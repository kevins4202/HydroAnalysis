11690,recharge in unconfined aquifers during managed aquifer recharge mar is influenced by the lithologic characteristics of the vadose zone the capacity of vadose wells to achieve recharge rates above those possible with recharge basins is studied in heterogeneous unsaturated porous media although near surface low permeability layers can be bypassed with vadose wells subsequent low permeability layers below or adjacent to the well screen influence recharge rates by forming perched conditions the numerical model vs2dti was used to evaluate the effect of heterogeneous lithology on vadose well recharge a sand aquifer was modeled using hydrogeologic characteristics from the hueco bolson aquifer in texas modeled recharge was studied for a 33 m deep vadose well with a 10 m high water column evaluated under conditions of both a homogenous aquifer and an aquifer with heterogeneity formed by a thin low permeability clay layer these low permeability layers were modeled at various depths alongside and below the well to study the impact of heterogeneity on mar processes results contrast vadose wells a without clay layers to recharge 200 6 m3 d considered the well s

layer was aligned at or above the upper half of the well screen simulating the low permeability clay layer along the bottom half of the well caused recharge rates reduction to a minimum of 30 m3 d 15 efficiency rates above 100 m3 d 50 efficiency occurred when the clay layer was 10 m below the base of the well these results characterize the impact of low permeability layer distance adjacent to and below a vadose well a low permeability horizon at a fixed depth relative to vadose wells at variable depths was also studied to demonstrate that recharge rate increases corresponding to deeper vadose wells due to additional screen length and greater pressure head results quantify the impact of vadose well placement relative to low permeability layer depth and promote understanding to achieve

et al 2003 well logs associated with this study show 53 individual lithologic horizons of the recharge site ranging from highly permeable sandy gravel to very low permeability clay and caliche layers hahn et al 2003 the subsurface at the recharge site is complex and recharge to the water table is influenced by low permeability layers interbedded within a high permeability sand matrix while lower permeability layers near the surface can be bypassed using vadose wells deeper layers below or adjacent to the well screen will influence recharge rates due to the formation of perched water tables the effect of unsaturated zone low permeability horizons on mar recharge rates is scarce in literature the more developed study of surface recharge and resulting water mounding is extensive bouwer 1969 bouwer 2002 hantush 1967 marino 1975 b and provides some insight to expected conditions at vadose wellfields in heterogenous lithology where perched conditions may occur in the vadose zone on low permeability layers these perched conditions create saturated soils above the low permeability layer and take the appearance of a mound of water fig 2 particularly relevant to this study is the finding by bouwer 2002 that recharge rates from surface basins hydraulically connected to the aquifer are not affected by water mounding when the depth between surface and water is large if the depth to water is less than approximately twice the length of the basin water mounding influences recharge by driving flow horizontally fig 1 reducing the rate at which water flows into the aquifer water mounding may also drive flow away from the planned recovery site mawer et al 2016 resulting in the potential loss of some portion of infiltrated water similar study describing recharge behavior from vadose zone wells is not available in current literature the goal of this study is to qualify the relationship between vadose well recharge rate and low permeability layers adding to the body of knowledge hydrogeologist can draw upon when considering vadose well mar projects lithologic characterization from the hueco bolson aquifer near el paso tx is used to characterize the model aquifer because the site has been previously studied and characterized to support an ongoing municipal aquifer recharge program it is expected that this site s characteristics such as the heterogeneous lithology and depth to groundwater exist at hydrogeologically similar locations in the american southwest which may benefit from efficient mar projects the study simulates heterogeneous unsaturated zone lithology in the hueco bolson aquifer to create perched conditions above low permeability clay layers during vadose well recharge provided the low permeability clay layer is significantly extensive the perched condition acts as a localized shallow water table with the potential to influence recharge rates as described above even if the regional groundwater table is significantly deep

numerical modeling program which simulates two dimensional water flow and solute transport in variably saturated porous media by solving richards equation in a finite difference model hsieh et al 2000 healy and essaid 2012 vs2dti was chosen for this study because it is a freely available two dimensional model developed by the u s geological survey and contains a user friendly graphical interface hsieh et al 2000 in this study the primary model outputs considered were flux and rate of flux out of the model through the bottom and side model boundaries as these correlated to recharge volume m3 and rate m3 day the two dimensional richards equation is given in equation 1 1 θ t x k ψ ψ x y k ψ ψ y 1 where the moisture content θ is related to hydraulic conductivity k and pressure head ψ to relate hydraulic conductivity to saturation for a given soil type and determine hydraulic conductivity k as moisture content changes the study used equations derived from mualem 1976 and the van genuchten equation van genuchten 1980 described by botros et al 2011 and ghanbarian alavijeh et al 2010 as shown in equation 2 2 k ψ k s s e 1 1 s e 1 m m 2 where ks is the hydraulic conductivity when the soil is saturated and se is the effective water saturation between zero and one this variable se is related to θs the saturated water content of the soil and θr the residual water content of the

retc is used for analyzing the hydraulic conductivity properties of unsaturated soils through the brooks corey and van genuchten parametric models leiji et al 1989 1989van genuchten et al 1991 retc and published data from usgs report 99 271 abeyta and frenzel 1999a b were used to quantify van genuchten s equation variables table 1 and accurately describe the hueco bolse aquifer in the vs2dti model well logs and hydrogeologic reports from the aquifer recharge program and surrounding area were used as references to create a two dimensional model 800 m in length and 110 m in depth hahn et al 2003 texas water development board 2016 the water table was set at 107 m below ground surface based on well log data initially the aquifer model was built with a fine sand matrix and multiple lenses of low permeability silts and clays table 1 to recreate as accurately as possible hydrogeologic conditions at the el paso water utility epwu recharge site this sand matrix featured a horizontal to vertical conductivity kx kz ratio of 10 1 and a kx value of 21 m d this simulated aquifer was calibrated by ensuring the initial arrival of the recharge wetting front to the water table occurred after the same time elapse in both model and field observations made by american water works association awwa and epwu hahn et al 2003 the vadose wells contain specified head boundary conditions applied to the left and right vertical face of a 33 m deep well to simulate flow moving horizontally across the well screen into the aquifer this head represents a 10 m tall column of water within the well by setting the head value to 23 m below ground surface bgs pressure head from the water column at 33 m bgs bottom of the well was 10 m while the pressure head at 23 m bgs the top of the water column was 0 m vs2dti requires grid discretization to solve the richards equation 1 using the finite difference method grid discretization along the horizontal x axis was accomplished by refining grid columns at the center of the model at the well and progressively widening grid spacing further from the center these columns started with a width of 3 62 m at the left boundary and gradually reduced to 1 64 m spacing in the center of the model before increasing again to 3 62 m on the right boundary grid discretization along the vertical z axis was constant above 78 m bgs at 1 m vertical spacing and constant but coarser 2 m vertical spacing below 78 m bgs following calibration of the model analysis was performed to study the horizontal extent of low permeability soils on vadose zone recharge by first removing low permeability horizons from the model to create a homogenous aquifer fig 3 this run represented the maximum recharge possible for the model in the absence of low permeability layers to isolate the effect of a low permeability horizon on vadose well recharge rate a single 360 m long clay layer was added to the model and the model re run this was repeated 34 times across all variables held constant in the model except the placement depth of the low permeability horizon fig 3 placement depth of the low permeability layer included nine model runs with the layer adjacent to the well screen at various locations between 23 m and 33 m and twenty two runs with the layer below the well screen at 2 m intervals from 34 m to 78 m subsequent modeling showed that extending the length of this layer laterally did not significantly change recharge rates 3 results the calculated recharge rate for a homogenous aquifer fig 3 was 200 6 m3 d this represents the maximum modeled recharge possible under ideal conditions and provides the basis for comparing all other model results all other model runs with a low permeability horizon either adjacent to or below the vadose well screen were compared to this maximum recharge rate recharge efficiency was computed as the percentage of recharge in each model scenario with a low permeability layer compared to the homogeneous aquifer fig 4 demonstrates this effect on both recharge rate and efficiency when a low permeability layer is modeled at a distance adjacent to or below the well screen when low permeability layers are simulated above 23 m below ground surface bgs there is no effect on recharge rate from the vadose well this result was expected since the model simulates a well screen from 23 to 33 m bgs so recharge starts below any low permeability horizon shallower than 23 m indeed this ability to bypass near surface layers of low permeability is one of the primary advantages a vadose well has over recharge basin recharge this constant rate of recharge is seen as the vertical line between y 0 and y 23 in fig 4 there is a brief but rapid decrease in recharge rate as the low permeability horizon approaches the bottom of the well followed by a long and steady recovery in recharge rate as the low permeability horizon moves further from the well bottom fig 4 minimum recharge occurs when the vadose well bottom sits directly on the low permeability horizon this scenario returned a recharge rate of 30 m3 d only 15 efficiency the low permeability horizons between 23 m and 33 m bgs were adjacent to the well screen and perched conditions form above the low permeability horizon but flow from the portion of the well screen below the horizon is unimpeded since greater recharge occurs at the bottom of a vadose well where pressure head is greatest a low permeability layer adjacent to the well screen significantly affects recharge rate only when adjacent to the bottom half of the well screen fig 4 shows the efficiency curve of a vadose zone well remains at or above 90 provided that the low permeability horizon is adjacent to the upper half of the screen corresponding to 28 5 m or shallower on the y axis in the simulation the middle of the well screen is at 27 5 m not 28 5 m which demonstrates how the well has a greater recharge rate towards the bottom of the screen due to the pressure head from the water column above this 28 5 m point there is sufficient screen length below the low permeability horizon to allow most recharge to occur in the section of screen with the greater recharge if the low permeability horizon is adjacent to the well in the lower half of the screen especially below 28 5 m well efficiency rapidly decreases decrease is especially pronounced when the low permeability horizon is both adjacent to the very bottom section of screen and below it this condition occurs if the bottom of a vadose well was installed in the low permeability layer shown at 33 m in fig 4 and shown conceptually as fig 2 well b water mounds on the low permeability horizon forming a perched layer and decreases recharge from well into the surrounding aquifer matrix results also consider recharge from wells of varying depth and water column height and a fixed no change to depth low permeability horizon the situation a hydrogeologist might encounter in when designing a wellfield the model was rerun 24 times with the vadose well between 15 m and 95 m deep all vadose wells were simulated as screened from 5 m bgs to bottom and water column was simulated as steady at 5 m from surface resulting in deeper wells having higher water columns and therefore greater pressure heads at the bottom of the well the low permeability layer was included between 73 m and 75 m and was not changed between model runs fig 5 results from this scenario represent a balance between increased recharge in deeper wells and reduced recharge as deeper wells approach the low permeability layer creating perched conditions at 73 75 m bgs two factors increase recharge as deeper wells are simulated first the greater well screen area of deeper wells allows more flow into the model and secondly taller water columns in the wells allows greater pressure head to force water across the well screen into the aquifer countering this increase is the previously described effect of perched conditions above the low permeability horizon at 73 75 m bgs as vadose wells are simulated deeper into the unsaturated zone the bottom of the wells approach this low permeability horizon and experience a reduction in efficiency as a perched water table forms against the well screen the overall effect is that deeper vadose wells recharge more water but the rate at which recharge increases with depth becomes impacted if perched conditions exist fig 5 the 200 6 m3 d modeled maximum infiltration rate is reasonable when compared with infiltration rates at recharge projects with active vadose zone wellfield with the consideration that site specific lithology and construction design influence these field rates the city of surprise arizona usa an arid location with a thick vadose zone like the modeled hueco boslon in el paso employs 20 vadose zone recharge wells designed for a planned infiltration rate of 260 gallons per minute gpm 1417 m3 d each significantly more than the modeled 200 6 m3 d arcadis u s inc 2017 city of surprise arizona 2009 more recently each of the surprise az vadose wells is listed with an average recharge capacity of 175 000 gpd 662 m3 d carollo 2022 goodyear az usa also operates a vadose zone wellfield design infiltration rate for each of goodyear s wells is 285 gpm 1553 m3 d reclamation 2014 differences between modeled and actual infiltration rates can be attributed to the two dimensional nature of the program vs2dti the greater depth of operational wells 180 ft 55 m at goodyear compared to 100 ft 33 m as modeled srinivasan and larger well diameter 48 in 1 2 m borehole at field sites comparted to 39 in 1 m as modeled however comparing municipal recharge rates with the model provides confidence that the modeled rate can be realistically achieved at municipal projects in similar geologic settings 4 discussion and application assuming a vadose well is screened for its entire length below a fixed depth the recharge efficiency per unit length of screen can be determined by dividing the total recharge rate from the well by the well screen length and can be compared to the unit length recharge efficiency in shallower or deeper wells recharge efficiency per unit length of screen decreases as the well screen approaches the low permeability layer reaches a minimum value when the well bottom is inside the low permeability layer and increases as the well screen extends below the low permeability layer fig 5 as the bottom of a vadose well approaches a low permeability layer a drop in the recharge rate per meter occurs due to perched conditions along the well screen this reduced recharge rate per meter continues until the well is extended below the low permeability layer the result is absolute recharge quantity increasing as vadose well depth screen length increases but with the rate of increased recharge slowing as a vadose well bottom approaches a low permeability layer identifying likely recharge locations can be done using a variety of remote sensing or field sampling techniques khan et al 2020 lithologic records from exploratory boreholes or surrounding wells can provide insight to low permeability layers anticipated to create perched conditions this knowledge can be applied towards the design the most efficient vadose well field while meeting desired recharge quantity instead of placing vadose wells at an arbitrary depth that may coincide with elevations of silt or clay lens creating perched layers wells can be screened at shallower depths where recharge efficiency is higher to save drilling and placement costs with only a modest reduction in absolute recharge rate these factors create a sweet spot in designed well depth where the greater cost of installing a deeper well nearer to the low permeability layer is not justified due to diminishing increases in recharge rate but a shallower well does not infiltrate sufficient water volumes to justify cost of emplacement this concept of recharge sweet spot is demonstrated in fig 6 recharge rates from the scenario described above were used to determine vadose well installation cost in terms of cubic meter of recharge with a scaling factor of 1 57 applied to estimate fully three dimensional recharge patton 2017 installation including foundation drilling and casing screening material was assumed to be 3281 per meter of well depth 1000 ft with a fixed floor cost of 90 000 to account for mobilization related costs for reference four 30 48 m 100 ft wells installed as part of the goodyear az vadose wellfield incurred a drilling only cost of 2579 27 per meter 786 16 ft city of goodyear 2016 reclamation 2014 although installation costs depend on location any project s anticipated cost for installation can be used to determine the sweet spot emplacement to illustrate a design criterion of 12 334 8 m3 d 10 acre ft per day of recharge was set as shown in table 2 both costs and recharge rates increase as wells get deeper but the rate of recharge slows as the bottom of the vadose well approaches the 73 75 m bgs clay layer recharge rates are significantly greater once the well pokes through the low permeability modeled here as clay layer and has a length of screen no longer influenced by the perched water mound in this scenario the most cost efficient shallow 75 m bgs wellfield design is 23 wells at a depth of 30 m these calculations provide insight into the ideal depth to place vadose wells by considering the modeled recharge per meter of well screen against the cost to emplace a well unless all wells can be screened below all low permeability layers the ideal depth will be somewhere shallower than the deepest low permeability layer anticipated to cause perched conditions 5 conclusions a modeling investigation studied the optimization of vadose wells in mar to achieve recharge in an arid region complex lithology was incorporated into this modeling and shown to influence vadose well recharge rates low permeability layers below a vadose well may cause perched aquifers on the layer resulting in a reduced recharge rate in our example this recharge rate is reduced to less than 20 of the value expected for that same well in the absence of low permeability layers with rates varying between 200 6 m3 d and 30 m3 d dependent on the elevation of a single low permeability layer that created perched conditions in the vadose zone these different rates illustrate the effect that low permeability horizons can have on managed aquifer recharge from vadose wells for the most accurate consideration of vadose well performance at a prospective recharge site the subsurface should be tested for any lithologic horizons anticipated to cause perched conditions and their depth and thickness carefully noted a model of these conditions can then be built in vs2dti and several vadose well depths tested to optimize a balance between cost and desired recharge rate using site specific knowledge and recharge modeling vadose well fields can be designed for maximum cost and recharge efficiency vadose well placement immediately above low permeability horizons the least efficient well placement depth can be avoided and a decision between fewer deeper wells and more numerous shallower wells can be made based on economic considerations these results provide understanding of the parameters that control the effective rate of recharge to groundwater in a typical mar setting and information useful towards gathering appropriate geological and hydrological data in the design of mar systems it extends

the left and right vertical face of a 33 m deep well to simulate flow moving horizontally across the well screen into the aquifer this head represents a 10 m tall column of water within the well by setting the head value to 23 m below ground surface bgs pressure head from the water column at 33 m bgs bottom of the well was 10 m while the pressure head at 23 m bgs the top of the water column was 0 m vs2dti requires grid discretization to solve the richards equation 1 using the finite difference method grid discretization along the horizontal x axis was accomplished by refining grid columns at the center of the model at the well and progressively widening grid spacing further from the center these columns started with a width of 3 62 m at the left boundary and gradually reduced to 1 64 m spacing in the center of the model before increasing again to 3 62 m on the right boundary grid discretization along the vertical z axis was constant above 78 m bgs at 1 m vertical spacing and constant but coarser 2 m vertical spacing below 78 m bgs following calibration of the model analysis was performed to study the horizontal extent of low permeability soils on vadose zone recharge by first removing low permeability horizons from the model to create a homogenous aquifer fig 3 this run represented the maximum recharge possible for the model in the absence of low permeability layers to isolate the effect of a low permeability horizon on vadose well recharge rate a single 360 m long clay layer was added to the model and the model re run this was repeated 34 times across all variables held constant in the model except the placement depth of the low permeability horizon fig 3 placement depth of the low permeability layer included nine model runs with the layer adjacent to the well screen at various locations between 23 m and 33 m and twenty two runs with the layer below the well screen at 2 m intervals from 34 m to 78 m subsequent modeling showed that extending the length of this layer laterally did not significantly change recharge rates 3 results the calculated recharge rate for a homogenous aquifer fig 3 was 200 6 m3 d this represents the maximum modeled recharge possible under ideal conditions and provides the basis for comparing all other model results all other model runs with a low permeability horizon either adjacent to or below the vadose well screen were compared to this maximum recharge rate recharge efficiency was computed as the percentage of recharge in each model scenario with a low permeability layer compared to the homogeneous aquifer fig 4 demonstrates this effect on both recharge rate and efficiency when a low permeability layer is modeled at a distance adjacent to or below the well screen when low permeability layers are simulated above 23 m below ground surface bgs there is no effect on recharge rate from the vadose well this result was expected since the model simulates a well screen from 23 to 33 m bgs so recharge starts below any low permeability horizon shallower than 23 m indeed this ability to bypass near surface layers of low permeability is one of the primary advantages a vadose well has over recharge basin recharge this constant rate of recharge is seen as the vertical line between y 0 and y 23 in fig 4 there is a brief but rapid decrease in recharge rate as the low permeability horizon approaches the bottom of the well followed by a long and steady recovery in recharge rate as the low permeability horizon moves further from the well bottom fig 4 minimum recharge occurs when the vadose well bottom sits directly on the low permeability horizon this scenario returned a recharge rate of 30 m3 d only 15 efficiency the low permeability horizons between 23 m and 33 m bgs were adjacent to the well screen and perched conditions form above the low permeability horizon but flow from the portion of the well screen below the horizon is unimpeded since greater recharge occurs at the bottom of a vadose well where pressure head is greatest a low permeability layer adjacent to the well screen significantly affects recharge rate only when adjacent to the bottom half of the well screen fig 4 shows the efficiency curve of a vadose zone well remains at or above 90 provided that the low permeability horizon is adjacent to the upper half of the screen corresponding to 28 5 m or shallower on the y axis in the simulation the middle of the well screen is at 27 5 m not 28 5 m which demonstrates how the well has a greater recharge rate towards the bottom of the screen due to the pressure head from the water column above this 28 5 m point there is sufficient screen length below the low permeability horizon to allow most recharge to occur in the section of screen with the greater recharge if the low permeability horizon is adjacent to the well in the lower half of the screen especially below 28 5 m well efficiency rapidly decreases decrease is especially pronounced when the low permeability horizon is both adjacent to the very bottom section of screen and below it this condition occurs if the bottom of a vadose well was installed in the low permeability layer shown at 33 m in fig 4 and shown conceptually as fig 2 well b water mounds on the low permeability horizon forming a perched layer and decreases recharge from well into the surrounding aquifer matrix results also consider recharge from wells of varying depth and water column height and a fixed no change to depth low permeability horizon the situation a hydrogeologist might encounter in when designing a wellfield the model was rerun 24 times with the vadose well between 15 m and 95 m deep all vadose wells were simulated as screened from 5 m bgs to bottom and water column was simulated as steady at 5 m from surface resulting in deeper wells having higher water columns and therefore greater pressure heads at the bottom of the well the low permeability layer was included between 73 m and 75 m and was not changed between model runs fig 5 results from this scenario represent a balance between increased recharge in deeper wells and reduced recharge as deeper wells approach the low permeability layer creating perched conditions at 73 75 m bgs two factors increase recharge as deeper wells are simulated first the greater well screen area of deeper wells allows more flow into the model and secondly taller water columns in the wells allows greater pressure head to force water across the well screen into the aquifer countering this increase is the previously described effect of perched conditions above the low permeability horizon at 73 75 m bgs as vadose wells are simulated deeper into the unsaturated zone the bottom of the wells approach this low permeability horizon and experience a reduction in efficiency as a perched water table forms against the well screen the overall effect is that deeper vadose wells recharge more water but the rate at which recharge increases with depth becomes impacted if perched conditions exist fig 5 the 200 6 m3 d modeled maximum infiltration rate is reasonable when compared with infiltration rates at recharge projects with active vadose zone wellfield with the consideration that site specific lithology and construction design influence these field rates the city of surprise arizona usa an arid location with a thick vadose zone like the modeled hueco boslon in el paso employs 20 vadose zone recharge wells designed for a planned infiltration rate of 260 gallons per minute gpm 1417 m3 d each significantly more than the modeled 200 6 m3 d arcadis u s inc 2017 city of surprise arizona 2009 more recently each of the surprise az vadose wells is listed with an average recharge capacity of 175 000 gpd 662 m3 d carollo 2022 goodyear az usa also operates a vadose zone wellfield design infiltration rate for each of goodyear s wells is 285 gpm 1553 m3 d reclamation 2014 differences between modeled and actual infiltration rates can be attributed to the two dimensional nature of the program vs2dti the greater depth of operational wells 180 ft 55 m at goodyear compared to 100 ft 33 m as modeled srinivasan and larger well diameter 48 in 1 2 m borehole at field sites comparted to 39 in 1 m as modeled however comparing municipal recharge rates with the model provides confidence that the modeled rate can be realistically achieved at municipal projects in similar geologic settings 4 discussion and application assuming a vadose well is screened for its entire length below a fixed depth the recharge efficiency per unit length of screen can be determined by dividing the total recharge rate from the well by the well screen length and can be compared to the unit length recharge efficiency in shallower or deeper wells recharge efficiency per unit length of screen decreases as the well screen approaches the low permeability layer reaches a minimum value when the well bottom is inside the low permeability layer and increases as the well screen extends below the low permeability layer fig 5 as the bottom of a vadose well approaches a low permeability layer a drop in the recharge rate per meter occurs due to perched conditions along the well screen this reduced recharge rate per meter continues until the well is extended below the low permeability layer the result is absolute recharge quantity increasing as vadose well depth screen length increases but with the rate of increased recharge slowing as a vadose well bottom approaches a low permeability layer identifying likely recharge locations can be done using a variety of remote sensing or field sampling techniques khan et al 2020 lithologic records from exploratory boreholes or surrounding wells can provide insight to low permeability layers anticipated to create perched conditions this knowledge can be applied towards the design the most efficient vadose well field while meeting desired recharge quantity instead of placing vadose wells at an arbitrary depth that may coincide with elevations of silt or clay lens creating perched layers wells can be screened at shallower depths where recharge efficiency is higher to save drilling and placement costs with only a modest reduction in absolute recharge rate these factors create a sweet spot in designed well depth where the greater cost of installing a deeper well nearer to the low permeability layer is not justified due to diminishing increases in recharge rate but a shallower well does not infiltrate sufficient water volumes to justify cost of emplacement this concept of recharge sweet spot is demonstrated in fig 6 recharge rates from the scenario described above were used to determine vadose well installation cost in terms of cubic meter of recharge with a scaling factor of 1 57 applied to estimate fully three dimensional recharge patton 2017 installation including foundation drilling and casing screening material was assumed to be 3281 per meter of well depth 1000 ft with a fixed floor cost of 90 000 to account for mobilization related costs for reference four 30 48 m 100 ft wells installed as part of the goodyear az vadose wellfield incurred a drilling only cost of 2579 27 per meter 786 16 ft city of goodyear 2016 reclamation 2014 although installation costs depend on location any project s anticipated cost for installation can be used to determine the sweet spot emplacement to illustrate a design criterion of 12 334 8 m3 d 10 acre ft per day of recharge was set as shown in table 2 both costs and recharge rates increase as wells get deeper but the rate of recharge slows as the bottom of the vadose well approaches the 73 75 m bgs clay layer recharge rates are significantly greater once the well pokes through the low permeability modeled here as clay layer and has a length of screen no longer influenced by the perched water mound in this scenario the most cost efficient shallow 75 m bgs wellfield design is 23 wells at a depth of 30 m these calculations provide insight into the ideal depth to place vadose wells by considering the modeled recharge per meter of well screen against the cost to emplace a well unless all wells can be screened below all low permeability layers the ideal depth will be somewhere shallower than the deepest low permeability layer anticipated to cause perched conditions 5 conclusions a modeling investigation studied the optimization of vadose wells in mar to achieve recharge in an arid region complex lithology was incorporated into this modeling and shown to influence vadose well recharge rates low permeability layers below a vadose well may cause perched aquifers on the layer resulting in a reduced recharge rate in our example this recharge rate is reduced to less than 20 of the value expected for that same well in the absence of low permeability layers with rates varying between 200 6 m3 d and 30 m3 d dependent on the elevation of a single low permeability layer that created perched conditions in the vadose zone these different rates illustrate the effect that low permeability horizons can have on managed aquifer recharge from vadose wells for the most accurate consideration of vadose well performance at a prospective recharge site the subsurface should be tested for any lithologic horizons anticipated to cause perched conditions and their depth and thickness carefully noted a model of these conditions can then be built in vs2dti and several vadose well depths tested to optimize a balance between cost and desired recharge rate using site specific knowledge and recharge modeling vadose well fields can be designed for maximum cost and recharge efficiency vadose well placement immediately above low permeability horizons the least efficient well placement depth can be avoided and a decision between fewer deeper wells and more numerous shallower wells can be made based on economic considerations these results provide understanding of the parameters that control the effective rate of recharge to groundwater in a typical mar setting and information useful towards gathering appropriate geological and hydrological data in the design of mar systems it extends

11691,the identification and management of groundwater resources are critical for sustainable development since there is an increase in demand for groundwater use geospatial remote sensing approaches are vital to groundwater resource evaluation and conservation we studied the spatiotemporal dynamics of land use change between 2000 and 2020 and its impact on water level conditions and groundwater potential zones in a rapidly urbanizing kamrup metropolitan district of assam india the thematic maps such as land use and land cover lulc in 2000 and 2020 geology geomorphology topsoil sand topsoil clay and slope were used to define groundwater potential zones the analytical hierarchy process was used to quantify the weight rank and reclassification of various thematic maps the assigned weights of lulc geology geomorphology topsoil sand topsoil clay and slope were 70 14 4 6 4 6 4 6 and 2 2 respectively the groundwater potential zone classified as good has decreased in cumulative area by 19 during the study period the increase in the very good groundwater potential zone is primarily associated with conservation of lakes and other surface water bodies urbanization is the primary driver for decreased groundwater potentiality in the study region shallow 2 m below ground level bgl groundwater levels are associated with good groundwater potential zones whereas intermediate 2 5 m bgl groundwater levels are associated with moderate groundwater potential zones groundwater levels in built up areas are showing falling trends except in a few places where the water levels are rising which suggests a lack of monsoonal recharge due to increased imperviousness without sustainable planning the change in groundwater potential zones and a falling trend in the depth to water levels

northeastern india data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction groundwater is an essential natural resource that enriches the lives on earth it caters to the needs of half of drinking water 40 of irrigation water and one third of industrial water requirements foster et al 2013 jakeman et al 2016 halder et al 2020 unesco world water assessment programme 2022 groundwater holds nearly 99 of the freshwater available on earth for human consumption and is the most slowly replenished reservoir taylor et al 2013 cuthbert et al 2019 the slow replenishment makes the groundwater an asset and less susceptible to short term events like droughts and other extreme weather events than surface water dalin 2021 kandekar et al 2021 proper management is essential since groundwater resources are replenished more slowly than surface water however groundwater availability remains unknown unless aquifer mapping is done for long term sustainability dalin 2021 the primary problems with managing water resources in urban areas are the rapid rate of urbanization and the extraordinary increasing strain of expanding anthropogenic activities the increasing dependence on groundwater over the last few decades caused the over exploitation of aquifers cuthbert et al 2019 halder et al 2020 nath et al 2021 ul haq et al 2021 the land transformations due to urbanization are occurring locally regionally and globally over the last few decades and will continue in the future mishra et al 2014 urbanization is mainly associated with deforestation the transformation of vegetated lands into industrial and residential areas and the development of road networks and modern infrastructures nath et al 2021 an increased imperviousness due to urbanization significantly affects groundwater recharge and availability and reduces infiltration mishra et al 2014 together with increasing groundwater abstraction the urbanization can be linked to groundwater depletion however in some places urbanization can increase groundwater recharge by redistribution lerner 2002 alqurashi and kumar 2019 have shown the decline in groundwater storage associated with the changes in land usage e g agricultural to industrial practices song et al 2014 and chen et al 2015 observed that the urban areas received slightly greater amounts of precipitation with higher intensity than the neighboring mountainous areas they have suggested that the combination of urbanization and topography causes the differences in rainfall on the other hand patra et al 2018a and ul haq et al 2021 have observed that urbanization increases average minimum and maximum temperatures and decreases rainfall in the area the change in precipitation and temperature as well as the expansion of urban built up areas has had a negative effect on the groundwater tables during pre and post monsoon periods patra et al 2018a kamrup metropolitan district is the smallest and the most densely inhabited district of assam india the metropolitan region has been experiencing rapid population growth industrialization and urbanization over the last few decades das and goswami 2013 kumar 2017 bhuyan 2018 according to the central ground water board cgwb the current stage of total groundwater extraction versus total groundwater availability is 57 26 based on the 2020 assessment year central groundwater board 2020 however there is an increasing demand for groundwater to sustain the growth of industries and housing development unplanned urbanization accompanied by an rapidly increasing population leads to significant anthropogenic changes in this region and threatens the availability of groundwater resources at present 60 of the population depends on groundwater and only 40 have access to treated water das and goswami 2013 gogoi 2017 therefore it is essential to assess the changes in the groundwater potentiality zone and analyze the water level conditions in this region several knowledge driven processes such as analytic hierarchy process catastrophe theory probabilistic frequency ratio logistic regression simple additive weights and machine learning combined with remote sensing rs and geographic information system gis are used to delineate the groundwater potential of a region saaty 1980 kaur et al 2020 prasad et al 2020 hasanuzzaman et al 2022 the purpose of using these methods is to investigate a connection between groundwater occurrences and significant topographic features however each method has advantages and disadvantages table s1 among these methods the analytic hierarchy process ahp a multi criteria decision making technique has been used extensively to delineate groundwater potential zones saaty 1980 murmu et al 2019 al djazouli et al 2020 roy et

and qualitative approaches and is suitable for expert based rankings to improve accuracy therefore we employed the ahp technique along with rs and gis to determine the relative importance of geology geomorphology slope lulc clay and sand contents to map groundwater potential zones gwpzs the objective of this research is to study spatiotemporal changes in urban areas between 2000 and 2020 and their impact on long term trends in groundwater levels and the change in groundwater potential zones in the densely inhabited kamrup metropolitan district of assam india we achieved this objective by collecting long term groundwater level data and analyzing their trends and spatio temporal distributions land use and land cover analysis were also conducted to observe the changes in urban dynamics in our study area combining all the thematic maps help us to quantify the change in groundwater potential zones in the study area 2 study area kamrup metropolitan district is located between latitudes 25 43 00 n to 26 51 00 n and longitudes 90 36 00 e to 92 12 00 e the district shares its border with nagaon district in the east darrang district in the west kamrup district in the north and meghalaya

humidity the average temperature ranges from 12 c to 38 c the average annual rainfall is 2125 mm with 96 rainy days central groundwater board 2013 plp 2018 2 1 geology and geomorphology geological and geomorphological maps of the study area were obtained from the geological survey of india gsi at 1 50 000 and 1 250 000 scales respectively bhukosh 2022 the geological formation of the region comprises assam meghalaya gneissic complex older metamorphic group hauli formation and barpeta formation ii gsi 2013 assam meghalaya gneissic complex includes coarse grey granite pink granite gneiss composite gneiss and banded gneiss fig 2 a the older metamorphic group comprises hornblende biotite schist while the hauli formation includes feebly oxidized grey fine sand silt and clay semi consolidated the barpeta formation ii includes micaceous sand silt and clay gsi 2013 groundwater is abundant in gneissic rocks as they have a high weathering intensity nithya et al 2019 the assam meghalaya gneissic complex is given the most weight in the groundwater potential zone mapping followed by the older metamorphic group barpeta formation ii and hauli formation the region has distinguishable geomorphic units such as the flood plain of brahmaputra river and its tributaries younger alluvial plains in the areas with lower elevation and older alluvium in the higher slopes piedmont and flood plains with gentle slopes are found along the foothills while inselbergs represented by denuded small isolated hills are made up of granite and gneissic rocks central groundwater

pediment deposits underlain by weathered formations and lower in hilly regions central groundwater board 2013 2 2 slope the slope is an important parameter that determines a drainage basin s groundwater potential abdullateef et al 2021 the slope of a river basin influences the development of a drainage pattern nithya et al 2019 shuttle radar topography mission srtm digital elevation model dem at 30 m spatial resolution was used to create the slope map fig 3 farr et al 2007 the slope of the study area varies between 0 and 46 the slopes 15 are located in the eastern and central parts of the study area it is difficult for rainwater to infiltrate through steep slopes which results in rapid runoff and greater erosion hence the areas with higher slopes are classified as poor for groundwater storage and recharge on the other hand the areas with flat topography and gentle slopes have a high infiltration rate and are classified as good potential for groundwater storage and recharge 2 3 topsoil clay and sand content the gridded data of sand and clay contents in topsoil 0 5 cm were obtained from isric world soil information soilgrids 2022 the gridded data of 250 m spatial resolution were resampled to 30 m resolution to prepare groundwater potential zone maps for 2000 and 2020 soil is an important parameter that influences the groundwater potential of an area for example sandy soils have higher recharge rates and clayey soils have higher tortuosity and less water movement kim and jackson 2012 the topsoil clay and sand contents of the study area are shown in fig 4 a and b the clay content varies between 236 and 333 g kg and sand content varies between 317 and 416 g kg higher topsoil clay is observed in the southeastern part of the study area on the other hand higher topsoil sand is observed near the brahmaputra river 3 materials and methods 3 1 land use and land cover analysis the lulc classification was done using maximum likelihood method richards and richards 2006 in erdas imagine software satellite imageries for 2000 and 2020 were downloaded from the united states geological survey usgs earth explorer table 1 the maximum likelihood classifier mlc has been extensively used in lulc classification it is a parametric algorithm based on bayesian probability theory richards and richards 2006 it is a statistical decision procedure that aids in the classification of overlapping signatures and is based on the likelihood that a pixel belongs to a specific class jensen 2005 the fundamental assumption is that all the classes have identical probabilities and that the data for each class in each band have normal distributions it computes the likelihood that a given pixel belongs to a specific class each pixel is assigned to the class with the greatest probability i e maximum likelihood the pixel remains unclassified if the highest likelihood is less than a user defined threshold the lulc classes were built up area vegetation fallow land sandbar and waterbody a detailed description of lulc classes is given in table 2 accuracy assessment was done to assess the classification strengths and to interpret the classified image nath et al 2021 ground truth data for each lulc class was collected using visual interpretation of satellite imageries high resolution google earth images and field knowledge of the study area nath et al 2021 about 100 randomly distributed points were identified as ground truth pixels the erdas imagine software was used to compare classification results with reference data using a post classification confusion matrix based on ground truth region of interest roi the kappa coefficient was used to compute the correct values of a confusion matrix based on 1 the agreement between the classification and reference data diagonal cells and 2 the chance agreement indicated by the row and column totals i e marginal s there is a poor agreement between the reference and classified data if the kappa coefficient is less than 0 20 if the kappa coefficient is greater than 0 81 the categorized lulc classes and reference data are almost similar landis and koch 1977 3 2 mapping of groundwater levels groundwater levels from shallow wells 25 m for pre monsoon march and post monsoon november in 2000 and 2019 were obtained from the cgwb indiawris 2022 and directorate of geology and mining assam dgm 2022 the spatial distribution of groundwater levels were mapped using inverse distance weighting idw technique in arcgis pro 2 4 the idw is based on the concept of tobler s first law of geography tobler 1970 the idw is a convex interpolation technique that spatially fits continuous models of variations the idw uses the data from a known location to calculate the values of a variable at a new location patra et al 2018a based on the following equation 1 x ˆ i 1 n w i x i 2 w i d i i 1 n d i where x ˆ stands for an unknown value of a variable x i is the value of a known location n stands for the number of sample locations w i is the weight of each sample location d i is the distance from each sample location to the unknown location and α is the power the idw method provided more accurate results in accordance with the distribution of groundwater monitoring wells variability in the data and distance between the data points over the kriging and spline interpolation method wu and hung 2016 the idw method has routinely used in groundwater level spatial interpolation studies sajjad et al 2022 3 3 groundwater level trend analysis the trend analysis was done using the mann kendall test based on the time series groundwater level data of selected wells from the study area n 18 water level data for pre monsoon march and post monsoon november seasons were collected between 2007 and 2019 the data was obtained from the cgwb and directorate of geology and mining assam the selection of wells is based on the availability of data for longer time span mann kendall test is a widely applied method in hydrology and climate studies to determine the trends based on time series data wu et al 2008 pathak and dodamani 2019 the test was initially formulated by mann 1945 and later introduced by kendall 1975 it is a nonparametric method for trend detection to determine the trend either s statistics for less than 10 data points or z statistics for more than 10 data points is used rahman et al 2017 liu et al 2020 minea et al 2022 s statistic can be computed using the following equation 3 s k 1 n 1 j k 1 n s g n x j x k where n is the total number of samples and x j and x k are the consecutive data values of the time series the sgn x j x k takes the values of 1 0 and 1 and can be estimated as follows 4 s g n x j x k 1 i f x j x k 0 0 i f x j x k 0 1 i f x j x k 0 the variance of s can be calculated as follows 5 v a r s 1 18 n n 1 2 n 5 p 1 q t p t p 1 2 t p 5 where q is the number of data pairs same values in the time series and t p is the data value in the pth group in the absence of data pairs the sum of paired group is not required then the z statistic can be computed using the following equation 6 z s 1 v a r s i f s 0 0 i f s 0 s 1 v a r s i f s 0 the z values follow a normal distribution and can be used to determine whether a variable has a trend falling increasing rising decreasing and no trend for example falling increasing trend when z 0 rising decreasing trend when z 0 and no trend when z 0 the significance of the results is based on the null hypothesis no trend which is tested against an alternative hypothesis having a trend the obtained p values determine whether a trend is statistically significant or not typically 0 05 i e 95 confidence level the magnitude of the trend falling or rising i e how much the water level has changed each year was determined by sen s slope method the method is resistant to outliers sen 1968 the sen s slope is calculated using the following equation 7 β m e d i a n x j x k j k j k where β is sen s slope estimate β 0 indicates a falling trend and β 0 indicates a rising trend 3 4 groundwater potential zone mapping six thematic layers geology geomorphology lulc topsoil sand topsoil clay and slope were prepared and analyzed using the ahp technique to delineate the groundwater potential zones a schematic diagram shows the datasets used and the steps taken to prepare these thematic layers fig 5 groundwater availability is highly influenced by geology the porosity and permeability of a geological formation determine its ability to hold and transfer water vandas et al 2002 soil properties control the infiltration of surface water ahmed and sajjad 2018 soil texture and structure influence the water movement slope determines the groundwater recharge process ahmed and sajjad 2018 the ahp technique divides a complex multi criteria decision problem into a hierarchy based pairwise analysis of the relative value of various criteria and sub criteria al djazouli et al 2020 according to saaty s relative importance scale the weights of each parameter were assigned saaty 1980 the weights were determined based on a review of previous studies and local knowledge of the field site according to saaty 1980 a value of 7 indicates strongly important 6 indicates moderately important 5 indicates moderately less important 4 indicates less important 3 indicates strongly less important 2 indicates extremely less important and 1 indicates equally important the pairwise comparison matrix was developed for the selected thematic layers to evaluate the scale weight of the relevant layers and their impact on groundwater availability das 2019 all the thematic layers were compared to one another in a pairwise comparison matrix and the results are presented in table 3 the weights were determined using the weighted arithmetic mean approach which is calculated using the following equation das 2019 8 a w λ max w where a is the pairwise comparison matrix λ max is the principal eigenvalue of the matrix and w is the weight the consistency ratio cr was calculated following saaty 1980 as per the equation given below 9 c r c i r i 10 c i λ max n n 1 where cr is the consistency ratio ci is the consistency index ri is the random index λ max is the principal eigenvalue of the matrix and n is the number of factors random index ri values were taken from the published article by saaty 1980 which depends on the number of components saaty 1980 proposed that the cr 0 10 is acceptable to continue the analysis if cr is greater than 0 10 then there is a need to revise the judgment and correct inconsistency in the judgment to keep cr within the allowable range arulbalaji et al 2019 if cr 0 it shows perfect consistency in the pairwise comparison the thematic layers were resampled to 30 m spatial resolution and integrated into arcgis software the thematic layers were then re classified using the natural breaks classification method in arcgis software the weights were assigned after reclassification the ranks scale of 1 5 were assigned to the sub classes of each thematic layer based on their relative influence on groundwater availability table 4 the resultant maps of groundwater potential zones were created using a weighted overlay method as per the equation given below 11 11 g w p z i n x a y b where gwpz is the groundwater potential zone x is the weight of thematic layers and y is the rank of thematic layers subclasses the a term a 1 2 3 x represents the thematic maps and the b term b 1 2 3 y represents the thematic map classes arulbalaji et al 2019 the groundwater potential zones were then re classified as poor moderate good and very good based on the combined weights received from different parameters 4 results 4 1 groundwater level distributions the depth to water levels ranged from 0 01 m to 21 42 m below ground level bgl in the pre and post monsoon seasons of 2000 and 2019 figs 6 and 7 table sd1 the spatial extent of the variations of depth to water level has changed considerably during different seasons and years however the annual rainfall pattern in the study area remained consistent the decline is not significant during the two years fig s1 the spatial distribution of depth to water levels showed a few cones of depression water levels 6 1 m bgl located in the central part of the study area during both the pre and post monsoon seasons of 2000 in 2019 the spatial distribution of depth to water levels showed several wells with water levels 6 1 m bgl such a pattern in depth to water levels could be attributed to anthropogenic activities in the pre monsoon season of 2000 the depth to water levels ranged from 0 25 m to 11 27 m bgl table sd1 groundwater levels were mostly 4 6 m bgl 75 out of 91 wells except for a few localized cones of depression where the depth to water levels was 4 6 m bgl fig 6a table sd1 in lalganesh a t road katabari and pamohi the groundwater levels were between 6 1 m and 8 2 m bgl while in jalukbari amingaon birubari paltan bazar and madhgharia the groundwater levels were 8 2 m bgl the deepest groundwater level was found in madhgharia refinery well id 91 11 27 m bgl located in the northeastern part of the study area on the other hand panjabari well id 71 located in the southeastern part of the study area had recorded the shallowest groundwater level 0 25 m bgl in the post monsoon season of 2000 the depth to water levels ranged from 0 01 m to 14 55 m bgl table sd1 groundwater levels were 4 6 m bgl in the eastern and western parts of the study area in amingaon dhirenpara manpara birubari paltan bazar and madhgharia the groundwater levels were 8 2 m bgl fig 6b birubari well id 32 located in the north central part of the study area had recorded the deepest groundwater levels 14 55 m bgl in contrast narengi high school well id 74 located in the eastern part of the study area had recorded the shallowest groundwater levels 0 01 m bgl in the pre monsoon season of 2019 the depth to water levels ranged between 0 48 m and 21 42 m bgl table sd1 more than half of the monitoring wells 28 out of 54 wells had recorded groundwater levels 4 6 m bgl fig 7a these wells are located in lachitpur udaipur panbazar kahilipara christian basti kachari basti betkuchi and panjabari the deepest groundwater level 21 42 m bgl was found in panjabari well id 147 located in the southeastern part of the study area shallow groundwater levels 3 1 m bgl were mostly observed in the southwestern part of the study area the shallowest groundwater level 0 48 m bgl was recorded in maligaon well id 142 following the monsoon season the groundwater levels in many well locations have recovered and were found to be 4 6 m bgl fig 7b these wells were located in the southwestern part of the study area and north of the brahmaputra river deep groundwater levels 6 1 m bgl were found in the central and northeastern parts of the study area the areas include udaipur kahilipara adagudam zoo narengi road narengi forest gate and panjabari fig 7b adagudam well id 112 located in the central part of the study area had recorded the deepest groundwater level 18 02 m bgl the shallowest groundwater level 1 15 m bgl was observed in paltan bazar well id 145 located in the north central part of the study area 4 2 long term trends in groundwater levels the mann kendall test gives an interesting insight into pre and post monsoon water level data of the study area the results of the mann kendall test along with the magnitudes of the trends based on sen s slope are presented in table 5 in the pre monsoon the z values indicate that the depth to water level i e below ground level is falling increasing in five monitoring wells while in four monitoring wells the depth to water level is rising decreasing the trends are different in different wells which could be due to the changing groundwater withdrawal pattern in different parts of the study area in the post monsoon the z values indicate that the depth to water level is falling increasing in seven wells while in one well the depth to water level is rising decreasing in four wells the depth to water level is falling in both pre and post monsoon seasons while in one well a rising trend is observed in both seasons the rising trend in depth to water level in maligaon is the result of the conservation of deepor beel as part of the ramsar agreement in both pre and post monsoon seasons the depth to water level in maligoan has remained within 1 5 m bgl since 2013 table sd2 the observation of a rising trend in depth to water level in patharquary wireless and paltan bazar during the pre monsoon season is likely due to the changing pattern of the pumping regime as land use change has also resulted in the development of high rise buildings that typically draw water from deep aquifers 100 m and or increase in recharge due to redistribution lerner 2002 our time series data shows that the depth to water level in these locations remained within 2 m bgl in both pre and post monsoon seasons since 2013 table sd2 on the other hand the falling trends are observed in locations such as bakarapara boragaon and panjabari where the depth to water level is constantly falling and found to be greater than 8 m bgl especially during the pre monsoon seasons the significance of these trends is represented by p values typically 0 05 however the magnitude of these trends differs in different wells as shown by sen s slope which suggests the rate at which the depth to water level changes with time the positive values of sen s slope signify a falling depth to water level while the negative values signify a rising depth to water level the falling depth to water level during the post monsoon season suggests that the recharge is not sufficient to recover the drop in water level due to pre monsoon groundwater withdrawal to understand the control of rainfall on such a pattern the trend analysis of total annual rainfall from 1980 to 2019 reveals no significant change z values of 1 5 and p values of 0 13 in the study area the slope is slightly negative i e 5 32 mm yr but statistically not significant suggesting a major control of anthropogenic activities in changing pattern of depth to water level in the study area 4 3 land use and land cover pattern the lulc classification for 2000 and 2020 is shown in fig 8 the overall accuracy is 89 and 91 and the corresponding kappa coefficient is 0 84 and 0 86 respectively for 2000 and 2020 table s2 the overall accuracy of our classified images and the kappa coefficient agrees well with the suggested global accuracy of 85 90 for lulc mapping of urban areas anderson 1976 landis and koch 1977 the results show that vegetation and built up areas are the two dominant lulc classes in both years table 6 however vegetation consisting of 158 km2 in the area in 2000 decreased to 127 km2 in 2020 on the contrary built up areas consisting of 103 km2 in the area in 2000 increased to 131 km2 in 2020 the areas under different lulc classes have changed over time overall built up areas have increased by 27 followed by an increase in fallow land by 8 9 and waterbody by 15 table 6 on the other hand there has been a significant decrease in vegetation by 20 and sandbar by 30 there has been a significant increase in built up areas by replacing vegetation and fallow land between 2000 and 2020 in places like kahilipara lokhra barsajai patharquary bonda narengi satgaon and rukminigaon these places are located in the south and southeastern part of the study area our analysis further showed that the lake in the eastern part of the study area disappeared in 2020 and converted into built up areas and vegetation fig 8 the spatiotemporal pattern of lulc change was also reported earlier by nath et al 2021 these authors have attributed this change to the increase in demand for land for housing and industrial activities 5 discussion the results of the groundwater potential zones show considerable changes between 2000 and 2020 fig 9 poor gwpz has decreased in area by 68 while moderate gwpz has increased in area by 10 on the other hand good gwpz has decreased in area by 19 and very good gwpz has increased in area by 307 table s3 the areas that changed from good to moderate gwpz are primarily located near the built up areas such a transformation indicates the adverse effect of urbanization on the groundwater potentiality of a region arefin 2020 has shown a decrease in the groundwater potential zones in dhaka city and linked that to urban development likewise sajjad et al 2022 have shown a declining trend in groundwater levels related to land transformation due to urbanization in the faisalabad district of pakistan in 2002 deepor beel wetland was classified as a ramsar site therefore in response to this initiative the local government has implemented conservation measures around deepor beel due to its biological and environmental significance planning commission government of india 2008 saikia 2019 as a response very good gwpz has increased near deepor beel and its adjoining region on the west of the study area fig 9 these changes have favored the greater seasonal availability of surface water in the study area das and goswami 2013 and recharge to groundwater our trend analysis has shown that the depth to water level is rising and remained within 1 5 m bgl near deeper beel maligaon well id 142 in both pre and post monsoon seasons table sd2 good and very good gwpzs are located in places where a significant and commercially exploitable quantity of groundwater can be found at a shallow depth while poor and moderate gwpzs are located in places where the depth to water level is greater due to a lack of recharge and higher groundwater abstraction urbanization in the study area has increased rapidly to fulfill the demand of a growing proportion of the population living in cities and suburbs chetia et al 2020 urbanization increases surface imperviousness leading to an altered groundwater flow path and deteriorating water quality das and goswami 2013 urban land use has low infiltration rates due to the prevalence of impervious surfaces allafta et al 2021 but at the same time urbanization can increase recharge by redistribution and improve groundwater conditions lerner 2002 minnig et al 2018 in our study area the land use changes have primarily occurred in places like kahilipara lokhra barsajai patharquary bonda narengi satgaon and rukminigaon where vegetation and fallow land have converted to the urban landscape these areas have been classified as moderate gwpz in 2020 fig 9 topography could play an important role in groundwater availability condon and maxwell 2015 the water levels are deep in regions close to undulating inselbergs and residual hills such as basistha forest gate panjabari mathgharia and birubari than the areas with flat topography such as rukminigaon gotanagar and jalukbari table sd1 the water levels in valley fill areas vary depending on the thickness of the residuum the water levels are steadily decreasing from the elevated eastern and southeastern parts to the low lying alluvial plains in the west figs 6 and 7 although these areas are situated in valley fill deposits the water levels in rehabari nepali mandir and paltan bazar are found in deeper depths this could be related to a high level of stress associated with the withdrawal of large volumes of groundwater for domestic and commercial purposes das and goswami 2013 the rapid expansion of urban areas contributes adversely to many social economic and environmental problems high population growth in the study area is linked to urban expansion and altered land use patterns nath et al 2021 the population density in the study area has been increasing significantly fig 10 thereby increasing the pressure on the city s natural resources such as groundwater and the capacity of the local government to offer clean drinking water pawe and saikia 2018 the issue of drinking water supply is becoming increasingly problematic as the population is growing rapidly due to the inconsistent water supply infrastructure most of the areas lack access to safe drinking water bhattacharya and borah 2014 ahmed et al 2021 unfortunately even though the brahmaputra river is a significant source of water still due to the unstable public water supply in guwahati city individuals must rely on either their own sources of water commercial agencies and or water vendors which is not feasible for all residents on a regular basis ahmed et al 2021 recently the government of assam has undertaken four major water supply projects with funding from the government of india jawaharlal nehru national urban renewal mission jnnurm for the western region japan international cooperation agency jica for the north and central regions and asian development bank adb for the eastern region to provide an affordable dependable safe pressurised and continuous 24 7 supply of water to the guwahati metropolitan area the water supply projects are still under construction however one of the four projects has recently begun only partially supplying water in some regions we did not observe significant changes in rainfall patterns in the study area over the last 40 years period fig s1 the trend analysis of the annual rainfall pattern confirmed such observations sen s slope is 5 32 mm yr and the p value is 0 13 nath et al 2021 further showed a positive link between the increase in the depth to water level and the increase in the percentage of urban areas the trend analysis based on the 12 years of water level data collected during pre and post monsoon seasons confirmed that the depth to water level is falling in many localities near urban areas except in places like deepor beel and some high rise building locations patharquary wireless and paltan bazar where the depth to water level is rising table sd2 the rapid expansion of commercial and residential activity has caused a significant increase in water usage in guwahati and other metropolitan regions of the state the problem could spread to other urban areas in the state if the relevant authorities are unable to act soon to stop the widespread extraction and usage of groundwater practices like rainwater harvesting along with treated water from the brahmaputra river should be implemented to every household in the city urbanization has occurred in places where the population density has increased between 2000 and 2020 these places are located in the south and southeast of the city center and have shown changes in groundwater potential zones from good to moderate fig 9 in most cases urbanization makes the land surface impervious inhibiting rainwater from infiltrating deep and diminishing groundwater recharge mishra et al 2014 consequently the depth to water levels surrounding newer built up areas on the outskirts of the city center is deep and showing a falling trend indicating that there has been a greater withdrawal of groundwater than the amount of groundwater being recharged the monsoonal rain the primary source of recharge has not changed significantly and may impact the groundwater pattern in the study area due to increased overland flow although the positive effects of urbanization on groundwater recharge can not be entirely ruled out since in a few pockets urbanization has allowed rising water level trends 6 validation of groundwater potential zone mean annual average pre and post monsoon groundwater levels in 2000 and 2019 were used to validate the groundwater potential zones table sd3 water level data demonstrate a region s actual recharge rate and groundwater potential and there should be a strong correlation between them patra et al 2018b validation data for 2000 show that in a majority of locations groundwater potential zones and depth to water level either agree or partially agree with each other in 2019 the disagreement between groundwater potential zones and depth to water level was slightly higher such a disagreement could be attributed to local variations in groundwater recharge conditions and monsoonal variations in rainfall the depth to water level is shallow 2 m bgl in good groundwater potential zones whereas the depth to water level is intermediate 2 5 m bgl in moderate groundwater potential zones the range of groundwater level fluctuations varied from place to place the spatial variations in groundwater level fluctuation indicate varied hydrogeological and groundwater recharge conditions patra et al 2018b the validation results fit well with the delineated map of groundwater potential zones 7 conclusion the lulc change analysis shows a considerable expansion of urban areas by approximately 27 and a decrease in the vegetation cover by 20 in the study area from 2000 to 2020 furthermore population density has increased in areas where we observed an increase in the built up areas during the study period the gwpz map shows that the increasing built up areas and population density result in the shift in groundwater potential zones from good to moderate due to the combined effects of rapid population growth and urbanization the demand for fresh water in the study area would increase dramatically the greater number of households and industries could increase groundwater extraction resulting in a falling trend in depth to water levels in several pockets over time the trend analysis confirms that urban areas have mostly shown falling trends in depth to water level with a few exceptions where the depth to water level is rising in the short term groundwater pumping should be regulated and local governments should take initiatives to fulfill the demand of a majority of household s drinking water requirements at the same time the aquifer could be replenished through managed artificial recharge and reduced groundwater consumption by rainwater harvesting declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to

11691,the identification and management of groundwater resources are critical for sustainable development since there is an increase in demand for groundwater use geospatial remote sensing approaches are vital to groundwater resource evaluation and conservation we studied the spatiotemporal dynamics of land use change between 2000 and 2020 and its impact on water level conditions and groundwater potential zones in a rapidly urbanizing kamrup metropolitan district of assam india the thematic maps such as land use and land cover lulc in 2000 and 2020 geology geomorphology topsoil sand topsoil clay and slope were used to define groundwater potential zones the analytical hierarchy process was used to quantify the weight rank and reclassification of various thematic maps the assigned weights of lulc geology geomorphology topsoil sand topsoil clay and slope were 70 14 4 6 4 6 4 6 and 2 2 respectively the groundwater potential zone classified as good has decreased in cumulative area by 19 during the study period the increase in the very good groundwater potential zone is primarily associated with conservation of lakes and other surface water bodies urbanization is the primary driver for decreased groundwater potentiality in the study region shallow 2 m below ground level bgl groundwater levels are associated with good groundwater potential zones whereas intermediate 2 5 m bgl groundwater levels are associated with moderate groundwater potential zones groundwater levels in built up areas are showing falling trends except in a few places where the water levels are rising which suggests a lack of monsoonal recharge due to increased imperviousness without sustainable planning the change in groundwater potential zones and a falling trend in the depth to water levels

northeastern india data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction groundwater is an essential natural resource that enriches the lives on earth it caters to the needs of half of drinking water 40 of irrigation water and one third of industrial water requirements foster et al 2013 jakeman et al 2016 halder et al 2020 unesco world water assessment programme 2022 groundwater holds nearly 99 of the freshwater available on earth for human consumption and is the most slowly replenished reservoir taylor et al 2013 cuthbert et al 2019 the slow replenishment makes the groundwater an asset and less susceptible to short term events like droughts and other extreme weather events than surface water dalin 2021 kandekar et al 2021 proper management is essential since groundwater resources are replenished more slowly than surface water however groundwater availability remains unknown unless aquifer mapping is done for long term sustainability dalin 2021 the primary problems with managing water resources in urban areas are the rapid rate of urbanization and the extraordinary increasing strain of expanding anthropogenic activities the increasing dependence on groundwater over the last few decades caused the over exploitation of aquifers cuthbert et al 2019 halder et al 2020 nath et al 2021 ul haq et al 2021 the land transformations due to urbanization are occurring locally regionally and globally over the last few decades and will continue in the future mishra et al 2014 urbanization is mainly associated with deforestation the transformation of vegetated lands into industrial and residential areas and the development of road networks and modern infrastructures nath et al 2021 an increased imperviousness due to urbanization significantly affects groundwater recharge and availability and reduces infiltration mishra et al 2014 together with increasing groundwater abstraction the urbanization can be linked to groundwater depletion however in some places urbanization can increase groundwater recharge by redistribution lerner 2002 alqurashi and kumar 2019 have shown the decline in groundwater storage associated with the changes in land usage e g agricultural to industrial practices song et al 2014 and chen et al 2015 observed that the urban areas received slightly greater amounts of precipitation with higher intensity than the neighboring mountainous areas they have suggested that the combination of urbanization and topography causes the differences in rainfall on the other hand patra et al 2018a and ul haq et al 2021 have observed that urbanization increases average minimum and maximum temperatures and decreases rainfall in the area the change in precipitation and temperature as well as the expansion of urban built up areas has had a negative effect on the groundwater tables during pre and post monsoon periods patra et al 2018a kamrup metropolitan district is the smallest and the most densely inhabited district of assam india the metropolitan region has been experiencing rapid population growth industrialization and urbanization over the last few decades das and goswami 2013 kumar 2017 bhuyan 2018 according to the central ground water board cgwb the current stage of total groundwater extraction versus total groundwater availability is 57 26 based on the 2020 assessment year central groundwater board 2020 however there is an increasing demand for groundwater to sustain the growth of industries and housing development unplanned urbanization accompanied by an rapidly increasing population leads to significant anthropogenic changes in this region and threatens the availability of groundwater resources at present 60 of the population depends on groundwater and only 40 have access to treated water das and goswami 2013 gogoi 2017 therefore it is essential to assess the changes in the groundwater potentiality zone and analyze the water level conditions in this region several knowledge driven processes such as analytic hierarchy process catastrophe theory probabilistic frequency ratio logistic regression simple additive weights and machine learning combined with remote sensing rs and geographic information system gis are used to delineate the groundwater potential of a region saaty 1980 kaur et al 2020 prasad et al 2020 hasanuzzaman et al 2022 the purpose of using these methods is to investigate a connection between groundwater occurrences and significant topographic features however each method has advantages and disadvantages table s1 among these methods the analytic hierarchy process ahp a multi criteria decision making technique has been used extensively to delineate groundwater potential zones saaty 1980 murmu et al 2019 al djazouli et al 2020 roy et

and qualitative approaches and is suitable for expert based rankings to improve accuracy therefore we employed the ahp technique along with rs and gis to determine the relative importance of geology geomorphology slope lulc clay and sand contents to map groundwater potential zones gwpzs the objective of this research is to study spatiotemporal changes in urban areas between 2000 and 2020 and their impact on long term trends in groundwater levels and the change in groundwater potential zones in the densely inhabited kamrup metropolitan district of assam india we achieved this objective by collecting long term groundwater level data and analyzing their trends and spatio temporal distributions land use and land cover analysis were also conducted to observe the changes in urban dynamics in our study area combining all the thematic maps help us to quantify the change in groundwater potential zones in the study area 2 study area kamrup metropolitan district is located between latitudes 25 43 00 n to 26 51 00 n and longitudes 90 36 00 e to 92 12 00 e the district shares its border with nagaon district in the east darrang district in the west kamrup district in the north and meghalaya state in the south fig 1 the total urban population is approximately 1 million as per the census in 2011 and it was estimated to be 2 5 million by 2025 guwahati metropolitan development authority gmda as shown in fig 1c is an integral part of the district where the majority of the district s inhabitants reside physiographically the region is divided into three units i e the alluvial plains in the central and western parts the hilly regions in the south and swampy area along the flood plains of the brahmaputra river in the west central groundwater board 2013 in the hilly region the elevation is up to 327 m while the elevation ranges between 49 5 and 55 5 m above mean sea level in the plains patowary and sharma 2018 the climate is humid subtropical with hot summers heavy rainfall and high humidity the average temperature ranges from 12 c to 38 c the average annual rainfall is 2125 mm with 96 rainy days central groundwater board 2013 plp 2018 2 1 geology and geomorphology geological and geomorphological maps of the study area were obtained from the geological survey of india gsi at 1 50 000 and 1 250 000 scales respectively bhukosh 2022 the geological formation of the region comprises assam meghalaya gneissic complex older metamorphic group hauli formation and barpeta formation ii gsi 2013 assam meghalaya gneissic complex includes coarse grey granite pink granite gneiss composite gneiss and banded gneiss fig 2 a the older metamorphic group comprises hornblende biotite schist while the hauli formation includes feebly oxidized grey fine sand silt and clay semi consolidated the barpeta formation ii includes micaceous sand silt and clay gsi 2013 groundwater is abundant in gneissic rocks as they have a high weathering intensity nithya et al 2019 the assam meghalaya gneissic complex is given the most weight in the groundwater potential zone mapping followed by the older metamorphic group barpeta formation ii and hauli formation the region has distinguishable geomorphic units such as the flood plain of brahmaputra river and its tributaries younger alluvial plains in the areas with lower elevation and older alluvium in the higher slopes piedmont and flood plains with gentle slopes are found along the foothills while inselbergs represented by denuded small isolated hills are made up of granite and gneissic rocks central groundwater

pediment deposits underlain by weathered formations and lower in hilly regions central groundwater board 2013 2 2 slope the slope is an important parameter that determines a drainage basin s groundwater potential abdullateef et al 2021 the slope of a river basin influences the development of a drainage pattern nithya et al 2019 shuttle radar topography mission srtm digital elevation model dem at 30 m spatial resolution was used to create the slope map fig 3 farr et al 2007 the slope of the study area varies between 0 and 46 the slopes 15 are located in the eastern and central parts of the study area it is difficult for rainwater to infiltrate through steep slopes which results in rapid runoff and greater erosion hence the areas with higher slopes are classified as poor for groundwater storage and recharge on the other hand the areas with flat topography and gentle slopes have a high infiltration rate and are classified as good potential for groundwater storage and recharge 2 3 topsoil clay and sand content the gridded data of sand and clay contents in topsoil 0 5 cm were obtained from isric world soil information soilgrids 2022 the gridded data of 250 m spatial resolution were resampled to 30 m resolution to prepare groundwater potential zone maps for 2000 and 2020 soil is an important parameter that influences the groundwater potential of an area for example sandy soils have higher recharge rates and clayey soils have higher tortuosity and less water movement kim and jackson 2012 the topsoil clay and sand contents of the study area are shown in fig 4 a and b the clay content varies between 236 and 333 g kg and sand content varies between 317 and 416 g kg higher topsoil clay is observed in the southeastern part of the study area on the other hand higher topsoil sand is observed near the brahmaputra river 3 materials and methods 3 1 land use and land cover analysis the lulc classification was done using maximum likelihood method richards and richards 2006 in erdas imagine software satellite imageries for 2000 and 2020 were downloaded from the united states geological survey usgs earth explorer table 1 the maximum likelihood classifier mlc has been extensively used in lulc classification it is a parametric algorithm based on bayesian probability theory richards and richards 2006 it is a statistical decision procedure that aids in the classification of overlapping signatures and is based on the likelihood that a pixel belongs to a specific class jensen 2005 the fundamental assumption is that all the classes have identical probabilities and that the data for each class in each band have normal distributions it computes the likelihood that a given pixel belongs to a specific class each pixel is assigned to the class with the greatest probability i e maximum likelihood the pixel remains unclassified if the highest likelihood is less than a user defined threshold the lulc classes were built up area vegetation fallow land sandbar and waterbody a detailed description of lulc classes is given in table 2 accuracy assessment was done to assess the classification strengths and to interpret the classified image nath et al 2021 ground truth data for each lulc class was collected using visual interpretation of satellite imageries high resolution google earth images and field knowledge of the study area nath et al 2021 about 100 randomly distributed points were identified as ground truth pixels the erdas imagine software was used to compare classification results with reference data using a post classification confusion matrix based on ground truth region of interest roi the kappa coefficient was used to compute the correct values of a confusion matrix based on 1 the agreement between the classification and reference data diagonal cells and 2 the chance agreement indicated by the row and column totals i e marginal s there is a poor agreement between the reference and classified data if the kappa coefficient is less than 0 20 if the kappa coefficient is greater than 0 81 the categorized lulc classes and reference data are almost similar landis and koch 1977 3 2 mapping of groundwater levels groundwater levels from shallow wells 25 m for pre monsoon march and post monsoon november in 2000 and 2019 were obtained from the cgwb indiawris 2022 and directorate of geology and mining assam dgm 2022 the spatial distribution of groundwater levels were mapped using inverse distance weighting idw technique in arcgis pro 2 4 the idw is based on the concept of tobler s first law of geography tobler 1970 the idw is a convex interpolation technique that spatially fits continuous models of variations the idw uses the data from a known location to calculate the values of a variable at a new location patra et al 2018a based on the following equation 1 x ˆ i 1 n w i x i 2 w i d i i 1 n d i where x ˆ stands for an unknown value of a variable x i is the value of a known location n stands for the number of sample locations w i is the weight of each sample location d i is the distance from each sample location to the unknown location and α is the power the idw method provided more accurate results in accordance with the distribution of groundwater monitoring wells variability in the data and distance between the data points over the kriging and spline interpolation method wu and hung 2016 the idw method has routinely used in groundwater level spatial interpolation studies sajjad et al 2022 3 3 groundwater level trend analysis the trend analysis was done using the mann kendall test based on the time series groundwater level data of selected wells from the study area n 18 water level data for pre monsoon march and post monsoon november seasons were collected between 2007 and 2019 the data was obtained from the cgwb and directorate of geology and mining assam the selection of wells is based on the availability of data for longer time span mann kendall test is a widely applied method in hydrology and climate studies to determine the trends based on time series data wu et al 2008 pathak and dodamani 2019 the test was initially formulated by mann 1945 and later introduced by kendall 1975 it is a nonparametric method for trend detection to determine the trend either s statistics for less than 10 data points or z statistics for more than 10 data points is used rahman et al 2017 liu et al 2020 minea et al 2022 s statistic can be computed using the following equation 3 s k 1 n 1 j k 1 n s g n x j x k where n is the total number of samples and x j and x k are the consecutive data values of the time series the sgn x j x k takes the values of 1 0 and 1 and can be estimated as follows 4 s g n x j x k 1 i f x j x k 0 0 i f x j x k 0 1 i f x j x k 0 the variance of s can be calculated as follows 5 v a r s 1 18 n n 1 2 n 5 p 1 q t p t p 1 2 t p 5 where q is the number of data pairs same values in the time series and t p is the data value in the pth group in the absence of data pairs the sum of paired group is not required then the z statistic can be computed using the following equation 6 z s 1 v a r s i f s 0 0 i f s 0 s 1 v a r s i f s 0 the z values follow a normal distribution and can be used to determine whether a variable has a trend falling increasing rising decreasing and no trend for example falling increasing trend when z 0 rising decreasing trend when z 0 and no trend when z 0 the significance of the results is based on the null hypothesis no trend which is tested against an alternative hypothesis having a trend the obtained p values determine whether a trend is statistically significant or not typically 0 05 i e 95 confidence level the magnitude of the trend falling or rising i e how much the water level has changed each year was determined by sen s slope method the method is resistant to outliers sen 1968 the sen s slope is calculated using the following equation 7 β m e d i a n x j x k j k j k where β is sen s slope estimate β 0 indicates a falling trend and β 0 indicates a rising trend 3 4 groundwater potential zone mapping six thematic layers geology geomorphology lulc topsoil sand topsoil clay and slope were prepared and analyzed using the ahp technique to delineate the groundwater potential zones a schematic diagram shows the datasets used and the steps taken to prepare these thematic layers fig 5 groundwater availability is highly influenced by geology the porosity and permeability of a geological formation determine its ability to hold and transfer water vandas et al 2002 soil properties control the infiltration of surface water ahmed and sajjad 2018 soil texture and structure influence the water movement slope determines the groundwater recharge process ahmed and sajjad 2018 the ahp technique divides a complex multi criteria decision problem into a hierarchy based pairwise analysis of the relative value of various criteria and sub criteria al djazouli et al 2020 according to saaty s relative importance scale the weights of each parameter were assigned saaty 1980 the weights were determined based on a review of previous studies and local knowledge of the field site according to saaty 1980 a value of 7 indicates strongly important 6 indicates moderately important 5 indicates moderately less important 4 indicates less important 3 indicates strongly less important 2 indicates extremely less important and 1 indicates equally important the pairwise comparison matrix was developed for the selected thematic layers to evaluate the scale weight of the relevant layers and their impact on groundwater availability das 2019 all the thematic layers were compared to one another in a pairwise comparison matrix and the results are presented in table 3 the weights were determined using the weighted arithmetic mean approach which is calculated using the following equation das 2019 8 a w λ max w where a is the pairwise comparison matrix λ max is the principal eigenvalue of the matrix and w is the weight the consistency ratio cr was calculated following saaty 1980 as per the equation given below 9 c r c i r i 10 c i λ max n n 1 where cr is the consistency ratio ci is the consistency index ri is the random index λ max is the principal eigenvalue of the matrix and n is the number of factors random index ri values were taken from the published article by saaty 1980 which depends on the number of components saaty 1980 proposed that the cr 0 10 is acceptable to continue the analysis if cr is greater than 0 10 then there is a need to revise the judgment and correct inconsistency in the judgment to keep cr within the allowable range arulbalaji et al 2019 if cr 0 it shows perfect consistency in the pairwise comparison the thematic layers were resampled to 30 m spatial resolution and integrated into arcgis software the thematic layers were then re classified using the natural breaks classification method in arcgis software the weights were assigned after reclassification the ranks scale of 1 5 were assigned to the sub classes of each thematic layer based on their relative influence on groundwater availability table 4 the resultant maps of groundwater potential zones were created using a weighted overlay method as per the equation given below 11 11 g w p z i n x a y b where gwpz is the groundwater potential zone x is the weight of thematic layers and y is the rank of thematic layers subclasses the a term a 1 2 3 x represents the thematic maps and the b term b 1 2 3 y represents the thematic map classes arulbalaji et al 2019 the groundwater potential zones were then re classified as poor moderate good and very good based on the combined weights received from different parameters 4 results 4 1 groundwater level distributions the depth to water levels ranged from 0 01 m to 21 42 m below ground level bgl in the pre and post monsoon seasons of 2000 and 2019 figs 6 and 7 table sd1 the spatial extent of the variations of depth to water level has changed considerably during different seasons and years however the annual rainfall pattern in the study area remained consistent the decline is not significant during the two years fig s1 the spatial distribution of depth to water levels showed a few cones of depression water levels 6 1 m bgl located in the central part of the study area during both the pre and post monsoon seasons of 2000 in 2019 the spatial distribution of depth to water levels showed several wells with water levels 6 1 m bgl such a pattern in depth to water levels could be attributed to anthropogenic activities in the pre monsoon season of 2000 the depth to water levels ranged from 0 25 m to 11 27 m bgl table sd1 groundwater levels were mostly 4 6 m bgl 75 out of 91 wells except for a few localized cones of depression where the depth to water levels was 4 6 m bgl fig 6a table sd1 in lalganesh a t road katabari and pamohi the groundwater levels were between 6 1 m and 8 2 m bgl while in jalukbari amingaon birubari paltan bazar and madhgharia the groundwater levels were 8 2 m bgl the deepest groundwater level was found in madhgharia refinery well id 91 11 27 m bgl located in the northeastern part of the study area on the other hand panjabari well id 71 located in the southeastern part of the study area had recorded the shallowest groundwater level 0 25 m bgl in the post monsoon season of 2000 the depth to water levels ranged from 0 01 m to 14 55 m bgl table sd1 groundwater levels were 4 6 m bgl in the eastern and western parts of the study area in amingaon dhirenpara manpara birubari paltan bazar and madhgharia the groundwater levels were 8 2 m bgl fig 6b birubari well id 32 located in the north central part of the study area had recorded the deepest groundwater levels 14 55 m bgl in contrast narengi high school well id 74 located in the eastern part of the study area had recorded the shallowest groundwater levels 0 01 m bgl in the pre monsoon season of 2019 the depth to water levels ranged between 0 48 m and 21 42 m bgl table sd1 more than half of the monitoring wells 28 out of 54 wells had recorded groundwater levels 4 6 m bgl fig 7a these wells are located in lachitpur udaipur panbazar kahilipara christian basti kachari basti betkuchi and panjabari the deepest groundwater level 21 42 m bgl was found in panjabari well id 147 located in the southeastern part of the study area shallow groundwater levels 3 1 m bgl were mostly observed in the southwestern part of the study area the shallowest groundwater level 0 48 m bgl was recorded in maligaon well id 142 following the monsoon season the groundwater levels in many well locations have recovered and were found to be 4 6 m bgl fig 7b these wells were located in the southwestern part of the study area and north of the brahmaputra river deep groundwater levels 6 1 m bgl were found in the central and northeastern parts of the study area the areas include udaipur kahilipara adagudam zoo narengi road narengi forest gate and panjabari fig 7b adagudam well id 112 located in the central part of the study area had recorded the deepest groundwater level 18 02 m bgl the shallowest groundwater level 1 15 m bgl was observed in paltan bazar well id 145 located in the north central part of the study area 4 2 long term trends in groundwater levels the mann kendall test gives an interesting insight into pre and post monsoon water level data of the study area the results of the mann kendall test along with the magnitudes of the trends based on sen s slope are presented in table 5 in the pre monsoon the z values indicate that the depth to water level i e below ground level is falling increasing in five monitoring wells while in four monitoring wells the depth to water level is rising decreasing the trends are different in different wells which could be due to the changing groundwater withdrawal pattern in different parts of the study area in the post monsoon the z values indicate that the depth to water level is falling increasing in seven wells while in one well the depth to water level is rising decreasing in four wells the depth to water level is falling in both pre and post monsoon seasons while in one well a rising trend is observed in both seasons the rising trend in depth to water level in maligaon is the result of the conservation of deepor beel as part of the ramsar agreement in both pre and post monsoon seasons the depth to water level in maligoan has remained within 1 5 m bgl since 2013 table sd2 the observation of a rising trend in depth to water level in patharquary wireless and paltan bazar during the pre monsoon season is likely due to the changing pattern of the pumping regime as land use change has also resulted in the development of high rise buildings that typically draw water from deep aquifers 100 m and or increase in recharge due to redistribution lerner 2002 our time series data shows that the depth to water level in these locations remained within 2 m bgl in both pre and post monsoon seasons since 2013 table sd2 on the other hand the falling trends are observed in locations such as bakarapara boragaon and panjabari where the depth to water level is constantly falling and found to be greater than 8 m bgl especially during the pre monsoon seasons the significance of these trends is represented by p values typically 0 05 however the magnitude of these trends differs in different wells as shown by sen s slope which suggests the rate at which the depth to water level changes with time the positive values of sen s slope signify a falling depth to water level while the negative values signify a rising depth to water level the falling depth to water level during the post monsoon season suggests that the recharge is not sufficient to recover the drop in water level due to pre monsoon groundwater withdrawal to understand the control of rainfall on such a pattern the trend analysis of total annual rainfall from 1980 to 2019 reveals no significant change z values of 1 5 and p values of 0 13 in the study area the slope is slightly negative i e 5 32 mm yr but statistically not significant suggesting a major control of anthropogenic activities in changing pattern of depth to water level in the study area 4 3 land use and land cover pattern the lulc classification for 2000 and 2020 is shown in fig 8 the overall accuracy is 89 and 91 and the corresponding kappa coefficient is 0 84 and 0 86 respectively for 2000 and 2020 table s2 the overall accuracy of our classified images and the kappa coefficient agrees well with the suggested global accuracy of 85 90 for lulc mapping of urban areas anderson 1976 landis and koch 1977 the results show that vegetation and built up areas are the two dominant lulc classes in both years table 6 however vegetation consisting of 158 km2 in the area in 2000 decreased to 127 km2 in 2020 on the contrary built up areas consisting of 103 km2 in the area in 2000 increased to 131 km2 in 2020 the areas under different lulc classes have changed over time overall built up areas have increased by 27 followed by an increase in fallow land by 8 9 and waterbody by 15 table 6 on the other hand there has been a significant decrease in vegetation by 20 and sandbar by 30 there has been a significant increase in built up areas by replacing vegetation and fallow land between 2000 and 2020 in places like kahilipara lokhra barsajai patharquary bonda narengi satgaon and rukminigaon these places are located in the south and southeastern part of the study area our analysis further showed that the lake in the eastern part of the study area disappeared in 2020 and converted into built up areas and vegetation fig 8 the spatiotemporal pattern of lulc change was also reported earlier by nath et al 2021 these authors have attributed this change to the increase in demand for land for housing and industrial activities 5 discussion the results of the groundwater potential zones show considerable changes between 2000 and 2020 fig 9 poor gwpz has decreased in area by 68 while moderate gwpz has increased in area by 10 on the other hand good gwpz has decreased in area by 19 and very good gwpz has increased in area by 307 table s3 the areas that changed from good to moderate gwpz are primarily located near the built up areas such a transformation indicates the adverse effect of urbanization on the groundwater potentiality of a region arefin 2020 has shown a decrease in the groundwater potential zones in dhaka city and linked that to urban development likewise sajjad et al 2022 have shown a declining trend in groundwater levels related to land transformation due to urbanization in the faisalabad district of pakistan in 2002 deepor beel wetland was classified as a ramsar site therefore in response to this initiative the local government has implemented conservation measures around deepor beel due to its biological and environmental significance planning commission government of india 2008 saikia 2019 as a response very good gwpz has increased near deepor beel and its adjoining region on the west of the study area fig 9 these changes have favored the greater seasonal availability of surface water in the study area das and goswami 2013 and recharge to groundwater our trend analysis has shown that the depth to water level is rising and remained within 1 5 m bgl near deeper beel maligaon well id 142 in both pre and post monsoon seasons table sd2 good and very good gwpzs are located in places where a significant and commercially exploitable quantity of groundwater can be found at a shallow depth while poor and moderate gwpzs are located in places where the depth to water level is greater due to a lack of recharge and higher groundwater abstraction urbanization in the study area has increased rapidly to fulfill the demand of a growing proportion of the population living in cities and suburbs chetia et al 2020 urbanization increases surface imperviousness leading to an altered groundwater flow path and deteriorating water quality das and goswami 2013 urban land use has low infiltration rates due to the prevalence of impervious surfaces allafta et al 2021 but at the same time urbanization can increase recharge by redistribution and improve groundwater conditions lerner 2002 minnig et al 2018 in our study area the land use changes have primarily occurred in places like kahilipara lokhra barsajai patharquary bonda narengi satgaon and rukminigaon where vegetation and fallow land have converted to the urban landscape these areas have been classified as moderate gwpz in 2020 fig 9 topography could play an important role in groundwater availability condon and maxwell 2015 the water levels are deep in regions close to undulating inselbergs and residual hills such as basistha forest gate panjabari mathgharia and birubari than the areas with flat topography such as rukminigaon gotanagar and jalukbari table sd1 the water levels in valley fill areas vary depending on the thickness of the residuum the water levels are steadily decreasing from the elevated eastern and southeastern parts to the low lying alluvial plains in the west figs 6 and 7 although these areas are situated in valley fill deposits the water levels in rehabari nepali mandir and paltan bazar are found in deeper depths this could be related to a high level of stress associated with the withdrawal of large volumes of groundwater for domestic and commercial purposes das and goswami 2013 the rapid expansion of urban areas contributes adversely to many social economic and environmental problems high population growth in the study area is linked to urban expansion and altered land use patterns nath et al 2021 the population density in the study area has been increasing significantly fig 10 thereby increasing the pressure on the city s natural resources such as groundwater and the capacity of the local government to offer clean drinking water pawe and saikia 2018 the issue of drinking water supply is becoming increasingly problematic as the population is growing rapidly due to the inconsistent water supply infrastructure most of the areas lack access to safe drinking water bhattacharya and borah 2014 ahmed et al 2021 unfortunately even though the brahmaputra river is a significant source of water still due to the unstable public water supply in guwahati city individuals must rely on either their own sources of water commercial agencies and or water vendors which is not feasible for all residents on a regular basis ahmed et al 2021 recently the government of assam has undertaken four major water supply projects with funding from the government of india jawaharlal nehru national urban renewal mission jnnurm for the western region japan international cooperation agency jica for the north and central regions and asian development bank adb for the eastern region to provide an affordable dependable safe pressurised and continuous 24 7 supply of water to the guwahati metropolitan area the water supply projects are still under construction however one of the four projects has recently begun only partially supplying water in some regions we did not observe significant changes in rainfall patterns in the study area over the last 40 years period fig s1 the trend analysis of the annual rainfall pattern confirmed such observations sen s slope is 5 32 mm yr and the p value is 0 13 nath et al 2021 further showed a positive link between the increase in the depth to water level and the increase in the percentage of urban areas the trend analysis based on the 12 years of water level data collected during pre and post monsoon seasons confirmed that the depth to water level is falling in many localities near urban areas except in places like deepor beel and some high rise building locations patharquary wireless and paltan bazar where the depth to water level is rising table sd2 the rapid expansion of commercial and residential activity has caused a significant increase in water usage in guwahati and other metropolitan regions of the state the problem could spread to other urban areas in the state if the relevant authorities are unable to act soon to stop the widespread extraction and usage of groundwater practices like rainwater harvesting along with treated water from the brahmaputra river should be implemented to every household in the city urbanization has occurred in places where the population density has increased between 2000 and 2020 these places are located in the south and southeast of the city center and have shown changes in groundwater potential zones from good to moderate fig 9 in most cases urbanization makes the land surface impervious inhibiting rainwater from infiltrating deep and diminishing groundwater recharge mishra et al 2014 consequently the depth to water levels surrounding newer built up areas on the outskirts of the city center is deep and showing a falling trend indicating that there has been a greater withdrawal of groundwater than the amount of groundwater being recharged the monsoonal rain the primary source of recharge has not changed significantly and may impact the groundwater pattern in the study area due to increased overland flow although the positive effects of urbanization on groundwater recharge can not be entirely ruled out since in a few pockets urbanization has allowed rising water level trends 6 validation of groundwater potential zone mean annual average pre and post monsoon groundwater levels in 2000 and 2019 were used to validate the groundwater potential zones table sd3 water level data demonstrate a region s actual recharge rate and groundwater potential and there should be a strong correlation between them patra et al 2018b validation data for 2000 show that in a majority of locations groundwater potential zones and depth to water level either agree or partially agree with each other in 2019 the disagreement between groundwater potential zones and depth to water level was slightly higher such a disagreement could be attributed to local variations in groundwater recharge conditions and monsoonal variations in rainfall the depth to water level is shallow 2 m bgl in good groundwater potential zones whereas the depth to water level is intermediate 2 5 m bgl in moderate groundwater potential zones the range of groundwater level fluctuations varied from place to place the spatial variations in groundwater level fluctuation indicate varied hydrogeological and groundwater recharge conditions patra et al 2018b the validation results fit well with the delineated map of groundwater potential zones 7 conclusion the lulc change analysis shows a considerable expansion of urban areas by approximately 27 and a decrease in the vegetation cover by 20 in the study area from 2000 to 2020 furthermore population density has increased in areas where we observed an increase in the built up areas during the study period the gwpz map shows that the increasing built up areas and population density result in the shift in groundwater potential zones from good to moderate due to the combined effects of rapid population growth and urbanization the demand for fresh water in the study area would increase dramatically the greater number of households and industries could increase groundwater extraction resulting in a falling trend in depth to water levels in several pockets over time the trend analysis confirms that urban areas have mostly shown falling trends in depth to water level with a few exceptions where the depth to water level is rising in the short term groundwater pumping should be regulated and local governments should take initiatives to fulfill the demand of a majority of household s drinking water requirements at the same time the aquifer could be replenished through managed artificial recharge and reduced groundwater

11692,the holistic management of water resources is attainable with evidence based planning constructed on reliable hydrological information however data paucity especially in sub saharan africa leads to a significant knowledge gap regarding surface water and groundwater interactions leaving considerable uncertainty to support relevant decisions this study combined hydrogeochemistry and environmental isotopes to explore the connections between the surface water and groundwater in the data scarce catchment of lake babati basin in northern tanzania the results showed that i lake babati receives groundwater influx from recently recharged aquifers endowed in the pyroclastic formation in the lake basin ii the lake is not well mixed as presented by the heterogenous hydrogeochemistry and confirmed by the differences in the isotopic composition of deuterium and oxygen 18 at different locations within it iii the deep wells located near the lake abstract a mixture of recently recharged water deep aquifer waters and lake water with enriched isotopic compositions and iv the hydrogeochemistry and isotopic data reveal the presence of a hydraulic connection between the lake and deep

et al 2012 mukherjee et al 2020 pantaleo et al 2018 this trend has been described as the silent revolution because it is driven by numerous individual farmers who pursue short term benefits provided by intensive groundwater abstraction without government planning llamas and martínez santos 2005 since such developments are often uncontrolled and not incorporated into comprehensive land and water management plans at the basin scale they often result in overexploitation and degradation of aquifers these developments coupled with climate variability present a significant challenge to sustainable groundwater development throughout the world tanzania is not an exception as similar scenarios have been reported chacha et al 2018 ligate et al 2021 mul et al 2007 further still population growth and

surface water groundwater dynamics in many catchments are still limited especially where the aquifer potential and its connection with surface water systems are less understood regionally there are numerous hydrological studies on lake victoria ogiramoi 2011 swenson and wahr 2009 tate et al 2004 and the east african rift valley lakes such as lake manyara deus et al 2013 lake malawi hassan and

al 2022 however the focus of the studies have been fluoride and arsenic contamination of groundwater and lake level variability with few studies reporting on hydraulic connections and interactions between lake water and groundwater lake babati basin identified as the study area has several wells located within 300 m from its shores abstracting water for township water supply there are concerns that the abstractions from these boreholes could influence the lake level variability premised on the groundwater flow concept advanced by toth 1963 the present study aimed to assess the possibility of hydraulic connections and interactions between lake babati and the groundwater system this study circumvented the challenges of insitu data paucity by using the hydrogeochemical method and stable environmental isotopes to characterise the water sources and investigate the interactions between the surface water and groundwater in the basin it is further hoped that information from this study regarding the interactions of the lake with the groundwater system will inform the management of the possible pollution pathways and reveal if the increasing number of wells around the lake may influence the lake variability 2 study area 2 1 location and geology the study was conducted on a 390 km2 catchment of lake babati which is located in babati town in manyara region of northern tanzania lying between longitudes 35 30 e and 35 50 e and latitudes 4 10 s and 4 30 s fig 1 the catchment elevation varies from 1201 m in the valleys near lake babati to 2388 m in the hills as shown in fig 1 the catchment is mostly bounded in the south and southwest by granite and gneiss rocks as shown in fig 2 mineral resources division 1966 the catchment s southwest and western borders lie on a relatively higher elevation bounded by an outcrop of the bubu cataclasites of precambrian rocks from the tanzania craton tectonic unit ijumulana et al 2020 mineral resources division 1966 the bubu cataclasites fig 2 have a high likelihood of groundwater flow in the micropores characterised by faults mineral resources division 1966 similarly the southern catchment boundary lies on a range of mountains composed of metasedimentary rocks of mixed granitoid and permeated gneiss and quartzo feldspathic gneiss as shown in fig 2 the metasedimentary rocks of micaceous quartzite the usagaran formation from the mozambique belt tectonic unit ijumulana et al 2020 mineral resources division 1966 bounds the south east and eastern borders of the catchment given the compactness of the metamorphic rocks of the usagaran formation it was considered an aquifuge in those borders subramanya 2008 however these regions could experience high runoffs after rains due to the steep slopes and low infiltration rates the boundary rocks enclose an endowment of superficial and volcanic deposits from the recent neogene era in the catchment centre there are dark soils from weathered tuffs with quartzo feldspathic gneiss at some sections with an interspersion of some agglomerate and crystal tuffs from the volcanic formation lightly coloured sandy soils superficial deposits dominate the valleys while dark brown soils derived from weathered tuffs cover mainly the eastern part of the lake the western side of the lake is the most complex with no dominant formation but is endowed with a combination of red and red brown soils dark brown soils from weathered tuff and sometimes with tuff and lava floats as the superficial deposits volcanic formations such as the crystal tuffs and agglomerate intersperse the alluvial sand silt and clay deposits that form the aquifer surrounding the lake the neogene era s volcanic materials dominated the northern border of the catchment forming hills and mountains the patches of volcanic agglomerate volcanic tuffs and fragments which intersperse the superficial deposits in the northern and the central part of the catchment form the principal aquifer of the catchment due to their high permeability which ranges from 0 4 m day for silt to 8 64 m day for mixed sand subramanya 2008 the superficial geological formation varies from alluvium materials red and brown soils mbuga soils or calcic vertisols ngalio 1998 and water distribution it was therefore not surprising that most of the wells were located within this region a geological cross section a a in fig 4 revealed clayey sand and compact clay overlays fine to coarse sand formations beneath the lake dijkshoorn 2003 also reported that clay layers confine the aquifer in the lake area 2 2 climate the catchment experiences a semi arid climate with a highly variable rainfall pattern ijumulana et al 2020 sandstrom 1995 the average annual hydrological year precipitation was 836 mm with a standard deviation of 270 mm according to the 1980 2014 rainfall records from babati meteorological station station id 9435030 maintained by the tanzania meteorological authority the shifting intertropical convergence zone and indian ocean dipole influence the bimodal rainfall distribution awange et al 2016 the main rainfall season runs from february to may while minor rainfall occurs between october and january the period between june and september is a dry but cold season dry winter with the mean maximum temperature of 22 c and the mean minimum temperature of 11 c the short dry spell in february which separates the two rainy seasons is characterised by higher temperatures with the mean maximum temperature reaching 26 5 c and the mean minimum temperature of 14 55 c 2 3 lake babati lake babati is a small and shallow freshwater lake within the east african rift valley region with a maximum depth of about 7 m in the wet season due to its shallowness the lake rapidly responds to climatic variations for instance it flooded babati town several times following episodes of high rainfall in 1964 1979 and 1990 stromquist 1992 and massively overflowed through an artificial spillway in 2006 2019 and 2020 the flooding and drying cycles have resulted in the lake s size variations based on the september 2019 satellite imagery the lake s surface area was about 12 55 km2 compared to the 17 km2 mineral resources division 1966 captured in fig 2 the september 2019 lake size was estimated from a land use map classified using iso unsupervised method based on a landsat satellite imagery of the area row 168 and path 063 acquired on september 29 2019 after verification with the observed field data the classified land use map had an overall accuracy of 79 3 a spillway has been built in the northeastern part of the lake to drain excess water into river kiongozi and avoid flooding babati town river kiongozi physically links lake babati to lake manyara lake babati is an essential source of fish to the local community and supports several aquatic species such as the hippopotamus mbanguka et al 2016 sandstrom 1995 stromquist 1992 all the rivers draining into lake babati are ephemeral recently babati town has expanded with more settlements land cover modifications and an increased population hongoa 2014 pantaleo et al 2018 however agriculture and livestock productions are still the key economic activities in the district these anthropogenic activities have resulted in more abstraction wells in the lake s neighbourhood to supply water to the sprouting babati town although the lake level fluctuated following cycles of drought and heavy rainfall in the past it recently experienced a consistent level decline the natural resource managers are apprehensive that the presence of abstraction wells around the lake may cause irrecoverable damage to the groundwater lake dynamics which in the worst case scenario can lead to the complete drying of the lake however studies linking the wells abstractions groundwater dynamics and the lake water level are scanty 2 4 groundwater level and flow directions the groundwater levels contour map was interpolated using different methods based on data from 323 shallow wells within the catchment collected by pantaleo et al 2018 cross validation using leave one out method of the groundwater heads interpolated by the kriging inverse distance weighted idw and local polynomial methods showed that the idw method with a power of one 1 was the best interpolation method as it had the lowest measures of errors the mean error of interpolated groundwater heads was 0 2294 m while the mean absolute error and the root means squared error were 3 701 m and 38 19 m respectively the groundwater levels were thus interpolated using idw with a power of one a standard search method with a minimum of 10 neighbors and a maximum of 15 neighbors as a search criteria and other default settings the groundwater flow directions from the idw s interpolated groundwater levels varied with topography but remained shallow in the lake s valleys and flood plains fig 3 generally the groundwater contours converged and indicated a flow direction towards the lake after the lake the flow directions were in the northeastern part of the catchment implying that the lake and groundwater precisely drain in the direction of the artificial outlet channel constructed to relieve the lake of the excess water in flood conditions the groundwater contours were steeper in the eastern than the western lake boundary indicating that the eastern boundary had more substantial groundwater inflow than the western boundary although the south of the lake had flattened flow contours signifying a low gradient groundwater flow potential the contours generally indicate a gradient that mobilises the lake flow from the southernmost border to the northeastern part where it is deepest mbanguka et al 2016 since the groundwater level in an unconfined catchment imitates the topography and flows to a low elevation toth 1963 a general flow direction towards the lake as dictated by the topography was assumed for the groundwater in areas not covered by the shallow well water levels 2 5 groundwater flow system the granitic rocks at the southern boundary of the catchment area are believed to establish a no flow boundary due to the consolidated formation of granite however the pyroclastic rocks within the catchment provide an opportunity for a localised groundwater system that interacts with the lake evidence from 10 wells drilled to an average depth of 80 m around lake babati shows the presence of unconsolidated materials and an aquifer with a high yield of groundwater flows fig 4 from the available data on 10 wells with depth of greater than 30 m the first water strike was at an average depth of 12 m but the piezometric water heads in all the wells averaged 1 5 m thus the wells are probably abstracting from confined aquifers with a contribution from the unconfined aquifer since the well screens are also located in the unconfined aquifer a hydrogeological section sketched not drawn to scale based on the well logs fig 4 showed that clay layers confine the aquifer in the lake area the presence of clayey sand layers in the lake s neighbourhood fig 4 indicates the possibility of lake aquifer interactions in the catchment through leaky sections the steep slopes at the eastern and the western catchment boundaries and the convergence of groundwater head contours to the lake signified a no flow boundary at the eastern and southern catchment boundaries furthermore the groundwater head contours suggested a northeast groundwater flow after the lake and the prospect of having a leaky or flux boundary at the northern catchment boundary 3 materials and methods 3 1 data sources different sources provided wells data including the internal drainage basin authority of tanzania research data from pantaleo et al 2018 the babati water supply authority bawasa and field measurements conducted between june 2019 and june 2020 the wells were classified as shallow if their depths were less than 30 m and deep wells if the depths equalled or exceeded 30 m in accordance with the practice and understanding of the drillers and water supply operators within the region 3 2 water sample collection and laboratory analyses water samples were collected on 22nd and may 23 2019 towards the end of the major wet season from different points and depths in lake babati shallow and deep wells and rivers within and outside of lake babati basin as shown in fig 1 the lake water was sampled from 1 m below the surface and 2 3rd of the lake depth using a lake water sampler during the sampling campaign water was sampled from two points in lake manyara one from about the lake s middle and another from its northernmost boundary near a river input for comparison purposes with lake babati groundwater from the shallow and deep wells was collected using a bucket or pump outlet after pumping out for about 5 10 min to avoid sampling stationary water the main interests were to collect representative groundwater samples from the aquifer the rivers were sampled from the flowing sections to avoid sampling stagnant water we systematically followed the standard methods for sampling preservation and examining water and wastewater chemistry described in the apha 2017 temperature the potential of hydrogen ion ph total dissolved solids tds and electrical conductivity ec were measured during sampling using a hanna multi parameter test kit model hi 9829 the multi parameter kit was calibrated for ec and ph by taking readings from standard solutions of both in addition the kit was reset and recalibrated according to the manufacturer s specifications whenever necessary the water samples were filled into cleaned dry bottles decontaminated in nitric acid and rinsed with deionised water a day before the field excursion cooler boxes packed with ice cubes were used to maintain the samples cold in the field the water samples were treated and sampled in different bottles depending on the purpose of the tests the samples for isotope analysis were filled and capped airtight underwater into 100 ml high density polyethene bottles to avoid introducing air bubbles no further treatments were performed on the samples but they were stored in a low temperature room to avoid evaporation water samples for cation and anion analysis were kept in polyethene bottles and maintained at 4 c without further treatment immediately after fieldwork the carbonate bicarbonate and total alkalinity of the samples were determined by titrating with sulphuric acid using methyl orange and phenolphthalein as endpoint indicators following the titration method 2320 b described by the apha 2017 major cations and anions were analysed using ion chromatography ics 5000 at the national institute of hydrology laboratory roorkee uttarakhand state india according to the standard analysis protocol specified by the apha 2017 the samples were filtered using a 0 45 μm pore diameter membrane filter and diluted with distilled water to ensure ec 10 μs cm before analysis the ionic balance of the major cations and anions in the samples was a criterion for assessing the accuracy of the hydrogeochemical analysis sample analysis was repeated where the ionic balance errors of major cations and anions were 10 finally 86 of the 29 samples had ionic balance errors of 5 while one sample still had an ionic balance error of 10 after repeated analysis these results were accepted as most had an ionic balance error of less than the acceptable 5 water samples for isotope analysis were analysed for deuterium 2h and oxygen 18 18o isotopes at the nuclear laboratory of the national institute of hydrology roorkee uttarakhand india using a dual inlet isotope mass ratio spectrometer the unit of measurement was per mil deviations denoted as δ from vienna standard mean ocean water v smow about 3 ml of the sample was first equilibrated with hydrogen gas in the presence of a platinum catalyst for 3 h before determining deuterium before determining the oxygen 18 isotope the samples were equilibrated for about 7 h in carbon dioxide the isotope composition δ delta values of deuterium and oxygen 18 defined as isotopic ratios reflecting deviation in per mil from v smow were calculated as shown in equation 1 craig 1961 kendall and doctor 2003 1 δ s a m p l e r s a m p l e r s t a n d a r d 1 1000 where r s a m p l e is the concentration ratio of the heavy isotope to the more abundant light isotope of the same atom for example the ratios of 18o 16o or 2h 1h the r s t a n d a r d and r s a m p l e are derived from beam currents integrated over time for a sample gas against a reference gas a positive δ s a m p l e means the isotopic ratio is higher than the standards and vice versa the global network of isotope in precipitation iaea 2019 provided 117 monthly isotopic datasets of deuterium and oxygen 18 in precipitation in tanzania collected from dar es salaam between march 1961 to october 1973 and another 18 monthly measurements from dodoma from january 2014 to april 2016 to augment the data the dodoma station is at an altitude of 1150 m 213 km south of the study area while dar es salaam is at an elevation of 55 m and 480 km to the south east of the study area the isotope data in precipitation was representative of the seasonal variations since they were collected throughout the year in the months with rainfall 3 3 analysis of hydrogeochemical and isotopic data descriptive statistics were applied to compare the relative variations of hydrogeochemical parameters and isotopic compositions among the different water sources and were presented in box plots we computed the moran s index statistics following the steps described by ijumulana et al 2020 and quino lima et al 2020 without repeating for brevity to identify spatial autocorrelation in the hydrogeochemical parameters moran s index ranges from 1 to 1 with 1 representing perfect clustering and 1 perfect dispersion a moran s index of 0 implies perfectly random data the moran i statistics were accompanied by z scores and probability of occurrence to help hypothesis testing the excel analysis tools and the r packages version 3 6 1 were handy for data exploration and analysis we applied the principal component analysis pca to reduce the raw data to important parameters principal components and visualise the associations between different hydrogeochemical parameters the use of pca for similar analysis is widely reported in ecological and hydrogeological studies ligate et al 2022 mataba et al 2021 sakakibara et al 2016 tomašek et al 2022 the pca was performed using r packages prcomp package the missing values were omitted from the analysis and variables were scaled as they had different units of measurement the principal component loadings and principal component scores pcss were computed but only the most dominant principal components were reported based on the principal components the stat ellipse function within ggplot2 functions of r packages was applied to cluster the scatterplot by water source and show the overlap of the principal components between different water sources the cluster was an ellipse drawn within a 95 confidence interval of the scatterplot the piper diagram piper 1944 was used to present and identify the dominant hydrogeochemical facies and evolution in the water based on the relative abundance of major cations and anions a scatter plot of the δ d and δ 18 o values was made to understand the relationship in their variations spatial interpolation of the δ 18 o values was done to appreciate the evolution δ 18 o in the lake s surface and bottom as reported by dansgard 1964 the δ d and δ 18 o values of precipitation mostly from the northern hemisphere that has not been evaporated are linearly related by a regression equation that is now termed as the global meteoric water line gmwl mathematically expressed as in equation 2 craig 1961 2 δ 2 h 8 δ 18 o 10 any variation of the oxygen 18 isotopes and deuterium that results in a deviation from the gmwl has been used as a basis for studying sources of water because atmospheric processes and groundwater recharge sources influence their compositions jabal et al 2018 their applications have been extensive including establishing aquifer hydrogeological characteristics groundwater flow dynamics and the interconnections with different sources jabal et al 2018 krishan et al 2019 maurya et al 2019 further the deuterium excess d a second order isotope parameter sensitive to the conditions during the evaporation of water from the source pfahl and sodemann 2014 was applied to understand the moisture sources jabal et al 2018 deuterium excess d was determined using equation 3 liliane and jouzel 1979 pfahl and sodemann 2014 and plotted against δ 18 0 3 d δ d 8 δ 18 o with δ d and δ 18 0 as the measured deuterium and oxygen 18 relative abundance to v smow 4 results and discussion 4 1 hydrogeochemical variations 4 1 1 the abundance of major cations and anions sodium ions na and magnesium ions mg2 were the main cations that altogether made 80 of the cation concentration while bicarbonate ions hco3 alone made 66 of the anions followed by chloride cl at 17 the carbonates co3 2 formed a tiny portion of the anions and were zero in all the samples except the lake samples ls3 and ls4 table a 1 the trend of cation abundance was na mg2 ca2 k while for anions the abundance was in the order of hco3 cl co3 2 sulphates so4 2 similarly a high concentration of na was also observed on the slopes of mount meru in arusha tanzania tomašek et al 2022 the so4 2 formed a paltry 6 of the anions concentration table a 1 in the appendix provides details and compares each sample s measured variables against the who 2011 2017 guideline and maximum allowable concentrations whenever established most of the measured parameters were below the who guideline values fig 5 they thus met the drinking water standards except for fluoride in sample ls4 1 9 mg l and rv3 1 9 mg l and nitrate in sample dw3 66 4 mg l and sw3 57 3 mg l fluoride levels were generally low in the study area agreeing with ijumulana et al 2020 2021 who described the study area as a fluoride cool spot with a low probability of fluoride risk level the study area is located in a semi arid area where excessive evaporation is expected to influence salts concentration ahmed et al 2019 however the cl concentration was relatively low the strong diluting effect of rainfall and the runoffs into the lake could have offset the evaporation effect on cl concentration however the lake and deep wells exhibited higher cl concentration than other water sources 4 1 2 distribution of the hydrogeochemical parameters the lake had a higher concentration of all the ions contrasting with the rainfall driven sources like the crater the rivers and the springs fig 5 a l the springs represented by their ec had the second least concentration of ions the deep wells had the highest concentration of ca2 with a mean of 29 16 mg l followed by the lake at 22 06 mg l and the shallow wells at 20 12 mg l however the lake had the highest concentration of mg2 followed by the deep wells the deep wells may have acquired more ca2 and mg2 salts because their waters had a longer rock dissolution time than the spring and river waters the intermediate composition of the lake chemistry suggests the lake contains a mixture of ions from different sources ahmed et al 2019 reported similar results in the eastern desert of egypt where groundwater at the downstream points in the low altitude had relatively higher ion concentrations and tds than at the upstream point in the high altitude nearby tomašek et al 2022 have attributed the high ions concentration in groundwater sources at the foot of mount meru to the longer rock water interaction time low precipitation and high evaporation rates although all water samples were fresh tds 1000 mg l freeze and cherry 1979 the lake and deep wells exhibited higher tds than the rivers shallow wells and springs implying the presence of higher salts concentration in them the deep wells and the lake probably have water that has had prolonged contact dissolution time with geological formation rocks from which most of these salts originate freeze and cherry 1979 sakakibara et al 2016 the ec varied a lot among the different groups the ec of water samples from the bottom of lake babati varied from 542 to 677 μs cm with a mean of 631 μs cm while water samples from the lake s surface had ec within a range of 475 670 μs cm with an average of 575 μs cm the ec for the deep wells varied within a broader range from 415 to 683 μs cm with a mean of 550 μs cm lower than for the lake water the shallow wells rivers springs and crater had an ec below 500 μs cm fig 5 c implying that they contained freshwater in contrast the lake water and deep wells had marginal waters with ec between 500 and 1500 μs cm davis and dewiest 1966 as expected the tds followed the same trend as the ec the deep wells had intermediate values of tds and ec fig 5 b falling between the lake and the rivers and springs freshwater of meteoric origin an indication that the deep wells were a mixture of lake water recently recharged rainwater and water with dissolved rocks although lake babati is shallow and semi closed with excessive evaporation it maintained a low level of salination the high influx of rainfall and runoffs seems to dilute the lake and retard the salinisation effect of evaporation the results revealed that the springs rivers and shallow wells have lower nitrate concentrations than the lake s bottom suggesting they are less contaminated sources fig 5 m the higher concentration of nitrates no3 in the lake s bottom may have resulted from contamination by fertilisers animal manure or sewerage effluents from nearby communities which are reportedly the main sources of no3 in water in the region elisante and muzuka 2017 ligate et al 2021 tomašek et al 2022 although a reduction of no3 concentration is expected with depth nazzal et al 2014 due to the presence of reducing conditions at deeper depths deep wells had the most extensive variation in no3 concentration from about 5 6 to 66 4 mg l fig 5 h this wide variation of no3 concentration in deep wells may suggest that the deep aquifer waters mix with no3 polluted surface waters since the natural occurrence of nitrates in water is low the no3 concentration in deep wells was an intermediate value between its concentration at the lake s bottom and the shallow wells which corroborates that mixing occurs the mixing between shallow lake and deep water can only be possible if a hydraulic connection exists the deep wells within the catchment have well screens installed to abstract water from both the confined and unconfined aquifers attesting abstraction of mixed water therefore the unconfined aquifers are likely to have a hydraulic connection with the lake through the alluvial deposits a mixture of fine to medium sand with silty clay on top that forms the aquifer surrounding the lake like no3 phosphate po4 3 naturally has a very low concentration in water or soil since phosphate is biologically active and often a limiting nutrient therefore the observed higher than the naturally occurring concentration of phosphate in lake babati suggests that the phosphate originated from artificial sources such as sewerage deposition or leakage from farms using nitrogen phosphorus and potassium npk fertilisers which are the primary sources of phosphate and nitrate further the presence of both no3 and po4 3 in the crater water cr with a comparatively higher concentration of potassium k than na attests to the pollution of the water sources by npk fertilisers probably from the neighbouring farms acid dissolution of some rocks may also result in elevated phosphorus concentrations as observed in the volcanic regions of taupo in new zealand timperley 1983 in such a case however phosphate concentration would be widespread and a very high concentration would be expected in deep wells due to prolonged contact and dissolution time the selective phosphate distribution in surface water sources in the lake babati catchment suggests that phosphate may be derived from point sources this scenario further implies that the processes that supply phosphorus are higher than the biological processes that deplete it which is more likely when surface water loading of the pollutant occurs although pollution from sewerage industries and agriculture also contribute to the occurrence of so4 2 in water nazzal et al 2014 the low levels of industrialisation and the limited use of fertilisers in agriculture in the lake babati basin were anticipated to have minimal impact generally as captured in fig 5 the deep boreholes had higher ec and dissolved salts with more elevated ca2 mg2 and k concentrations than the shallow wells the possible dissolution of calcium magnesium silicate or limestone rocks could have yielded high levels of ca2 mg2 and co3 2 ahmed et al 2019 kenoyer and bowser 1992 observed that the concentrations of some cations increase when water passes through longer subsurface flow paths we observed similar results in the deep wells probably due to the long residence time resulting in rock mineral dissolution in contrast because they are recharged from recent water the shallow wells had far less dissolved solids probably due to the short interaction time with the mineral contents of the aquifer we tested the parameters for spatial autocorrelation the parameters with a p value 0 05 in table 1 have significant spatial autocorrelation in their distribution the ec tds salinity hco3 and co3 2 showed spatial clustering p value 0 05 especially among samples from the lake and its neighbourhood the clustering of the parameters showed a hotspot near the lake as shown in figure suppl 1 of the appendix the areas outside the lake catchment had very distinctive patterns from the clustered samples from the lake and its northern boundary as shown in figure suppl 1 of the appendix implying that the lake interacts with and influences the hydrogeochemistry of the aquifers in its neighbourhood the spatial autocorrelation clustering of salinity ec and tds hco3 and co3 2 limited the power to infer generalise the observation from these samples to the whole population as suggested by pawley and mcardle 2021 therefore the standard statistics reported here are only applicable and limited to the studied site a principal components analysis showed that ec tds salinity f cl co3 2 so4 2 ca2 mg2 na and k are negatively correlated with principal component one in a strong way fig 6 a the parameters co3 2 so4 2 ca2 mg2 and na as shown by the loading plots of principal component one pc1 against principal component two pc2 fig 6 a exhibited multicollinearity thus increasing or decreasing together the multicollinearity between hco3 the most dominant anions in the water samples with ec tds and salinity indicated the possible importance of hco3 in driving the respective physical properties of freshwater characteristics this is alluded to by the increase in pc2 with a reduction in hco3 ec tds and salinity therefore the pc2 was possibly a measure of the control of water softness since it increased with an increase in the concentration of f cl co3 2 mg2 na and k which determine water softness the multicollinearity of f cl co3 2 and so4 2 with mg2 na and k shown in fig 6 a could imply the presence and common origin of salts of cl so4 2 and co3 2 in the water the association of so4 2 with ca2 and mg2 might suggest the dissolution of dolomite and gypsum rocks especially in the waters of the deep wells and some shallow wells bennett et al 2021 observed a similar association between the ions on mount meru and attributed it to rock water interaction fig 6 b indicated an overlap in the principal components of shallow wells with deep wells and rivers which implies that the water from the shallow wells was a mixture of the deep wells and river water recently recharged water although the data points for the crater and springs were few for the ellipsoidal representation of their spread their locations within the cluster for rivers and shallow wells fig 6 indicated their similarities the hydrogeochemical parameters of deep wells spread widely engulfing the lake s bottom waters and overlapping with the lake s surface water shallow wells and river waters this implies that the deep wells contain a mixture of water from different sources the mixing of water from the lake and deep wells was further corroborated by the striking similarity between the lake s bottom water and deep wells in principal components 1 and 2 properties fig 6 b 4 1 3 piper trilinear diagram from the piper diagram classification fig 7 the alkaline earth metals mg ca exceeded the alkalis na k and the weak acids co3 hco3 dominated the strong acids so4 cl in most samples the water samples fell into three main facies types as summarised in table 2 however most samples belonged to the ca mg hco3 facies indicating temporary hardness due to ion exchange reaction carbonate hardness exceeded 50 in most samples suggesting a substantial dissolution of possibly dolomitic rocks into the water three water types occur in lake babati i e the mixed ca na hco3 na cl and ca hco3 suggesting it has water from different sources moreover four out of the six locations sampled in the lake had different water types at the surface and bottom implying that the lake is not well mixed location l6 in the lake was homogenous with ca na hco3 water type both at the surface l6s and bottom l6b while location l4 had a na cl water type both at the surface l4s and bottom l4b the deep wells springs and some shallow wells had the mg ca hco3 water type indicating the influence of rock water dissolution in contrast the shallow wells sw1 and sw2 had purely ca hco3 water type 4 2 isotopic compositions and variations 4 2 1 local meteoric water line vs global meteoric water line the local meteoric water lines lmwl based on the isotopic composition of precipitation from dar es salaam sourced from iaea 2019 a coastal area that is only 10 m above sea level indian ocean and dodoma an inland town that is 1100 m higher in altitude than dar es salaam were not significantly different p 0 22 this was contrary to gibson et al 2016 and gonzález trinidad et al 2017 who reported that isotopic enrichment declines with altitude and distance from the ocean nevertheless an interaction of additional factors such as rainfall amount temperature and seasonal effects could have influenced the variations in the isotopic compositions in precipitations of both stations in a nonlinear way gibson et al 2016 gonfiantini et al 2001 gonzález trinidad et al 2017 kendall and doctor 2003 the proximity of the dodoma station to the study area and the fact that dodoma lmwl is closer to the gmwl dansgard 1964 motivated its choice to better represent the isotopic composition of precipitation for babati moreover the gmwl is a crucial reference line for understanding the processes that drive the circulation of air masses under different climatic conditions around the globe dansgard 1964 kendall and doctor 2003 4 2 2 oxygen 18 and deuterium variation the most depleted δ18o value was 10 15 recorded in april 2016 while the most enriched was 3 36 recorded in january 2015 both at the dodoma sampling site the dar es salaam site had the δ18o values ranging from 8 95 to 2 6 and δd from 2 1 to 126 9 the δ18o and δd values reduced in a similar pattern not shown with increased precipitation highlighting the influence of the amount effects in the isotopic compositions kendall and doctor 2003 scholl et al 2014 the precipitation volume weighted isotopic composition at the dar es salaam station was 2 92 for δ18o and 13 11 for δd the volume weighted composition for the dodoma site could not be computed as the precipitation volume at the sampling time was not available the average isotopic composition in precipitation at dar es salaam a coastal site based on 11 observations in may the month of water sampling in the study area was 2 22 for δ18o and 0 69 for δd the dodoma site based on a single observation was more depleted than dar es salaam with the δ18o value of 3 48 the dodoma site probably as an inland site had the ocean inland distance influence its fractionation pfahl and sodemann 2014 generally the isotopic compositions showed relative depletion in the peak rainy season perhaps due to the amounts effects while relative enrichment was observed in the dry season historical data showed that the relative depletion in the rainy season and enrichment in dry seasons are long term seasonal patterns therefore the seasonal variations of the isotopic compositions implied that rainfed water sources such as the shallow wells and springs would have similar seasonal variations in their isotopic compositions the variations in deuterium and oxygen 18 have been applied to establish the water sources that replenish the aquifer and determine water origins groundwater flow dynamics and the interconnections with different sources jabal et al 2018 krishan et al 2019 maurya et al 2019 specifically the relative enrichment of δ18o and δd in samples indicate the extent of evaporation from water sources since lighter isotopes evaporate faster than heavy isotopes thus leaving the remaining water enriched with heavy isotopes akker et al 2011 kendall and doctor 2003 therefore the spread and clustering of the isotopic composition of the collected water samples fig 8 indicated the differences in evaporation of the original water source as shown fig 8 the lake water differed distinctly from the river springs and shallow well waters the deep boreholes specifically dw1 and dw3 laid between the lake and springs suggesting that they abstracted a mixture of lake water and recently recharged meteoric water the two other deep wells dw2 and dw4 which were distant from the lake at least 2 km away from the lakeshore had isotopic compositions close to that of the precipitation signifying they were mainly recharged from precipitation that did not undergo significant evaporation these results imply that the aquifers of these deep wells are in hydraulic connection with the local groundwater flow system where water has a short residence time or travel route the closeness of the isotopic composition of the spring rivers and shallow wells to the lmwl suggests their meteoric origin for example the water sample from the mrara river rv3 was significantly depleted in heavy isotopes like precipitation and plotted near the meteoric line it was therefore conclusive that the springs shallow wells and rivers were mainly driven by precipitation and less by the base flow chacha et al 2018 likewise reported similar isotopic compositions for springs in arusha tanzania and observed that the source of the flowing springs was linked to precipitation and its seasonal variation the ephemeral characteristics of the rivers and springs in the area further supported this observation in contrast river kiongozi rv2 had an isotopically enriched signature that laid between the lmwl and the lake babati isotopic signature this observation suggests that river kiongozi receives isotopically rich water from lake babati and runoff water furthermore the groundwater head contour map fig 8 drawn from water levels of shallow wells substantiated that groundwater flow from lake babati is in the northeast in the flow direction of river kiongozi lake babati water was enriched in both δ18o and δd and plotted below the lmwl with a regression line with a negative intercept of 0 48 and a slope of 4 89 compared to the lmwl s slope of 7 56 fig 8 the deviation from the lmwl was most likely due to the high temperature and excess evaporation which removed the lighter isotopes while concentrating the heavier ones in the lake akker et al 2011 however lake manyara about 60 km in the north and downstream of lake babati diverged from this with a distinctive isotopic signature and hydrogeochemistry despite being sampled simultaneously with this study the average ec of lake manyara based on two samples one in the lake middle and another at the northernmost lakeshore close to a river mouth was 2000 μs cm against lake babati s 527 μs cm the former probably due to its large size and low chance of mixing had spatially varying water chemistry and isotopic signature not shown with more depleted water δ18o deviation of 2 1 near the river input casanova and hillaire marcel 1992 similarly reported high spatial variability in lake manyara s hydrogeochemistry and isotopic composition which depended on the distance from the fluvial inputs lake manyara had higher ion concentrations than lake babati agreeing with the findings of ala aho et al 2013 that closed lakes in higher altitudes at the finnish rokua esker aquifer had lower solute tracer concentrations than flowing lakes in the lower altitudes the low salt concentration in lake babati gave credence to the notion that runoff and recently recharged groundwater seep into the lake the low solute concentration in recently recharged water was probably due to the short contact time with the rocks or short flow path of the local groundwater flow systems which characterise elevated catchments such as lake babati catchment toth 1963 the gradual decline of the lake level following seasonal variations might suggest that it receives substantial groundwater influx as indicated by the groundwater head contours fig 8 in the pyroclastic geological formation in the lake valley otherwise being shallow lake babati would rapidly dry out during prolonged droughts if it solely relied on precipitation and surface runoffs 4 2 3 deuterium excess variation against delta oxygen 18 δ18o the deuterium excess d excess is a useful second order isotope parameter for understanding moisture sources it provides information on the roles of diffusive transport in the atmospheric boundary layer and the effect of temperatures on fractionation pfahl and sodemann 2014 a plot of d excess against δ18o indicated a spread implying the variation in the water sources fig 9 the lake water clustered in a zone with enriched δ18o but very low deuterium excess indicating it experienced significant evaporation chacha et al 2018 pfahl and sodemann 2014 in contrast the clustering of shallow wells springs rivers and two deep wells dw2 and dw4 distant from the lake in a zone with high d excess but a depleted δ18o just like precipitation implied that they receive precipitation water before evaporation two deep wells dw1 and dw3 had a d excess intermediate to those of the lake water and precipitation suggesting that they are in hydraulic connection with the lake and abstract a mixture of recently recharged groundwater from precipitation and lake water enriched by evaporation similarly river kiongozi sample rv2 recorded a d excess of 6 9 and δ18o of 2 5 fig 9 closer to the d excess of lake babati 9 6 than any other river this suggests that it receives a portion of its baseflow from lake babati 4 2 4 lake water mixing lake babati although small shallow with occasional outflow and without the ability to turn exhibited variations in the isotopic composition both spatially and with depth fig 10 although the isotopic variations in depth were insignificant p 0 35 for δd and p 0 41 for δ18o the difference indicated that the lake is not well mixed the interpretation of the isotopic composition presented in fig 10 showed a slight fractionation gradient within the lake both at the surface and bottom the depletion at the southernmost lake boundary upstream closer to the inflowing streams was attributed to the dilution of the lake water by runoff the increase in enrichment downstream and northwards in the flow direction was probably due to the concentration of heavy isotopes by evaporation in addition as water moves downstream a reduction in dilution is possible since the lake only has small seasonal streams draining into those sections the enrichment at the lake s centre might be related to a higher evaporation intensity the concentration of enriched waters at the lake centre during seasons of low lake level and the reduced dilution effect from inflowing water the evidence of evaporation influencing the hydrogeochemistry at the lake s centre near locations of samples l4s and l3s further corroborated the uniqueness of the lake at this point it confirmed that the lake was not well mixed 5 conclusion the similarity of the isotopic and hydrogeochemical compositions of the deep wells with the lake water suggests that the lake recharges the deep wells in its neighbourhood while the shallow wells drain into the lake further the presence of nitrate in the deep wells attested that deeper aquifers receive both the lake water and the recently recharged water polluted with nitrate implying a hydraulic connection of the deep wells with the lake on the other hand the lake was not well mixed possibly because of differential dilution by runoff evaporation enrichment at the lake surface and the minimal wind mixing effect on the shallow lake the hydrogeochemical and isotopic composition of the shallow wells showed an affinity with the springs and crater water signifying that they originate from rainfall and runoff sources on the other hand the deep wells were characterised by the carbonate and sulphate salts of calcium and magnesium whose sources are rocks that probably dissolved as water travelled the high salt concentration in the deep wells indicated they extract a portion of water with a long residence time mixed with the recently recharged water from the local groundwater flow systems the year round flow characteristics of the kiongozi river are probably due to the groundwater flux baseflow contribution from lake babati the similarity of the isotopic signature of this river with the deep wells in the lake neighbourhood and the groundwater suggests its hydraulic connection to the groundwater flow systems of lake babati such a connection demonstrates a high likelihood of impacting the surface water while abstracting groundwater at unsustainable rates therefore implementation of integrated water resources management is required for sustainable water resources development and management further the abstractions of the groundwater systems must be limited to the safe yields of the aquifer determined and informed through pumping tests and continuous monitoring of the groundwater levels for timely remediation efforts whereas this study demonstrates the feasibility of employing numerous methods in dealing with ungauged and data scarce catchments we recommend validation of its findings using insitu instrumental measurements of seepage and fluxes additionally a detailed 3 d modelling of integrated surface water groundwater system is recommended to quantify the exchange of fluxes and offer more insights into the interdependence of the surface water and

11692,the holistic management of water resources is attainable with evidence based planning constructed on reliable hydrological information however data paucity especially in sub saharan africa leads to a significant knowledge gap regarding surface water and groundwater interactions leaving considerable uncertainty to support relevant decisions this study combined hydrogeochemistry and environmental isotopes to explore the connections between the surface water and groundwater in the data scarce catchment of lake babati basin in northern tanzania the results showed that i lake babati receives groundwater influx from recently recharged aquifers endowed in the pyroclastic formation in the lake basin ii the lake is not well mixed as presented by the heterogenous hydrogeochemistry and confirmed by the differences in the isotopic composition of deuterium and oxygen 18 at different locations within it iii the deep wells located near the lake abstract a mixture of recently recharged water deep aquifer waters and lake water with enriched isotopic compositions and iv the hydrogeochemistry and isotopic data reveal the presence of a hydraulic connection between the lake and deep

et al 2012 mukherjee et al 2020 pantaleo et al 2018 this trend has been described as the silent revolution because it is driven by numerous individual farmers who pursue short term benefits provided by intensive groundwater abstraction without government planning llamas and martínez santos 2005 since such developments are often uncontrolled and not incorporated into comprehensive land and water management plans at the basin scale they often result in overexploitation and degradation of aquifers these developments coupled with climate variability present a significant challenge to sustainable groundwater development throughout the world tanzania is not an exception as similar scenarios have been reported chacha et al 2018 ligate et al 2021 mul et al 2007 further still population growth and

surface water groundwater dynamics in many catchments are still limited especially where the aquifer potential and its connection with surface water systems are less understood regionally there are numerous hydrological studies on lake victoria ogiramoi 2011 swenson and wahr 2009 tate et al 2004 and the east african rift valley lakes such as lake manyara deus et al 2013 lake malawi hassan and

al 2022 however the focus of the studies have been fluoride and arsenic contamination of groundwater and lake level variability with few studies reporting on hydraulic connections and interactions between lake water and groundwater lake babati basin identified as the study area has several wells located within 300 m from its shores abstracting water for township water supply there are concerns that the abstractions from these boreholes could influence the lake level variability premised on the groundwater flow concept advanced by toth 1963 the present study aimed to assess the possibility of hydraulic connections and interactions between lake babati and the groundwater system this study circumvented the challenges of insitu data paucity by using the hydrogeochemical method and stable environmental isotopes to characterise the water sources and investigate the interactions between the surface water and groundwater in the basin it is further hoped that information from this study regarding the interactions of the lake with the groundwater system will inform the management of the possible pollution pathways and reveal if the increasing number of wells around the lake may influence the lake variability 2 study area 2 1 location and geology the study was conducted on a 390 km2 catchment of lake babati which is located in babati town in manyara region of northern tanzania lying between longitudes 35 30 e and 35 50 e and latitudes 4 10 s and 4 30 s fig 1 the catchment elevation varies from 1201 m in the valleys near lake babati to 2388 m in the hills as shown in fig 1 the catchment is mostly bounded in the south and southwest by granite and gneiss rocks as shown in fig 2 mineral resources division 1966 the catchment s southwest and western borders lie on a relatively higher elevation bounded by an outcrop of the bubu cataclasites of precambrian rocks from the tanzania craton tectonic unit ijumulana et al 2020 mineral resources division 1966 the bubu cataclasites fig 2 have a high likelihood of groundwater flow in the micropores characterised by faults mineral resources division 1966 similarly the southern catchment boundary lies on a range of mountains composed of metasedimentary rocks of mixed granitoid and permeated gneiss and quartzo feldspathic gneiss as shown in fig 2 the metasedimentary rocks of micaceous quartzite the usagaran formation from the mozambique belt tectonic unit ijumulana et al 2020 mineral resources division 1966 bounds the south east and eastern borders of the catchment given the compactness of the metamorphic rocks of the usagaran formation it was considered an aquifuge in those borders subramanya 2008 however these regions could experience high runoffs after rains due to the steep slopes and low infiltration rates the boundary rocks enclose an endowment of superficial and volcanic deposits from the recent neogene era in the catchment centre there are dark soils from weathered tuffs with quartzo feldspathic gneiss at some sections with an interspersion of some agglomerate and crystal tuffs from the volcanic formation lightly coloured sandy soils superficial deposits dominate the valleys while dark brown soils derived from weathered tuffs cover mainly the eastern part of the lake the western side of the lake is the most complex with no dominant formation but is endowed with a combination of red and red brown soils dark brown soils from weathered tuff and sometimes with tuff and lava floats as the superficial deposits volcanic formations such as the crystal tuffs and agglomerate intersperse the alluvial sand silt and clay deposits that form the aquifer surrounding the lake the neogene era s volcanic materials dominated the northern border of the catchment forming hills and mountains the patches of volcanic agglomerate volcanic tuffs and fragments which intersperse the superficial deposits in the northern and the central part of the catchment form the principal aquifer of the catchment due to their high permeability which ranges from 0 4 m day for silt to 8 64 m day for mixed sand subramanya 2008 the superficial geological formation varies from alluvium materials red and brown soils mbuga soils or calcic vertisols ngalio 1998 and water distribution it was therefore not surprising that most of the wells were located within this region a geological cross section a a in fig 4 revealed clayey sand and compact clay overlays fine to coarse sand formations beneath the lake dijkshoorn 2003 also reported that clay layers confine the aquifer in the lake area 2 2 climate the catchment experiences a semi arid climate with a highly variable rainfall pattern ijumulana et al 2020 sandstrom 1995 the average annual hydrological year precipitation was 836 mm with a standard deviation of 270 mm according to the 1980 2014 rainfall records from babati meteorological station station id 9435030 maintained by the tanzania meteorological authority the shifting intertropical convergence zone and indian ocean dipole influence the bimodal rainfall distribution awange et al 2016 the main rainfall season runs from february to may while minor rainfall occurs between october and january the period between june and september is a dry but cold season dry winter with the mean maximum temperature of 22 c and the mean minimum temperature of 11 c the short dry spell in february which separates the two rainy seasons is characterised by higher temperatures with the mean maximum temperature reaching 26 5 c and the mean minimum temperature of 14 55 c 2 3 lake babati lake babati is a small and shallow freshwater lake within the east african rift valley region with a maximum depth of about 7 m in the wet season due to its shallowness the lake rapidly responds to climatic variations for instance it flooded babati town several times following episodes of high rainfall in 1964 1979 and 1990 stromquist 1992 and massively overflowed through an artificial spillway in 2006 2019 and 2020 the flooding and drying cycles have resulted in the lake s size variations based on the september 2019 satellite imagery the lake s surface area was about 12 55 km2 compared to the 17 km2 mineral resources division 1966 captured in fig 2 the september 2019 lake size was estimated from a land use map classified using iso unsupervised method based on a landsat satellite imagery of the area row 168 and path 063 acquired on september 29 2019 after verification with the observed field data the classified land use map had an overall accuracy of 79 3 a spillway has been built in the northeastern part of the lake to drain excess water into river kiongozi and avoid flooding babati town river kiongozi physically links lake babati to lake manyara lake babati is an essential source of fish to the local community and supports several aquatic species such as the hippopotamus mbanguka et al 2016 sandstrom 1995 stromquist 1992 all the rivers draining into lake babati are ephemeral recently babati town has expanded with more settlements land cover modifications and an increased population hongoa 2014 pantaleo et al 2018 however agriculture and livestock productions are still the key economic activities in the district these anthropogenic activities have resulted in more abstraction wells in the lake s neighbourhood to supply water to the sprouting babati town although the lake level fluctuated following cycles of drought and heavy rainfall in the past it recently experienced a consistent level decline the natural resource managers are apprehensive that the presence of abstraction wells around the lake may cause irrecoverable damage to the groundwater lake dynamics which in the worst case scenario can lead to the complete drying of the lake however studies linking the wells abstractions groundwater dynamics and the lake water level are scanty 2 4 groundwater level and flow directions the groundwater levels contour map was interpolated using different methods based on data from 323 shallow wells within the catchment collected by pantaleo et al 2018 cross validation using leave one out method of the groundwater heads interpolated by the kriging inverse distance weighted idw and local polynomial methods showed that the idw method with a power of one 1 was the best interpolation method as it had the lowest measures of errors the mean error of interpolated groundwater heads was 0 2294 m while the mean absolute error and the root means squared error were 3 701 m and 38 19 m respectively the groundwater levels were thus interpolated using idw with a power of one a standard search method with a minimum of 10 neighbors and a maximum of 15 neighbors as a search criteria and other default settings the groundwater flow directions from the idw s interpolated groundwater levels varied with topography but remained shallow in the lake s valleys and flood plains fig 3 generally the groundwater contours converged and indicated a flow direction towards the lake after the lake the flow directions were in the northeastern part of the catchment implying that the lake and groundwater precisely drain in the direction of the artificial outlet channel constructed to relieve the lake of the excess water in flood conditions the groundwater contours were steeper in the eastern than the western lake boundary indicating that the eastern boundary had more substantial groundwater inflow than the western boundary although the south of the lake had flattened flow contours signifying a low gradient groundwater flow potential the contours generally indicate a gradient that mobilises the lake flow from the southernmost border to the northeastern part where it is deepest mbanguka et al 2016 since the groundwater level in an unconfined catchment imitates the topography and flows to a low elevation toth 1963 a general flow direction towards the lake as dictated by the topography was assumed for the groundwater in areas not covered by the shallow well water levels 2 5 groundwater flow system the granitic rocks at the southern boundary of the catchment area are believed to establish a no flow boundary due to the consolidated formation of granite however the pyroclastic rocks within the catchment provide an opportunity for a localised groundwater system that interacts with the lake evidence from 10 wells drilled to an average depth of 80 m around lake babati shows the presence of unconsolidated materials and an aquifer with a high yield of groundwater flows fig 4 from the available data on 10 wells with depth of greater than 30 m the first water strike was at an average depth of 12 m but the piezometric water heads in all the wells averaged 1 5 m thus the wells are probably abstracting from confined aquifers with a contribution from the unconfined aquifer since the well screens are also located in the unconfined aquifer a hydrogeological section sketched not drawn to scale based on the well logs fig 4 showed that clay layers confine the aquifer in the lake area the presence of clayey sand layers in the lake s neighbourhood fig 4 indicates the possibility of lake aquifer interactions in the catchment through leaky sections the steep slopes at the eastern and the western catchment boundaries and the convergence of groundwater head contours to the lake signified a no flow boundary at the eastern and southern catchment boundaries furthermore the groundwater head contours suggested a northeast groundwater flow after the lake and the prospect of having a leaky or flux boundary at the northern catchment boundary 3 materials and methods 3 1 data sources different sources provided wells data including the internal drainage basin authority of tanzania research data from pantaleo et al 2018 the babati water supply authority bawasa and field measurements conducted between june 2019 and june 2020 the wells were classified as shallow if their depths were less than 30 m and deep wells if the depths equalled or exceeded 30 m in accordance with the practice and understanding of the drillers and water supply operators within the region 3 2 water sample collection and laboratory analyses water samples were collected on 22nd and may 23 2019 towards the end of the major wet season from different points and depths in lake babati shallow and deep wells and rivers within and outside of lake babati basin as shown in fig 1 the lake water was sampled from 1 m below the surface and 2 3rd of the lake depth using a lake water sampler during the sampling campaign water was sampled from two points in lake manyara one from about the lake s middle and another from its northernmost boundary near a river input for comparison purposes with lake babati groundwater from the shallow and deep wells was collected using a bucket or pump outlet after pumping out for about 5 10 min to avoid sampling stationary water the main interests were to collect representative groundwater samples from the aquifer the rivers were sampled from the flowing sections to avoid sampling stagnant water we systematically followed the standard methods for sampling preservation and examining water and wastewater chemistry described in the apha 2017 temperature the potential of hydrogen ion ph total dissolved solids tds and electrical conductivity ec were measured during sampling using a hanna multi parameter test kit model hi 9829 the multi parameter kit was calibrated for ec and ph by taking readings from standard solutions of both in addition the kit was reset and recalibrated according to the manufacturer s specifications whenever necessary the water samples were filled into cleaned dry bottles decontaminated in nitric acid and rinsed with deionised water a day before the field excursion cooler boxes packed with ice cubes were used to maintain the samples cold in the field the water samples were treated and sampled in different bottles depending on the purpose of the tests the samples for isotope analysis were filled and capped airtight underwater into 100 ml high density polyethene bottles to avoid introducing air bubbles no further treatments were performed on the samples but they were stored in a low temperature room to avoid evaporation water samples for cation and anion analysis were kept in polyethene bottles and maintained at 4 c without further treatment immediately after fieldwork the carbonate bicarbonate and total alkalinity of the samples were determined by titrating with sulphuric acid using methyl orange and phenolphthalein as endpoint indicators following the titration method 2320 b described by the apha 2017 major cations and anions were analysed using ion chromatography ics 5000 at the national institute of hydrology laboratory roorkee uttarakhand state india according to the standard analysis protocol specified by the apha 2017 the samples were filtered using a 0 45 μm pore diameter membrane filter and diluted with distilled water to ensure ec 10 μs cm before analysis the ionic balance of the major cations and anions in the samples was a criterion for assessing the accuracy of the hydrogeochemical analysis sample analysis was repeated where the ionic balance errors of major cations and anions were 10 finally 86 of the 29 samples had ionic balance errors of 5 while one sample still had an ionic balance error of 10 after repeated analysis these results were accepted as most had an ionic balance error of less than the acceptable 5 water samples for isotope analysis were analysed for deuterium 2h and oxygen 18 18o isotopes at the nuclear laboratory of the national institute of hydrology roorkee uttarakhand india using a dual inlet isotope mass ratio spectrometer the unit of measurement was per mil deviations denoted as δ from vienna standard mean ocean water v smow about 3 ml of the sample was first equilibrated with hydrogen gas in the presence of a platinum catalyst for 3 h before determining deuterium before determining the oxygen 18 isotope the samples were equilibrated for about 7 h in carbon dioxide the isotope composition δ delta values of deuterium and oxygen 18 defined as isotopic ratios reflecting deviation in per mil from v smow were calculated as shown in equation 1 craig 1961 kendall and doctor 2003 1 δ s a m p l e r s a m p l e r s t a n d a r d 1 1000 where r s a m p l e is the concentration ratio of the heavy isotope to the more abundant light isotope of the same atom for example the ratios of 18o 16o or 2h 1h the r s t a n d a r d and r s a m p l e are derived from beam currents integrated over time for a sample gas against a reference gas a positive δ s a m p l e means the isotopic ratio is higher than the standards and vice versa the global network of isotope in precipitation iaea 2019 provided 117 monthly isotopic datasets of deuterium and oxygen 18 in precipitation in tanzania collected from dar es salaam between march 1961 to october 1973 and another 18 monthly measurements from dodoma from january 2014 to april 2016 to augment the data the dodoma station is at an altitude of 1150 m 213 km south of the study area while dar es salaam is at an elevation of 55 m and 480 km to the south east of the study area the isotope data in precipitation was representative of the seasonal variations since they were collected throughout the year in the months with rainfall 3 3 analysis of hydrogeochemical and isotopic data descriptive statistics were applied to compare the relative variations of hydrogeochemical parameters and isotopic compositions among the different water sources and were presented in box plots we computed the moran s index statistics following the steps described by ijumulana et al 2020 and quino lima et al 2020 without repeating for brevity to identify spatial autocorrelation in the hydrogeochemical parameters moran s index ranges from 1 to 1 with 1 representing perfect clustering and 1 perfect dispersion a moran s index of 0 implies perfectly random data the moran i statistics were accompanied by z scores and probability of occurrence to help hypothesis testing the excel analysis tools and the r packages version 3 6 1 were handy for data exploration and analysis we applied the principal component analysis pca to reduce the raw data to important parameters principal components and visualise the associations between different hydrogeochemical parameters the use of pca for similar analysis is widely reported in ecological and hydrogeological studies ligate et al 2022 mataba et al 2021 sakakibara et al 2016 tomašek et al 2022 the pca was performed using r packages prcomp package the missing values were omitted from the analysis and variables were scaled as they had different units of measurement the principal component loadings and principal component scores pcss were computed but only the most dominant principal components were reported based on the principal components the stat ellipse function within ggplot2 functions of r packages was applied to cluster the scatterplot by water source and show the overlap of the principal components between different water sources the cluster was an ellipse drawn within a 95 confidence interval of the scatterplot the piper diagram piper 1944 was used to present and identify the dominant hydrogeochemical facies and evolution in the water based on the relative abundance of major cations and anions a scatter plot of the δ d and δ 18 o values was made to understand the relationship in their variations spatial interpolation of the δ 18 o values was done to appreciate the evolution δ 18 o in the lake s surface and bottom as reported by dansgard 1964 the δ d and δ 18 o values of precipitation mostly from the northern hemisphere that has not been evaporated are linearly related by a regression equation that is now termed as the global meteoric water line gmwl mathematically expressed as in equation 2 craig 1961 2 δ 2 h 8 δ 18 o 10 any variation of the oxygen 18 isotopes and deuterium that results in a deviation from the gmwl has been used as a basis for studying sources of water because atmospheric processes and groundwater recharge sources influence their compositions jabal et al 2018 their applications have been extensive including establishing aquifer hydrogeological characteristics groundwater flow dynamics and the interconnections with different sources jabal et al 2018 krishan et al 2019 maurya et al 2019 further the deuterium excess d a second order isotope parameter sensitive to the conditions during the evaporation of water from the source pfahl and sodemann 2014 was applied to understand the moisture sources jabal et al 2018 deuterium excess d was determined using equation 3 liliane and jouzel 1979 pfahl and sodemann 2014 and plotted against δ 18 0 3 d δ d 8 δ 18 o with δ d and δ 18 0 as the measured deuterium and oxygen 18 relative abundance to v smow 4 results and discussion 4 1 hydrogeochemical variations 4 1 1 the abundance of major cations and anions sodium ions na and magnesium ions mg2 were the main cations that altogether made 80 of the cation concentration while bicarbonate ions hco3 alone made 66 of the anions followed by chloride cl at 17 the carbonates co3 2 formed a tiny portion of the anions and were zero in all the samples except the lake samples ls3 and ls4 table a 1 the trend of cation abundance was na mg2 ca2 k while for anions the abundance was in the order of hco3 cl co3 2 sulphates so4 2 similarly a high concentration of na was also observed on the slopes of mount meru in arusha tanzania tomašek et al 2022 the so4 2 formed a paltry 6 of the anions concentration table a 1 in the appendix provides details and compares each sample s measured variables against the who 2011 2017 guideline and maximum allowable concentrations whenever established most of the measured parameters were below the who guideline values fig 5 they thus met the drinking water standards except for fluoride in sample ls4 1 9 mg l and rv3 1 9 mg l and nitrate in sample dw3 66 4 mg l and sw3 57 3 mg l fluoride levels were generally low in the study area agreeing with ijumulana et al 2020 2021 who described the study area as a fluoride cool spot with a low probability of fluoride risk level the study area is located in a semi arid area where excessive evaporation is expected to influence salts concentration ahmed et al 2019 however the cl concentration was relatively low the strong diluting effect of rainfall and the runoffs into the lake could have offset the evaporation effect on cl concentration however the lake and deep wells exhibited higher cl concentration than other water sources 4 1 2 distribution of the hydrogeochemical parameters the lake had a higher concentration of all the ions contrasting with the rainfall driven sources like the crater the rivers and the springs fig 5 a l the springs represented by their ec had the second least concentration of ions the deep wells had the highest concentration of ca2 with a mean of 29 16 mg l followed by the lake at 22 06 mg l and the shallow wells at 20 12 mg l however the lake had the highest concentration of mg2 followed by the deep wells the deep wells may have acquired more ca2 and mg2 salts because their waters had a longer rock dissolution time than the spring and river waters the intermediate composition of the lake chemistry suggests the lake contains a mixture of ions from different sources ahmed et al 2019 reported similar results in the eastern desert of egypt where groundwater at the downstream points in the low altitude had relatively higher ion concentrations and tds than at the upstream point in the high altitude nearby tomašek et al 2022 have attributed the high ions concentration in groundwater sources at the foot of mount meru to the longer rock water interaction time low precipitation and high evaporation rates although all water samples were fresh tds 1000 mg l freeze and cherry 1979 the lake and deep wells exhibited higher tds than the rivers shallow wells and springs implying the presence of higher salts concentration in them the deep wells and the lake probably have water that has had prolonged contact dissolution time with geological formation rocks from which most of these salts originate freeze and cherry 1979 sakakibara et al 2016 the ec varied a lot among the different groups the ec of water samples from the bottom of lake babati varied from 542 to 677 μs cm with a mean of 631 μs cm while water samples from the lake s surface had ec within a range of 475 670 μs cm with an average of 575 μs cm the ec for the deep wells varied within a broader range from 415 to 683 μs cm with a mean of 550 μs cm lower than for the lake water the shallow wells rivers springs and crater had an ec below 500 μs cm fig 5 c implying that they contained freshwater in contrast the lake water and deep wells had marginal waters with ec between 500 and 1500 μs cm davis and dewiest 1966 as expected the tds followed the same trend as the ec the deep wells had intermediate values of tds and ec fig 5 b falling between the lake and the rivers and springs freshwater of meteoric origin an indication that the deep wells were a mixture of lake water recently recharged rainwater and water with dissolved rocks although lake babati is shallow and semi closed with excessive evaporation it maintained a low level of salination the high influx of rainfall and runoffs seems to dilute the lake and retard the salinisation effect of evaporation the results revealed that the springs rivers and shallow wells have lower nitrate concentrations than the lake s bottom suggesting they are less contaminated sources fig 5 m the higher concentration of nitrates no3 in the lake s bottom may have resulted from contamination by fertilisers animal manure or sewerage effluents from nearby communities which are reportedly the main sources of no3 in water in the region elisante and muzuka 2017 ligate et al 2021 tomašek et al 2022 although a reduction of no3 concentration is expected with depth nazzal et al 2014 due to the presence of reducing conditions at deeper depths deep wells had the most extensive variation in no3 concentration from about 5 6 to 66 4 mg l fig 5 h this wide variation of no3 concentration in deep wells may suggest that the deep aquifer waters mix with no3 polluted surface waters since the natural occurrence of nitrates in water is low the no3 concentration in deep wells was an intermediate value between its concentration at the lake s bottom and the shallow wells which corroborates that mixing occurs the mixing between shallow lake and deep water can only be possible if a hydraulic connection exists the deep wells within the catchment have well screens installed to abstract water from both the confined and unconfined aquifers attesting abstraction of mixed water therefore the unconfined aquifers are likely to have a hydraulic connection with the lake through the alluvial deposits a mixture of fine to medium sand with silty clay on top that forms the aquifer surrounding the lake like no3 phosphate po4 3 naturally has a very low concentration in water or soil since phosphate is biologically active and often a limiting nutrient therefore the observed higher than the naturally occurring concentration of phosphate in lake babati suggests that the phosphate originated from artificial sources such as sewerage deposition or leakage from farms using nitrogen phosphorus and potassium npk fertilisers which are the primary sources of phosphate and nitrate further the presence of both no3 and po4 3 in the crater water cr with a comparatively higher concentration of potassium k than na attests to the pollution of the water sources by npk fertilisers probably from the neighbouring farms acid dissolution of some rocks may also result in elevated phosphorus concentrations as observed in the volcanic regions of taupo in new zealand timperley 1983 in such a case however phosphate concentration would be widespread and a very high concentration would be expected in deep wells due to prolonged contact and dissolution time the selective phosphate distribution in surface water sources in the lake babati catchment suggests that phosphate may be derived from point sources this scenario further implies that the processes that supply phosphorus are higher than the biological processes that deplete it which is more likely when surface water loading of the pollutant occurs although pollution from sewerage industries and agriculture also contribute to the occurrence of so4 2 in water nazzal et al 2014 the low levels of industrialisation and the limited use of fertilisers in agriculture in the lake babati basin were anticipated to have minimal impact generally as captured in fig 5 the deep boreholes had higher ec and dissolved salts with more elevated ca2 mg2 and k concentrations than the shallow wells the possible dissolution of calcium magnesium silicate or limestone rocks could have yielded high levels of ca2 mg2 and co3 2 ahmed et al 2019 kenoyer and bowser 1992 observed that the concentrations of some cations increase when water passes through longer subsurface flow paths we observed similar results in the deep wells probably due to the long residence time resulting in rock mineral dissolution in contrast because they are recharged from recent water the shallow wells had far less dissolved solids probably due to the short interaction time with the mineral contents of the aquifer we tested the parameters for spatial autocorrelation the parameters with a p value 0 05 in table 1 have significant spatial autocorrelation in their distribution the ec tds salinity hco3 and co3 2 showed spatial clustering p value 0 05 especially among samples from the lake and its neighbourhood the clustering of the parameters showed a hotspot near the lake as shown in figure suppl 1 of the appendix the areas outside the lake catchment had very distinctive patterns from the clustered samples from the lake and its northern boundary as shown in figure suppl 1 of the appendix implying that the lake interacts with and influences the hydrogeochemistry of the aquifers in its neighbourhood the spatial autocorrelation clustering of salinity ec and tds hco3 and co3 2 limited the power to infer generalise the observation from these samples to the whole population as suggested by pawley and mcardle 2021 therefore the standard statistics reported here are only applicable and limited to the studied site a principal components analysis showed that ec tds salinity f cl co3 2 so4 2 ca2 mg2 na and k are negatively correlated with principal component one in a strong way fig 6 a the parameters co3 2 so4 2 ca2 mg2 and na as shown by the loading plots of principal component one pc1 against principal component two pc2 fig 6 a exhibited multicollinearity thus increasing or decreasing together the multicollinearity between hco3 the most dominant anions in the water samples with ec tds and salinity indicated the possible importance of hco3 in driving the respective physical properties of freshwater characteristics this is alluded to by the increase in pc2 with a reduction in hco3 ec tds and salinity therefore the pc2 was possibly a measure of the control of water softness since it increased with an increase in the concentration of f cl co3 2 mg2 na and k which determine water softness the multicollinearity of f cl co3 2 and so4 2 with mg2 na and k shown in fig 6 a could imply the presence and common origin of salts of cl so4 2 and co3 2 in the water the association of so4 2 with ca2 and mg2 might suggest the dissolution of dolomite and gypsum rocks especially in the waters of the deep wells and some shallow wells bennett et al 2021 observed a similar association between the ions on mount meru and attributed it to rock water interaction fig 6 b indicated an overlap in the principal components of shallow wells with deep wells and rivers which implies that the water from the shallow wells was a mixture of the deep wells and river water recently recharged water although the data points for the crater and springs were few for the ellipsoidal representation of their spread their locations within the cluster for rivers and shallow wells fig 6 indicated their similarities the hydrogeochemical parameters of deep wells spread widely engulfing the lake s bottom waters and overlapping with the lake s surface water shallow wells and river waters this implies that the deep wells contain a mixture of water from different sources the mixing of water from the lake and deep wells was further corroborated by the striking similarity between the lake s bottom water and deep wells in principal components 1 and 2 properties fig 6 b 4 1 3 piper trilinear diagram from the piper diagram classification fig 7 the alkaline earth metals mg ca exceeded the alkalis na k and the weak acids co3 hco3 dominated the strong acids so4 cl in most samples the water samples fell into three main facies types as summarised in table 2 however most samples belonged to the ca mg hco3 facies indicating temporary hardness due to ion exchange reaction carbonate hardness exceeded 50 in most samples suggesting a substantial dissolution of possibly dolomitic rocks into the water three water types occur in lake babati i e the mixed ca na hco3 na cl and ca hco3 suggesting it has water from different sources moreover four out of the six locations sampled in the lake had different water types at the surface and bottom implying that the lake is not well mixed location l6 in the lake was homogenous with ca na hco3 water type both at the surface l6s and bottom l6b while location l4 had a na cl water type both at the surface l4s and bottom l4b the deep wells springs and some shallow wells had the mg ca hco3 water type indicating the influence of rock water dissolution in contrast the shallow wells sw1 and sw2 had purely ca hco3 water type 4 2 isotopic compositions and variations 4 2 1 local meteoric water line vs global meteoric water line the local meteoric water lines lmwl based on the isotopic composition of precipitation from dar es salaam sourced from iaea 2019 a coastal area that is only 10 m above sea level indian ocean and dodoma an inland town that is 1100 m higher in altitude than dar es salaam were not significantly different p 0 22 this was contrary to gibson et al 2016 and gonzález trinidad et al 2017 who reported that isotopic enrichment declines with altitude and distance from the ocean nevertheless an interaction of additional factors such as rainfall amount temperature and seasonal effects could have influenced the variations in the isotopic compositions in precipitations of both stations in a nonlinear way gibson et al 2016 gonfiantini et al 2001 gonzález trinidad et al 2017 kendall and doctor 2003 the proximity of the dodoma station to the study area and the fact that dodoma lmwl is closer to the gmwl dansgard 1964 motivated its choice to better represent the isotopic composition of precipitation for babati moreover the gmwl is a crucial reference line for understanding the processes that drive the circulation of air masses under different climatic conditions around the globe dansgard 1964 kendall and doctor 2003 4 2 2 oxygen 18 and deuterium variation the most depleted δ18o value was 10 15 recorded in april 2016 while the most enriched was 3 36 recorded in january 2015 both at the dodoma sampling site the dar es salaam site had the δ18o values ranging from 8 95 to 2 6 and δd from 2 1 to 126 9 the δ18o and δd values reduced in a similar pattern not shown with increased precipitation highlighting the influence of the amount effects in the isotopic compositions kendall and doctor 2003 scholl et al 2014 the precipitation volume weighted isotopic composition at the dar es salaam station was 2 92 for δ18o and 13 11 for δd the volume weighted composition for the dodoma site could not be computed as the precipitation volume at the sampling time was not available the average isotopic composition in precipitation at dar es salaam a coastal site based on 11 observations in may the month of water sampling in the study area was 2 22 for δ18o and 0 69 for δd the dodoma site based on a single observation was more depleted than dar es salaam with the δ18o value of 3 48 the dodoma site probably as an inland site had the ocean inland distance influence its fractionation pfahl and sodemann 2014 generally the isotopic compositions showed relative depletion in the peak rainy season perhaps due to the amounts effects while relative enrichment was observed in the dry season historical data showed that the relative depletion in the rainy season and enrichment in dry seasons are long term seasonal patterns therefore the seasonal variations of the isotopic compositions implied that rainfed water sources such as the shallow wells and springs would have similar seasonal variations in their isotopic compositions the variations in deuterium and oxygen 18 have been applied to establish the water sources that replenish the aquifer and determine water origins groundwater flow dynamics and the interconnections with different sources jabal et al 2018 krishan et al 2019 maurya et al 2019 specifically the relative enrichment of δ18o and δd in samples indicate the extent of evaporation from water sources since lighter isotopes evaporate faster than heavy isotopes thus leaving the remaining water enriched with heavy isotopes akker et al 2011 kendall and doctor 2003 therefore the spread and clustering of the isotopic composition of the collected water samples fig 8 indicated the differences in evaporation of the original water source as shown fig 8 the lake water differed distinctly from the river springs and shallow well waters the deep boreholes specifically dw1 and dw3 laid between the lake and springs suggesting that they abstracted a mixture of lake water and recently recharged meteoric water the two other deep wells dw2 and dw4 which were distant from the lake at least 2 km away from the lakeshore had isotopic compositions close to that of the precipitation signifying they were mainly recharged from precipitation that did not undergo significant evaporation these results imply that the aquifers of these deep wells are in hydraulic connection with the local groundwater flow system where water has a short residence time or travel route the closeness of the isotopic composition of the spring rivers and shallow wells to the lmwl suggests their meteoric origin for example the water sample from the mrara river rv3 was significantly depleted in heavy isotopes like precipitation and plotted near the meteoric line it was therefore conclusive that the springs shallow wells and rivers were mainly driven by precipitation and less by the base flow chacha et al 2018 likewise reported similar isotopic compositions for springs in arusha tanzania and observed that the source of the flowing springs was linked to precipitation and its seasonal variation the ephemeral characteristics of the rivers and springs in the area further supported this observation in contrast river kiongozi rv2 had an isotopically enriched signature that laid between the lmwl and the lake babati isotopic signature this observation suggests that river kiongozi receives isotopically rich water from lake babati and runoff water furthermore the groundwater head contour map fig 8 drawn from water levels of shallow wells substantiated that groundwater flow from lake babati is in the northeast in the flow direction of river kiongozi lake babati water was enriched in both δ18o and δd and plotted below the lmwl with a regression line with a negative intercept of 0 48 and a slope of 4 89 compared to the lmwl s slope of 7 56 fig 8 the deviation from the lmwl was most likely due to the high temperature and excess evaporation which removed the lighter isotopes while concentrating the heavier ones in the lake akker et al 2011 however lake manyara about 60 km in the north and downstream of lake babati diverged from this with a distinctive isotopic signature and hydrogeochemistry despite being sampled simultaneously with this study the average ec of lake manyara based on two samples one in the lake middle and another at the northernmost lakeshore close to a river mouth was 2000 μs cm against lake babati s 527 μs cm the former probably due to its large size and low chance of mixing had spatially varying water chemistry and isotopic signature not shown with more depleted water δ18o deviation of 2 1 near the river input casanova and hillaire marcel 1992 similarly reported high spatial variability in lake manyara s hydrogeochemistry and isotopic composition which depended on the distance from the fluvial inputs lake manyara had higher ion concentrations than lake babati agreeing with the findings of ala aho et al 2013 that closed lakes in higher altitudes at the finnish rokua esker aquifer had lower solute tracer concentrations than flowing lakes in the lower altitudes the low salt concentration in lake babati gave credence to the notion that runoff and recently recharged groundwater seep into the lake the low solute concentration in recently recharged water was probably due to the short contact time with the rocks or short flow path of the local groundwater flow systems which characterise elevated catchments such as lake babati catchment toth 1963 the gradual decline of the lake level following seasonal variations might suggest that it receives substantial groundwater influx as indicated by the groundwater head contours fig 8 in the pyroclastic geological formation in the lake valley otherwise being shallow lake babati would rapidly dry out during prolonged droughts if it solely relied on precipitation and surface runoffs 4 2 3 deuterium excess variation against delta oxygen 18 δ18o the deuterium excess d excess is a useful second order isotope parameter for understanding moisture sources it provides information on the roles of diffusive transport in the atmospheric boundary layer and the effect of temperatures on fractionation pfahl and sodemann 2014 a plot of d excess against δ18o indicated a spread implying the variation in the water sources fig 9 the lake water clustered in a zone with enriched δ18o but very low deuterium excess indicating it experienced significant evaporation chacha et al 2018 pfahl and sodemann 2014 in contrast the clustering of shallow wells springs rivers and two deep wells dw2 and dw4 distant from the lake in a zone with high d excess but a depleted δ18o just like precipitation implied that they receive precipitation water before evaporation two deep wells dw1 and dw3 had a d excess intermediate to those of the lake water and precipitation suggesting that they are in hydraulic connection with the lake and abstract a mixture of recently recharged groundwater from precipitation and lake water enriched by evaporation similarly river kiongozi sample rv2 recorded a d excess of 6 9 and δ18o of 2 5 fig 9 closer to the d excess of lake babati 9 6 than any other river this suggests that it receives a portion of its baseflow from lake babati 4 2 4 lake water mixing lake babati although small shallow with occasional outflow and without the ability to turn exhibited variations in the isotopic composition both spatially and with depth fig 10 although the isotopic variations in depth were insignificant p 0 35 for δd and p 0 41 for δ18o the difference indicated that the lake is not well mixed the interpretation of the isotopic composition presented in fig 10 showed a slight fractionation gradient within the lake both at the surface and bottom the depletion at the southernmost lake boundary upstream closer to the inflowing streams was attributed to the dilution of the lake water by runoff the increase in enrichment downstream and northwards in the flow direction was probably due to the concentration of heavy isotopes by evaporation in addition as water moves downstream a reduction in dilution is possible since the lake only has small seasonal streams draining into those sections the enrichment at the lake s centre might be related to a higher evaporation intensity the concentration of enriched waters at the lake centre during seasons of low lake level and the reduced dilution effect from inflowing water the evidence of evaporation influencing the hydrogeochemistry at the lake s centre near locations of samples l4s and l3s further corroborated the uniqueness of the lake at this point it confirmed that the lake was not well mixed 5 conclusion the similarity of the isotopic and hydrogeochemical compositions of the deep wells with the lake water suggests that the lake recharges the deep wells in its neighbourhood while the shallow wells drain into the lake further the presence of nitrate in the deep wells attested that deeper aquifers receive both the lake water and the recently recharged water polluted with nitrate implying a hydraulic connection of the deep wells with the lake on the other hand the lake was not well mixed possibly because of differential dilution by runoff evaporation enrichment at the lake surface and the minimal wind mixing effect on the shallow lake the hydrogeochemical and isotopic composition of the shallow wells showed an affinity with the springs and crater water signifying that they originate from rainfall and runoff sources on the other hand the deep wells were characterised by the carbonate and sulphate salts of calcium and magnesium whose sources are rocks that probably dissolved as water travelled the high salt concentration in the deep wells indicated they extract a portion of water with a long residence time mixed with the recently recharged water from the local groundwater flow systems the year round flow characteristics of the kiongozi river are probably due to the groundwater flux baseflow contribution from lake babati the similarity of the isotopic signature of this river with the deep wells in the lake neighbourhood and the groundwater suggests its hydraulic connection to the groundwater flow systems of lake babati such a connection demonstrates a high likelihood of impacting the surface water while abstracting groundwater at unsustainable rates therefore implementation of integrated water resources management is required for sustainable water resources development and management further the abstractions of the groundwater systems must be limited to the safe yields of the aquifer determined and informed through pumping tests and continuous monitoring of the groundwater levels for timely remediation efforts whereas this study demonstrates the feasibility of employing numerous methods in dealing with ungauged and data scarce catchments we recommend validation of its findings using insitu instrumental measurements of seepage and fluxes additionally a detailed 3 d modelling of integrated surface water groundwater system is recommended to quantify the exchange of fluxes and offer more insights into the interdependence of the surface water and

11693,sagar a district in central india hosts a large population of people dependent on groundwater without further purification for their daily needs however water borne diseases primarily kidney stones are prevalent in this district therefore we collected a large number of drinking water samples 227 in both pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons by dividing the entire area into 6 6 km2 grids a total of 19 drinking water quality parameters were assessed and analyzed for each sample and compared with the bureau of indian standards bis 2012 is 10500 the correlation coefficients of total dissolved solids tds electrical conductivity and salinity were found to align perfectly with the correlation coefficients of total hardness calcium hardness and magnesium hardness similarly the total alkalinity and phenolphthalein alkalinity were correlated with bicarbonate and carbonate ion concentrations respectively ion selective electrodes ise uv vis spectrophotometer and volumetric methods were used for the analyses the water quality was found to be mainly influenced by geological factors which play an important role in controlling hardness tds and chloride and sulfate ion concentrations the water quality index indicates that about 89 of the samples were in good condition however total hardness th and nitrate ion concentration were the issues at large geological analysis was performed using arcgis 10 0 to mark the spatiality of drinking water quality through distribution maps which revealed that the predominance of permeable calcium rich rocks is the prime reasons behind the water hardness graphical abstract image 1 keywords water quality parameter principle component analysis factor analysis water quality index cluster analysis geospatial analysis data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction water is vital to life and ecosystem the availability and quality of surface water get highly affected by anthropogenic activities and environmental factors at the same time the high percentage of groundwater availability low risk of environmental pollution and improved supply make groundwater a great hope for the sustainable development however the upward pace of development and excessive use of groundwater is rapidly contaminating it that harm aquatic life economic development and social welfare panghal et al 2021 absametov et al 2023 kumar and sangeetha 2020 water borne diseases annually kill around 3 4 million people mainly children kale et al 2021 singhal et al 2020 khatri et al 2020 and therefore drinking water quality has become a serious global concern in recent years kharake and raut 2021 yadav et al 2020 sagar is a water scarce district of central india with a population of 2 38 million of whom 70 2 live in rural areas as of 2011 census the vast majority of this population uses untreated groundwater recently a local newspaper dainik bhaskar dated may 21 2022 highlighted that on an average 250 stone patients are diagnosed per month at bundelkhand medical college sagar due to the use of hard water in the area supplementary fig s1 although this observation and the reason behind it still needs extensive research the analysis of groundwater quality is definitely of utmost importance residents of sagar are heavily dependent on groundwater but we found a limited number of research papers on groundwater quality in sagar district for example jhariya et al 2012 jhariya 2014 investigated the groundwater quality of sagar city and nearby villages with a comparatively small number of sample size 37 reported nitrate pollution in the area pathak 2020 surveyed only 15 stations at sagar city analyzed ten parameters per sample and concluded most of the water quality parameters were under who acceptable limit pathak 2013 worked on rajghat reservoir of sagar collected and analyzed 05 samples and predicted about the variability in drinking water quality in three seasons pre monsoon monsoon and post monsoon seasons in the available literature the number of samples and the analyzed parameters are too small to draw any conclusion so we started our work with the aim to investigate total and area wise groundwater quality of sagar district with a bigger sample size 227 and analyzed parameters 19 for both in pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons analysis of groundwater quality factors affecting them and the origin behind these factors are important objectives of this study which can help policy makers and users for present and future prospects to summarize and draw conclusions on water quality parameters from around 8500 data set we have used statistical analysis such as principle component analysis pca water quality index wqi and geographic information system gis 2 study area

southwest narsinghpur district to the southeast vidisha district to the northwest and damoh district to the east 3 materials and methods drinking water sampling collection and analysis were performed according to standard protocols kale et al 2020 the grid map in 6 6 km2 grid of sagar district was prepared by sysglob software solution pvt ltd and finalized the collection of 227 drinking water samples one sample was taken from each grid in both pre monsoon march 2019 to june 2019 and post monsoon november 2019 to january 2020 seasons nine in situ parameters color odor ph temperature tds ec salinity orp and do were obtained at the sampling site using a multiparameter hannah hi 98194 primary data were obtained using an interview schedule to learn about water use behaviour the physical appearance and odor of the water samples were used to assess color and odor respectively ex situ parameters were examined using american public health association apha recommended procedures apha 2005 total alkalinity ta and total hardness th of the samples were determined titrimetrically on the same day as collection an ion selective electrode hanna hi 3222 was used to calculate the fluoride ion concentration whereas vollhard s method was used to calculate the chloride ion concentration a single beam spectrophotometer rigol ultra 3660 measured nitrate sulfate and phosphate ion concentrations for the detailed experimental procedures see supplementary information s i 1 statistical analysis such as descriptive statistics correlation coefficient matrix and pca were operated on the 227 samples the statistical software ibm statistical package for social sciences spss version 26 0 was used to statistically analyze the data in addition ca was performed using ibm spss and geospatial analysis was performed using arc gis 10 0 3 1 calculations 3 1 1 water quality index the water quality data of the tested samples was compared with the prescribed drinking water standard of bis 2012 is 10500 to determine the suitability for drinking water quality the indian standards is as per indian standards institute were used to provide status for drinking water and building different categories three steps were followed in the first step each parameter tds ph th do fluoride chloride nitrate sulfate bicarbonate calcium and magnesium is assigned a weight w i which indicates relative importance to the overall drinking water quality i the maximum weighting assigned to the parameters was 5 due to their major importance in the assessment of drinking water quality the parameters were given a minimum weight of 2 based on their importance such as the weight of do in groundwater quality assessment batabyal and chakraborty 2015 using equation 1 relative weight w i was calculated in the second step 1 w i ω i i 1 n ω i w i denotes the relative weight w i represents the parameter weight and n is the total number of parameters in step 2 a quality rating scale q i was calculated for each parameter which is the ratio of the concentration of the physicochemical parameter with respect of its standard value as specified in bis 2012 is 10500 in a scale of 100 2 q i c i s i 100 here q i is the rating of water quality for the ith parameter c i is the concentration mg l of each parameter of the water samples and s i is the value of the maximum permissible limit as per the bis for each chemical parameter in mg l in step 3 si for each chemical variable was determined using equation 3 and the wqi was calculated using equation 4 3 s i i w i q i 4 w q i i n s i i where si i is the subindex and n is the total number of parameters used for determining wqi 3 1 2 geospatial analysis of the groundwater quality parameters of the sagar district spatial distribution with gis was used to interpret data for a particular physiochemical parameter over a geographic area it helps in evaluating distributional trends spatial patterns flow patterns and spatial relationships among others in the present study the spatial data of water quality were interpolated using the inverse distance weight interpolation method based on the distance weight where the weight is transmitted from the known measured location to the data of the unknown point the spatial distribution of water quality parameters was analyzed using equation 5 on arcgis software version 10 0 5 i x 0 i 1 n x i h i j β i 1 n 1

discussion 4 1 descriptive statistics of the physiochemical parameters descriptive statistics of the physico chemical parameters obtained from the analysis of all drinking water samples are shown in table 1 and the ionic parameters are depicted graphically in figs 2 and 3 other parameters are graphically shown between supplementary figs s2 s5 their numerical indices are presented in tables s1 and s2 most of the physico chemical parameters of the drinking water were found to be under the bis limits as can be concluded from table 1 for example only 3 6 of the samples had ph values outside the bis range 6 5 8 5 and the maximum observed ph was 9 55 meanwhile 23 of the tds values in the pre monsoon season and 9 in the post monsoon season were above the bis limit 500 ppm and 1469 ppm was the maximum observed tds value in addition fluoride ion concentration in 1 14 of the samples exceeded the bis limit of 1 0 ppm and the maximum observed value was 10 5 ppm only 4 10 of the samples have chloride ion concentration above the bis limit of 250 ppm and the maximum observed value for this parameter was 660 ppm ta values were found above bis limit 200 ppm in 21 samples in pre monsoon season and 31 in post monsoon season however the major issue was observed with the nitrate ion concentrations and th in the sagar district only 66 68 of the samples were found to have nitrate ion concentrations under the specified bis limit meanwhile only 30 53 of the samples had th values under the specified bis limit 200 ppm high standard deviations of some water quality parameters were attributed to discharge of untreated effluents into water bodies ravi shankar and mohan 2005 human activities without proper surface treatment and excessive use of fertilizers in agriculture among other factors ravi shankar and mohan 2005 aher and deshpande 2011 4 2 correlation coefficient matrix for this study a correlation matrix of 20 variables is presented in table 2 a and table 2 b for the pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons the parameters are called correlated if the alignment of the data matches above 50 correlation coefficient above 0 5 in our analysis the correlation coefficients of tds ec salinity and chloride and sulfate ion concentrations matched completely in the sagar district and were also found to be aligned with the correlation coefficients of th calcium hardness cah and magnesium hardness mgh similarly ta was found to be correlated with the bicarbonate ion concentration and phenolphthalein alkalinity phalk was found to correlate well with the carbonate ion concentration and ph 4 3 principle component analysis the components most widely affecting the water quality are determined by pca pca achieves data compression and establishes natural connections between samples or variables yang et al 2016 it has been found useful in pollution studies and water management processes shrestha and kazama 2007 vega et al 1998 brumelis et al 2000 they are also used to detect fluctuations in water quality due to geological and anthropogenic causes helena et al 2000 pca uses linear combinations of the original variables to convert them into new but uncorrelated variables axes called principal components pcs sapkota et al 2021 kale et al 2020 this is done on the full data set after data reduction in order to summarize statistical associations between physico chemical components with the least chance of data loss the kaiser meyer olkin kmo values in the present study were 0 70 in the pre monsoon season and 0 76 in the post monsoon season table 3 the nature of the correlation matrix was determined by performing bartlett s test of sphericity in this investigation the significance level was 0 00 0 05 which rejected the null hypothesis and confirmed good correlation between the parameters in both pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons finally the factors are maximized using varimax rotation and then principle factors were obtained using kaiser s principle roy et al 2021 the scree plots extracted for the two seasons are shown in fig 4 the scree plot shows the variation in percentage between different components and explains the reason behind the extraction of different pcs table 4 a and table 4 b show the respective rotation component matrices of the pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons hamzah et al 2017 4 4 factor analysis fa provides a meaningful combination of components factors that can be attributed to the cause of the observation pca extracts significant pcs from the normalized variables and minimizes the input of variables with small importance by applying varimax rotation the pcs create factors the most common use of fa is in minimizing the number of variables and categorizing variables by discovering structures in the interactions between variables pejman et al 2009 in our experiment fa was conducted on 19 parameters from 227 sampling sites it can be observed that the cumulative extractions of the squared loadings were 73 35 and 75 74 in the pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons respectively which are shown in the rotated component matrix in tables 4a and 4b the factor loadings were then classified as strong loading value 0 75 moderate loading value 0 75 0 50 and weak loadings loading value 0 50 0 30 components with loading values greater than 0 5 we considered in our experiment singh et al 2013 hence only the first five components in the pre monsoon season and the first six components in the post monsoon season were obtained which were rotated according to the orthogonal varimax method the respective loading in pre monsoon season was 40 07 by pc1 11 11 by pc2 7 98 by pc3 7 78 by pc4 and 6 38 by pc5 whereas in the post monsoon season it was 32 55 by pc1 14 06 by pc2 9 92 by pc3 7 69 by pc4 5 83 by pc5 and 5 66 by pc6 pc1 with the total variance of 40 07 highlights the strong positive loadings of tds 0 979 ec 0 979 salinity 0 979 chloride ion concentration 0 793 sulfate ion concentration 0 608 th 0 970 cah 0 953 mgh 0 932 ta 0 792 and bicarbonate ion concentration 0 789 in the post monsoon season pc1 showed 32 55 of the total variance exhibiting strong positive loadings of tds 0 950 ec 0 950 salinity 0 948 chloride ion concentration 0 707 sulfate ion concentration 0 684 th 0 902 cah 0 832 and mgh 0 805 the strong correlation was found between tds and th for pc1 with r 0 980 which is clearly generated due to dolomite and calcite rock water interaction shown in table 2a in pc1 dissolved salts of cah chloride sulfate and bicarbonate in the pre monsoon season and cah chloride and sulfate in the post monsoon season had the greatest impact on the water quality pc2 explained about 11 of the total variation in the pre monsoon season and about 14 in the post monsoon season where the pre monsoon season had a stronger influence of ph phalk and carbonate ion concentrations in the post monsoon season ph carbonate ion concentration phalk and fluoride ion concentration are positively correlated whereas nitrate ion concentration is negatively correlated with them thus pc2 represents physical aspects related to the acidic or basic nature of water pc3 contributed only 8 and 10 of the total variation in the pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons respectively in the pre monsoon season strong positive coefficients were found for nitrate and phosphate ion concentrations and slight negative coefficients for ph and fluoride ion concentrations in the post monsoon season pc3 showed a positive relationship between ta and bicarbonate ion concentration this agrees with the results obtained for in tables 2a and 2b this component is caused by the dissolution of minerals from the rock due to variation in ph and can be termed as ph effect pc4 explained 7 8 of the variation which is loaded with do and orp in the pre monsoon season this was due to redox processes in the post monsoon season the groundwater level dwl is negatively loaded with do in pc5 6 3 in pre monsoon and 5 8 in the post monsoon dwl and temp were positively correlated in the pre monsoon season in the post monsoon season orp was positively loaded meanwhile pc6 was found only in the post monsoon season and explained 5 66 of the variance with phosphate positive loading fig 5 shows a three dimensional plot of the pca loading values 4 5 cluster analysis ca ca is a multivariate techniques that group objects based on their characteristics it provides a summary of the intra relationships between various parameters which can provide a better understanding of the key factors pejman et al 2009 ward s method was chosen for clustering in this study because it uses more information and has much less space distorting effect helena et al 1999 hierarchical group clustering was performed on normalized data of zero mean and unit variance using squared euclidean distance as measures of similarity when ca was applied on the obtained data of various physico chemical parameters of sagar districts in pre monsoon season it divided the parameters into three groups i e clusters cluster i included phalk do ph temp orp ta mgh cah dwl as well as phosphate fluoride carbonate nitrate sulfate bicarbonate and chloride ion concentrations tds salinity and th were included in cluster ii cluster iii comprised only ec fig 6 a in the post monsoon season the physicochemical parameters were also divided into three main groups cluster i included tds salinity ta bicarbonate ion concentration cah th and dwl cluster ii included the fluoride phosphate carbonate nitrate chloride and sulfate ion concentrations phalk ph do temp orp and mgh finally cluster iii contained only ec fig 6b the cluster results indicate that different factors are responsible for the transformation of water quality in pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons in sagar district these also indicate that ec tds salinity th cah and mgh are closely related and may be affected by the same factor s meanwhile ph fluoride carbonate ion concentrations phalk and orp were clustered together and probably originated from a similar source garg 2018 4 6 water quality index wqi the water quality index wqi is used to integrate multiple parameters into a single numerical dimensionless value that provides the public with a general overview of water quality however the technology does not claim to grade water quality as the output comes in numbers and does not specify the various water quality variables the weights and relative weights of each parameter for the determination of wqi are summarized in table 5 the wqi values thus obtained were then divided into five categories and are presented in table 6 grade a is assigned a wqi 0 50 and represents excellent water quality grade b is assigned wqi values of 50 100 and represents good water quality meanwhile grade c with a wqi value of 100 200 represents poor quality grade d represents very poor water quality and is associated with wqi values of 200 300 finally grade e is assigned to wqi values above 300 where the water quality is unsuitable for drinking purposes mahmud et al 2020 a graph between the wqi range and the percentage of samples falling in that range is shown in fig 7 for both pre monsoon and post monsoon wqi of sagar district was calculated using various physico chemical parameters and compared with bis standard the wqi values are shown in fig 6 which indicates that 20 31 of the samples in sagar district were in excellent condition 66 69 were in good condition and only 3 11 were in poor condition therefore it can be concluded that most of the samples are safe for drinking purposes tiwari et al 2014 4 7 geospatial analysis of the groundwater 4 7 1 geospatial analysis for tds the high amount of tds in sagar district could be due to several reasons firstly the distribution of tds in sagar district is linked to its lithology land use and amount of rainfall dissolution of minerals in water is the basic reason behind high tds values the sedimentary deposits of the river with high concentrations of calcium potassium nitrate sulfate and fluoride are also responsible for the high tds concentration meanwhile low water content in the aquifer is also responsible for high tds in some of the pre monsoon season samples about 23 samples had tds value above the permissible limit high water rock contact with limestone and shale was found at khimlasha maharajpur kishanpura and umra fig 8 and supplementary information s i 2 in khurai malthone rahatgarh and deori areas the tds value of water increases due to use of relatively higher amount of fertilizers during agricultural practices whereas intensive farming practices and intensive tillage were found to be responsible for higher tds values in the post monsoon season significant difference was observed in tds values in pre monsoon and post monsoon season especially in bina deori gadhakota and rehli areas this was probably due to the lower relief elevation of rehli gadhakota deori and bina tehsils as compared to sagar rahatgarh banda and kesli tehsils supplementary fig s8 soil erosion occurs during rains which deposits minerals in low elevation areas dissolved minerals in water move from high to low altitude and increase the tds content of groundwater in low altitude areas 4 7 2 geospatial analysis for th and cah the th of water is associated with its dissolved calcium and magnesium ions from rocks and soils fig 8 and supplementary information s i 2 infiltration properties ion exchange capabilities and weathering of rocks contribute to the dissolution of calcium and magnesium ions in water sagar has calcium and magnesium containing rocks such as silicate dolomite and calcite therefore the groundwater in this zone is relatively hard in addition high th values of water at rehli deori khurai and malthone are a result of intensive agricultural practices and use of ammonia meanwhile calcium ions in groundwater may occur mainly through the dissolution of ca rich minerals in aquifers the lithology of sagar district is dominated by intertrappean and infratrappean formations of igneous and sedimentary rocks thus the high concentration of cah in the pebble horizon infiltrated the groundwater in addition intensive agricultural practices are also responsible for high concentrations of cah in water ahada and suthar 2018a 4 7 3 geospatial analysis for the nitrate ion concentration anthropogenic activities are the primary reason for the high nitrate ion concentration in the waters of sagar district fig 8 nitrogen enters groundwater primarily through various surface sources such as the widespread use of chemical fertilizers animal waste disposal and surface irrigation of nitrate enriched groundwater cropping pattern significantly affects the consumption of fertilizers for example wheat requires high amounts of nitrogen based fertilizers as does madhya pradesh a major wheat producer the widespread use of synthetic fertilizers to increase crop yields can have negative effects on groundwater quality the widespread use of chemical fertilizers containing urea diammonium phosphate ammonium nitrate sodium nitrate potassium nitrate calcium ammonium nitrate and nitrate concentrates increases the nitrate ion concentration of water because nitrate has high solubility and low retention in water also high nitrate amounts in shallow groundwater could be governed by pumping return flow cycles in semiarid regions climate and granite are minor sources of nitrate as in the case of the bedrock of the sagar district ahada and suthar 2018b geospatial plots other than those for tds th cah and nitrate ion concentrations are shown in supplementary figs s9 and s10 the geospatial analysis for wqi is shown in supplementary fig s11 5 estimated health risk high tds th and nitrate ion concentration are the major threats in sagar district high tds value in itself is not harmful only individual ions may have toxic roles large kidney patients in sagar district may or may not have a direct correlation with high th or cah levels as far as stone formation in the human body is concerned the quantity of water is more important than the quality of water consumed the lower the intake the more likely stone formation marangella et al 1996 combined food and water habits lead to more calculus as suggested by bellizzi et al 1999 and churchill et al 1978 therefore the possibility of stone disease with high calcium content in drinking water quality cannot be ruled out rising nitrate ion concentrations due to excessive use of fertilizers may be a major threat in the near future and there may be a risk for thyroid dysfunction gatseva et al 2008 nitrate ion is reduced to nitrite ion in the lower intestine and causes a disease called blue baby or methemoglobinemia karne and kulkarni 2009 with the use of high fertilizers the danger will increase by the day especially when farmers intend to increase agricultural productivity in this water stressed region 6 conclusion drinking water quality was assessed in sagar district of madhya pradesh india in both pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons of 2019 2020 with the entire location divided into 227 isolated points inspection of the correlation matrix of the analyzed variables showed the existence of strong correlations between variables such as ec tds salinity th

11693,sagar a district in central india hosts a large population of people dependent on groundwater without further purification for their daily needs however water borne diseases primarily kidney stones are prevalent in this district therefore we collected a large number of drinking water samples 227 in both pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons by dividing the entire area into 6 6 km2 grids a total of 19 drinking water quality parameters were assessed and analyzed for each sample and compared with the bureau of indian standards bis 2012 is 10500 the correlation coefficients of total dissolved solids tds electrical conductivity and salinity were found to align perfectly with the correlation coefficients of total hardness calcium hardness and magnesium hardness similarly the total alkalinity and phenolphthalein alkalinity were correlated with bicarbonate and carbonate ion concentrations respectively ion selective electrodes ise uv vis spectrophotometer and volumetric methods were used for the analyses the water quality was found to be mainly influenced by geological factors which play an important role in controlling hardness tds and chloride and sulfate ion concentrations the water quality index indicates that about 89 of the samples were in good condition however total hardness th and nitrate ion concentration were the issues at large geological analysis was performed using arcgis 10 0 to mark the spatiality of drinking water quality through distribution maps which revealed that the predominance of permeable calcium rich rocks is the prime reasons behind the water hardness graphical abstract image 1 keywords water quality parameter principle component analysis factor analysis water quality index cluster analysis geospatial analysis data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction water is vital to life and ecosystem the availability and quality of surface water get highly affected by anthropogenic activities and environmental factors at the same time the high percentage of groundwater availability low risk of environmental pollution and improved supply make groundwater a great hope for the sustainable development however the upward pace of development and excessive use of groundwater is rapidly contaminating it that harm aquatic life economic development and social welfare panghal et al 2021 absametov et al 2023 kumar and sangeetha 2020 water borne diseases annually kill around 3 4 million people mainly children kale et al 2021 singhal et al 2020 khatri et al 2020 and therefore drinking water quality has become a serious global concern in recent years kharake and raut 2021 yadav et al 2020 sagar is a water scarce district of central india with a population of 2 38 million of whom 70 2 live in rural areas as of 2011 census the vast majority of this population uses untreated groundwater recently a local newspaper dainik bhaskar dated may 21 2022 highlighted that on an average 250 stone patients are diagnosed per month at bundelkhand medical college sagar due to the use of hard water in the area supplementary fig s1 although this observation and the reason behind it still needs extensive research the analysis of groundwater quality is definitely of utmost importance residents of sagar are heavily dependent on groundwater but we found a limited number of research papers on groundwater quality in sagar district for example jhariya et al 2012 jhariya 2014 investigated the groundwater quality of sagar city and nearby villages with a comparatively small number of sample size 37 reported nitrate pollution in the area pathak 2020 surveyed only 15 stations at sagar city analyzed ten parameters per sample and concluded most of the water quality parameters were under who acceptable limit pathak 2013 worked on rajghat reservoir of sagar collected and analyzed 05 samples and predicted about the variability in drinking water quality in three seasons pre monsoon monsoon and post monsoon seasons in the available literature the number of samples and the analyzed parameters are too small to draw any conclusion so we started our work with the aim to investigate total and area wise groundwater quality of sagar district with a bigger sample size 227 and analyzed parameters 19 for both in pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons analysis of groundwater quality factors affecting them and the origin behind these factors are important objectives of this study which can help policy makers and users for present and future prospects to summarize and draw conclusions on water quality parameters from around 8500 data set we have used statistical analysis such as principle component analysis pca water quality index wqi and geographic information system gis 2 study area

according to standard protocols kale et al 2020 the grid map in 6 6 km2 grid of sagar district was prepared by sysglob software solution pvt ltd and finalized the collection of 227 drinking water samples one sample was taken from each grid in both pre monsoon march 2019 to june 2019 and post monsoon november 2019 to january 2020 seasons nine in situ parameters color odor ph temperature tds ec salinity orp and do were obtained at the sampling site using a multiparameter hannah hi 98194 primary data were obtained using an interview schedule to learn about water use behaviour the physical appearance and odor of the water samples were used to assess color and odor respectively ex situ parameters were examined using american public health association apha recommended procedures apha 2005 total alkalinity ta and total hardness th of the samples were determined titrimetrically on the same day as collection an ion selective electrode hanna hi 3222 was used to calculate the fluoride ion concentration whereas vollhard s method was used to calculate the chloride ion concentration a single beam spectrophotometer rigol ultra 3660 measured nitrate sulfate and phosphate ion concentrations for the detailed experimental procedures see supplementary information s i 1 statistical analysis such as descriptive statistics correlation coefficient matrix and pca were operated on the 227 samples the statistical software ibm statistical package for social sciences spss version 26 0 was used to statistically analyze the data in addition ca was performed using ibm spss and geospatial analysis was performed using arc gis 10 0 3 1 calculations 3 1 1 water quality index the water quality data of the tested samples was compared with the prescribed drinking water standard of bis 2012 is 10500 to determine the suitability for drinking water quality the indian standards is as per indian standards institute were used to provide status for drinking water and building different categories three steps were followed in the first step each parameter tds ph th do fluoride chloride nitrate sulfate bicarbonate calcium and magnesium is assigned a weight w i which indicates relative importance to the overall drinking water quality i the maximum weighting assigned to the parameters was 5 due to their major importance in the assessment of drinking water quality the parameters were given a minimum weight of 2 based on their importance such as the weight of do in groundwater quality assessment batabyal and chakraborty 2015 using equation 1 relative weight w i was calculated in the second step 1 w i ω i i 1 n ω i w i denotes the relative weight w i represents the parameter weight and n is the total number of parameters in step 2 a quality rating scale q i was calculated for each parameter which is the ratio of the concentration of the physicochemical parameter with respect of its standard value as specified in bis 2012 is 10500 in a scale of 100 2 q i c i s i 100 here q i is the rating of water quality for the ith parameter c i is the concentration mg l of each parameter of the water samples and s i is the value of the maximum permissible limit as per the bis for each chemical parameter in mg l in step 3 si for each chemical variable was determined using equation 3 and the wqi was calculated using equation 4 3 s i i w i q i 4 w q i i n s i i where si i is the subindex and n is the total number of parameters used for determining wqi 3 1 2 geospatial analysis of the groundwater quality parameters of the sagar district spatial distribution with gis was used to interpret data for a particular physiochemical parameter over a geographic area it helps in evaluating distributional trends spatial patterns flow patterns and spatial relationships among others in the present study the spatial data of water quality were interpolated using the inverse distance weight interpolation method based on the distance weight where the weight is transmitted from the known measured location to the data of the unknown point the spatial distribution of water quality parameters was analyzed using equation 5 on arcgis software version 10 0 5 i x 0 i 1 n x i h i j β i 1 n 1

discussion 4 1 descriptive statistics of the physiochemical parameters descriptive statistics of the physico chemical parameters obtained from the analysis of all drinking water samples are shown in table 1 and the ionic parameters are depicted graphically in figs 2 and 3 other parameters are graphically shown between supplementary figs s2 s5 their numerical indices are presented in tables s1 and s2 most of the physico chemical parameters of the drinking water were found to be under the bis limits as can be concluded from table 1 for example only 3 6 of the samples had ph values outside the bis range 6 5 8 5 and the maximum observed ph was 9 55 meanwhile 23 of the tds values in the pre monsoon season and 9 in the post monsoon season were above the bis limit 500 ppm and 1469 ppm was the maximum observed tds value in addition fluoride ion concentration in 1 14 of the samples exceeded the bis limit of 1 0 ppm and the maximum observed value was 10 5 ppm only 4 10 of the samples have chloride ion concentration above the bis limit of 250 ppm and the maximum observed value for this parameter was 660 ppm ta values were found above bis limit 200 ppm in 21 samples in pre monsoon season and 31 in post monsoon season however the major issue was observed with the nitrate ion concentrations and th in the sagar district only 66 68 of the samples were found to have nitrate ion concentrations under the specified bis limit meanwhile only 30 53 of the samples had th values under the specified bis limit 200 ppm high standard deviations of some water quality parameters were attributed to discharge of untreated effluents into water bodies ravi shankar and mohan 2005 human activities without proper surface treatment and excessive use of fertilizers in agriculture among other factors ravi shankar and mohan 2005 aher and deshpande 2011 4 2 correlation coefficient matrix for this study a correlation matrix of 20 variables is presented in table 2 a and table 2 b for the pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons the parameters are called correlated if the alignment of the data matches above 50 correlation coefficient above 0 5 in our analysis the correlation coefficients of tds ec salinity and chloride and sulfate ion concentrations matched completely in the sagar district and were also found to be aligned with the correlation coefficients of th calcium hardness cah and magnesium hardness mgh similarly ta was found to be correlated with the bicarbonate ion concentration and phenolphthalein alkalinity phalk was found to correlate well with the carbonate ion concentration and ph 4 3 principle component analysis the components most widely affecting the water quality are determined by pca pca achieves data compression and establishes natural connections between samples or variables yang et al 2016 it has been found useful in pollution studies and water management processes shrestha and kazama 2007 vega et al 1998 brumelis et al 2000 they are also used to detect fluctuations in water quality due to geological and anthropogenic causes helena et al 2000 pca uses linear combinations of the original variables to convert them into new but uncorrelated variables axes called principal components pcs sapkota et al 2021 kale et al 2020 this is done on the full data set after data reduction in order to summarize statistical associations between physico chemical components with the least chance of data loss the kaiser meyer olkin kmo values in the present study were 0 70 in the pre monsoon season and 0 76 in the post monsoon season table 3 the nature of the correlation matrix was determined by performing bartlett s test of sphericity in this investigation the significance level was 0 00 0 05 which rejected the null hypothesis and confirmed good correlation between the parameters in both pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons finally the factors are maximized using varimax rotation and then principle factors were obtained using kaiser s principle roy et al 2021 the scree plots extracted for the two seasons are shown in fig 4 the scree plot shows the variation in percentage between different components and explains the reason behind the extraction of different pcs table 4 a and table 4 b show the respective rotation component matrices of the pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons hamzah et al 2017 4 4 factor analysis fa provides a meaningful combination of components factors that can be attributed to the cause of the observation pca extracts significant pcs from the normalized variables and minimizes the input of variables with small importance by applying varimax rotation the pcs create factors the most common use of fa is in minimizing the number of variables and categorizing variables by discovering structures in the interactions between variables pejman et al 2009 in our experiment fa was conducted on 19 parameters from 227 sampling sites it can be observed that the cumulative extractions of the squared loadings were 73 35 and 75 74 in the pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons respectively which are shown in the rotated component matrix in tables 4a and 4b the factor loadings were then classified as strong loading value 0 75 moderate loading value 0 75 0 50 and weak loadings loading value 0 50 0 30 components with loading values greater than 0 5 we considered in our experiment singh et al 2013 hence only the first five components in the pre monsoon season and the first six components in the post monsoon season were obtained which were rotated according to the orthogonal varimax method the respective loading in pre monsoon season was 40 07 by pc1 11 11 by pc2 7 98 by pc3 7 78 by pc4 and 6 38 by pc5 whereas in the post monsoon season it was 32 55 by pc1 14 06 by pc2 9 92 by pc3 7 69 by pc4 5 83 by pc5 and 5 66 by pc6 pc1 with the total variance of 40 07 highlights the strong positive loadings of tds 0 979 ec 0 979 salinity 0 979 chloride ion concentration 0 793 sulfate ion concentration 0 608 th 0 970 cah 0 953 mgh 0 932 ta 0 792 and bicarbonate ion concentration 0 789 in the post monsoon season pc1 showed 32 55 of the total variance exhibiting strong positive loadings of tds 0 950 ec 0 950 salinity 0 948 chloride ion concentration 0 707 sulfate ion concentration 0 684 th 0 902 cah 0 832 and mgh 0 805 the strong correlation was found between tds and th for pc1 with r 0 980 which is clearly generated due to dolomite and calcite rock water interaction shown in table 2a in pc1 dissolved salts of cah chloride sulfate and bicarbonate in the pre monsoon season and cah chloride and sulfate in the post monsoon season had the greatest impact on the water quality pc2 explained about 11 of the total variation in the pre monsoon season and about 14 in the post monsoon season where the pre monsoon season had a stronger influence of ph phalk and carbonate ion concentrations in the post monsoon season ph carbonate ion concentration phalk and fluoride ion concentration are positively correlated whereas nitrate ion concentration is negatively correlated with them thus pc2 represents physical aspects related to the acidic or basic nature of water pc3 contributed only 8 and 10 of the total variation in the pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons respectively in the pre monsoon season strong positive coefficients were found for nitrate and phosphate ion concentrations and slight negative coefficients for ph and fluoride ion concentrations in the post monsoon season pc3 showed a positive relationship between ta and bicarbonate ion concentration this agrees with the results obtained for in tables 2a and 2b this component is caused by the dissolution of minerals from the rock due to variation in ph and can be termed as ph effect pc4 explained 7 8 of the variation which is loaded with do and orp in the pre monsoon season this was due to redox processes in the post monsoon season the groundwater level dwl is negatively loaded with do in pc5 6 3 in pre monsoon and 5 8 in the post monsoon dwl and temp were positively correlated in the pre monsoon season in the post monsoon season orp was positively loaded meanwhile pc6 was found only in the post monsoon season and explained 5 66 of the variance with phosphate positive loading fig 5 shows a three dimensional plot of the pca loading values 4 5 cluster analysis ca ca is a multivariate techniques that group objects based on their characteristics it provides a summary of the intra relationships between various parameters which can provide a better understanding of the key factors pejman et al 2009 ward s method was chosen for clustering in this study because it uses more information and has much less space distorting effect helena et al 1999 hierarchical group clustering was performed on normalized data of zero mean and unit variance using squared euclidean distance as measures of similarity when ca was applied on the obtained data of various physico chemical parameters of sagar districts in pre monsoon season it divided the parameters into three groups i e clusters cluster i included phalk do ph temp orp ta mgh cah dwl as well as phosphate fluoride carbonate nitrate sulfate bicarbonate and chloride ion concentrations tds salinity and th were included in cluster ii cluster iii comprised only ec fig 6 a in the post monsoon season the physicochemical parameters were also divided into three main groups cluster i included tds salinity ta bicarbonate ion concentration cah th and dwl cluster ii included the fluoride phosphate carbonate nitrate chloride and sulfate ion concentrations phalk ph do temp orp and mgh finally cluster iii contained only ec fig 6b the cluster results indicate that different factors are responsible for the transformation of water quality in pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons in sagar district these also indicate that ec tds salinity th cah and mgh are closely related and may be affected by the same factor s meanwhile ph fluoride carbonate ion concentrations phalk and orp were clustered together and probably originated from a similar source garg 2018 4 6 water quality index wqi the water quality index wqi is used to integrate multiple parameters into a single numerical dimensionless value that provides the public with a general overview of water quality however the technology does not claim to grade water quality as the output comes in numbers and does not specify the various water quality variables the weights and relative weights of each parameter for the determination of wqi are summarized in table 5 the wqi values thus obtained were then divided into five categories and are presented in table 6 grade a is assigned a wqi 0 50 and represents excellent water quality grade b is assigned wqi values of 50 100 and represents good water quality meanwhile grade c with a wqi value of 100 200 represents poor quality grade d represents very poor water quality and is associated with wqi values of 200 300 finally grade e is assigned to wqi values above 300 where the water quality is unsuitable for drinking purposes mahmud et al 2020 a graph between the wqi range and the percentage of samples falling in that range is shown in fig 7 for both pre monsoon and post monsoon wqi of sagar district was calculated using various physico chemical parameters and compared with bis standard the wqi values are shown in fig 6 which indicates that 20 31 of the samples in sagar district were in excellent condition 66 69 were in good condition and only 3 11 were in poor condition therefore it can be concluded that most of the samples are safe for drinking purposes tiwari et al 2014 4 7 geospatial analysis of the groundwater 4 7 1 geospatial analysis for tds the high amount of tds in sagar district could be due to several reasons firstly the distribution of tds in sagar district is linked to its lithology land use and amount of rainfall dissolution of minerals in water is the basic reason behind high tds values the sedimentary deposits of the river with high concentrations of calcium potassium nitrate sulfate and fluoride are also responsible for the high tds concentration meanwhile low water content in the aquifer is also responsible for high tds in some of the pre monsoon season samples about 23 samples had tds value above the permissible limit high water rock contact with limestone and shale was found at khimlasha maharajpur kishanpura and umra fig 8 and supplementary information s i 2 in khurai malthone rahatgarh and deori areas the tds value of water increases due to use of relatively higher amount of fertilizers during agricultural practices whereas intensive farming practices and intensive tillage were found to be responsible for higher tds values in the post monsoon season significant difference was observed in tds values in pre monsoon and post monsoon season especially in bina deori gadhakota and rehli areas this was probably due to the lower relief elevation of rehli gadhakota deori and bina tehsils as compared to sagar rahatgarh banda and kesli tehsils supplementary fig s8 soil erosion occurs during rains which deposits minerals in low elevation areas dissolved minerals in water move from high to low altitude and increase the tds content of groundwater in low altitude areas 4 7 2 geospatial analysis for th and cah the th of water is associated with its dissolved calcium and magnesium ions from rocks and soils fig 8 and supplementary information s i 2 infiltration properties ion exchange capabilities and weathering of rocks contribute to the dissolution of calcium and magnesium ions in water sagar has calcium and magnesium containing rocks such as silicate dolomite and calcite therefore the groundwater in this zone is relatively hard in addition high th values of water at rehli deori khurai and malthone are a result of intensive agricultural practices and use of ammonia meanwhile calcium ions in groundwater may occur mainly through the dissolution of ca rich minerals in aquifers the lithology of sagar district is dominated by intertrappean and infratrappean formations of igneous and sedimentary rocks thus the high concentration of cah in the pebble horizon infiltrated the groundwater in addition intensive agricultural practices are also responsible for high concentrations of cah in water ahada and suthar 2018a 4 7 3 geospatial analysis for the nitrate ion concentration anthropogenic activities are the primary reason for the high nitrate ion concentration in the waters of sagar district fig 8 nitrogen enters groundwater primarily through various surface sources such as the widespread use of chemical fertilizers animal waste disposal and surface irrigation of nitrate enriched groundwater cropping pattern significantly affects the consumption of fertilizers for example wheat requires high amounts of nitrogen based fertilizers as does madhya pradesh a major wheat producer the widespread use of synthetic fertilizers to increase crop yields can have negative effects on groundwater quality the widespread use of chemical fertilizers containing urea diammonium phosphate ammonium nitrate sodium nitrate potassium nitrate calcium ammonium nitrate and nitrate concentrates increases the nitrate ion concentration of water because nitrate has high solubility and low retention in water also high nitrate amounts in shallow groundwater could be governed by pumping return flow cycles in semiarid regions climate and granite are minor sources of nitrate as in the case of the bedrock of the sagar district ahada and suthar 2018b geospatial plots other than those for tds th cah and nitrate ion concentrations are shown in supplementary figs s9 and s10 the geospatial analysis for wqi is shown in supplementary fig s11 5 estimated health risk high tds th and nitrate ion concentration are the major threats in sagar district high tds value in itself is not harmful only individual ions may have toxic roles large kidney patients in sagar district may or may not have a direct correlation with high th or cah levels as far as stone formation in the human body is concerned the quantity of water is more important than the quality of water consumed the lower the intake the more likely stone formation marangella et al 1996 combined food and water habits lead to more calculus as suggested by bellizzi et al 1999 and churchill et al 1978 therefore the possibility of stone disease with high calcium content in drinking water quality cannot be ruled out rising nitrate ion concentrations due to excessive use of fertilizers may be a major threat in the near future and there may be a risk for thyroid dysfunction gatseva et al 2008 nitrate ion is reduced to nitrite ion in the lower intestine and causes a disease called blue baby or methemoglobinemia karne and kulkarni 2009 with the use of high fertilizers the danger will increase by the day especially when farmers intend to increase agricultural productivity in this water stressed region 6 conclusion drinking water quality was assessed in sagar district of madhya pradesh india in both pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons of 2019 2020 with the entire location divided into 227 isolated points inspection of the correlation matrix of the analyzed variables showed the existence of strong correlations between variables such as ec tds salinity th cah mgh and chloride nitrate and bicarbonate ion concentrations pca indicated that tds th cah and nitrate and chloride ion concentrations were the most significant parameters contributed to the water quality variations both in pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons meanwhile fa grouped related components and assisted in recognizing the contributors to water quality pca evinced that a parameter that significantly contributes to water quality variations in summer may be less or not significant in winter the wqi indicated that 66 69 of water samples were in the range of good water quality while 3 11 of the samples are of poor water quality the primary reasons behind the water quality are geological as evidenced by the geospatial analysis most of the water quality parameters in sagar district were found to be within the acceptable limits of bis except th and cah intertrappean and infratrappean formations of igneous and sedimentary rocks dominate the lithology of the sagar district and the

11694,wadi araba is an important economic area in egypt due to the presence of numerous species of flora and fauna the problem is the lack of information on the aquifer system this study aims to investigate the characteristics of the aquifer system within the scope of the groundwater potentiality types of the aquifer system types of groundwater interface and groundwater layers interaction in the study area six wells were drilled at three depths 300 m 600 m and 1200 m to identify the different characteristics of the aquifer the results showed that there are three groundwater layers separated by shale sheets that are not interacting together the higher extraction potentiality of groundwater from the aquifer is from the upstream 340 400 m2 day 1 while the lower extraction potentiality is from midstream 10 50 m2 day 1 followed by the downstream 20 m2 day 1 with significant differences compared to upstream the water quality analysis showed that higher salinity was recorded downstream side where the wadi encounters the lower units of the gulf of suez eventually there is a limitation on the exploitation of groundwater in the aquifer for intensive agricultural development this is because the aquifer potentiality ranges from weak to medium graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater management multilayer aquifer wadi araba arid lands data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction the annual share quota of egypt s nile river is fixed and limited to 55 5 billion cubic meters according to the agreement between egypt and sudan in 1959 abdalla 1971 the increased population resulted in the need to divert water for domestic purposes ghazouani et al 2014 accordingly the per capita share of available water decreased to 700 m3 in 2017 and is expected to reach 500 m3 per capita in 2025 nwrp 2017 according to the world bank standards 2005 the per capita share of available water is below the limit of water scarcity moreover the country has other water related challenges such as seepage losses and increasing rates of evapotranspiration omar and moussa 2016 farig et al 2021 the annual evaporation rate is 7 5 mm day 1 with a maximum rate of 10 8 mm day 1 in june and a minimum of 3 9 mm day 1 in december hassan 2013 overall the annual water deficit in egypt is estimated at seven billion cubic meters and the country could run out of water by 2025 unicef 2021 the situation is further exacerbated by the aridity of the country where the amount of rainfall ranges from 12 mm to 200 mm annually in the whole of egypt nwrp 2017 moreover most of the rainfall is occurring on the narrow mediterranean coast with about 200 mm per year world weather and climate information 2022 the limited water resources prompted egypt to consider natural and non conventional water resources such as groundwater abdel shafy et al 2010 in egypt groundwater is the second main water resource after the nile river with about 7 2 billion cubic meters pumped annually nwrp 2017 the real challenge of the country is that 97 of the total area is located under hyper arid climatic conditions deserts and of which only a small part of 3 of the total area is located in the nile delta gef 2009 recently several ambitious projects were inaugurated in the desert lands mainly relying on groundwater this is to reduce the population pressure in the nile valley and delta and establish new farming communities that can meet the country s growing food security for example the 1 5 million acres mega project an agricultural land reclamation inaugurated in december 2015 in the western desert isin and konandreas 2017 with more than 1500 newly drilled wells in the fossil aquifer gafi 2019 the exploration of these projects involves some common global natural and man made constraints such as climate change intensive withdrawal of groundwater and degradation of water quality climate change and increased global air

test was conducted for 72 h before starting the pumping test the static water level was measured using an electric water level probe dipper a submersible pump 125 hp was installed and the changes in water level were observed the pumping test was conducted by pumping water at a constant rate from a suitable local datum top of casing and observing the aquifer response drawdown using a dipper and stopwatch in the pumping well and any nearby observation wells during and after pumping recovery phase as shown in fig 6 the flow rate was measured directly after the start of the test and at intervals during the test using a water meter regarding the step pumping test the dynamic water levels in the well were measured in the intervals of 1 minute for 10 minutes elapsed 2 minutes for 20 minutes elapsed 5 minutes for 60 minutes elapsed 10 minutes for 120 minutes elapsed and 15 minutes for 180 minutes elapsed making it a total elapsed pumping time of about 180 minutes the step pumping

constant rate pumping test the pumping phase and the recovery phase are shown in fig 7 2 2 7 water quality monitoring groundwater samples were collected from wells tapping the wadi araba during the pumping test in june 2021 the groundwater quality was assessed through water sample collection and analysis for each well layer the sample collection preservation and analysis regarding all investigated parameters were conducted according to the standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater baird and bridgewater 2017 the ph and ec of the water samples were measured in the field using calibrated portable meters model 310i wtw the chemical parameters such as bicarbonate hco3 calcium ca magnesium mg sodium na potassium k chloride cl and sulphate so4 2 were analyzed bicarbonate was determined by titration against sulfuric acid 0 02 n with phenolphthalein and methyl orange as indicators the ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid edta titration method was used for the hardness estimation of calcium and magnesium sodium and potassium were determined by flame photometer model sherwood 410 chloride and sulphate were determined using ion chromatography model dionex ics5000 the samples were analyzed at the national water research center in egypt 2 3 data analysis 2 3 1 properties of the aquifer the characteristics of each well such as static and dynamic water levels well yield and transmissivity were monitored the following assumptions were considered the aquifer is infinite homogeneous and isotropic the control well is fully penetrating the groundwater flow is horizontal and uniform and the well diameter is negligible based on these assumptions the transmissivity m2 day 1 was calculated using the cooper jacob method 1947 as shown in eq 1 1 t 2 3 q 4 π δ s where q m3 day 1 pumping rate δs m slope of the fitted line change in drawdown per log cycle time π mathematical constant the aquifer potentiality was classified based on the transmissivity

well and observing the groundwater level at the nearest one 25 m distance between wells for the upstream the experiment was done for bns d and bns b wells at depths of 450 m and 1200 m respectively three wells midstream bns c ed 2 araba 2 were drilled to different aquifer depths 1448 m 858 m and 300 m results and analysis of the aquifer layers interaction have been discussed in section 3 4 3 results and discussions 3 1 properties of the aquifer the physical characteristics of the soil such as porosity permeability storage and hydraulic conductivity identify the aquifer s properties these characteristics are determined by techniques like aquifer tests shown in table 2 akhtar et al 2020 table 2 shows inventory data of the drilled wells in the aquifer subject to groundwater characteristics six deep drilled wells were recorded in the wadi araba tapping the aquifer with depths ranging from 300 m araba 1 to 1448 m bns c data illustrated that pump yield differed along the wadi from upstream to downstream the higher pump yield was recorded upstream followed by midstream and downstream for the upstream bns b bns d the average pump yield was 199 m3 h 1 for the midstream bns c ed 2 araba 2 the average yield was 81 m3 h 1 while for the downstream araba 1 it was 45 m3 h 1 the static water level ranged from 110 5 m upstream 81 5 m downstream and 60 5 m midstream the transmissivity of upstream wells bns b and bns d was 400 and 340 m2 day 1 respectively this implies the higher extraction potentiality of groundwater from the aquifer upstream and is classified as moderate potentiality 50 500 m2 day 1 according to de wiest 1965 regarding midstream and downstream wells the transmissivity ranged from 10 m2 day 1 at the midstream well ed 2 to 50 m2 day 1 at the midstream of araba 2 this implies weak extraction potentiality 5 50 m2 day 1 of groundwater from the aquifer at midstream and downstream also the differences in transmissivity between upstream midstream and downstream mean that this aquifer is unconfined according to charles r fitts 2013 3 2 pumping yield and specific drawdown of each layer the management of groundwater resources requires the estimation of the formation loss coefficient between multilayers in heterogeneous aquifers fig 9 illustrates the effect of pumping from different wells on water movement between the layers as estimated by applying the formation loss coefficient the layers formation loss coefficient b increases when groundwater flows to the east to the gulf of suez this is due to the increase of shale sheets in the aquifer near the gulf of suez also results revealed that the formation loss coefficient differed between all layers this indicates the differences in the geological formation between aquifer layers in the upstream the formation loss coefficient was 0 097 h m 2 and 0 159 h m 2 in bns d layer 2 and bns b layer 3 respectively in the midstream the formation loss coefficient was 0 14 h m 2 1 87 h m 2 and 0 61 h m 2 in araba 2 layer 1 ed 2 layer 2 and bns c layer 3 respectively in the downstream the formation loss coefficient was 0 59 h m 2 in araba 1 layer 1 therefore the groundwater potential upstream is better than midstream and downstream especially in layer 2 in the midstream the groundwater potential is better than downstream especially in layer 1 3 3 geomorphology and structure of the aquifer fig 10 shows the geomorphology and structure of wadi araba the aquifer is divided into three different geological layers and the deep layers extend to great depths of up to 1500 m as shown in fig 10 the analysis of the geomorphology and structure of wadi araba indicates that the development of the wadi topography formed in several stages the sequences of the wadi from top to base are i palaeocene eocene carbonate sequence ii cretaceous mixed clastic and iii cambrian lower cretaceous sandstone sequence 3 4 aquifer layers interaction table 3 shows the interaction between aquifer layers through two experiments at the upstream and midstream wells regarding the first experiment at the upstream wells bns d bns b when water was pumped from bns d well the maximum drawdown was 27 9 m while in the other upstream well bns b the groundwater level did not change and it was at the static level depth of 111 4 m that means there is no interaction between the aquifer layers upstream the same trend was observed at the midstream aquifer when water was pumped from the araba 2 well the maximum drawdown was zero at bns c and ed 2 the static groundwater level depth was 68 4 m and 72 8 m for both wells respectively these results clarified that there is no interaction between different layers in the wadi araba aquifer 3 5 water quality monitoring the results of the groundwater chemical analyses are shown in table 4 overall the groundwater salinity of the aquifer in the study area is non fresh water 1000 ppm according to the chebotarev classification chebotarev 1955 the lowest ec was observed at upstream wells bns b bns d while the highest values were observed downstream araba 1 with significant differences the optimal ec value for plant growth is usually between 0 8 and 1 8 μmhos cm and should not exceed 2 5 μmhos cm seifi et al 2010 the groundwater salinity ec ranges from 2 4 μmhos cm bns b to 17 2 μmhos cm araba 1 the high salinity of araba 1 is due to the location on the downstream side where the wadi comes in contact with the lower units of the gulf of suez which causes a change in the aquifer facies el hossary 2013 regarding the ph it ranges from 7 01 to 7 8 which falls within the alkaline basic range u s geological survey 2018 and is safe for agriculture while ph 8 and above affect plant growth ourimbah 2011 the ec in araba 1 is very high 17 2 μmhos cm and not suited for all plants where the optimum range for most crops is between 5 5 μmhos cm and 7 5 μmhos cm fao 1992 the groundwater of the wadi araba has one group of hypothetical salts combination nacl na2so4 nahco3 mg hco3 2 and ca hco3 2 also it has na2so4 and nahco3 of meteoric origin 3 6 agricultural purpose and sustainable development this study aimed to clarify the appropriate groundwater management to achieve sustainable development through intensive investigation of the aquifer system overall groundwater potential in the case study ranged from weak to medium revealing the inability of intensive agriculture therefore the study suggested irrigated agriculture on a small scale of 50 ha 100 ha further the establishment of rural households and communities resilient to the subsistence farming system is essential and will be promising for sustainable development burney and naylor 2012 gowing et al 2020 ngango and hong 2021 in such communities irrigation water is a key strategy to build a resilient system to erratic rainfall and low groundwater potential thus the introduction of modern irrigation technologies such as drip and sprinkler irrigation is crucial to address and meet the challenges of low groundwater potential weak to medium besides modern irrigation is a key element to address the challenges of low crop productivity you et al 2011 çetin and kara 2019 abde et al 2021 mohammed 2021 it is also an important factor for communities that face low level income from agriculture to consider the application of solar energy for groundwater management the application of solar energy will save operational costs and conserve groundwater from depletion solar energy pumps are frequently cited as a key strategy to enhance drought resilience and aid groundwater sustainability he et al 2019 sayed et al 2019 kumar et al 2023 on the other hand the incentive framework for subsistence farming systems to produce a surplus for the market effectively alleviates low levels of income this can be through establishing an intensive production system such as poultry seasonal crops animals and trees ifad 2014 fao 2014 in this way farmers can shift from agriculture to agro industries based on agricultural raw materials processing activities this approach is defined as a circular economy ce in which the raw materials agricultural components and products keep their value for longer especially when the system is operated by renewable energy ellen macarthur foundation 2015 the ce has a broad spectrum of applications suitable for the future of established groundwater based communities the water smart ce includes protection and less pressure on the water related ecosystem both aquatic and groundwater salminen et al 2022 a smart water economy in water use can be increased when implementing a policy that encourages the reuse of recycled water to recharge groundwater which will improve the agricultural economy and food security system manisha et al 2023 ce represents a key strategy to minimize agricultural activities negative impacts and enhance economic performance elia et al 2017 stegmann et al 2020 velasco muñoz et al 2021 further adopting circular economy systems is a proper approach for labor intensive smallholder farmers and contributes to developing a gender sensitive economy united nations department of economic and social affairs 2021 4 conclusions and recommendations this paper intensively investigated the aquifer system characteristics in wadi araba where the egyptian government invested to explore the potentiality of the groundwater in the wadi the findings of this study could be useful for decision makers to manage the groundwater properly results indicated that the water well productivity upstream of the wadi is better than midstream and downstream the upstream water well of bns d layer 2 is operated at a relatively high pumping yield accompanied by low drawdown the upstream water well yield was 197 m3 h 1 and the drawdown was 27 9 m the midstream water well of ed 02 layer 2 is operated at a relatively low pumping yield 45 m3 h 1 accompanied by a high drawdown 137 8 m the midstream water well productivity in layers 1 and 3 is better than in layer 2 the results also revealed that the aquifer is classified as heterogenous where the transmissivity and formation losses coefficient change between the different locations overall the pumping tests for the drilled groundwater wells revealed that the aquifer potentiality ranges from weak to medium this could limit the exploitation of groundwater in the aquifer for intensive agricultural development regarding water quality it varies between the different layers of the aquifer the surface layer is characterized by the highest salinity then the middle layer of the aquifer followed by the bottom layer this could be due to the upper layers being connected to the gulf of suez while the lower layers are not connected the downstream location of the wadi is characterized by high salinity where the salinity reaches 17 2 μmhos cm thus more awareness should be considered for agricultural purposes downstream ultimately wadi araba s groundwater resources are limited and bound to fail it is therefore important to offer farmers ways to adopt new farming systems technology such as modern irrigation and solar energy pumps besides establishes integrated farming systems such as poultry seasonal crops animals and trees mixed crop livestock agroforestry and solar energy are key components of circular farming and farm sustainability with the use of scientific advances innovations and new technologies modern irrigation in this way farmers will be able to shift from low to high production and income otherwise groundwater resources will be exhausted forcing farmers to drill deeper wells at high costs and energy it is also recommended to encourage the planning and management of large scale recycling of treated wastewater for indirect groundwater recharge this would increase the circular economy in water use which positively impacts the enhancement of livestock milk production women s employment and income since the wadi is still being explored the study recommends adopting small developmental models while continuing the exploration research and observing the behavior of the

11694,wadi araba is an important economic area in egypt due to the presence of numerous species of flora and fauna the problem is the lack of information on the aquifer system this study aims to investigate the characteristics of the aquifer system within the scope of the groundwater potentiality types of the aquifer system types of groundwater interface and groundwater layers interaction in the study area six wells were drilled at three depths 300 m 600 m and 1200 m to identify the different characteristics of the aquifer the results showed that there are three groundwater layers separated by shale sheets that are not interacting together the higher extraction potentiality of groundwater from the aquifer is from the upstream 340 400 m2 day 1 while the lower extraction potentiality is from midstream 10 50 m2 day 1 followed by the downstream 20 m2 day 1 with significant differences compared to upstream the water quality analysis showed that higher salinity was recorded downstream side where the wadi encounters the lower units of the gulf of suez eventually there is a limitation on the exploitation of groundwater in the aquifer for intensive agricultural development this is because the aquifer potentiality ranges from weak to medium graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater management multilayer aquifer wadi araba arid lands data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction the annual share quota of egypt s nile river is fixed and limited to 55 5 billion cubic meters according to the agreement between egypt and sudan in 1959 abdalla 1971 the increased population resulted in the need to divert water for domestic purposes ghazouani et al 2014 accordingly the per capita share of available water decreased to 700 m3 in 2017 and is expected to reach 500 m3 per capita in 2025 nwrp 2017 according to the world bank standards 2005 the per capita share of available water is below the limit of water scarcity moreover the country has other water related challenges such as seepage losses and increasing rates of evapotranspiration omar and moussa 2016 farig et al 2021 the annual evaporation rate is 7 5 mm day 1 with a maximum rate of 10 8 mm day 1 in june and a minimum of 3 9 mm day 1 in december hassan 2013 overall the annual water deficit in egypt is estimated at seven billion cubic meters and the country could run out of water by 2025 unicef 2021 the situation is further exacerbated by the aridity of the country where the amount of rainfall ranges from 12 mm to 200 mm annually in the whole of egypt nwrp 2017 moreover most of the rainfall is occurring on the narrow mediterranean coast with about 200 mm per year world weather and climate information 2022 the limited water resources prompted egypt to consider natural and non conventional water resources such as groundwater abdel shafy et al 2010 in egypt groundwater is the second main water resource after the nile river with about 7 2 billion cubic meters pumped annually nwrp 2017 the real challenge of the country is that 97 of the total area is located under hyper arid climatic conditions deserts and of which only a small part of 3 of the total area is located in the nile delta gef 2009 recently several ambitious projects were inaugurated in the desert lands mainly relying on groundwater this is to reduce the population pressure in the nile valley and delta and establish new farming communities that can meet the country s growing food security for example the 1 5 million acres mega project an agricultural land reclamation inaugurated in december 2015 in the western desert isin and konandreas 2017 with more than 1500 newly drilled wells in the fossil aquifer gafi 2019 the exploration of these projects

level was measured at the same time intervals used to measure the dynamic water level drawdown until the water level gets to the same level as the pre test static level the different phases of the constant rate pumping test the pumping phase and the recovery phase are shown in fig 7 2 2 7 water quality monitoring groundwater samples were collected from wells tapping the wadi araba during the pumping test in june 2021 the groundwater quality was assessed through water sample collection and analysis for each well layer the sample collection preservation and analysis regarding all investigated parameters were conducted according to the standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater baird and bridgewater 2017 the ph and ec of the water samples were measured in the field using calibrated portable meters model 310i wtw the chemical parameters such as bicarbonate hco3 calcium ca magnesium mg sodium na potassium k chloride cl and sulphate so4 2 were analyzed bicarbonate was determined by titration against sulfuric acid 0 02 n with phenolphthalein and methyl orange as indicators the ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid edta titration method was used for the hardness estimation of calcium and magnesium sodium and potassium were determined by flame photometer model sherwood 410 chloride and sulphate were determined using ion chromatography model dionex ics5000 the samples were analyzed at the national water research center in egypt 2 3 data analysis 2 3 1 properties of the aquifer the characteristics of each well such as static and dynamic water levels well yield and transmissivity were monitored the following assumptions were considered the aquifer is infinite homogeneous and isotropic the control well is fully penetrating the groundwater flow is horizontal and uniform and the well diameter is negligible based on these assumptions the transmissivity m2 day 1 was calculated using the cooper jacob method 1947 as shown in eq 1 1 t 2 3 q 4 π δ s where q m3 day 1 pumping rate δs m slope of the fitted line change in drawdown per log cycle time π mathematical constant the aquifer potentiality was classified based on the transmissivity

well and observing the groundwater level at the nearest one 25 m distance between wells for the upstream the experiment was done for bns d and bns b wells at depths of 450 m and 1200 m respectively three wells midstream bns c ed 2 araba 2 were drilled to different aquifer depths 1448 m 858 m and 300 m results and analysis of the aquifer layers interaction have been discussed in section 3 4 3 results and discussions 3 1 properties of the aquifer the physical characteristics of the soil such as porosity permeability storage and hydraulic conductivity identify the aquifer s properties these characteristics are determined by techniques like aquifer tests shown in table 2 akhtar et al 2020 table 2 shows inventory data of the drilled wells in the aquifer subject to groundwater characteristics six deep drilled wells were recorded in the wadi araba tapping the aquifer with depths ranging from 300 m araba 1 to 1448 m bns c data illustrated that pump yield differed along the wadi from upstream to downstream the higher pump yield was recorded upstream followed by midstream and downstream for the upstream bns b bns d the average pump yield was 199 m3 h 1 for the midstream bns c ed 2 araba 2 the average yield was 81 m3 h 1 while for the downstream araba 1 it was 45 m3 h 1 the static water level ranged from 110 5 m upstream 81 5 m downstream and 60 5 m midstream the transmissivity of upstream wells bns b and bns d was 400 and 340 m2 day 1 respectively this implies the higher extraction potentiality of groundwater from the aquifer upstream and is classified as moderate potentiality 50 500 m2 day 1 according to de wiest 1965 regarding midstream and downstream wells the transmissivity ranged from 10 m2 day 1 at the midstream well ed 2 to 50 m2 day 1 at the midstream of araba 2 this implies weak extraction potentiality 5 50 m2 day 1 of groundwater from the aquifer at midstream and downstream also the differences in transmissivity between upstream midstream and downstream mean that this aquifer is unconfined according to charles r fitts 2013 3 2 pumping yield and specific drawdown of each layer the management of groundwater resources requires the estimation of the formation loss coefficient between multilayers in heterogeneous aquifers fig 9 illustrates the effect of pumping from different wells on water movement between the layers as estimated by applying the formation loss coefficient the layers formation loss coefficient b increases when groundwater flows to the east to the gulf of suez this is due to the increase of shale sheets in the aquifer near the gulf of suez also results revealed that the formation loss coefficient differed between all layers this indicates the differences in the geological formation between aquifer layers in the upstream the formation loss coefficient was 0 097 h m 2 and 0 159 h m 2 in bns d layer 2 and bns b layer 3 respectively in the midstream the formation loss coefficient was 0 14 h m 2 1 87 h m 2 and 0 61 h m 2 in araba 2 layer 1 ed 2 layer 2 and bns c layer 3 respectively in the downstream the formation loss coefficient was 0 59 h m 2 in araba 1 layer 1 therefore the groundwater potential upstream is better than midstream and downstream especially in layer 2 in the midstream the groundwater potential is better than downstream especially in layer 1 3 3 geomorphology and structure of the aquifer fig 10 shows the geomorphology and structure of wadi araba the aquifer is divided into three different geological layers and the deep layers extend to great depths of up to 1500 m as shown in fig 10 the analysis of the geomorphology and structure of wadi araba indicates that the development of the wadi topography formed in several stages the sequences of the wadi from top to base are i palaeocene eocene carbonate sequence ii cretaceous mixed clastic and iii cambrian lower cretaceous sandstone sequence 3 4 aquifer layers interaction table 3 shows the interaction between aquifer layers through two experiments at the upstream and midstream wells regarding the first experiment at the upstream wells bns d bns b when water was pumped from bns d well the maximum drawdown was 27 9 m while in the other upstream well bns b the groundwater level did not change and it was at the static level depth of 111 4 m that means there is no interaction between the aquifer layers upstream the same trend was observed at the midstream aquifer when water was pumped from the araba 2 well the maximum drawdown was zero at bns c and ed 2 the static groundwater level depth was 68 4 m and 72 8 m for both wells respectively these results clarified that there is no interaction between different layers in the wadi araba aquifer 3 5 water quality monitoring the results of the groundwater chemical analyses are shown in table 4 overall the groundwater salinity of the aquifer in the study area is non fresh water 1000 ppm according to the chebotarev classification chebotarev 1955 the lowest ec was observed at upstream wells bns b bns d while the highest values were observed downstream araba 1 with significant differences the optimal ec value for plant growth is usually between 0 8 and 1 8 μmhos cm and should not exceed 2 5 μmhos cm seifi et al 2010 the groundwater salinity ec ranges from 2 4 μmhos cm bns b to 17 2 μmhos cm araba 1 the high salinity of araba 1 is due to the location on the downstream side where the wadi comes in contact with the lower units of the gulf of suez which causes a change in the aquifer facies el hossary 2013 regarding the ph it ranges from 7 01 to 7 8 which falls within the alkaline basic range u s geological survey 2018 and is safe for agriculture while ph 8 and above affect plant growth ourimbah 2011 the ec in araba 1 is very high 17 2 μmhos cm and not suited for all plants where the optimum range for most crops is between 5 5 μmhos cm and 7 5 μmhos cm fao 1992 the groundwater of the wadi araba has one group of hypothetical salts combination nacl na2so4 nahco3 mg hco3 2 and ca hco3 2 also it has na2so4 and nahco3 of meteoric origin 3 6 agricultural purpose and sustainable development this study aimed to clarify the appropriate groundwater management to achieve sustainable development through intensive investigation of the aquifer system overall groundwater potential in the case study ranged from weak to medium revealing the inability of intensive agriculture therefore the study suggested irrigated agriculture on a small scale of 50 ha 100 ha further the establishment of rural households and communities resilient to the subsistence farming system is essential and will be promising for sustainable development burney and naylor 2012 gowing et al 2020 ngango and hong 2021 in such communities irrigation water is a key strategy to build a resilient system to erratic rainfall and low groundwater potential thus the introduction of modern irrigation technologies such as drip and sprinkler irrigation is crucial to address and meet the challenges of low groundwater potential weak to medium besides modern irrigation is a key element to address the challenges of low crop productivity you et al 2011 çetin and kara 2019 abde et al 2021 mohammed 2021 it is also an important factor for communities that face low level income from agriculture to consider the application of solar energy for groundwater management the application of solar energy will save operational costs and conserve groundwater from depletion solar energy pumps are frequently cited as a key strategy to enhance drought resilience and aid groundwater sustainability he et al 2019 sayed et al 2019 kumar et al 2023 on the other hand the incentive framework for subsistence farming systems to produce a surplus for the market effectively alleviates low levels of income this can be through establishing an intensive production system such as poultry seasonal crops animals and trees ifad 2014 fao 2014 in this way farmers can shift from agriculture to agro industries based on agricultural raw materials processing activities this approach is defined as a circular economy ce in which the raw materials agricultural components and products keep their value for longer especially when the system is operated by renewable energy ellen macarthur foundation 2015 the ce has a broad spectrum of applications suitable for the future of established groundwater based communities the water smart ce includes protection and less pressure on the water related ecosystem both aquatic and groundwater salminen et al 2022 a smart water economy in water use can be increased when implementing a policy that encourages the reuse of recycled water to recharge groundwater which will improve the agricultural economy and food security system manisha et al 2023 ce represents a key strategy to minimize agricultural activities negative impacts and enhance economic performance elia et al 2017 stegmann et al 2020 velasco muñoz et al 2021 further adopting circular economy systems is a proper approach for labor intensive smallholder farmers and contributes to developing a gender sensitive economy united nations department of economic and social affairs 2021 4 conclusions and recommendations this paper intensively investigated the aquifer system characteristics in wadi araba where the egyptian government invested to explore the potentiality of the groundwater in the wadi the findings of this study could be useful for decision makers to manage the groundwater properly results indicated that the water well productivity upstream of the wadi is better than midstream and downstream the upstream water well of bns d layer 2 is operated at a relatively high pumping yield accompanied by low drawdown the upstream water well yield was 197 m3 h 1 and the drawdown was 27 9 m the midstream water well of ed 02 layer 2 is operated at a relatively low pumping yield 45 m3 h 1 accompanied by a high drawdown 137 8 m the midstream water well productivity in layers 1 and 3 is better than in layer 2 the results also revealed that the aquifer is classified as heterogenous where the transmissivity and formation losses coefficient change between the different locations overall the pumping tests for the drilled groundwater wells revealed that the aquifer potentiality ranges from weak to medium this could limit the exploitation of groundwater in the aquifer for intensive agricultural development regarding water quality it varies between the different layers of the aquifer the surface layer is characterized by the highest salinity then the middle layer of the aquifer followed by the bottom layer this could be due to the upper layers being connected to the gulf of suez while the lower layers are not connected the downstream location of the wadi is characterized by high salinity where the salinity reaches 17 2 μmhos cm thus more awareness should be considered for agricultural purposes downstream ultimately wadi araba s groundwater resources are limited and bound to fail it is therefore important to offer farmers ways to adopt new farming systems technology such as modern irrigation and solar energy pumps besides establishes integrated farming systems such as poultry seasonal crops animals and trees mixed crop livestock agroforestry and solar energy are key components of circular farming and farm sustainability with the use of scientific advances innovations and new technologies modern irrigation in this way farmers will be able to shift from low to high production and income otherwise groundwater resources will be exhausted forcing farmers to drill deeper wells at high costs and energy it is also recommended to encourage the planning and management of large scale recycling of treated wastewater for indirect groundwater recharge this would increase the circular economy in water use which positively impacts the enhancement of livestock milk production women s employment and income since the wadi is still being explored the study recommends adopting small developmental models while continuing the exploration research and observing the behavior of the
