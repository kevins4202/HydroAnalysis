the dissipated energy model the dissipated energy e during one low frequency lf oscillation of period τ is related to the linear coefficient b by the formula 1 e 0 τ b d x d t 2 d t where x refers to the lf component of the surge motions consequently provided the energy dissipated by the mooring line during one lf surge oscillation can be calculated the linear damping coefficient can be obtained by 2 b e τ 2 π 2 x 0 2 where x 0 is the amplitude of the surge harmonic oscillation the improved quasi static method fan et al 2017 by the author of this paper is employed here to calculate the mooring induced damping consider a discretization of the period τ with a time step δ t τ 2 n a total of n 1 catenary line profiles are computed the first and the last respectively for the near and far positions as shown in fig 2 at each time step the profile of mooring line could be computed consequently the position of each mooring line element could be considered as a displacement function of

responses of the semi submersible platform with each type of full depth and truncated mooring system is carried out in time domain by the commercial software aqwa the structure of the semi submersible platform model is mainly composed of two pontoons four columns a deck and a derrick the main parameters of the platform structure are listed in table 1 the full depth and truncated mooring systems used in the simulation are described and designed in section 2 the coupled analysis model of platform and mooring lines is shown in fig 4 the wave conditions in this study are the 1 year and 100 year return periods in the south china sea as shown in table 2 jonswap wave spectrum is used during the numerical simulation based on the description above motion responses of the semi submersible platform with each type of full depth and truncated mooring system are analysed in duration of 3 h with the incident wave direction as 0 the lf range and the wave frequency wf range is defined as 0 0 2 rad s and 0 2 1 0 rad s respectively the power spectral density psd of the whole time series has been calculated with welch s method welch 1967 by use of fast fourier transform fft 4 1 applicability of catenary mooring system the couple analysis results of the semi submersible platform with catenary full depth and truncated mooring system in extreme 100 year return period and working 1 year return period wave conditions are shown as follows the representative time series of the floater motion and their spectra are shown in figs 5 16 the motion surge heave and pitch statistics are described in tables 3 5 the representative time series of no 5 mooring line tension in 100 year return period wave condition are shown in fig 17 in the surge direction based on the time series and psd shown above the motions of platform with truncated mooring system fit very well with those with full depth mooring system in both extreme and working wave condition the statistics in table 3 show that all the relative errors are below 1 5 in the heave direction based on the time series and psd shown above the motions of platform with truncated mooring system and those with full depth mooring system fit well with each other the statistics in table 4 show that all the relative errors are below 4 the error which equals 3 68 between max wf motions of platform with full depth and truncated mooring system is largest actually the max wf motion with truncated mooring system is only 0 05 m smaller than that with full depth mooring system in the pitch direction based on the time series and psd shown above in both extreme and working wave condition the motions of platform with truncated mooring system fit well with those with full depth mooring system the statistics in table 5 show that some relative errors are relatively larger than those in the surge and heave directions however actually the absolute error is small enough in fig 17 we could see that the amplitude of no 5 mooring line tension of truncated system in wf is obviously larger than that of full depth system this is because the truncated mooring system is designed based on the equivalence of the lf mooring induced damping which could reduce the platform resonant excursion significantly the damping of the truncated mooring system could not be equivalent with the full depth mooring system in all frequencies after the damping compensation in lf the damping of the truncated mooring system in wf is larger than that of the full depth mooring system based on the comparisons above it demonstrates that the catenary full depth mooring system can be replaced by the truncated mooring system for model tests 4 2 applicability of semi taut mooring system the numerical results of the semi submersible platform with semi taut full depth and truncated mooring system in extreme and working wave conditions are shown as follows the motion surge heave and pitch statistics are described in tables 6 8 the representative time series and their spectra are shown in figs 18 29 the representative time series of no 5 mooring line tension in 100 year return period wave condition are shown in fig 30 in the surge direction based on the time series and psd shown above the motions of platform with truncated mooring system fit greatly well with those with full depth mooring system in both extreme and working wave condition the statistics in table 6 show that all the relative errors are below 1 in the heave direction based on the time series and psd shown above the motions of platform with truncated mooring system and those with full depth mooring system fit very well with each other the statistics in table 7 show that all the relative errors are below 1 in the pitch direction based on the time series and psd shown above in both extreme and working wave condition the motions of platform with truncated mooring system fit well with those with full depth mooring system the statistics in table 8 show that the relative errors are larger than those in the surge and heave directions however actually the absolute error is small in fig 30 we could see that the amplitude of no 5 mooring line tension of truncated system in wf is just a little larger than that of full depth system the truncated mooring system is designed based on the equivalence of the lf mooring induced damping which could reduce the platform resonant excursion significantly there is a coincidence here that the wf damping of the truncated mooring system is also similar with the full depth mooring system for this chosen semi taut system based on the comparisons above it demonstrates that the semi taut full depth mooring system can be replaced by the truncated mooring system to perform model testing 4 3 applicability of taut mooring system the global analysis results of the semi submersible platform with taut full depth and truncated mooring system in extreme and working wave conditions are shown as follows the motion surge heave and pitch statistics are described in tables 9 11 the representative time series and their spectra are shown in figs 31 42 the representative time series of no 5 mooring line tension in 100 year return period wave condition are shown in fig 43 in the surge direction based on the time series and psd shown above the motions of platform with truncated mooring system fit well with those with full depth mooring system in both extreme and working wave condition the statistics in table 9 show that the relative errors are larger than those in the results of catenary and semi taut mooring systems in addition the relative errors in working wave condition is larger than those in extreme wave condition the reason is that the mooring induced damping of taut mooring system is larger than those of catenary and semi taut mooring system thus the error during calculating and designing the truncated mooring system may take larger effect furthermore in working wave condition the damping caused by the platform itself is relatively smaller so the error between truncated and full depth mooring system plays a more important role in the heave direction based on the time series and psd shown above the motions of platform with truncated mooring system and those with full depth mooring system fit well with each other the statistics in table 10 show that all the relative errors are below 5 the error which equals 4 62 between max wf motions of platform with full depth and truncated mooring system is largest however the max wf motion with truncated mooring system is only 0 06 m smaller than that with full depth mooring system in the pitch direction based on the time series and psd shown above in both extreme and working wave condition the motions of platform with truncated mooring system fit well with those with full depth mooring system the statistics in table 11 show that some relative errors are relatively larger than those in the surge and heave directions however actually the absolute error is small enough in fig 43 we could see that the amplitude of no 5 mooring line tension of truncated system in wf is obviously larger than that of full depth system this is because the truncated mooring system is designed based on the equivalence of the lf mooring induced damping which could reduce the platform resonant excursion significantly the damping of the truncated mooring system could not be equivalent with the full depth mooring system in all frequencies after the damping compensation in lf the damping of the truncated mooring system in wf is larger than that of the full depth mooring system based on the comparisons above it demonstrates that the taut full depth mooring system can be replaced by the truncated mooring system to perform model testing 5 conclusions in this study considering all the three types catenary semi taut and taut of full depth mooring systems based on both the static and damping equivalence truncated mooring systems are optimized designed respectively the motion responses of a semi submersible platform with each type of full depth and truncated mooring system are calculated in both extreme and working wave conditions respectively the applicability of the innovative approach which proposes to design truncated mooring system based on both the static and damping equivalence is discussed some useful conclusions can be drawn as follows 1 in both extreme and working wave conditions all the three types of full depth mooring systems can be replaced by the truncated mooring systems to perform model testing 2 in surge direction the motion responses of platform with truncated mooring system fit greatly well with those with full depth mooring system with catenary and semi taut mooring systems the relative errors of all the motion statistics between full depth and truncated are controlled below 1 5 the relative errors with taut system are relatively larger the reason is that the mooring induced damping of taut mooring system is larger than that of catenary or semi taut mooring system thus the error during calculating and designing the truncated mooring system may take larger effect 3 in heave direction the motion responses of platform with full depth and truncated mooring system fit well with each other almost all the relative errors of motion statistics are below 5 4 in pitch direction the motion responses of platform with truncated mooring system fit well with those with full depth mooring system the relative errors are larger than those in the surge and heave directions however actually the absolute error is small enough designing by use of the innovative approach the equivalent truncated mooring system could be a good replacement for the full depth mooring system so that wave basins may be sufficiently large to conduct physical model test in reasonable scale without numerical extrapolation in addition the effects of different truncation factors and the applicability analysis for the spar platform with asymmetrical mooring systems will be studied in the future acknowledgments this paper was financially supported by the national natural science foundation of china grant no 51709118

responses of the semi submersible platform with each type of full depth and truncated mooring system is carried out in time domain by the commercial software aqwa the structure of the semi submersible platform model is mainly composed of two pontoons four columns a deck and a derrick the main parameters of the platform structure are listed in table 1 the full depth and truncated mooring systems used in the simulation are described and designed in section 2 the coupled analysis model of platform and mooring lines is shown in fig 4 the wave conditions in this study are the 1 year and 100 year return periods in the south china sea as shown in table 2 jonswap wave spectrum is used during the numerical simulation based on the description above motion responses of the semi submersible platform with each type of full depth and truncated mooring system are analysed in duration of 3 h with the incident wave direction as 0 the lf range and the wave frequency wf range is defined as 0 0 2 rad s and 0 2 1 0 rad s respectively the power spectral density psd of the whole time series has been calculated with welch s method welch 1967 by use of fast fourier transform fft 4 1 applicability of catenary mooring system the couple analysis results of the semi submersible platform with catenary full depth and truncated mooring system in extreme 100 year return period and working 1 year return period wave conditions are shown as follows the representative time series of the floater motion and their spectra are shown in figs 5 16 the motion surge heave and pitch statistics are described in tables 3 5 the representative time series of no 5 mooring line tension in 100 year return period wave condition are shown in fig 17 in the surge direction based on the time series and psd shown above the motions of platform with truncated mooring system fit very well with those with full depth mooring system in both extreme and working wave condition the statistics in table 3 show that all the relative errors are below 1 5 in the heave direction based on the time series and psd shown above the motions of platform with truncated mooring system and those with full depth mooring system fit well with each other the statistics in table 4 show that all the relative errors are below 4 the error which equals 3 68 between max wf motions of platform with full depth and truncated mooring system is largest actually the max wf motion with truncated mooring system is only 0 05 m smaller than that with full depth mooring system in the pitch direction based on the time series and psd shown above in both extreme and working wave condition the motions of platform with truncated mooring system fit well with those with full depth mooring system the statistics in table 5 show that some relative errors are relatively larger than those in the surge and heave directions however actually the absolute error is small enough in fig 17 we could see that the amplitude of no 5 mooring line tension of truncated system in wf is obviously larger than that of full depth system this is because the truncated mooring system is designed based on the equivalence of the lf mooring induced damping which could reduce the platform resonant excursion significantly the damping of the truncated mooring system could not be equivalent with the full depth mooring system in all frequencies after the damping compensation in lf the damping of the truncated mooring system in wf is larger than that of the full depth mooring system based on the comparisons above it demonstrates that the catenary full depth mooring system can be replaced by the truncated mooring system for model tests 4 2 applicability of semi taut mooring system the numerical results of the semi submersible platform with semi taut full depth and truncated mooring system in extreme and working wave conditions are shown as follows the motion surge heave and pitch statistics are described in tables 6 8 the representative time series and their spectra are shown in figs 18 29 the representative time series of no 5 mooring line tension in 100 year return period wave condition are shown in fig 30 in the surge direction based on the time series and psd shown above the motions of platform with truncated mooring system fit greatly well with those with full depth mooring system in both extreme and working wave condition the statistics in table 6 show that all the relative errors are below 1 in the heave direction based on the time series and psd shown above the motions of platform with truncated mooring system and those with full depth mooring system fit very well with each other the statistics in table 7 show that all the relative errors are below 1 in the pitch direction based on the time series and psd shown above in both extreme and working wave condition the motions of platform with truncated mooring system fit well with those with full depth mooring system the statistics in table 8 show that the relative errors are larger than those in the surge and heave directions however actually the absolute error is small in fig 30 we could see that the amplitude of no 5 mooring line tension of truncated system in wf is just a little larger than that of full depth system the truncated mooring system is designed based on the equivalence of the lf mooring induced damping which could reduce the platform resonant excursion significantly there is a coincidence here that the wf damping of the truncated mooring system is also similar with the full depth mooring system for this chosen semi taut system based on the comparisons above it demonstrates that the semi taut full depth mooring system can be replaced by the truncated mooring system to perform model testing 4 3 applicability of taut mooring system the global analysis results of the semi submersible platform with taut full depth and truncated mooring system in extreme and working wave conditions are shown as follows the motion surge heave and pitch statistics are described in tables 9 11 the representative time series and their spectra are shown in figs 31 42 the representative time series of no 5 mooring line tension in 100 year return period wave condition are shown in fig 43 in the surge direction based on the time series and psd shown above the motions of platform with truncated mooring system fit well with those with full depth mooring system in both extreme and working wave condition the statistics in table 9 show that the relative errors are larger than those in the results of catenary and semi taut mooring systems in addition the relative errors in working wave condition is larger than those in extreme wave condition the reason is that the mooring induced damping of taut mooring system is larger than those of catenary and semi taut mooring system thus the error during calculating and designing the truncated mooring system may take larger effect furthermore in working wave condition the damping caused by the platform itself is relatively smaller so the error between truncated and full depth mooring system plays a more important role in the heave direction based on the time series and psd shown above the motions of platform with truncated mooring system and those with full depth mooring system fit well with each other the statistics in table 10 show that all the relative errors are below 5 the error which equals 4 62 between max wf motions of platform with full depth and truncated mooring system is largest however the max wf motion with truncated mooring system is only 0 06 m smaller than that with full depth mooring system in the pitch direction based on the time series and psd shown above in both extreme and working wave condition the motions of platform with truncated mooring system fit well with those with full depth mooring system the statistics in table 11 show that some relative errors are relatively larger than those in the surge and heave directions however actually the absolute error is small enough in fig 43 we could see that the amplitude of no 5 mooring line tension of truncated system in wf is obviously larger than that of full depth system this is because the truncated mooring system is designed based on the equivalence of the lf mooring induced damping which could reduce the platform resonant excursion significantly the damping of the truncated mooring system could not be equivalent with the full depth mooring system in all frequencies after the damping compensation in lf the damping of the truncated mooring system in wf is larger than that of the full depth mooring system based on the comparisons above it demonstrates that the taut full depth mooring system can be replaced by the truncated mooring system to perform model testing 5 conclusions in this study considering all the three types catenary semi taut and taut of full depth mooring systems based on both the static and damping equivalence truncated mooring systems are optimized designed respectively the motion responses of a semi submersible platform with each type of full depth and truncated mooring system are calculated in both extreme and working wave conditions respectively the applicability of the innovative approach which proposes to design truncated mooring system based on both the static and damping equivalence is discussed some useful conclusions can be drawn as follows 1 in both extreme and working wave conditions all the three types of full depth mooring systems can be replaced by the truncated mooring systems to perform model testing 2 in surge direction the motion responses of platform with truncated mooring system fit greatly well with those with full depth mooring system with catenary and semi taut mooring systems the relative errors of all the motion statistics between full depth and truncated are controlled below 1 5 the relative errors with taut system are relatively larger the reason is that the mooring induced damping of taut mooring system is larger than that of catenary or semi taut mooring system thus the error during calculating and designing the truncated mooring system may take larger effect 3 in heave direction the motion responses of platform with full depth and truncated mooring system fit well with each other almost all the relative errors of motion statistics are below 5 4 in pitch direction the motion responses of platform with truncated mooring system fit well with those with full depth mooring system the relative errors are larger than those in the surge and heave directions however actually the absolute error is small enough designing by use of the innovative approach the equivalent truncated mooring system could be a good replacement for the full depth mooring system so that wave basins may be sufficiently large to conduct physical model test in reasonable scale without numerical extrapolation in addition the effects of different truncation factors and the applicability analysis for the spar platform with asymmetrical mooring systems will be studied in the future acknowledgments this paper was financially supported by the national natural science foundation of china grant no 51709118

23741,the potential of the gulf of urabá to hold a multi purpose port motivated a sediment dynamics study to describe the seasonal sediment concentration patterns in this tropical region challenges addressed in this study include a complex three dimensional flow pattern in a tropical estuary and the lack of in situ measurements to overcome such challenges this study completed i measurements of suspended sediment concentrations during two climatic seasons and an extreme event 2010 2011 ii definition of boundary conditions from global databases iii qualitative analysis of sediment concentrations from satellite imagery and iv integration of the previously mentioned steps to build a process based 3d sediment transport model seasonal patterns of suspended sediment concentrations were identified and corroborated by the agreement between model results satellite imagery and field measurements during the calm rainy season the atrato river turbid plume extends northward and dominates the sediment dynamics in the gulf on the other hand during the dry season and extreme events bed transport is enhanced and the river s plume and the littoral drift shift southwards keywords sediment transport model atrato river plume delft3d data scarcity estuarine dynamics 1 introduction the strategic location of the gulf of urabá in the southernmost portion of the caribbean sea as well as the export quality banana produced in the region make this tropical estuary of particular interest for governmental plans related to the construction of a multi purpose port and an interoceanic channel bird 2010 cámara de comercio de medellín para antioquia 2006 hubach 1930 to achieve these development plans understanding the sediment dynamics of the gulf has become a priority especially because it could lead to a long term solution to sedimentation and erosion problems in the region the former occurring in bahia colombia and the navigational channels in the deltas of the atrato and león rivers and the latter taking place on the east coast of the gulf where erosion rates up to 0 5 m yr have been reported correa and vernette 2004 posada and henao 2008 velasquez and rave 1996 however the lack of measurements or a systematic program to collect oceanographic and atmospheric data in the gulf including the atrato river delta increases the challenges to complete sediment dynamic studies in the region the factors controlling the sediment dynamics in coastal and estuarine zones are both naturally and anthropogenically originated stanica et al 2007 syvitski and milliman 2007 van rijn 1993 walling 2006 within the gulf of urabá forces due to river discharges waves winds and density gradients are responsible for the hydrodynamics and sediment transport bernal et al 2005 chevillot et al 1993 escobar 2011 montoya and toro 2006 velasquez and escobar 2012 the human impacts have also been studied in this area by correa and vernette 2004 and correa et al 2005 who identified the relocation of the mouth of the turbo river and the unplanned construction of groins and seawalls as anthropogenic causes of erosion the regional and local importance of the gulf of urabá have led to multiple studies performed to identify its sediment circulation some of them based on satellite imagery molina et al 1992 turbidity measurements chevillot et al 1993 and seabed granulometric parameters álvarez and bernal 2007 despite the importance of these studies they could not cover the 3d circulation structure of the gulf later montoya 2010 presented a numerical model which overcame that restriction but the scarce measurements of currents suspended sediment concentration ssc and the disregard of wave effects limited the evaluation of the modeled sediment dynamics this study aims to describe seasonal sediment concentrations patterns in the gulf of urabá by means of a 3d sediment transport model that includes the influence of the wind waves tides river discharges and density gradients this model was built over a validated hydrodynamic model of the study area escobar et al 2015 to verify the reliability of the sediment transport model calibration and validation were completed through quantitative comparisons at 314 locations where ssc samples were obtained in three separate field campaigns moreover the model was qualitatively validated by comparing its results with observed sediment concentration patterns on satellite images 2 study area the gulf of urabá is located in the southernmost zone of the caribbean sea as shown in fig 1 its northwest cape known as cabo tiburón delimits the republics of colombia and panama just where south america begins the gulf s maximum depth reaches 75 m at the north and progressively reduces along its central axis until the southernmost area called bahia colombia which has maximum depths of 25 m the gulf s width varies between 49 and 6 km its narrowest area is the result of the constriction generated by the atrato river bird foot delta which drains in oceanic waters through seven main mouths according to the classification by galloway 1975 the atrato delta is river dominated and has a major role in the hydrodynamics and sediment transport in the gulf escobar 2011 montoya and toro 2006 this river drains one of the rainiest regions of the world with an average annual precipitation that exceeds 12500 mm mesa et al 1997 and a drainage area of 35000 km2 measurements performed within this study captured atrato river discharges between 4000 and 5000 m3 s and ssc up to 120 mg l a summary of the discharge and solid input from atrato s main mouths is presented in fig 1 where the relative contribution of el roto leoncito and matuntugo distributaries is also shown these values constitute the only measurements available on river discharges about 22 smaller rivers than the atrato river also discharge their water in the gulf among them the león turbo and acandí stand out the first two are located on the east coast the migration of the intertropical convergence zone itcz generates two seasons in the gulf poveda and mesa 1997 during the rainy season between may and november the itcz is located over the gulf causing high rates of precipitation of about 200 mm month cioh 2010 and weak winds from different directions from december to april during the dry season the itcz is located to the south of the gulf generating northerly trade winds that can reach 9 4 m s in february chevillot et al 1993 the gulf has a micro tidal regime with mixed semidiurnal tides the tidal range at the northern boundary is less than 0 5 m although there is not a complete characterization of the wave climate in the region it is known to be seasonal data from the wavewatch iii model wwiii indicates a dominant north direction wave periods of about 6 s and mean significant wave heights hs about 0 8 and 1 6 m during the rainy and dry seasons respectively in the northern part of the gulf waves depend on weather conditions out in the caribbean sea swell while in the south they are mainly generated by local meteorological conditions osorio et al 2010 the same authors estimated the wave height with a 35 year return period to be around 5 m high the seasonality of waves and winds influences the currents in the region and the discharge of the atrato river creates a stratified circulation during calm conditions that is modified under energetic events escobar et al 2015 the seabed of the gulf is composed primarily of fine sediments fig 1 nevertheless coarser particles are found in shallow regions especially on the northwest coast and the most protected area of bahia colombia where non cohesive sediments constitute more than 70 of the bed thomas et al 2007 coastal erosion problems are commonly found on the east coast of the gulf whereas continuous dredging is required in the atrato delta and bahia colombia fig 1 due to the high and still unknown rates of sedimentation 3 data 3 1 field data ssc discharge of the atrato river thermohaline conditions waves and water levels measurements of instantaneous ssc were conducted in three separate oceanographic cruises in april 2010 november 2010 and november 2011 more than 1400 km were traversed in a vessel during the three field campaigns which covered two distinct climatic seasons and one extreme weather event for each field campaign measurements of instantaneous ssc were made in the gulf and at the seven main distributaries of the atrato river as close as possible to the river s mouths for a total of 314 samples and 83 samples respectively field campaigns were designed to capture the spatial variability of the ssc the basis for these designs was the spatially varying sediment concentrations that can extend past the nearshore region resulting from the influence of several external forcings driving the dynamics of the gulf escobar et al 2015 measurements of ssc were made instantaneously at the predefined stations indicated in fig 2 this method renders a considerable amount of spatially distributed information at the expense of temporal resolution during the last field campaign in november 2011 the number of ssc samples was increased along the shallow areas of the east coast and the atrato delta to focus data acquisition in areas with high ssc gradients due to wave processes and river outflows measurements of ssc were completed by mechanical sampling using a niskin bottle in each campaign water samples were collected from various locations covering different water depths tidal and lunar phases and climatic seasons sediment concentration was determined i directly by filtering water samples using fiber glass filters gc50 with a pore size of 0 5 μm following the standard protocol 2540 american public health association et al 1998 and ii indirectly by measuring turbidity with a wpa tu140 turbidimeter to define boundary conditions for the model measurements of the discharge of the atrato river in the west coast and the thermohaline distribution along the northern boundary of the study area were completed instantaneous river and thermohaline forcings were measured once per field campaign due to limited availability of acoustic doppler current profilers adcp and conductivity temperature and depth profilers ctd discharges and ssc of the atrato river mouths were measured one at the time therefore these variables are influenced by changes in the river conditions that could have occurred within the sampling periods ranging from a few hours up to one day measurements of the discharge of the smaller atrato river distributaries was completed as far as possible from the main distributary nevertheless this was not always guaranteed due to navigational restrictions in shallow waters the vertical distribution of salinity and temperature was measured at four stations distributed along the gulf s northern boundary as shown in fig 2 an upward looking adcp was deployed for a three month period at a depth of 18 m at the location indicated by a star in fig 2 the adcp continuously recorded water levels and directional waves from august 2010 to november of 2010 including the model s validation period see section 4 4 and the time when hurricane tomas passed through the caribbean water levels were recorded every 20 min while waves every 3 h with a burst time of 20 min and a ping period of 0 5 s the deployment of this instrument was not possible during the first and third oceanographic cruises nevertheless the data obtained during the deployment period was useful to validate secondary sources of boundary conditions i e global models used when field measurements were unavailable sections 3 2 and 4 4 velocity profiles along multiple cross sections were measured in the gulf additionally temperature and salinity profiles were measured at the stations shown in fig 2 this data was used to investigate the hydrodynamics of the region and to evaluate the performance of the hydrodynamic model that constitutes the base of the sediment transport model introduced in this study details on these measurements and the hydrodynamics of the gulf are presented in escobar et al 2015 3 2 global models and pre existent databases tides waves atmospheric conditions bathymetry and sea bed composition data from global models and pre existing databases were used as boundary conditions for the numerical model when observations were unavailable examples of global model data include wave and tide conditions at the northern boundary of the gulf waves were obtained from the third generation wave model wwiii tolman 1997 at the location indicated with a cross in fig 2 tides were extracted from the tide model driver tmd egbert and erofeeva 2002 at the point marked with a diamond in the same figure atmospheric variables such as air temperature relative humidity short wave radiation atmospheric pressure and wind were obtained from local meteorological stations located in turbo and los cedros see triangles in fig 2 the inland location of the stations is expected to influence wind records by reducing their magnitude due to enhanced friction over land however these stations are the only in situ source of meteorological conditions data gaps in the time series of wind records were filled with data from the nasa s quik scatterometer quikscat and advanced scatterometer ascat relative humidity air temperature pressure and cloud cover percentage were obtained from the national center for atmospheric research ncar kalnay et al 1996 and the north american regional reanalysis narr mesinger et al 2006 projects the bathymetry was digitized from the nautical chart of the colombian general maritime direction dimar the discharges of minor tributaries were determined through hydrological balances and the hidrosig software velez et al 2000 seabed composition was defined from the sediment samples taken in 2003 and 2004 and processed by thomas et al 2007 4 numerical model the delft3d modeling platform developed by wl delft hydraulics roelvink and van banning 1994 was used to build the sediment transport model for the gulf of urabá the software suite provides built in coupling of hydrodynamics waves and sediment transport the hydrodynamic model solves the navier stokes equations for an incompressible fluid under the shallow water boussinesq and hydrostatic pressure assumptions deltares 2012 the turbulent fluctuations are included through reynolds stresses and related to the reynolds averaged flow by a κ ε turbulence closure model uittenbogaard et al 1992 the model accounts for the effects of tides density gradients river discharges wind drag and waves waves are computed through the third generation model simulating waves nearshore swan booij et al 1999 the built in online coupling of swan and delft3d allows accounting for wave current interaction processes which are particularly important for sediment dynamics like mass flux due to waves turbulence increase due to breaking waves and enhancement of bed shear stresses reniers et al 2004 validation of the performance of the hydrodynamic and wave modules was completed in a previous phase of this study escobar et al 2015 the sediment transport model presented in this paper builds upon that work the computation of ssc in the model depends on the interaction of currents waves and sediment availability from rivers and bed composition ssc are solved by the three dimensional advection diffusion equation for two sediment types cohesive d50 63 μm and non cohesive d50 150 μm the spatial availability of these types of sediments in the seabed is included in the model according to the distribution shown in fig 1 settling velocity of non cohesive particles is calculated based on their size using van rijn s 2007b formulation on the other hand settling velocity of cohesive sediments was calibrated in two sub regions differentiated by their exposure to wave action see section 4 3 this spatially varying calibration was completed to partially account for processes that are not fully implemented in delft3d like flocculation and breakup of sediment flocs due to variable turbulence and salinity the exchange of sediments between the bed and the flow is solved by means of mathematical formulations that compute the erosive or depositional response of the bottom to bed shear stress upward diffusion and settling velocity for cohesive sediments the fluxes between the bed and the flow are calculated with the partheniades krone formulations partherniades 1965 for non cohesive particles the same process is modeled using van rijn 2007a sink and source terms acting above a reference height that separates suspended and bed transports the solution of the model through a finite difference scheme leendertse 1967 leendertse et al 1973 stelling 1983 required the construction of a curvilinear grid with 21961 cells the spatial resolution of the grid varies between 37 m in the narrowest region of the gulf and 1200 m in the northern boundary the grid has finer cells near the atrato river delta where more complicated dynamics were anticipated to capture the 3d dynamics of the gulf a sigma grid phillips 1957 with 20 depth variable layers was used in the vertical direction the near surface and bottom layers are the thinnest layers aimed to capture the atrato s plume and near bed transport all model s modules flow wave and sediment transport used the same spatial discretization details of the grid and locations of boundary forcings are presented in fig 2 4 1 spatial sensitivity analysis to identify the most relevant factors in the computation of ssc spatial sensitivity analyses to numerical and physical parameters were completed under relatively calm weather conditions pairs of simulations including and excluding external forcings or considering different values of the parameters were run i e with and without waves horizontal eddy viscosity set to 1 10 and 100 etc the relevance of the parameters was estimated at each grid cell based on the difference in modeled ssc for each pair of simulations as a result the method confirmed the spatial extent in which each parameter had the most influence fig 3 shows the discrepancies of ssc obtained from pairs of simulations involving three of the most important forcings in the gulf waves thermohaline processes and the discharge of the atrato river positive differences dark colors indicate an increase in ssc caused by the external forcing while negative values imply an increase in ssc when neglecting the forcing the inclusion of waves in the model resulted in an overall increase of ssc in the study area as expected wave effects are enhanced in shallow waters along the coast and in the atrato river delta where sediment transport capacity is higher due to wave bottom interaction and wave breaking on the other hand under the calm conditions considered in this sensitivity analysis the southernmost part of the gulf bahia colombia seems to be well protected from wave s action nonetheless it should be noted that high energy events can disrupt the dynamics in bahia colombia osorio et al 2010 escobar et al 2015 density gradients thermohaline forcing and the atrato river discharge are highly relevant in the advection processes near the atrato delta as shown in fig 3 in the delta the spatial extent of the river s plume is influenced by the discharge and density gradients between the river and the gulf the model simulates a larger plume when density gradients are considered meaning that a less dense turbid and buoyant plume travels farther than one with the same density of the sea the inclusion of thermohaline processes resulted in a reduction of ssc along the west coast the plume preventing waves from reaching the west coast may explain this unexpected result on the other hand when density gradients are neglected waves become the dominant process in the generation of ssc in the shallow areas of the northwest coast in addition to external forcings physical parameters of the model were included in the sensitivity analysis details of this analysis and consideration of other parameters can be found in velásquez and escobar 2012 and velásquez 2011 who found the manning roughness coefficient eddy viscosity and diffusivity settling velocity erosion parameter and critical bed shear stress for erosion to be the most important physical parameters for the computation of ssc in the gulf 4 2 statistical evaluation of the model to compare measured and simulated ssc model outputs were extracted at the grid node closest in space and time to each sampling station the accuracy of the model to predict ssc was determined by means of the mean absolute error mae which is not heavily influenced by outliers the relative mean absolute error rmae and the adjusted relative mean absolute error armae which takes into account the observational error oe of measurements and laboratory procedures sutherland et al 2004a an oe 4 67 mg l was computed as the mean difference of duplicate analysis of five randomly selected water samples with different concentrations per field campaign the statistical parameters were calculated based on equations 1 3 as defined by sutherland et al 2004a the angular brackets denote average vertical lines symbolize absolute values modulus y and x are simulated and measured ssc respectively 1 m a e y x 2 r m a e m a e x 3 a r m a e y x o e x 4 3 calibration calibration was performed during a rainy season from november 18th to december 3rd 2011 during this period the wind had variable directions and waves approached the study area primarily from the northeast with hs lower than 1 5 m the average relative humidity and temperature were 86 and 27 c respectively the ssc out of atrato river mouths was approximately 90 mg l details of boundary conditions used to force the calibration simulations can be found in fig 4 the calibration was used to determine the value of 12 unknown physical parameters in the model see table 1 that led to the best fit between modeled and measured superficial ssc at 78 sampling stations see fig 4 of the 12 parameters analyzed during the calibration the manning roughness coefficient the critical bed shear stress the eddy viscosity and diffusivity and the settling velocity of fine particles were found to be essential variables to accurately reproduce observed ssc to represent wave exposed areas in the north and wave protected areas in the south of the gulf a spatial calibration of settling velocities horizontal and vertical eddy viscosity and diffusivity coefficients was completed the spatial variation of manning s roughness coefficient was defined dependent on water depth and proximity to the atrato delta for example a higher manning at depths 30 m and lower manning at deeper regions the erosion parameter was varied spatially according to the presence of seabed vegetation on the west coast of bahia colombia the final calibrated parameters are presented in table 1 the mae rmae and armae for the calibration period are 5 06 mg l 0 68 and 0 40 respectively the spatial distribution of the observed and modeled ssc for the calibration period is presented in fig 4 this figure depicts three ssc features i the highest ssc were simulated and measured in the deltas of the atrato león and east coast rivers from which the sediment is dispersed to deeper waters ii intermediate ssc up to 15 mg l were captured by the model in the northwest coast and along the east coast between turbo and necocli iii low ssc were computed and measured in the north and along the central axis of the gulf abrupt changes in ssc near the atrato delta point out the existence of strong concentration gradients most of them are successfully captured by the model gradients not captured in the simulations are likely caused by the unavailability of in situ data to force the model e g river discharge hydrographs and wind measurements despite the simplification of these parameters most of the simulated ssc are within a factor of 2 or within the oe with respect to observations the values of the calibrated parameters were defined through the one at a time process in which the model accuracy is the main target saltelli et al 2000 this methodology allowed changing each parameter starting with the more relevant as determined in section 4 1 until a final model configuration generated the best fit between observations and modeled ssc as an additional verification of the reliability of fine sediments related parameters their final values were compared with reported values in laboratory field and numerical studies hwang and mehta 1989 van rijn 1989 briaud et al 2004 van ledden et al 2006 and portela et al 2013 it was found that calibrated values lie inside the range of reported values in different investigations 4 4 validation the model validation was completed for a week in november 2010 when hurricane tomas was passing through the caribbean generating hs of 2 3 m at the entrance of the gulf of urabá mae rmae and armae were used to evaluate the performance of the model at 30 monitoring stations 28 of which provided data at 0 3 5 and 10 m depth the remaining two stations provide superficial data only measured and simulated ssc at different depths are presented in fig 5 the range of measured ssc for the validation period varied from 3 4 to 48 4 mg l with the highest ssc located at the surface the lower range of ssc with respect to the calibration period results from measurements performed far from the coast at locations with depths exceeding 10 m constraints to sample shallow waters include a ship with a draft of 5 m and the choppy conditions consequence of hurricane tomas measured water levels and waves near the model boundary adcp deployment were used to force the numerical model during the validation period it was assumed that boundary conditions from field measurements lead to a better model performance than data from global models wwiii and tmd to verify this assumption and to estimate the error caused by using data from global models as boundary conditions four types of simulations forced with data from different sources were completed the sources of tidal and wave boundary conditions for each type of simulation were i field measurements ii tmd and wwiii global models iii tmd and wave measurements and iv tide measurements and wwiii type i simulation resulted in mae 3 53 mg l rmae 0 68 and armae 0 24 the mae at 0 3 5 and 10 m depth were 5 1 2 6 2 6 and 3 5 mg l respectively the larger error at the surface is explained by the high superficial concentration at one station in front of the matutungo mouth indicated in fig 5 that was not captured by the model if this point were to be excluded from the analysis the mae would have remained constant in depth overall the model tended to underestimate ssc on the surface and to overestimate ssc past 5 m depth the best accuracy was reached at 3 and 5 m depth with a mae of 2 6 mg l comparison of type i and ii simulations indicate a 6 8 improvement on simulated ssc by forcing the model with observed tides and waves type i instead of using data from global models type ii comparison of type i iii and iv simulations indicate that observed tides account for 1 7 of improvement in model performance while measured waves account for 5 the effect of restricted measurements of the atrato river discharges and winds could not be isolated nor verified but it is expected that simplifications in these variables could lead to higher model inaccuracies due to their relevance on the dynamics of the gulf results of the validation simulation indicate that the extent of the atrato river plume was constricted and the typical northward orientation of the river s plume was shifted southwards following the direction of stronger winds and waves model results also indicate that nearshore currents generated by high energy waves increased sediment transport to the south along the entire east coast resulting in ssc comparable to those simulated in the atrato delta the incoming storm waves did not have major effects on ssc along the northwest coast where bed resistance is higher due to predominantly larger sediment sizes a similar response was found in the southwest coast of bahia colombia where a lower erosion parameter was set to account for underwater vegetation effects high ssc modeled in near bed layers during the validation period could not be verified due to unavailability of near bed ssc observations however model results suggest the existence of hyperpycnal flows mulder et al 2003 friedrichs and wright 2004 traykovski et al 2007 which is consistent with the findings of escobar et al 2015 who hypothesized that these flows could exist in the gulf of urabá an additional evaluation of the model was completed for april 2010 under dry season conditions validation 2 for this second validation period turbidity measurements were available and ssc were defined indirectly from a correlation curve between turbidity and ssc with r2 0 77 and mean uncertainty of 8 mg l the correlation curve was built from simultaneous sampling of ssc and turbidity measurements using a wpa tu140 turbidimeter simultaneous sampling locations correspond to measuring stations for november 2010 shown in fig 2 the comparison between modeled and turbidity originated superficial ssc resulted in mae rmae and armae of 6 42 mg l 0 81 and 0 33 respectively absolute and relative errors increased with respect to previous validation and calibration periods this underperformance of the model could be partly explained by the use of a correlation instead of direct measurements of ssc the summary of the errors for the calibration and validation periods is presented in table 2 4 5 model performance van rijn et al 2002 introduced an evaluation method for hydrodynamic models with qualitative ratings for model performance similarly sutherland et al 2004b proposed a classification of morphological model performance based on their brier skill scores such methodologies are not yet defined for sediment transport models winter 2007 thus following the evaluation methodology of davies et al 2002 predicted ssc are considered accurate within a factor of 2 of measured data in accordance with this evaluation method a graphical comparison between simulated and observed concentrations is presented in fig 6 for the calibration period rainy season 79 of the simulated ssc fall within a factor of 2 or the oe of the measured ssc this percentage is 87 for the first validation period extreme event and 38 for the second validation period dry season larger inaccuracies during the second validation can be partly explained by the indirect measuring approach model limitations due to the lack of continuous measurements of boundary conditions and the simplified formulations for cohesive sediment transport are additional sources of errors for all the evaluation periods a comparison of the calibration validation 1 and validation 2 are shown in fig 6 the left panel in this figure calibration shows a wide range of ssc values up to 100 mg l during this period measurements were performed from a small boat that allowed collection of water samples from deep waters up to very shallow areas affected by river discharges and wave action under the calm conditions of this period the model accurately reproduced high ssc near river deltas main distributaries of the atrato and león river and intermediate to low ssc along the east coast and deep waters respectively fig 6 center and right validation 1 and 2 show a lower range of measured ssc up to 48 mg l consequence of measurements completed in deep waters relatively far from river deltas and the coastline overall the model is reasonably accurate in predicting ssc in the gulf of urabá the model results concur with previous studies of sediment transport in the region molina et al 1992 chevillot et al 1993 in addition the statistical parameters obtained during the evaluation provide additional confidence in the model performance however it is noted that the accuracy of the model near the bed was not tested and it is still uncertain 5 seasonal sediment dynamics one month long simulations of the dry and rainy seasons were run to identify the seasonal variability of the ssc in the gulf of urabá the length of the simulations allows investigating ssc variations within a tidal cycle and a tidal month to observe the response of ssc during an extreme event an additional five day simulation with high energy forcings reported in the literature chevillot et al 1993 osorio et al 2010 was also set up all scenarios began from hot start simulations were hydrodynamic stability had been reached a summary of the boundary conditions for each scenario is presented in table 3 solid and flow discharges at the atrato mouths were set to the measured values in the field campaigns at each season for each simulation wave and wind forcings were fixed at constant typical values while tides shortwave radiation air temperature and relative humidity were set at temporally variable values fig 7 shows the superficial ssc patterns in the gulf for two seasons and an extreme event simulated ssc correspond to spring tide variations of ssc within the tidal cycle flood and ebb and tidal month spring and neap were found to be of least amount therefore they were not included in the figure the bottom panels in fig 7 correspond to the spatial extents marked by red squares in the figures at the top panels the vectors in the bottom of fig 7 indicate the magnitude and direction of the superficial rainy and dry seasons and depth averaged high energy event velocity within the gulf depth averaged velocity is superimposed over the ssc on the high energy event because mix and turbulence processes are enhanced due to high winds and waves therefore less flow stratification is expected for this scenario satellite images from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis at corresponding seasons and extreme event are also shown in fig 7 middle these images were chosen for specific days when wind and wave conditions approximately coincided to those used in the model simulations table 3 because constant marine fluvial and wind forcings were used in the simulations a perfect fit between satellite and modeled superficial ssc was not expected however a qualitative good agreement between predicted and observed superficial ssc was obtained as shown in modeled and observed patterns a to j in fig 7 the simulation of the rainy season in combination with the satellite image allowed determining the following general ssc patterns letters indicate location of the pattern in fig 7 a the sediment discharge in the main mouths of the atrato delta forms turbid plumes driven northwards by superficial currents except by that of the leoncito mouth whose plume is initially driven southwards following the orientation of its channel b wave energy concentration in headlands along the east coast enhances ssc these sediments are driven northwards by currents that keep them in a narrow strip along the coast c the discharge of the león river generates a small plume directed toward the center of bahia colombia d sediments resuspension in the wave exposed region of punta caribaná is driven by currents with a dominant northeast direction during the dry season and extreme event fig 7 center and right northerly winds and waves induce the following ssc patterns e the león river plume gets mixed with the suspended sediments transported by the littoral drift and reaches farther into the center of bahia colombia f the littoral drift moves southward along the east coast this longshore current is stronger and opposite in direction to that of the rainy season the spatial extent and magnitude of the littoral drift depend on the strength of the marine forces but in the most energetic scenarios it can flow almost continuously north to south from punta caribaná to bahia colombia h and i g sediment discharge of the atrato river typically heading north during calm weather is blocked and even turned southwards thus suspended sediments are dispersed across the central part of the gulf j under the extreme event the plume of the león river can merge with the littoral drift and continue moving to the southernmost part of bahia colombia from where it deviates northwards due to the convergence of opposing currents fig 8 presents the modeled ssc along cross and longitudinal sections indicated in fig 2 for the characteristic seasons and the high energy event described in table 3 in the rainy season near surface ssc are generated by the plumes of the distributaries of the atrato river on the other hand during high energy events increase of wave forces change the previous pattern and near bed sediment transport becomes relevant further analysis of differences in ssc for the two types of sediments included in the model indicate that non cohesive ssc is usually lower than cohesive ssc during the rainy and dry seasons however during the high energy event near bed sand concentration in the northwest coast can exceed mud concentration in some grid cells near the shore in other shallow areas like punta caribaná non cohesive sediment concentration increases significantly attaining values up to 50 in respect to fine particles in the tarena mouth and the northern coast of turbo this ratio is only 10 6 discussion and conclusions the development of a 3d sediment transport model in a tropical estuary with scarce systematic programs to collect oceanographic fluvial and atmospheric data was possible with overall reasonable accuracy statistical and qualitative evaluation of the model confirmed its fair performance and enabled the determination of seasonal ssc patterns in the gulf during the rainy season river plumes are the main features transporting sediments in the gulf most of the solid discharge of the rivers is transported to the north of the mouths by buoyant jets energetic conditions of the dry season and extreme events in the caribbean sea increase ssc and reverse the sediment dynamics in the gulf in this case northerly winds and waves block river plumes from traveling north and enhance near bed transport and southerly littoral drift in the east coast the first two field campaigns in 2010 were designed to have an extensive spatial coverage of the gulf while enabling the identification of regions with high gradients of ssc in the third and last field campaign in 2011 sampling in areas with higher ssc like the atrato delta and near the east coast was increased future work on sediment related studies in the gulf should focus on river deltas el roto matutungo leoncito and león even if it implies a reduction of the spatial extent of samples under this recommendation special attention must be given to the management of navigation risks over shallow and uncharted waters numerical modeling and in situ measurements were integrated to determine sediment concentration patterns in the gulf of urabá this approach worked for the rainy season but it was not effective for energetic conditions due to reduced nearshore measurements of ssc to overcome this issue satellite images were incorporated in this research these images were crucial to adjust the model for extreme oceanographic and atmospheric conditions specifically because they led to i identify the need to divide the model into wave exposed and protected areas where independent calibration processes were required to correct excessive sediment dispersion and over prediction of superficial ssc in bahia colombia ii reduce mud content in shallow areas of punta caribaná and the northwest coast where rocks coral reefs and coarse sediments compose the seabed iii reduce the erosion factor in shallow areas of the southwest coast bahia colombia where vegetation covers the marine bed the latter significantly reduced fine sediment entrainment and led to a better qualitative fit between modeled superficial ssc and satellite images limitations of satellite imagery are related to their spatio temporal resolution the 250 m imagery limits the detection of ssc features to scales larger than hundreds of meters cloud cover is also a limiting factor on the temporal availability of the images especially when the itcz migrates over the gulf the performance of the sediment transport model was evaluated using instantaneous values of ssc measured in each field campaign at predefined stations indicated in fig 2 this type of model evaluation is particularly challenging because the observed ssc are the result of unsteady forcings with stochastic nature e g winds tides waves thermohaline conditions and river discharges for which in situ measurements are unavailable set up of boundary conditions for the sediment transport model was possible by using data from global models nevertheless it should be noted that using this data to force local models is expected to generate additional inaccuracies in the results of small scale simulations to quantify this additional error comparison of model results forced with boundary conditions from both in situ measurements and global models november 2010 validation 1 were performed forcing the model with observed waves and tides improves the accuracy of simulated ssc up to 6 8 this verification could not be made for atmospheric conditions and the discharge of the atrato river for which in situ measurements are expected to improve the model results limitations of the model include the simplified formulations for cohesive sediment transport in stratified flows available in delft3d in which processes like flocculation and floc breakup are not fully implemented model results showed an important increase of near bottom ssc during extreme events in respect to calm conditions however simulated near bed ssc could not be verified due to the unavailability of near bottom measurements to further improve this sediment transport model ssc sampling near the bed during high energy events could be used to verify the formation of hyperpycnal flow as well as definition of bed sediment properties e g size specific density and fine content bathymetric measurements in the atrato delta and regions with depths 3 m would also be useful to enhance the representation of the bottom in nearshore regions acknowledgments field data and modeling tools used in this study were obtained from the research project coastal erosion

23741,the potential of the gulf of urabá to hold a multi purpose port motivated a sediment dynamics study to describe the seasonal sediment concentration patterns in this tropical region challenges addressed in this study include a complex three dimensional flow pattern in a tropical estuary and the lack of in situ measurements to overcome such challenges this study completed i measurements of suspended sediment concentrations during two climatic seasons and an extreme event 2010 2011 ii definition of boundary conditions from global databases iii qualitative analysis of sediment concentrations from satellite imagery and iv integration of the previously mentioned steps to build a process based 3d sediment transport model seasonal patterns of suspended sediment concentrations were identified and corroborated by the agreement between model results satellite imagery and field measurements during the calm rainy season the atrato river turbid plume extends northward and dominates the sediment dynamics in the gulf on the other hand during the dry season and extreme events bed transport is enhanced and the river s plume and the littoral drift shift southwards keywords sediment transport model atrato river plume delft3d data scarcity estuarine dynamics 1 introduction the strategic location of the gulf of urabá in the southernmost portion of the caribbean sea as well as the export quality banana produced in the region make this tropical estuary of particular interest for governmental plans related to the construction of a multi purpose port and an interoceanic channel bird 2010 cámara de comercio de medellín para antioquia 2006 hubach 1930 to achieve these development plans understanding the sediment dynamics of the gulf has become a priority especially because it could lead to a long term solution to sedimentation and erosion problems in the region the former occurring in bahia colombia and the navigational channels in the deltas of the atrato and león rivers and the latter taking place on the east coast of the gulf where erosion rates up to 0 5 m yr have been reported correa and vernette 2004 posada and henao 2008 velasquez and rave 1996 however the lack of measurements or a systematic program to collect oceanographic and atmospheric data in the gulf including the atrato river delta increases the challenges to complete sediment dynamic studies in the region the factors controlling the sediment dynamics in coastal and estuarine zones are both naturally and anthropogenically originated stanica et al 2007 syvitski and milliman 2007 van rijn 1993 walling 2006 within the gulf of urabá forces due to river discharges waves winds and density gradients are responsible for the hydrodynamics and sediment transport bernal et al 2005 chevillot et al 1993 escobar 2011 montoya and toro 2006 velasquez and escobar 2012 the human impacts have also been studied in this area by correa and vernette 2004 and correa et al 2005 who identified the relocation of the mouth of the turbo river and the unplanned construction of groins and seawalls as anthropogenic causes of erosion the regional and local importance of the gulf of urabá have led to multiple studies performed to identify its sediment circulation some of them based on satellite imagery molina et al 1992 turbidity measurements chevillot et al 1993 and seabed granulometric parameters álvarez and bernal 2007 despite the importance of these studies they could not cover the 3d circulation structure of the gulf later montoya 2010 presented a numerical model which overcame that restriction but the scarce measurements of currents suspended sediment concentration ssc and the disregard of wave effects limited the evaluation of the modeled sediment dynamics this study aims to describe seasonal sediment concentrations patterns in the gulf of urabá by means of a 3d sediment transport model that includes the influence of the wind waves tides river discharges and density gradients this model was built over a validated hydrodynamic model of the study area escobar et al 2015 to verify the reliability of the sediment transport model calibration and validation were completed through quantitative comparisons at 314 locations where ssc samples were obtained in three separate field campaigns moreover the model was qualitatively validated by comparing its results with observed sediment concentration patterns on satellite images 2 study area the gulf of urabá is located in the southernmost zone of the caribbean sea as shown in fig 1 its northwest cape known as cabo tiburón delimits the republics of colombia and panama just where south america begins the gulf s maximum depth reaches 75 m at the north and progressively reduces along its central axis until the southernmost area called bahia colombia which has maximum depths of 25 m the gulf s width varies between 49 and 6 km its narrowest area is the result of the constriction generated by the atrato river bird foot delta which drains in oceanic waters through seven main mouths according to the classification by galloway 1975 the atrato delta is river dominated and has a major role in the hydrodynamics and sediment transport in the gulf escobar 2011 montoya and toro 2006 this river drains one of the rainiest regions of the world with an average annual precipitation that exceeds 12500 mm mesa et al 1997 and a drainage area of 35000 km2 measurements performed within this study captured atrato river discharges between 4000 and 5000 m3 s and ssc up to 120 mg l a summary of the discharge and solid input from atrato s main mouths is presented in fig 1 where the relative contribution of el roto leoncito and matuntugo distributaries is also shown these values constitute the only measurements available on river discharges about 22 smaller rivers than the atrato river also discharge their water in the gulf among them the león turbo and acandí stand out the first two are located on the east coast the migration of the intertropical convergence zone itcz generates two seasons in the gulf poveda and mesa 1997 during the rainy season between may and november the itcz is located over the gulf causing high rates of precipitation of about 200 mm month cioh 2010 and weak winds from different directions from december to april during the dry season the itcz is located to the south of the gulf generating northerly trade winds that can reach 9 4 m s in february chevillot et al 1993 the gulf has a micro tidal regime with mixed semidiurnal tides the tidal range at the northern boundary is less than 0 5 m although there is not a complete characterization of the wave climate in the region it is known to be seasonal data from the wavewatch iii model wwiii indicates a dominant north direction wave periods of about 6 s and mean significant wave heights hs about 0 8 and 1 6 m during the rainy and dry seasons respectively in the northern part of the gulf waves depend on weather conditions out in the caribbean sea swell while in the south they are mainly generated by local meteorological conditions osorio et al 2010 the same authors estimated the wave height with a 35 year return period to be around 5 m high the seasonality of waves and winds influences the currents in the region and the discharge of the atrato river creates a stratified circulation during calm conditions that is modified under energetic events escobar et al 2015 the seabed of the gulf is composed primarily of fine sediments fig 1 nevertheless coarser particles are found in shallow regions especially on the northwest coast and the most protected area of bahia colombia where non cohesive sediments constitute more than 70 of the bed thomas et al 2007 coastal erosion problems are commonly found on the east coast of the gulf whereas continuous dredging is required in the atrato delta and bahia colombia fig 1 due to the high and still unknown rates of sedimentation 3 data 3 1 field data ssc discharge of the atrato river thermohaline conditions waves and water levels measurements of instantaneous ssc were conducted in three separate oceanographic cruises in april 2010 november 2010 and november 2011 more than 1400 km were traversed in a vessel during the three field campaigns which covered two distinct climatic seasons and one extreme weather event for each field campaign measurements of instantaneous ssc were made in the gulf and at the seven main distributaries of the atrato river as close as possible to the river s mouths for a total of 314 samples and 83 samples respectively field campaigns were designed to capture the spatial variability of the ssc the basis for these designs was the spatially varying sediment concentrations that can extend past the nearshore region resulting from the influence of several external forcings driving the dynamics of the gulf escobar et al 2015 measurements of ssc were made instantaneously at the predefined stations indicated in fig 2 this method renders a considerable amount of spatially distributed information at the expense of temporal resolution during the last field campaign in november 2011 the number of ssc samples was increased along the shallow areas of the east coast and the atrato delta to focus data acquisition in areas with high ssc gradients due to wave processes and river outflows measurements of ssc were completed by mechanical sampling using a niskin bottle in each campaign water samples were collected from various locations covering different water depths tidal and lunar phases and climatic seasons sediment concentration was determined i directly by filtering water samples using fiber glass filters gc50 with a pore size of 0 5 μm following the standard protocol 2540 american public health association et al 1998 and ii indirectly by measuring turbidity with a wpa tu140 turbidimeter to define boundary conditions for the model measurements of the discharge of the atrato river in the west coast and the thermohaline distribution along the northern boundary of the study area were completed instantaneous river and thermohaline forcings were measured once per field campaign due to limited availability of acoustic doppler current profilers adcp and conductivity temperature and depth profilers ctd discharges and ssc of the atrato river mouths were measured one at the time therefore these variables are influenced by changes in the river conditions that could have occurred within the sampling periods ranging from a few hours up to one day measurements of the discharge of the smaller atrato river distributaries was completed as far as possible from the main distributary nevertheless this was not always guaranteed due to navigational restrictions in shallow waters the vertical distribution of salinity and temperature was measured at four stations distributed along the gulf s northern boundary as shown in fig 2 an upward looking adcp was deployed for a three month period at a depth of 18 m at the location indicated by a star in fig 2 the adcp continuously recorded water levels and directional waves from august 2010 to november of 2010 including the model s validation period see section 4 4 and the time when hurricane tomas passed through the caribbean water levels were recorded every 20 min while waves every 3 h with a burst time of 20 min and a ping period of 0 5 s the deployment of this instrument was not possible during the first and third oceanographic cruises nevertheless the data obtained during the deployment period was useful to validate secondary sources of boundary conditions i e global models used when field measurements were unavailable sections 3 2 and 4 4 velocity profiles along multiple cross sections were measured in the gulf additionally temperature and salinity profiles were measured at the stations shown in fig 2 this data was used to investigate the hydrodynamics of the region and to evaluate the performance of the hydrodynamic model that constitutes the base of the sediment transport model introduced in this study details on these measurements and the hydrodynamics of the gulf are presented in escobar et al 2015 3 2 global models and pre existent databases tides waves atmospheric conditions bathymetry and sea bed composition data from global models and pre existing databases were used as boundary conditions for the numerical model when observations were unavailable examples of global model data include wave and tide conditions at the northern boundary of the gulf waves were obtained from the third generation wave model wwiii tolman 1997 at the location indicated with a cross in fig 2 tides were extracted from the tide model driver tmd egbert and erofeeva 2002 at the point marked with a diamond in the same figure atmospheric variables such as air temperature relative humidity short wave radiation atmospheric pressure and wind were obtained from local meteorological stations located in turbo and los cedros see triangles in fig 2 the inland location of the stations is expected to influence wind records by reducing their magnitude due to enhanced friction over land however these stations are the only in situ source of meteorological conditions data gaps in the time series of wind records were filled with data from the nasa s quik scatterometer quikscat and advanced scatterometer ascat relative humidity air temperature pressure and cloud cover percentage were obtained from the national center for atmospheric research ncar kalnay et al 1996 and the north american regional reanalysis narr mesinger et al 2006 projects the bathymetry was digitized from the nautical chart of the colombian general maritime direction dimar the discharges of minor tributaries were determined through hydrological balances and the hidrosig software velez et al 2000 seabed composition was defined from the sediment samples taken in 2003 and 2004 and processed by thomas et al 2007 4 numerical model the delft3d modeling platform developed by wl delft hydraulics roelvink and van banning 1994 was used to build the sediment transport model for the gulf of urabá the software suite provides built in coupling of hydrodynamics waves and sediment transport the hydrodynamic model solves the navier stokes equations for an incompressible fluid under the shallow water boussinesq and hydrostatic pressure assumptions deltares 2012 the turbulent fluctuations are included through reynolds stresses and related to the reynolds averaged flow by a κ ε turbulence closure model uittenbogaard et al 1992 the model accounts for the effects of tides density gradients river discharges wind drag and waves waves are computed through the third generation model simulating waves nearshore swan booij et al 1999 the built in online coupling of swan and delft3d allows accounting for wave current interaction processes which are particularly important for sediment dynamics like mass flux due to waves turbulence increase due to breaking waves and enhancement of bed shear stresses reniers et al 2004 validation of the performance of the hydrodynamic and wave modules was completed in a previous phase of this study escobar et al 2015 the sediment transport model presented in this paper builds upon that work the computation of ssc in the model depends on the interaction of currents waves and sediment availability from rivers and bed composition ssc are solved by the three dimensional advection diffusion equation for two sediment types cohesive d50 63 μm and non cohesive d50 150 μm the spatial availability of these types of sediments in the seabed is included in the model according to the distribution shown in fig 1 settling velocity of non cohesive particles is calculated based on their size using van rijn s 2007b formulation on the other hand settling velocity of cohesive sediments was calibrated in two sub regions differentiated by their exposure to wave action see section 4 3 this spatially varying calibration was completed to partially account for processes that are not fully implemented in delft3d like flocculation and breakup of sediment flocs due to variable turbulence and salinity the exchange of sediments between the bed and the flow is solved by means of mathematical formulations that compute the erosive or depositional response of the bottom to bed shear stress upward diffusion and settling velocity for cohesive sediments the fluxes between the bed and the flow are calculated with the partheniades krone formulations partherniades 1965 for non cohesive particles the same process is modeled using van rijn 2007a sink and source terms acting above a reference height that separates suspended and bed transports the solution of the model through a finite difference scheme leendertse 1967 leendertse et al 1973 stelling 1983 required the construction of a curvilinear grid with 21961 cells the spatial resolution of the grid varies between 37 m in the narrowest region of the gulf and 1200 m in the northern boundary the grid has finer cells near the atrato river delta where more complicated dynamics were anticipated to capture the 3d dynamics of the gulf a sigma grid phillips 1957 with 20 depth variable layers was used in the vertical direction the near surface and bottom layers are the thinnest layers aimed to capture the atrato s plume and near bed transport all model s modules flow wave and sediment transport used the same spatial discretization details of the grid and locations of boundary forcings are presented in fig 2 4 1 spatial sensitivity analysis to identify the most relevant factors in the computation of ssc spatial sensitivity analyses to numerical and physical parameters were completed under relatively calm weather conditions pairs of simulations including and excluding external forcings or considering different values of the parameters were run i e with and without waves horizontal eddy viscosity set to 1 10 and 100 etc the relevance of the parameters was estimated at each grid cell based on the difference in modeled ssc for each pair of simulations as a result the method confirmed the spatial extent in which each parameter had the most influence fig 3 shows the discrepancies of ssc obtained from pairs of simulations involving three of the most important forcings in the gulf waves thermohaline processes and the discharge of the atrato river positive differences dark colors indicate an increase in ssc caused by the external forcing while negative values imply an increase in ssc when neglecting the forcing the inclusion of waves in the model resulted in an overall increase of ssc in the study area as expected wave effects are enhanced in shallow waters along the coast and in the atrato river delta where sediment transport capacity is higher due to wave bottom interaction and wave breaking on the other hand under the calm conditions considered in this sensitivity analysis the southernmost part of the gulf bahia colombia seems to be well protected from wave s action nonetheless it should be noted that high energy events can disrupt the dynamics in bahia colombia osorio et al 2010 escobar et al 2015 density gradients thermohaline forcing and the atrato river discharge are highly relevant in the advection processes near the atrato delta as shown in fig 3 in the delta the spatial extent of the river s plume is influenced by the discharge and density gradients between the river and the gulf the model simulates a larger plume when density gradients are considered meaning that a less dense turbid and buoyant plume travels farther than one with the same density of the sea the inclusion of thermohaline processes resulted in a reduction of ssc along the west coast the plume preventing waves from reaching the west coast may explain this unexpected result on the other hand when density gradients are neglected waves become the dominant process in the generation of ssc in the shallow areas of the northwest coast in addition to external forcings physical parameters of the model were included in the sensitivity analysis details of this analysis and consideration of other parameters can be found in velásquez and escobar 2012 and velásquez 2011 who found the manning roughness coefficient eddy viscosity and diffusivity settling velocity erosion parameter and critical bed shear stress for erosion to be the most important physical parameters for the computation of ssc in the gulf 4 2 statistical evaluation of the model to compare measured and simulated ssc model outputs were extracted at the grid node closest in space and time to each sampling station the accuracy of the model to predict ssc was determined by means of the mean absolute error mae which is not heavily influenced by outliers the relative mean absolute error rmae and the adjusted relative mean absolute error armae which takes into account the observational error oe of measurements and laboratory procedures sutherland et al 2004a an oe 4 67 mg l was computed as the mean difference of duplicate analysis of five randomly selected water samples with different concentrations per field campaign the statistical parameters were calculated based on equations 1 3 as defined by sutherland et al 2004a the angular brackets denote average vertical lines symbolize absolute values modulus y and x are simulated and measured ssc respectively 1 m a e y x 2 r m a e m a e x 3 a r m a e y x o e x 4 3 calibration calibration was performed during a rainy season from november 18th to december 3rd 2011 during this period the wind had variable directions and waves approached the study area primarily from the northeast with hs lower than 1 5 m the average relative humidity and temperature were 86 and 27 c respectively the ssc out of atrato river mouths was approximately 90 mg l details of boundary conditions used to force the calibration simulations can be found in fig 4 the calibration was used to determine the value of 12 unknown physical parameters in the model see table 1 that led to the best fit between modeled and measured superficial ssc at 78 sampling stations see fig 4 of the 12 parameters analyzed during the calibration the manning roughness coefficient the critical bed shear stress the eddy viscosity and diffusivity and the settling velocity of fine particles were found to be essential variables to accurately reproduce observed ssc to represent wave exposed areas in the north and wave protected areas in the south of the gulf a spatial calibration of settling velocities horizontal and vertical eddy viscosity and diffusivity coefficients was completed the spatial variation of manning s roughness coefficient was defined dependent on water depth and proximity to the atrato delta for example a higher manning at depths 30 m and lower manning at deeper regions the erosion parameter was varied spatially according to the presence of seabed vegetation on the west coast of bahia colombia the final calibrated parameters are presented in table 1 the mae rmae and armae for the calibration period are 5 06 mg l 0 68 and 0 40 respectively the spatial distribution of the observed and modeled ssc for the calibration period is presented in fig 4 this figure depicts three ssc features i the highest ssc were simulated and measured in the deltas of the atrato león and east coast rivers from which the sediment is dispersed to deeper waters ii intermediate ssc up to 15 mg l were captured by the model in the northwest coast and along the east coast between turbo and necocli iii low ssc were computed and measured in the north and along the central axis of the gulf abrupt changes in ssc near the atrato delta point out the existence of strong concentration gradients most of them are successfully captured by the model gradients not captured in the simulations are likely caused by the unavailability of in situ data to force the model e g river discharge hydrographs and wind measurements despite the simplification of these parameters most of the simulated ssc are within a factor of 2 or within the oe with respect to observations the values of the calibrated parameters were defined through the one at a time process in which the model accuracy is the main target saltelli et al 2000 this methodology allowed changing each parameter starting with the more relevant as determined in section 4 1 until a final model configuration generated the best fit between observations and modeled ssc as an additional verification of the reliability of fine sediments related parameters their final values were compared with reported values in laboratory field and numerical studies hwang and mehta 1989 van rijn 1989 briaud et al 2004 van ledden et al 2006 and portela et al 2013 it was found that calibrated values lie inside the range of reported values in different investigations 4 4 validation the model validation was completed for a week in november 2010 when hurricane tomas was passing through the caribbean generating hs of 2 3 m at the entrance of the gulf of urabá mae rmae and armae were used to evaluate the performance of the model at 30 monitoring stations 28 of which provided data at 0 3 5 and 10 m depth the remaining two stations provide superficial data only measured and simulated ssc at different depths are presented in fig 5 the range of measured ssc for the validation period varied from 3 4 to 48 4 mg l with the highest ssc located at the surface the lower range of ssc with respect to the calibration period results from measurements performed far from the coast at locations with depths exceeding 10 m constraints to sample shallow waters include a ship with a draft of 5 m and the choppy conditions consequence of hurricane tomas measured water levels and waves near the model boundary adcp deployment were used to force the numerical model during the validation period it was assumed that boundary conditions from field measurements lead to a better model performance than data from global models wwiii and tmd to verify this assumption and to estimate the error caused by using data from global models as boundary conditions four types of simulations forced with data from different sources were completed the sources of tidal and wave boundary conditions for each type of simulation were i field measurements ii tmd and wwiii global models iii tmd and wave measurements and iv tide measurements and wwiii type i simulation resulted in mae 3 53 mg l rmae 0 68 and armae 0 24 the mae at 0 3 5 and 10 m depth were 5 1 2 6 2 6 and 3 5 mg l respectively the larger error at the surface is explained by the high superficial concentration at one station in front of the matutungo mouth indicated in fig 5 that was not captured by the model if this point were to be excluded from the analysis the mae would have remained constant in depth overall the model tended to underestimate ssc on the surface and to overestimate ssc past 5 m depth the best accuracy was reached at 3 and 5 m depth with a mae of 2 6 mg l comparison of type i and ii simulations indicate a 6 8 improvement on simulated ssc by forcing the model with observed tides and waves type i instead of using data from global models type ii comparison of type i iii and iv simulations indicate that observed tides account for 1 7 of improvement in model performance while measured waves account for 5 the effect of restricted measurements of the atrato river discharges and winds could not be isolated nor verified but it is expected that simplifications in these variables could lead to higher model inaccuracies due to their relevance on the dynamics of the gulf results of the validation simulation indicate that the extent of the atrato river plume was constricted and the typical northward orientation of the river s plume was shifted southwards following the direction of stronger winds and waves model results also indicate that nearshore currents generated by high energy waves increased sediment transport to the south along the entire east coast resulting in ssc comparable to those simulated in the atrato delta the incoming storm waves did not have major effects on ssc along the northwest coast where bed resistance is higher due to predominantly larger sediment sizes a similar response was found in the southwest coast of bahia colombia where a lower erosion parameter was set to account for underwater vegetation effects high ssc modeled in near bed layers during the validation period could not be verified due to unavailability of near bed ssc observations however model results suggest the existence of hyperpycnal flows mulder et al 2003 friedrichs and wright 2004 traykovski et al 2007 which is consistent with the findings of escobar et al 2015 who hypothesized that these flows could exist in the gulf of urabá an additional evaluation of the model was completed for april 2010 under dry season conditions validation 2 for this second validation period turbidity measurements were available and ssc were defined indirectly from a correlation curve between turbidity and ssc with r2 0 77 and mean uncertainty of 8 mg l the correlation curve was built from simultaneous sampling of ssc and turbidity measurements using a wpa tu140 turbidimeter simultaneous sampling locations correspond to measuring stations for november 2010 shown in fig 2 the comparison between modeled and turbidity originated superficial ssc resulted in mae rmae and armae of 6 42 mg l 0 81 and 0 33 respectively absolute and relative errors increased with respect to previous validation and calibration periods this underperformance of the model could be partly explained by the use of a correlation instead of direct measurements of ssc the summary of the errors for the calibration and validation periods is presented in table 2 4 5 model performance van rijn et al 2002 introduced an evaluation method for hydrodynamic models with qualitative ratings for model performance similarly sutherland et al 2004b proposed a classification of morphological model performance based on their brier skill scores such methodologies are not yet defined for sediment transport models winter 2007 thus following the evaluation methodology of davies et al 2002 predicted ssc are considered accurate within a factor of 2 of measured data in accordance with this evaluation method a graphical comparison between simulated and observed concentrations is presented in fig 6 for the calibration period rainy season 79 of the simulated ssc fall within a factor of 2 or the oe of the measured ssc this percentage is 87 for the first validation period extreme event and 38 for the second validation period dry season larger inaccuracies during the second validation can be partly explained by the indirect measuring approach model limitations due to the lack of continuous measurements of boundary conditions and the simplified formulations for cohesive sediment transport are additional sources of errors for all the evaluation periods a comparison of the calibration validation 1 and validation 2 are shown in fig 6 the left panel in this figure calibration shows a wide range of ssc values up to 100 mg l during this period measurements were performed from a small boat that allowed collection of water samples from deep waters up to very shallow areas affected by river discharges and wave action under the calm conditions of this period the model accurately reproduced high ssc near river deltas main distributaries of the atrato and león river and intermediate to low ssc along the east coast and deep waters respectively fig 6 center and right validation 1 and 2 show a lower range of measured ssc up to 48 mg l consequence of measurements completed in deep waters relatively far from river deltas and the coastline overall the model is reasonably accurate in predicting ssc in the gulf of urabá the model results concur with previous studies of sediment transport in the region molina et al 1992 chevillot et al 1993 in addition the statistical parameters obtained during the evaluation provide additional confidence in the model performance however it is noted that the accuracy of the model near the bed was not tested and it is still uncertain 5 seasonal sediment dynamics one month long simulations of the dry and rainy seasons were run to identify the seasonal variability of the ssc in the gulf of urabá the length of the simulations allows investigating ssc variations within a tidal cycle and a tidal month to observe the response of ssc during an extreme event an additional five day simulation with high energy forcings reported in the literature chevillot et al 1993 osorio et al 2010 was also set up all scenarios began from hot start simulations were hydrodynamic stability had been reached a summary of the boundary conditions for each scenario is presented in table 3 solid and flow discharges at the atrato mouths were set to the measured values in the field campaigns at each season for each simulation wave and wind forcings were fixed at constant typical values while tides shortwave radiation air temperature and relative humidity were set at temporally variable values fig 7 shows the superficial ssc patterns in the gulf for two seasons and an extreme event simulated ssc correspond to spring tide variations of ssc within the tidal cycle flood and ebb and tidal month spring and neap were found to be of least amount therefore they were not included in the figure the bottom panels in fig 7 correspond to the spatial extents marked by red squares in the figures at the top panels the vectors in the bottom of fig 7 indicate the magnitude and direction of the superficial rainy and dry seasons and depth averaged high energy event velocity within the gulf depth averaged velocity is superimposed over the ssc on the high energy event because mix and turbulence processes are enhanced due to high winds and waves therefore less flow stratification is expected for this scenario satellite images from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis at corresponding seasons and extreme event are also shown in fig 7 middle these images were chosen for specific days when wind and wave conditions approximately coincided to those used in the model simulations table 3 because constant marine fluvial and wind forcings were used in the simulations a perfect fit between satellite and modeled superficial ssc was not expected however a qualitative good agreement between predicted and observed superficial ssc was obtained as shown in modeled and observed patterns a to j in fig 7 the simulation of the rainy season in combination with the satellite image allowed determining the following general ssc patterns letters indicate location of the pattern in fig 7 a the sediment discharge in the main mouths of the atrato delta forms turbid plumes driven northwards by superficial currents except by that of the leoncito mouth whose plume is initially driven southwards following the orientation of its channel b wave energy concentration in headlands along the east coast enhances ssc these sediments are driven northwards by currents that keep them in a narrow strip along the coast c the discharge of the león river generates a small plume directed toward the center of bahia colombia d sediments resuspension in the wave exposed region of punta caribaná is driven by currents with a dominant northeast direction during the dry season and extreme event fig 7 center and right northerly winds and waves induce the following ssc patterns e the león river plume gets mixed with the suspended sediments transported by the littoral drift and reaches farther into the center of bahia colombia f the littoral drift moves southward along the east coast this longshore current is stronger and opposite in direction to that of the rainy season the spatial extent and magnitude of the littoral drift depend on the strength of the marine forces but in the most energetic scenarios it can flow almost continuously north to south from punta caribaná to bahia colombia h and i g sediment discharge of the atrato river typically heading north during calm weather is blocked and even turned southwards thus suspended sediments are dispersed across the central part of the gulf j under the extreme event the plume of the león river can merge with the littoral drift and continue moving to the southernmost part of bahia colombia from where it deviates northwards due to the convergence of opposing currents fig 8 presents the modeled ssc along cross and longitudinal sections indicated in fig 2 for the characteristic seasons and the high energy event described in table 3 in the rainy season near surface ssc are generated by the plumes of the distributaries of the atrato river on the other hand during high energy events increase of wave forces change the previous pattern and near bed sediment transport becomes relevant further analysis of differences in ssc for the two types of sediments included in the model indicate that non cohesive ssc is usually lower than cohesive ssc during the rainy and dry seasons however during the high energy event near bed sand concentration in the northwest coast can exceed mud concentration in some grid cells near the shore in other shallow areas like punta caribaná non cohesive sediment concentration increases significantly attaining values up to 50 in respect to fine particles in the tarena mouth and the northern coast of turbo this ratio is only 10 6 discussion and conclusions the development of a 3d sediment transport model in a tropical estuary with scarce systematic programs to collect oceanographic fluvial and atmospheric data was possible with overall reasonable accuracy statistical and qualitative evaluation of the model confirmed its fair performance and enabled the determination of seasonal ssc patterns in the gulf during the rainy season river plumes are the main features transporting sediments in the gulf most of the solid discharge of the rivers is transported to the north of the mouths by buoyant jets energetic conditions of the dry season and extreme events in the caribbean sea increase ssc and reverse the sediment dynamics in the gulf in this case northerly winds and waves block river plumes from traveling north and enhance near bed transport and southerly littoral drift in the east coast the first two field campaigns in 2010 were designed to have an extensive spatial coverage of the gulf while enabling the identification of regions with high gradients of ssc in the third and last field campaign in 2011 sampling in areas with higher ssc like the atrato delta and near the east coast was increased future work on sediment related studies in the gulf should focus on river deltas el roto matutungo leoncito and león even if it implies a reduction of the spatial extent of samples under this recommendation special attention must be given to the management of navigation risks over shallow and uncharted waters numerical modeling and in situ measurements were integrated to determine sediment concentration patterns in the gulf of urabá this approach worked for the rainy season but it was not effective for energetic conditions due to reduced nearshore measurements of ssc to overcome this issue satellite images were incorporated in this research these images were crucial to adjust the model for extreme oceanographic and atmospheric conditions specifically because they led to i identify the need to divide the model into wave exposed and protected areas where independent calibration processes were required to correct excessive sediment dispersion and over prediction of superficial ssc in bahia colombia ii reduce mud content in shallow areas of punta caribaná and the northwest coast where rocks coral reefs and coarse sediments compose the seabed iii reduce the erosion factor in shallow areas of the southwest coast bahia colombia where vegetation covers the marine bed the latter significantly reduced fine sediment entrainment and led to a better qualitative fit between modeled superficial ssc and satellite images limitations of satellite imagery are related to their spatio temporal resolution the 250 m imagery limits the detection of ssc features to scales larger than hundreds of meters cloud cover is also a limiting factor on the temporal availability of the images especially when the itcz migrates over the gulf the performance of the sediment transport model was evaluated using instantaneous values of ssc measured in each field campaign at predefined stations indicated in fig 2 this type of model evaluation is particularly challenging because the observed ssc are the result of unsteady forcings with stochastic nature e g winds tides waves thermohaline conditions and river discharges for which in situ measurements are unavailable set up of boundary conditions for the sediment transport model was possible by using data from global models nevertheless it should be noted that using this data to force local models is expected to generate additional inaccuracies in the results of small scale simulations to quantify this additional error comparison of model results forced with boundary conditions from both in situ measurements and global models november 2010 validation 1 were performed forcing the model with observed waves and tides improves the accuracy of simulated ssc up to 6 8 this verification could not be made for atmospheric conditions and the discharge of the atrato river for which in situ measurements are expected to improve the model results limitations of the model include the simplified formulations for cohesive sediment transport in stratified flows available in delft3d in which processes like flocculation and floc breakup are not fully implemented model results showed an important increase of near bottom ssc during extreme events in respect to calm conditions however simulated near bed ssc could not be verified due to the unavailability of near bottom measurements to further improve this sediment transport model ssc sampling near the bed during high energy events could be used to verify the formation of hyperpycnal flow as well as definition of bed sediment properties e g size specific density and fine content bathymetric measurements in the atrato delta and regions with depths 3 m would also be useful to enhance the representation of the bottom in nearshore regions acknowledgments field data and modeling tools used in this study were obtained from the research project coastal erosion

23742,inductive coupling temperature salinity depth mooring cable is an important instrument for measuring deep sea environment however the channel characteristics change depending on the load and marine environment and these characteristics affect the signal transmission reliability in this paper an inductive coupling temperature salinity depth communication system is developed and channel characteristics are derived theoretically the amplitude frequency and phase frequency characteristics in seawater and freshwater environments are measured using the frequency sweep method in laboratory the measured results are compared with the theoretical results the accuracy of the results is verified by recovering a square wave using the measured amplitude frequency and phase frequency characteristics next amplitude shift keying modulation is used to test the signal transmission reliability and the results show that the error rates are high due to the influence of noise finally to improve the signal transmission reliability a concatenated code comprising of reed solomon and convolution code is used the concatenated code can make the error rate less than 1 906 and 6 502 in sea water and fresh water respectively the study provides an important experimental evidence for understanding the channel characteristics and improving signal transmission reliability of inductive coupling temperature salinity depth mooring cable keywords inductive coupling temperature salinity depth communication system frequency sweep method reed solomon and convolution code reliability 1 introduction covering approximately 71 of the earth s surface and representing 90 of the earth s biosphere oceans play a major role in the world charette and smith 2010 the mooring buoys and submersible buoys are the most widely used ocean monitoring platforms for fixed point monitoring of the marine environment the inductive coupling temperature salinity depth mooring cable comprises of a vertical structure with many underwater sensor nodes each sensor node acts as a port for data acquisition and transmission using these sensor nodes the dynamic marine parameters and environmental data can be collected the collected data including information about salinity depth temperature chlorophyll ocean current etc is transferred to overwater buoy system and sent to the coastal control center the control center can provide fast response in real time tomisa et al 2008a for the case of wired cable transmission it is necessary to solve the problems related to the water tightness of the cable the reliability of multi node communication and the winding of cable and anchor in the wireless transmission mode the distance of optical transmission is limited chen et al 2017 the acoustic transmission has the problems of high cost low reliability and the poor synchronization stojanovic and preisig 2009 the transmission using inductive coupling temperature salinity depth mooring cable kojiya et al 2005 yoshioka et al 2007 is based on the principle of inductive coupling the transmission uses the mooring cable as a transmission medium and the anchor system as a part of the transmission link to achieve wireless transmission xiu et al 2012 the transmission using mooring cable provides a robust real time long distance communication suitable for acquiring marine environmental observation data as the detection depth is increasing more underwater sensor nodes are required namely the systems of different detection depths require sensors of different number this leads to the fact that the transmission channels of different detection depths are different the change of the ocean environment influences the impedance parameters of the channel and the amplitude of the signal will be attenuated after passing through the channel therefore the channel has fading characteristics and it is time varying due to the influence of the marine environment the signal is susceptible to various kinds of burst noise and random noise in the transmission process therefore the signal to noise ratio snr of the transmitted signal is low and this results in a low reliability of signal transmission tomisa et al 2008b zheng et al 2016 the method of establishing the circuit model of transmission channel is often used to analyze the transmission channel characteristics of the inductive coupling transmission system wu et al 2016 however the previous works overlooked many uncertain channel impedance parameters which leads to a certain difference between the channel characteristics derived from theoretical circuit model and the actual signal transmission in order to improve the reliability of data transmission over inductive coupling temperature salinity depth mooring cable the method presented in this paper is as follows firstly an inductive coupling temperature salinity depth communication system is developed in laboratory secondly the amplitude frequency and phase frequency characteristics of the seawater and freshwater systems are measured by using the frequency sweep method chen and latchman 1995 chen and niculescu 2004 the measured results are compared with the results of the theoretical circuit model the accuracy of measured results is verified by recovering a square wave signal passed through the system using the measured amplitude frequency and phase frequency characteristics thirdly the error rates the ratio of the number of erroneously received symbols to the total number of transmitted symbols of the system in seawater and freshwater environment are tested using the amplitude shift keying modulation technique the measurement results show that the error rates are high because of the influence of the noise to improve the reliability of transmission channel a concatenated reed solomon and convolution code is used in this paper the transmission characteristics of the inductive coupling channel are described more accurately compared with the theoretical circuit model further high reliability of the transmission signal is achieved using the frequency sweep method and the concatenated reed solomon and convolution code 2 system structure and measurement principle 2 1 system structure the inductive coupling temperature salinity depth mooring cable mainly consists of underwater sensor nodes a mooring cable and overwater control unit the transmission channel is composed of magnetic rings including underwater magnetic rings and overwater magnetic ring a mooring cable and water including sea water and fresh water huang et al 2013 during the measurement the mooring cable and water constitute a closed loop which is equivalent to a single turn coil the underwater sensor nodes are used to collect data about marine information such as temperature and salinity at different depths of the ocean the collected data is sent to the overwater control unit using the magnetic coupling technology fig 1 shows an example of the mooring cable system the circuit model and channel characteristics change with the number of underwater sensor nodes in this paper all the studies are carried out based on the point to point data transmission channel an inductive coupling transmission system was built in the laboratory a cable of 10 m length is placed perpendicularly in a cylindrical bath with a diameter of 3 m and a height of 10 m a set of magnetic rings are placed underwater and overwater along the cable the test platform is composedoftheni usb6259 ni usa signal collection board the agilent 81150 a agilent usa signal generator and the agilent 4249 a agilent usa impedance analyzer theni usb6259 ni usa signal collection board is used to collect data the agilent 81150 a agilent usa signal generator is selected as the signal source and the agilent 4249 a agilent usa impedance analyzer is used for measuring impedance parameters 2 2 the principle of theoretical calculation and actual measurement of channel characteristics the theoretical circuit model of the channel is established and the theoretical calculation process is shown in fig 2 as shown in fig 2 a establishing the channel circuit model is important to analyze transmission channel characteristics a voltage signal e i is input to the underwater magnetic ring and this induces a current in the single turn loop consisting of a mooring cable and water finally the current induces an electromotive force of e o in the overwater magnetic ring the calculation process based on the kirchhoff s voltage law is as follows 1 e i i 1 z 1 j ω m 1 2 i 2 2 j ω m 1 2 i 1 i 2 z 2 0 3 e o j ω m 2 3 i 2 where j is the square root of 1 z 1 j ω l 1 z 2 r r j ω l 2 l 2 m 1 2 l 1 l 2 m 2 3 l 2 l 3 l 2 l 3 z1 is the primary winding impedance oft1 z2 is the secondary winding impedance of t1 m1 2 is the mutual inductance of underwater magnetic ring and single turn loop m2 3 is the mutual inductance of the single turn loop and the underwater magnetic ring l1 is the primary winding inductance of t1 l2 is the inductance of the single turn loop l3 is the secondary winding inductance of t2 r is the resistance of water including freshwater resistance r1 and seawater resistance r2 and r is the resistance of the mooring cable the derivation of output voltage e o based on equations 1 3 is as follows 4 e o l 3 l 1 e i 1 r r 2 ω 2 l 2 2 e j arctan r r ω l 2 the amplitude frequency and phase frequency functions of e o are given by 5 a m p e o e i l 3 l 1 1 r r 2 ω 2 l 2 2 6 ϕ arctan r r ω l 2 in the system we built in the laboratory the values of l1 l2 r r and l3 which are functions of frequency are measured by the agilent 4294 a impedance analyzer and the results are shown in fig 2 b the amplitude frequency and phase frequency characteristics are calculated using equations 5 6 as discussed above the transmission channel characteristic can be analyzed by establishing the theoretical circuit model however the theoretical circuit model neglects some impedance parameters such as the parasitic capacitance between the magnetic coil which are difficult to measure and magnetic coil resistance which has a minor influence on channel characteristic therefore there is a certain error between the theoretical circuit model of the channel and the actual channel the frequency sweep method is used to improve the accuracy of characterization of the transmission channel the measurement process is shown in fig 3 the measurement principle is as follows a sinusoidal signal of certain frequency is input into the linear time invariant system to be measured as shown in fig 3 d the output sinusoidal signal of the same frequency is collected as shown in fig 3 e the amplitude ratio and phase difference of the output signal and the input signal provide the amplitude frequency and phase frequency characteristics of the system at the measured frequency point respectively by changing the frequency of the input signal and measuring the output signal the amplitude ratio and phase difference values at different frequencies are obtained after curve fitting the measured values the amplitude frequency and phase frequency curves of the channel are obtained in the actual measurement of seawater and freshwater systems the amplitude ratio and phase difference between the transmitted signal and received signal at different frequencies are measured using the frequency sweep method the amplitude frequency and phase frequency characteristic curves of the sea and fresh water systems are obtained using the matlab spline interpolation function 2 3 measurement result it can be observed from fig 2 b that when the signal frequency is greater than 100 khz the values of magnetic ring inductance are too small to transmit signal therefore the frequency range of the signal analyzed is selected to be 1 100 khz in the range of 1 10 khz the measurement points are uniformly spaced with a 100 hz separation and in the range of 10 100 khz the measurement points are separated by 500 hz the theoretical and measured amplitude frequency and phase frequency characteristic curves for sea water and fresh water are shown in fig 4 as shown in fig 4 in the theoretical seawater circuit model as the input signal frequency increases from 1 khz to 100 khz the ratio of amplitude increases from 0 013 to 0 7534 and the phase difference reduces from 89 2519 o to 26 6172 o compared with the seawater circuit model the amplitude attenuation of the freshwater circuit model is more severe i e the signal amplitude is smaller in fresh water than in sea water in freshwater circuit model as the frequency of transmitted signal increases from 1 khz to 100 khz the ratio of amplitude increases from 0 00017676 to 0 0144 and the phase difference decreases from 89 9898 o to 89 0195 o as the frequency is increases the amplitude ratio showed a gradually increasing trend and the phase difference showed a gradually decreasing trend in both sea water and fresh water in the actual measurement of seawater system as the frequency increases from 1 khz to 100 khz the ratio of amplitude increases from 0 01438738 to 0 1505784 and the phase difference reduces from 67 68546 o to 12 966 o in the freshwater environment the amplitude ratio increases from 0 006845676 to 0 01972456 and it is smaller than the seawater system the phase difference increases from 3 35969 o to 60 8366375 o and then reduces to 58 19385 o with an increase of transmitted signal frequency the amplitude ratio of both seawater and freshwater systems gradually increases thus this system is a high pass system with the cut off frequency of 100 khz a high pass filter allows a signal with a frequency band above the cut off frequency to pass smoothly and attenuates a signal having a band below the cut off frequency the amplitude attenuation of actual measurement is higher than that of theoretically computed value note that the theoretical circuit model is ideal and it ignores many practical parameters such as the resistance and parasitic capacitance of magnetic coil these parameters cause the mismatch between the results of the actual measurement and the theoretical calculation however the trend of the measurement matches the theoretical trend 2 4 verification of accuracy of measured amplitude frequency and phase frequency characteristics a square wave has an abundant frequency component and can use the fundamental frequency and several odd harmonics hence a square wave is used to verify the correctness and accuracy of the measured results it can be seen from the measurement results in the previous section that the signal distortion is higher at lower frequencies when the frequency is lower than 10 khz the distortion effect of square wave in the freshwater environment is severe a square wave signal of 10 khz is sent through channel the received signal is retrieved according to the amplitude frequency and phase frequency characteristic curves measured by the frequency sweep method as shown in fig 4 the retrieval process is implemented by matlab programming as shown in fig 5 the attenuation of the signal received in the freshwater system is higher than that of the seawater system this is because the resistance of fresh water is larger than that of sea water moreover the distortion of signal waveform in freshwater is also more severe than that of sea water as a result there is a higher error in the recovered signal in the freshwater system this result is consistent with the test result of the system channel characteristics performed using the frequency sweep method and proves the accuracy of the test 3 the measurement and optimization of system transmission performance 3 1 the analysis of error rate of amplitude shift keying modulation the measurement platform of amplitude shift keying modulation technique is set up using the ni usb6259 and the software program is implemented using the labview software the amplitude shift keying modulated signals together with noise in the range of 60 10 db enter the transmission channel through the underwater magnetic ring the acquisition card completes the signal acquisition after the signal passes through the inductive coupling channel the error rates are computed using the received signal at present the sea bird corporation in the united states has mastered inductive coupling transmission technology and applied it to actual marine monitor and the data rate of it is up to 9 6 kbps boyle et al kurz and neal since the maximum frequency of the system measured by the frequency sweep method is 100 khz therefore we select 10 khz 50 khz and 100 khz as the frequency range for the data transmission and the measurement results are shown in fig 6 it can be seen from fig 6 that the transmission signal frequency and the noise power level are the key factors affecting the error rate of the signal in the actual measurement the error rate decreases gradually with the increase of transmission frequency and the error rate of signal transmission in the freshwater environment is greater than that of the seawater environment this observation is consistent with the measured transmission characteristics of the channel and verifies the accuracy of measurement results 3 2 the improvement of signal transmission reliability using reed solomon and convolution code as shown in fig 6 the amplitude shift keying modulation technique has a high bit error rate to reduce the error rate concatenated reed solomon and convolution coding is adopted concatenated encoding is composed of two channel codes namely an inner code and an outer code typically long non binary codes are used as outer codes and short binary codes are used as inner codes the receiver uses the soft decision decoding algorithm and the algebraic decoding method to decode both the inner and outer codes respectively in this paper the viterbi algorithm is used for decoding convolutional codes in channel coding burst errors refer to a continuous sequence of errors random errors are data errors that are independent and scattered the type of errors that occur in the inductive coupling channel are mainly burst errors however in certain scenarios random errors are also possible hence a reed solomon code which is a block code and can correct burst errors is selected as the outer code of the concatenated code a convolution code has good capability to correct random errors hence it is selected as the inner code of the concatenated code strong interference may cause the number of burst errors generated by the channel exceed the outer decoder correction capability therefore the interleaving technique is needed to break down the burst error sequences firstly the parameters of both the reed solomon encoder and the convolution encoder and the interleaver should be designed to handle the error patterns during the transmission process secondly the length of inner and outer codes of the concatenated code needs to be increased to improve the error correcting capability however the change of parameters of the encoders and interleaver will increase of decoding complexity taking all these factors into account we designed a concatenated code system comprising of the 255 223 reed solomon code the 7 1 2 convolution code and 8 255 interleaver the specific coding process is shown in fig 7 firstly eight 223 bit code words are encoded using the 255 223 reed solomon code and the encoder outputs eight 255 bit code words saved in a 255 8 matrix by maximizing corresponding hamming distances secondly the generated matrix of encoded bits are sent into a 8 255 line interleaver the output of the interleaver is an 8 255 matrix which consists of 255 8 bit interleaved codes in the next stage the 255 codes are sent into a 7 1 2 convolution encoder to generate 255 8 2 bit code sequences the first bit corresponding to each of the 2 bit sequences is the information bit finally 8 255 2 223 cascade code words are transmitted over the channel using amplitude shift keying modulation to the overwater control unit the decoding process is the inverse of the encoding process for instance firstly the 8 255 2 223 cascade code words are demodulated and sent to the viterbi decoder to obtain the transmitted 255 8 code sequences next the 255 8 sequences are sent to the de interleaver block to obtain the original 8 255 matrix finally the de interleaved code words are sent to the rs decoder to recover the original 8223 bit data sequences the decoded data contains some errors these errors could be corrected using the cache of received sequences and the error pattern 3 3 experimental results optimized by the concatenated reed solomon and convolution code the simulink tool is used to implement the reed solomon and convolution encoders the binary information bits to be transmitted are encoded with reed solomon and convolution encoders and then modulated using amplitude shift keying the signal source uses the amplitude shift keying modulation technique and the noise source generates the noise with power in the range of 60 10 db the data signal and the noise enter the transmission channel through the underwater magnet ring the acquisition card completes the signal acquisition after the signal is passed through the channel the received data is demodulated and decoded the obtained error rates of amplitude shift keying modulation and amplitude shift keying modulation with concatenated encoding at different frequencies in seawater and freshwater environments are shown in fig 8 the result corresponding to the seawater environment with the signal transmission frequency of 10 khz is shown in fig 8 a it can be observed from the figure that as the noise power increases from 60 to 10 db the error rate of amplitude shift keying modulation increases from 0 0201634 to 0 0563725 in case of the concatenated encoding with amplitude shift

power concatenated encoder reduces the error rate by 0 0373125 in comparison with the simple amplitude shift keying modulation the result corresponding to the case of 50 khz frequency is shown in fig 8 b as the noise power level increases from 60 to 10 db the error rate of amplitude shift keying modulation increases from 0 015931343 to 0 02753 by contrast no errors are observed for the case of concatenated reed solomon and convolution codes the result corresponding to the case of 100 khz frequency is shown in fig 8 c in this case the error rate of amplitude shift keying modulation increases from 0 00367647 to 0 0263889 as the noise power level increases from 60 to 10 db no errors are observed for the case of concatenated encoding the results for the freshwater environment are shown in fig 8 d and 8 f as can be observed from the figures the error rates are higher in the freshwater system compared with the seawater environment however similar trend is observed as in the seawater environment from the 10 khz signal transmission frequency result shown in fig 8 d it can be noted that the error rates of the amplitude shift keying modulation range from 0 0262255 to 0 0936275 and the error rate of the concatenated code is 0 0 06502 in fig 8 e when the signal transmission frequency is 50 khz the error rates of amplitude shift keying modulation range from 0 019690167 to 0 064950967 and with the concatenated code the range of error rate is 0 0 03139 in fig 8 f when the signal transmission frequency is 100 khz the error rates of amplitude shift keying modulation range from 0 021160133 to 0 021160133 no errors are observed with the concatenated code from the above results it can be concluded that the bit error rates of data transmission with the reed solomon and convolution code encoding are much smaller compared with the case of only amplitude shift keying modulation hence the concatenated reed solomon and convolution codes can effectively improve the signal transmission reliability of the inductive coupling channel 4 conclusion inductive coupling transmission technology is an important communication technology for the deep sea measurement and observation in this paper a theoretical circuit model of the inductive coupling temperature salinity depth communication system is developed a frequency sweep method for measuring the channel characteristics is proposed from the theoretical and the measured amplitude frequency and phase frequency characteristics the system is shown to be a high pass system supporting a theoretical maximum transmission rate

23742,inductive coupling temperature salinity depth mooring cable is an important instrument for measuring deep sea environment however the channel characteristics change depending on the load and marine environment and these characteristics affect the signal transmission reliability in this paper an inductive coupling temperature salinity depth communication system is developed and channel

laboratory the measured results are compared with the theoretical results the accuracy of the results is verified by recovering a square wave using the measured amplitude frequency and phase frequency characteristics next amplitude shift keying modulation is used to test the signal transmission reliability and the results show that the error rates are high due to the influence of noise finally to improve the signal transmission reliability a concatenated code comprising of reed solomon and convolution code is used the concatenated code can make the error rate less than 1 906 and 6 502 in sea water and fresh water respectively the study provides an important experimental evidence for understanding the channel characteristics and improving signal transmission reliability of inductive coupling temperature salinity depth mooring cable keywords inductive coupling temperature salinity depth communication system frequency sweep method reed solomon and convolution code reliability 1 introduction covering approximately 71 of the earth s surface and representing 90 of the earth s biosphere oceans play a major role in the world charette and smith 2010 the mooring buoys and submersible buoys are the most widely used ocean monitoring platforms for fixed point monitoring of the marine environment the inductive coupling temperature salinity depth mooring cable comprises of a vertical structure with many underwater sensor nodes each sensor node acts as a port for data acquisition and transmission using these sensor nodes the dynamic marine parameters and environmental data can be collected the collected data including information about salinity depth temperature chlorophyll ocean current etc is transferred to overwater buoy system and sent to the coastal control center the control center can provide fast response in real time tomisa et al 2008a for the case of wired cable transmission it is necessary to solve the problems related to the water tightness of the cable the reliability of multi node communication and the winding of cable and anchor in the wireless transmission mode the distance of optical transmission is limited chen et al 2017 the acoustic transmission has the problems of high cost low reliability and the poor synchronization stojanovic and preisig 2009 the transmission using inductive coupling temperature salinity depth mooring cable kojiya et al 2005 yoshioka et al 2007 is based on the principle of inductive coupling the transmission uses the mooring cable as a transmission medium and the anchor system as a part of the transmission link to achieve wireless transmission xiu et al 2012 the transmission using mooring cable provides a robust real time long distance communication suitable for acquiring marine environmental observation data as the detection depth is increasing more underwater sensor nodes are required namely the systems of different detection depths require sensors of different number this leads to the fact that the transmission channels of different detection depths are different the change of the ocean environment influences the impedance parameters of the channel and the amplitude of the signal will be attenuated after passing through the channel therefore the channel has fading characteristics and it is time varying due to the influence of the marine environment the signal is susceptible to various kinds of burst noise and random noise in the transmission process therefore the signal to noise ratio snr of the transmitted signal is low and this results in a low reliability of signal transmission tomisa et al 2008b zheng et al 2016 the method of establishing the circuit model of transmission channel is often used to analyze the transmission channel characteristics of the inductive coupling transmission system wu et al 2016 however the previous works overlooked many uncertain channel impedance parameters which leads to a certain difference between the channel characteristics derived from theoretical circuit model and the actual signal transmission in order to improve the reliability of data transmission over inductive coupling temperature salinity depth mooring cable the method presented in this paper is as follows firstly an inductive coupling temperature salinity depth communication system is developed in laboratory secondly the amplitude frequency and phase frequency characteristics of the seawater and freshwater systems are measured by using the frequency sweep method chen and latchman 1995 chen and niculescu 2004 the measured results are compared with the results of the theoretical circuit model the accuracy of measured results is verified by recovering a square wave signal passed through the system using the measured amplitude frequency and phase frequency characteristics thirdly the error rates the ratio of the number of erroneously received symbols to the total number of transmitted symbols of the system in seawater and freshwater environment are tested using the amplitude shift keying modulation technique the measurement results show that the error rates are high because of the influence of the noise to improve the reliability of transmission channel a concatenated reed solomon and convolution code is used in this paper the transmission characteristics of the inductive coupling channel are described more accurately compared with the theoretical circuit model further high reliability of the transmission signal is achieved using the frequency sweep method and the concatenated reed solomon and convolution code 2 system structure and measurement principle 2 1 system structure the inductive coupling temperature salinity depth mooring cable mainly consists of underwater sensor nodes a mooring cable and overwater control unit the transmission channel is composed of magnetic rings including underwater magnetic rings and overwater magnetic ring a mooring cable and water including sea water and fresh water huang et al 2013 during the measurement the mooring cable and water constitute a closed loop which is equivalent to a single turn coil the underwater sensor nodes are used to collect data about marine information such as temperature and salinity at different depths of the ocean the collected data is sent to the overwater control unit using the magnetic coupling technology fig 1 shows an example of the mooring cable system the circuit model and channel characteristics change with the number of underwater sensor nodes in this paper all the studies are carried out based on the point to point data transmission channel an inductive coupling transmission system was built in the laboratory a cable of 10 m length is placed perpendicularly in a cylindrical bath with a diameter of 3 m and a height of 10 m a set of magnetic rings are placed underwater and overwater along the cable the test platform is composedoftheni usb6259 ni usa signal collection board the agilent 81150 a agilent usa signal generator and the agilent 4249 a agilent usa impedance analyzer theni usb6259 ni usa signal collection board is used to collect data the agilent 81150 a agilent usa signal generator is selected as the signal source and the agilent 4249 a agilent usa impedance analyzer is used for measuring impedance parameters 2 2 the principle of theoretical calculation and actual measurement of channel characteristics the theoretical circuit model of the channel is established and the theoretical calculation process is shown in fig 2 as shown in fig 2 a establishing the channel circuit model is important to analyze transmission channel characteristics a voltage signal e i is input to the underwater magnetic ring and this induces a current in the single turn loop consisting of a mooring cable and water finally the current induces an electromotive force of e o in the overwater magnetic ring the calculation process based on the kirchhoff s voltage law is as follows 1 e i i 1 z 1 j ω m 1 2 i 2 2 j ω m 1 2 i 1 i 2 z 2 0 3 e o j ω m 2 3 i 2 where j is the square root of 1 z 1 j ω l 1 z 2 r r j ω l 2 l 2 m 1 2 l 1 l 2 m 2 3 l 2 l 3 l 2 l 3 z1 is the primary winding impedance oft1 z2 is the secondary winding impedance of t1 m1 2 is the mutual inductance of underwater magnetic ring and single turn loop m2 3 is the mutual inductance of the single turn loop and the underwater magnetic ring l1 is the primary winding inductance of t1 l2 is the inductance of the single turn loop l3 is the secondary winding inductance of t2 r is the resistance of water including freshwater resistance r1 and seawater resistance r2 and r is the resistance of the mooring cable the derivation of output voltage e o based on equations 1 3 is as follows 4 e o l 3 l 1 e i 1 r r 2 ω 2 l 2 2 e j arctan r r ω l 2 the amplitude frequency and phase frequency functions of e o are given by 5 a m p e o e i l 3 l 1 1 r r 2 ω 2 l 2 2 6 ϕ arctan r r ω l 2 in the system we built in the laboratory the values of l1 l2 r r and l3 which are functions of frequency are measured by the agilent 4294 a impedance analyzer and the results are shown in fig 2 b the amplitude frequency and phase frequency characteristics are calculated using equations 5 6 as discussed above the transmission channel characteristic can be analyzed by establishing the theoretical circuit model however the theoretical circuit model neglects some impedance parameters such as the parasitic capacitance between the magnetic coil which are difficult to measure and magnetic coil resistance which has a minor influence on channel characteristic therefore there is a certain error between the theoretical circuit model of the channel and the actual channel the frequency sweep method is used to improve the accuracy of characterization of the transmission channel the measurement process is shown in fig 3 the measurement principle is as follows a sinusoidal signal of certain frequency is input into the linear time invariant system to be measured as shown in fig 3 d the output sinusoidal signal of the same frequency is collected as shown in fig 3 e the amplitude ratio and phase difference of the output signal and the input signal provide the amplitude frequency and phase frequency characteristics of the system at the measured frequency point respectively by changing the frequency of the input signal and measuring the output signal the amplitude ratio and phase difference values at different frequencies are obtained after curve fitting the measured values the amplitude frequency and phase frequency curves of the channel are obtained in the actual measurement of seawater and freshwater systems the amplitude ratio and phase difference between the transmitted signal and received signal at different frequencies are measured using the frequency sweep method the amplitude frequency and phase frequency characteristic curves of the sea and fresh water systems are obtained using the matlab spline interpolation function 2 3 measurement result it can be observed from fig 2 b that when the signal frequency is greater than 100 khz the values of magnetic ring inductance are too small to transmit signal therefore the frequency range of the signal analyzed is selected to be 1 100 khz in the range of 1 10 khz the measurement points are uniformly spaced with a 100 hz separation and in the range of 10 100 khz the measurement points are separated by 500 hz the theoretical and measured amplitude frequency and phase frequency characteristic curves for sea water and fresh water are shown in fig 4 as shown in fig 4 in the theoretical seawater circuit model as the input signal frequency increases from 1 khz to 100 khz the ratio of amplitude increases from 0 013 to 0 7534 and the phase difference reduces from 89 2519 o to 26 6172 o compared with the seawater circuit model the amplitude attenuation of the freshwater circuit model is more severe i e the signal amplitude is smaller in fresh water than in sea water in freshwater circuit model as the frequency of transmitted signal increases from 1 khz to 100 khz the ratio of amplitude increases from 0 00017676 to 0 0144 and the phase difference decreases from 89 9898 o to 89 0195 o as the frequency is increases the amplitude ratio showed a gradually increasing trend and the phase difference showed a gradually decreasing trend in both sea water and fresh water in the actual measurement of seawater system as the frequency increases from 1 khz to 100 khz the ratio of amplitude increases from 0 01438738 to 0 1505784 and the phase difference reduces from 67 68546 o to 12 966 o in the freshwater environment the amplitude ratio increases from 0 006845676 to 0 01972456 and it is smaller than the seawater system the phase difference increases from 3 35969 o to 60 8366375 o and then reduces to 58 19385 o with an increase of transmitted signal frequency the amplitude ratio of both seawater and freshwater systems gradually increases thus this system is a high pass system with the cut off frequency of 100 khz a high pass filter allows a signal with a frequency band above the cut off frequency to pass smoothly and attenuates a signal having a band below the cut off frequency the amplitude attenuation of actual measurement is higher than that of theoretically computed value note that the theoretical circuit model is ideal and it ignores many practical parameters such as the resistance and parasitic capacitance of magnetic coil these parameters cause the mismatch between the results of the actual measurement and the theoretical calculation however the trend of the measurement matches the theoretical trend 2 4 verification of accuracy of measured amplitude frequency and phase frequency characteristics a square wave has an abundant frequency component and can use the fundamental frequency and several odd harmonics hence a square wave is used to verify the correctness and accuracy of the measured results it can be seen from the measurement results in the previous section that the signal distortion is higher at lower frequencies when the frequency is lower than 10 khz the distortion effect of square wave in the freshwater environment is severe a square wave signal of 10 khz is sent through channel the received signal is retrieved according to the amplitude frequency and phase frequency characteristic curves measured by the frequency sweep method as shown in fig 4 the retrieval process is implemented by matlab programming as shown in fig 5 the attenuation of the signal received in the freshwater system is higher than that of the seawater system this is because the resistance of fresh water is larger than that of sea water moreover the distortion of signal waveform in freshwater is also more severe than that of sea water as a result there is a higher error in the recovered signal in the freshwater system this result is consistent with the test result of the system channel characteristics performed using the frequency sweep method and proves the accuracy of the test 3 the measurement and optimization of system transmission performance 3 1 the analysis of error rate of amplitude shift keying modulation the measurement platform of amplitude shift keying modulation technique is set up using the ni usb6259 and the software program is implemented using the labview software the amplitude shift keying modulated signals together with noise in the range of 60 10 db enter the transmission channel through the underwater magnetic ring the acquisition card completes the signal acquisition after the signal passes through the inductive coupling channel the error rates are computed using the received signal at present the sea bird corporation in the united states has mastered inductive coupling transmission technology and applied it to actual marine monitor and the data rate of it is up to 9 6 kbps boyle et al kurz and neal since the maximum frequency of the system measured by the frequency sweep method is 100 khz therefore we select 10 khz 50 khz and 100 khz as the frequency range for the data transmission and the measurement results are shown in fig 6 it can be seen from fig 6 that the transmission signal frequency and the noise power level are the key factors affecting the error rate of the signal in the actual measurement the error rate decreases gradually with the increase of transmission frequency and the error rate of signal transmission in the freshwater environment is greater than that of the seawater environment this observation is consistent with the measured transmission characteristics of the channel and verifies the accuracy of measurement results 3 2 the improvement of signal transmission reliability using reed solomon and convolution code as shown in fig 6 the amplitude shift keying modulation technique has a high bit error rate to reduce the error rate concatenated reed solomon and convolution coding is adopted concatenated encoding is composed of two channel codes namely an inner code and an outer code typically long non binary codes are used as outer codes and short binary codes are used as inner codes the receiver uses the soft decision decoding algorithm and the algebraic decoding method to decode both the inner and outer codes respectively in this paper the viterbi algorithm is used for decoding convolutional codes in channel coding burst errors refer to a continuous sequence of errors random errors are data errors that are independent and scattered the type of errors that occur in the inductive coupling channel are mainly burst errors however in certain scenarios random errors are also possible hence a reed solomon code which is a block code and can correct burst errors is selected as the outer code of the concatenated code a convolution code has good capability to correct random errors hence it is selected as the inner code of the concatenated code strong interference may cause the number of burst errors generated by the channel exceed the outer decoder correction capability therefore the interleaving technique is needed to break down the burst error sequences firstly the parameters of both the reed solomon encoder and the convolution encoder and the interleaver should be designed to handle the error patterns during the transmission process secondly the length of inner and outer codes of the concatenated code needs to be increased to improve the error correcting capability however the change of parameters of the encoders and interleaver will increase of decoding complexity taking all these factors into account we designed a concatenated code system comprising of the 255 223 reed solomon code the 7 1 2 convolution code and 8 255 interleaver the specific coding process is shown in fig 7 firstly eight 223 bit code words are encoded using the 255 223 reed solomon code and the encoder outputs eight 255 bit code words saved in a 255 8 matrix by maximizing corresponding hamming distances secondly the generated matrix of encoded bits are sent into a 8 255 line interleaver the output of the interleaver is an 8 255 matrix which consists of 255 8 bit interleaved codes in the next stage the 255 codes are sent into a 7 1 2 convolution encoder to generate 255 8 2 bit code sequences the first bit corresponding to each of the 2 bit sequences is the

fig 8 d and 8 f as can be observed from the figures the error rates are higher in the freshwater system compared with the seawater environment however similar trend is observed as in the seawater environment from the 10 khz signal transmission frequency result shown in fig 8 d it can be noted that the error rates of the amplitude shift keying modulation range from 0 0262255 to 0 0936275 and the error rate of the concatenated code is 0 0 06502 in fig 8 e when the signal transmission frequency is 50 khz the error rates of amplitude shift keying modulation range from 0 019690167 to 0 064950967 and with the concatenated code the range of error rate is 0 0 03139 in fig 8 f when the signal transmission frequency is 100 khz the error rates of amplitude shift keying modulation range from 0 021160133 to 0 021160133 no errors are observed with the concatenated code from the above results it can be concluded that the bit error rates of data transmission with the reed solomon and

difficult because it is closely connected to the ship design resistance seakeeping maneuvering performance etc synthetically in this paper we propose a new approach to predict the actual rpm and engine power of an lngc from full scale measurement data considering the described performance the sea route speed over ground and environmental conditions obtained from the measured data are additionally used to simulate sailing of the ship from the coast of southern taiwan to the coast of madagascar for 14 days the results of the simulation are qualitatively reviewed by comparing the calculated time histories of the rpm and the power with the measured rpm and power the results are quantitatively analyzed by comparing the time histories of errors between the measured values and calculated values finally the power increment due to the environmental load is estimated by comparing the predicted power considering the environmental load with the predicted power not considering the environmental load keywords rpm engine power full scale measurement ship design resistance seakeeping maneuvering environmental conditions 1 introduction recently discussions on applying the eedi eeoi and seemp have been carried out by the imo jung 2011 ball et al 2015 and the regulations of the iso have been updated to consider the environmental effects including wind waves current water depth etc to predict the speed from a sea trial iso 2015 the imo and iso aim to express the actual performance of a vessel objectively by improving the regulations and procedures to evaluate the performance of the ship with assumptions of the actual operating conditions to cope with such changes in regulations and procedures a prediction a measurement and an analysis related to the actual

tests and sea trials of the imo maneuvering tests kim et al 2011 2001 2007 and other studies have been carried out to consider the effect of the environmental load including wind waves and current on the resistance and maneuvering performance of a ship from a practical point of view yoon and rhee 2003 seo and kim 2011 liu 1993 you et al 2017a in the field of propeller design research has been conducted to measure and analyze the change in the performance of the propeller during actual operation song et al 2005 choi et al 2011 andersen et al 2002 hur et al 2011 in sailing of a ship and operating an offshore structure researchers have considered the performance of a vessel in estimating the foc to search for an optimal route rindaroy 2013 lin et al 2013 although the described studies have been carried out to estimate the actual performance of a vessel for each element technology it is necessary to consider not only the ship design information resistance seakeeping maneuvering performance etc but also the environmental conditions and sailing records including sea route and sailing speed to estimate the actual performance of a ship synthetically recently research has been conducted to assess the actual performance of the ship regarding the added resistance by using full scale measurement data and design information kim et al 2017 however since each piece of information is strictly protected as intellectual property by shipyards and shipping companies it is difficult to study the estimation and evaluation of the actual performance of a ship to overcome these limitations studies have been carried out to analyze the actual performance of a ship from full scale measurement data by using statistical methods yoo et al 2016 yoo and kim 2016 the uncertainty of the measured speed and power was analyzed insel 2008 and foc was assessed from the effective power borkowski et al a study was recently conducted to estimate the actual performance of a ship by using the design information model test results and ais data you et al 2017b 2017c in this paper we aim to propose a new approach to predict actual rpm and engine power after the sailing simulation has been conducted by considering ship design information model test results calculations and several items including sea routes sailing speed and environmental conditions obtained from full scale measurement data for this purpose a 151 k lngc constructed in the dsme was chosen and it is possible to consider the resistance seakeeping and maneuvering performance of the ship from the ship design information model test results and calculations in addition full scale measurement data of the vessel was secured from a shipping company in particular the latitude longitude sog mean draft measured wind data and measured wave data were selectively used mass of the ship is predicted from principal particulars and measured draft records the measured l c g is directly considered in the simulation the resistance coefficients are estimated by using a linear interpolation according to the mean draft and sailing speed taking into account the resistance model test results with the design draft and ballast draft some modified empirical formulae are used to set the hydrodynamic derivatives for the maneuvering simulation to ensure that the results of the simulation match well with the free running model test results you et al 2017b 2017c kijima et al 1990 fujii and tsuda 1961 1962 since the coefficients are obtained from the empirical formulae using principal particulars including the draft it is possible to consider the effect of the draft on the maneuverability of the ship the wind and wave loads are calculated by using the measured wind and wave information and they are considered as external forces

deflection angle heading angle rpm power etc regularly the sailing of a ship was simulated by following the measured sea route and sailing speed from the coast of southern taiwan to the coast of madagascar for 14 days since the course and speed change with a large difference are considered in this simulation the whole voyage can be continuously replicated the results of the simulation are qualitatively reviewed by comparing the calculated time histories of rpm and power with those of the measured rpm and power and the results are quantitatively analyzed by comparing the time histories of the errors between the measured values and the calculated values histograms are drawn up to understand the characteristics of the errors and as a result it is possible to verify the predicted actual rpm and engine power finally the power increment due to environmental load is estimated by comparing the predicted power while considering the environmental loads with the predicted power and not considering the environmental loads in conclusion it is possible to construct a feasible sailing simulation by considering the ship design information dynamic characteristics of the ship and course and speed change with a large difference 2 mathematical model 2 1 coordinate system the 151 k lngc with a single screw that was studied in the previous research is also used here kim et al 2017 you et al 2017b 2017c the 151 k lngc which is constructed as a membrane type can be seen in fig 1 the configuration above water line can be perceived from the figure briefly the ship s specifications are as follows l p p is 277 2 m b is 43 4 m t with design condition is 12 0 m t with ballast condition is 9 4 m c b with design condition is about 0 75 c b with ballast condition is about 0 73 and a r is 63 48 m 2 as shown in table 1 fig 2 shows the coordinate system of this research because coordinate systems for maneuvering equations of motion full scale measurement data wind load coefficients wave drift forces and moment are acquired for different coordinate systems it is necessary to arrange the whole values for an identical coordinate system while the calculation is performed the location of the ship is constantly updated in the polar coordinate system to prevent an error that occurs when it is repeatedly converted between the information of the polar coordinate system and that of the plane coordinate system richardus and adler 1972 groves 2013 when the earth is assumed to be a complete sphere in the polar coordinate system equations 1 3 are used to calculate the distance between two points bearing between two points and arrival location by considering the current location bearing and distance first equation 1 calculates the distance between two points when the latitude and longitude are known values equation 2 calculates the relative bearing between two points equation 3 calculates the arrival locations by considering the initial location bearing and distance the three equations that are mentioned are used to calculate the distance from the center of the ship to the waypoint the bearing between the center of the ship and waypoint and the updated location by solving the maneuvering equations of motion 1 a sin 2 δ ϕ 2 cos ϕ 1 cos ϕ 2 sin 2 δ λ 2 c 2 a tan 2 a 1 a d r c 2 θ a tan 2 sin δ λ cos ϕ 2 cos ϕ 1 sin ϕ 2 sin ϕ 1 cos ϕ 2 cos δ λ 3 ϕ 2 a

hydrodynamic loads for the hull are calculated as shown in equation 6 many hydrodynamic coefficients including the added mass added mass moment of inertia and rudder lift coefficients can be predicted using empirical formulae kijima et al 1990 fujii and tsuda 1961 1962 the definitions of each hydrodynamic derivative and non dimensionalization are identical to those in the prior research kijima et al 1990 however the slopes and constants related to y v n v n v r r are slightly modified to match the simulated results with free running model test results you et al 2017b 2017c the values are empirically modified by trial and error the simulated zigzag test results are well matched with those obtained from the free running model tests you et al 2017b 2017c however there are some differences between the simulation results and the free running model test results in 35 turning tests the coefficients are tuned to affect the magnitude of the turning trajectories as far as possible

k lngc is constructed as described the maneuverability of the ship with the design and ballast draft was already verified by comparing the results of the simulation for the 35 turning test the 10 10 zigzag test and the 20 20 zigzag test with those obtained from the free running model tests you et al 2017b 2017c the results of the free running model test and results of the calculation for the 10 10 zigzag tests and 20 20 zigzag tests were also reviewed in prior research you et al 2017b 2017c here trajectories of the 35 turning tests with a design and ballast draft are only referred to in fig 3 they are tested under deep water conditions with design speed for each draft the black squares and blue circles indicate the trajectories that were measured from free running model tests with the design and ballast draft the black solid line and blue chain line indicate the trajectories that were calculated with the design draft and ballast draft respectively there are some differences between locations obtained from free running model tests and calculated results later in the trajectories of course it can indicate that the described mathematical model may be inaccurate if the ship conducts large maneuvering behaviors long hours it may be possible to improve the accuracy of the mathematical model by conducting captive model tests or cfd calculations if the expected accuracy is somewhat lower than an individual expectation for the credibility of a sailing simulation however there is an outstanding merit to simulate maneuvering behavior with a different draft by using the empirical formulae despite the potential dissatisfaction for the accuracy due to the merit it is confirmed that the modified empirical formulae are applicable on the sailing simulation of the 151 k lngc after brief explanation for a captive model test and cfd calculation is described the strength is briefly mentioned as follows first captive model tests have been regarded as the most credible approach to obtain hydrodynamic coefficients used in the maneuvering equations of motion however a budget time and slot in a basin have to be secured to conduct a captive model test a few months ago not only those cannot be secured for the lngc constructed in the past but the accuracy increase is not greatly anticipated kim et al 2007 2011 second a set of hydrodynamic coefficients obtained from the cfd calculations can be applied to the simulation of the maneuvering behaviors accurately in reality the value of empirical formulae in maneuvering field has been diminished by applying the cfd on maneuvering simulations due to its accuracy and convenience sung et al 2015 however cfd has to accompany a lot of computing resource in spite of its broad applicability and accuracy it is hard to secure internal resource for this project unfortunately finally the empirical formulae are used to find a set of hydrodynamic coefficients due to the inaccuracy of the obtained results some values are empirically tuned even if the later trajectories are somewhat different the values of the advance transfer and tactical diameters are different less than 5 by sheer numbers only the level of difference observed in fig 3 is not immoderate in comparison to the captive model tests conducted at different basins kim et al 2007 2011 or in cfd calculation results sung et al 2015 consequently the coefficients obtained from empirical formulae and the small correction is regarded as allowable furthermore although there were small differences in the trajectory similar deviations between the calculated trajectories according to the draft and measured values according to the draft were also observed if there is a change of the draft of a vessel during simulation hydrodynamic coefficients cannot be newly acquired from the captive model tests or cfd calculations however since empirical formulae were constructed based on the physical knowledge by applying regression analysis a new set of the coefficients can be acquired from the verified empirical formulae immediately it is advantageous to simulate the sailing simulation 2 2 2 wind load to consider the wind loads acting on the 151 k lngc wind tunnel model test results and measured wind data are used more information can be shared with a reader if a sketch of the ship above the water line is opened due to the security policy of the shipbuilding company more information cannot be provided instead of the detailed lines it is possible to improve an intuitive grasp of the wind load characteristics of the vessel from fig 1 first of all the wind loads are calculated as shown in equations 9 and 10 and the non dimensionalized wind load coefficients were obtained from the wind tunnel model tests for the ship with the design and ballast draft the wind model test was conducted in the 2 6 m wide boundary layer wind tunnel in november 2004 the tunnel size is 20 8 m x 2 6 m x 1 8 m length x width x height here wind speed corresponds to 9 31 m s and a reynolds number is 8 565 10 5 at the reference height 10 0 m in full scale the model was constructed in wood high density foam and brass the tests were carried out with 1 200 scale model of the vessel it was chosen as a compromise between avoiding scale effects from a model that is too small and avoiding blockage in the wind tunnel caused by a model that is too large wind loads are measured using the 6 component strain gauges at the mid ship location the measured wind loads are non dimensionalized by using equation 9 fig 4 shows the wind load coefficients acquired according to the relative wind incident angle acting on the hull dsme 2005 the black solid line blue chain line and red broken line indicate c x ψ r w i c y ψ r w i and c n ψ r w i with the design draft and the black solid line with the squares blue chain line with circles and red broken line with diamonds indicate c x ψ r w i c y ψ r w i and c n ψ r w i with ballast draft respectively in the case of the lngc there is no difference in the shape or arrangement of the superstructure even if there is a change in the cargo consequently there is an insignificant difference in the wind load coefficients according to the draft in equation 10 the relations between the relative values of the wind and the absolute values of wind are summarized you et al 2017a however since relative values are obtained from the full scale measurement any convert is not done here just they are noticed for awareness only in equation 10 the definition of relative wind speed along the x axis y axis is shown and relative wind speed and relative wind incident angle are defined as well since the relative wind speed and relative wind incident angle were measured from a wind sensor installed on the ship the measured values were relatively obtained such as v r w i and ψ r w i l o a a t and a l according to the draft are summarized in table 2 in the sailing simulation the wind load coefficients and the projected areas are predicted using the linear interpolation method according to the mean draft the calculated wind loads are considered as external forces and moment in the maneuvering equations of motion as shown in equation 5 9 c x ψ r w i x 1 2 ρ u 2 a t c y ψ r w i y 1 2 ρ u 2 a l c n ψ r w i n 1 2 ρ u 2 a l l o a 10 x w i c x ψ r w i 1 2 ρ a i r a t v r w i 2 y w i c y ψ r w i 1 2 ρ a i r a

load to consider the wave loads acting on the 151 k lngc the ship design information including the lines and loading conditions and measured wave data were used the concept of a linear superposition is used to calculate the wave drift forces and the moment in irregular waves the increase in mean resistance in irregular waves is calculated by using pre calculated wave drift forces and moment and wave spectrum it is written as follows and the process is well summarized in the references iso 2015 seo and kim 2011 ittc 2011 11 x w a y w a n w a 0 q t f w α w ζ a 2 e w d w e w 5 16 h s 2 w m 4 w

information including the loading conditions hydrostar which is a famous commercial software provided by bv classification is used here in equation 11 qtf means wave drift force as shown in figs 5 10 variation of transfer function related to the ship speed wave frequency and wave heading can be shown in these figures table 3 shows the calculation matrix to acquire the wave loads acting on the hull the wave drift forces and the moment are calculated for five speeds seven wave incident angles and twenty nine wave frequencies respectively to avoid extrapolation of wave loads acting on the hull the minimum speed is determined by zero k n o t s and the maximum speed is determined by design speed of ballast draft which is 19 0 k n o t s the wave drift forces and moment for x y a n d n at an arbitrary time are obtained by using the linear interpolation method according to the speed and wave incident angle the significant wave height wave mean period and wave direction are measured from a wave radar installed on the ship the significant wave height and wave mean period that were measured are used to generate the ittc wave spectrum as explained in ref iso 2015 seo and kim 2011 ittc 2011 the calculated wave loads are considered as external forces and moment in equation 5 figs 4 6 show the non dimensionalized surge sway and yaw wave drift forces and moment for waves from 60 of the lngc with the ballast draft according to the speed figs 7 9 show the non dimensionalized surge and sway wave drift forces and yaw drift moment according to the wave incident angles at 0 6085 frequency of the lngc with the ballast draft according to the speed equation 11 show how to non dimensionalize the forces and moment in the figures since there are many wave drift forces and moments according to the speed frequency and wave direction the plots are drawn up for waves from 60 and the frequency of 0 6085 only the black solid line blue chain line red broken line orange chain line with squares and green broken line with circles indicate results for 0 0 7 5 13 0 17 5 and 19 0 k n o t s respectively the typical tendencies of the wave drift force are well shown in these figures as the ship speed becomes larger the peak values of wave drift force also become larger and the peak frequencies are moved in the small wave frequency and the maximum values of the calculated wave drift forces and moment are observed the waves from 60 to 300 it can be easily guessed that as the ship speed becomes larger a larger amount of waves is scattered and this causes a large peak value also the peak frequency of the wave drift force goes to small wave frequency because the encounter with the wave frequency becomes larger seo and kim 2011 3 concept of sailing simulation 3 1 types of data used in the sailing simulation the sailing simulation of the 151 k lngc is conducted based on full scale measurement data by referring the approach proposed based on the ais data in the previous study you et al 2017b 2017c here kinematic data acquired from full scale measurement are almost identical with those from ais of the 151 k lngc since measured data from various sensors are transmitted through an ais device and recorded on a storing device although each sensor has its own measuring period it is uncertain which technique is applied to the acquisition of the full scale measurement data at 10 min intervals table 4 shows the types of information acquired from the full scale measurement in particular the first and last records are summarized the time in utc can be checked to measure data ranging from 09 00 on november 22 2010 to 09 00 on december 6 2010 the latitude longitude cog sog forward draft after the draft relative wind speed relative wind incident angle significant wave height wave mean period relative wave incident angle rpm and power were measured at 10 min intervals for 14 days among these the information which is used directly in the simulation is the latitude longitude sog and mean draft fig 11 shows the sea route of the ship from the coast of southern taiwan to the coast of madagascar the course and speed change with a large difference when entering and leaving the strait of malacca in most of the remaining paths the ship maintains a straight path since the acquisition of full scale measurement data for a ship which was constructed in dsme is unusual the data are used to study the actual performance of the sailing vessel to simulate a sailing of a ship successive data have to be acquired without large intervals as far as possible consequently the mentioned period is chosen to study the actual sailing performance of the ship in this research if an area on the route is magnified the slight change of its course is sometimes observed the vessel is loaded with liquefied natural gas in west africa and is transported to asia via america then it follows a route from asia to west africa again accordingly it is operated under ballast condition during the selected voyage period in table 4 the draft for 14 days is changed from 9 77 m and 8 34 m to 9 80 m and 8 02 m because there are oil consumption and usage of living creature by crews the draft has to be consistently changed in fig 10 water depth can be briefly perceived from the coloring of a sea the water depth was not measured in the 151 k lngc since there is no sensor to measure the water depth in the vessel it seems that the minimum water depth is observed near the strait of malacca where main shipping channels vary from 14 9 m to over 100 m national geospatial intelligence agency 2016 shallow water effect can be ignored if the value of h t is larger than 4 0 conference 2003 because it is hard to predict water depth according to the actual location of the ship the shallow water effect is not considered here in the strait of malacca on the average between 50 and 60 of all current observation in the strait are 0 5 k n o t s or less national geospatial intelligence agency 2016 a small portion of these observations exceed 2 0 k n o t s national geospatial intelligence agency 2016 however there is no sensor to measure the currents or tides in the vessel they cannot be considered as well the predominant winds over the strait of malacca are monsoon winds normal wind strength is 5 10 k n o t s but may reach 20 to 25 k n o t s for short periods in the north part of the strait national geospatial intelligence agency 2016 it seems that the strong wind observed from 6 days to 9 days as shown in fig 12 may be linked closely with the reported wind characteristics in the north part of the strait of malacca the highest mean wind speed is about 33 k m h 17 82 k n o t s and significant wave height is ranging from 0 5 m to 3 5 m from the annual reporting cycle in the indian ocean reddi 2013 the highest wind and wave conditions are generally observed from june to august due to summer monsoon and the lowest conditions are shown from december to february due to winter monsoon although the maximum wind speed which is relatively acquired from full scale measurement by considering ship speed is about 40 k n o t s the absolute wind speed in the route is under 23 5 k n o t s at that time the maximum significant wave height is about 3 0 m based on the full scale measurement data the measured values for wind and waves are comparable or greater than the values affected by summer monsoon consequently the sailing performance of the 151 k lngc is predicted under stronger environmental conditions than usual fig 12 shows the time histories of the measured relative wind speed and relative wind incident angle measured from a wind sensor the black solid line indicates the relative wind speed and the blue circles indicate the relative wind incident angle as shown in equation 10 the effect of sailing speed is already considered in the relative values of wind data fig 13 shows the time histories of the measured significant wave height and relative wave incident angle obtained from a wave radar the wave radar can measure the wave mean period as well the black solid line indicates a significant wave height and the blue circles indicate the relative incident angle of the wave the identical sailing scenario which was measured is repeatedly simulated according to a consideration of the environmental load in figs 12 and 13 the dotted lines along the time axis indicate every one day from the initial time of the calculation the effect of the environmental load on the rpm and engine power can be basically studied by repeated simulations according to a consideration of the environmental loads in the two figures a certain direction of the wind and waves are maintained for days from the initial time however non directional environmental conditions are distinctly observed from about 3 days to 6 days in particular the wind and wave incident angles are distributed from all directions a significant wave height is obviously small and the observed mild weather conditions with non directional characteristics were due the 151 k lngc going through the strait of the malacca during this period the effect of the non directional environmental load on the rpm and engine power can be further investigated during the analysis rapid changes in the relative wind speed and significant wave height are sometimes observed and this is regarded as the effect of noise in the signal measurement however any filters or smoothing techniques were not applied to post process the values because the measurement data is provided for a relatively long period of time with 10 min intervals and because the locations consistently change due to the sailing of the ship since this concerns a distortion due to the application of any filters and smoothing techniques the effect of noise on the simulation is ignored here based on the measured relative wind speed the wind loads acting on the hull from about 7 days to 9 days were relatively large the maximum wind speed measured from full scale measurement was about 40 k n o t s absolute wind speed is about 23 5 k n o t s and the beaufort number is below 6 bhattacharyya 1978 in the case of the measured significant wave height the values were below 4 0 m therefore the sea state is below 3 lee and rhee 2001 from the maximum beaufort number and sea state the ship can be judged not to operate under extreme weather conditions therefore there is no problem related to predicting the environmental loads described before 3 2 simulation procedure using the full scale measurement data fig 14 shows the general flow chart of the sailing simulation using full scale measurement data among the acquired data the information at the initial time is regarded to be the initial state of the ship the latitude and longitude of the ship obtained from the full scale measurement data are assumed as the waypoints that the ship has to follow during the simulation they are measured from the onboard gps the sog is assumed as the command speed you et al 2017b 2017c the initial speed of the ship is assumed as the acquired initial sog and the initial rpm is estimated based on the initial mean draft and sailing speed by using linear interpolation between the resistance with the design draft and with ballast draft the initial heading angle is assumed as the bearing from the first location to the second location and the ship is always sailing from an arbitrary location toward the determined waypoint if the ship passes through the following waypoint the next location is substituted into the next waypoint the determination of whether the ship arrives at a waypoint or not is done by considering the concept in previous studies you et al 2017b 2017c lee and rhee 2001 you and rhee 2016 whether the relative distance from the center of the ship to the waypoint comes within a certain distance and whether the relative bearing from the current location of the ship and waypoint is larger than current heading angle is then judged the calculation of the distance and relative bearing is conducted by using equations 1 and 2 here the values are assumed to be 0 25 l p p and π 4 fig 15 shows an example of the course of the ship and determined waypoints from full scale measurement data the measured locations of the lngc at 10 min intervals are assumed as waypoints in the figure after the ship goes by the waypoint 1 it is moving toward the waypoint 2 the course is automatically determined by following the waypoints continuously in order to change the course of the ship according to the change in the waypoint the rudder deflection angle is determined by applying fuzzy control which takes into account the turn rate of the ship and the difference between the command heading angle and the current heading angle 36 38 the input variables used in the fuzzy control are defined in fig 15 the relative bearing is calculated by using equation 2 fuzzy membership functions which are nine and triangles and reasoning rules are identically used with those presented by the referred paper lee and rhee 2001 you and rhee 2016 hasegawa and kouzuki 1987 imo 2002 first the triangular membership functions of heading error are made up from 30 d e g to 30 d e g at 10 intervals second the membership functions of time derivative of heading error are defined on 1 0 0 5 0 2 0 05 0 0 05 0 2 0 5 and 1 0 d e g s respectively finally the membership functions of reasoning the command rudder angle are distinguished from 35 d e g to 35 d e g at 8 75 intervals to determine the command rudder angle at 30 s intervals the centroid of the chosen triangular functions is found lee and rhee 2001 the reason why the fuzzy control is applied to the simulation is that the control habits of the seafarers can be considered the decision for the rudder deflection angle in the actual operating vessel depends on the manufacturer of the autopilot devices in some cases since the seafarer controls the ship manually it is almost impossible to use identical control technique in this kind of simulation for the ship therefore fuzzy control is the best alternative to determine the rudder deflection angle during the simulation because the actual sailing draft is determined by the amount of cargo and ballast water etc it continuously changes during sailing because there are oil consumption and usage of living creature by crews the draft has to be changed furthermore if lng is loaded in a vessel in harbor the draft can be significantly changed as the draft is continuously changed during the voyage the mass of the ship is also changed to calculate the mass l p p b c b and mean draft are used in case of x g is updated from the full scale measurement data the resistance coefficients are calculated by applying a linear interpolation method according to the mean draft and sailing speed and the hydrodynamic derivatives are predicted from empirical formulae using principal particulars you et al 2017b 2017c kijima et al 1990 in the sailing simulation it is necessary to adjust an rpm according to the state of the propulsion devices equation 12 has been generally used to tune the rpm during a simulation of maneuvering tests such as turning tests or zigzag tests 39 since the test speed is regulated as at least 90 of the ship s speed corresponding to 85 of the maximum engine output 39 q e is a known variable according to the internal sea trial procedure i p p can be calculated using the design information as well since q p is identical with q denoted in equation 7 n can be predicted according to the prescribed values in case of the mandatory tests however equation 12 is not applicable in this sailing simulation although i p p is known and q p can be calculated using equation 7 q e is continuously changed by a seafarer as mentioned a voyage of the lngc is not conducted by following a simple scenario like maneuvering tests since the engine output is randomly variated equation 12 cannot be solved using the known values consequently another approach is needed to acquire n empirically in the previous research the speed of the ship was compared to the command speed at every 30 s to set the rpm if the speed of the ship was faster than the command speed the rpm decreases by 0 2 when the opposite happens the rpm increases by 0 2 you et al 2017a 2017b 2017c the rpm command is determined by accomplishing for the ship to follow the command speed without great gaps from the full scale measurement data by trial and error there is a limitation due to steps of the rpm command if a seafarer commands speed reduction or speed increase with large differences sailing speed cannot be immediately followed by using the fixed value to overcome the mentioned limitation the rpm command is variated according to the difference between the command speed and sailing speed of the ship as shown in table 5 by considering the updated hydrodynamic loads using the resistance and hydrodynamic coefficients the propeller thrust rudder loads wind loads wave loads rpm etc and maneuvering equations of motion are solved to update the acceleration velocity location etc after judging whether the ship arrives at the final waypoint or not the calculations are repeated until the ship reaches the final waypoint 12 2 π i p p n q e q p table 5 rpm commands per 30 s according to the difference between the command speed and sailing speed of the ship since the coordinates of the model test results full scale measurement data equations and calculation results are different it is necessary to summarize how to convert the coordinates as shown in table 6 first the latitude longitude sog and heading angle based on the global coordinate system are perceived at the present time second maneuvering equations of motion are solved by considering the environmental loads based on body fixed system third longitudinal speed transversal speed and turn rate are acquired by solving the equations fourth the deviations of distance and heading angle on the global coordinate system are calculated from the obtained values finally the updated latitude and longitude are found from the present latitude and longitude by calculating equation 3 the described convert is repeatedly conducted during the sailing simulation linear interpolation is applied to the calculation of resistance coefficient wind load coefficient wind load areas and wave drift forces and moment in the case of resistance coefficient and wind load areas depend on the draft only since the ballast draft is only considered simulation is used by using the values for the ballast draft wind load coefficients depend on draft and wind incident angle by using the coefficients obtained for the ballast draft the linear interpolation according to wind incident angle is applied in the case of wave drift forces and moment the loads depend on the sailing speed of the ship and wave incident angle since the wave load calculation is conducted for the ballast draft only after the linear interpolation is applied to sailing speed the effect of wave incident angle is calculated 3 3 feasibility check of the simulation fig 16 shows a comparison between the ship locations acquired from the full scale measurement data for 14 days and those calculated from the simulation according to a consideration of the environmental load there are two types of calculations one is simulated by considering the environmental loads and the other is simulated by ignoring the environmental loads the purpose is to compare the effect of the environmental loads on the actual rpm and engine power that are predicted qualitatively and quantitatively the black solid line blue squares and red circles indicate the measured locations of the ship predicted locations considering the environmental loads and predicted locations not considering the environmental loads respectively the ship can be seen to follow the measured locations regardless of the presence or absence of the environmental loads of course since the figure shows the entire route that was traveled for 14 days it may be necessary to compare the measured locations with the predicted locations for the enlarged section therefore the part of the course change with a large difference is chosen and it is marked as a rectangle in fig 16 fig 17 shows the enlarged figure of the ship locations acquired from full scale measurement data and those calculated from a simulation according to a consideration of the environmental loads near the entrance of the strait of malacca the definition of each symbol is identical to those in fig 16 only the enlarged figure shows a 0 5 0 5 area here the earth is assumed to be a complete sphere and the length of the base line in fig 17 is of about 55 59 k m even if there is a change in course with a large difference the ship can follow the measured locations as well figs 16 and 17 confirm that the ship passes through the waypoint very closely fig 18 shows the time histories of the measured ship speed and calculated speeds according to a consideration of the environmental loads the black solid line blue squares and red circles indicate the measured speeds of the ship predicted speeds considering the environmental loads and predicted speeds not considering the environmental loads respectively the speed of the ship can be seen to follow the measured speeds as well as the locations when the mean error between the measured values and the predicted values at 10 min intervals is calculated the averages are 0 022 k n o t s and 0 015 k n o t s these values are negligible in particular there are cases where the measured speed cannot be accurately tracked from about 3 days to 8 days as shown in fig 18 and this is a result of the rapid increase or decrease in the relative wind speed namely as the relative wind speed increases rapidly the speed of the ship suddenly decreases due to the increased wind load however the period is very short compared to the total measurement and simulation period and it is regarded to have an insignificant effect for the predicted rpm and engine power fig 19 shows the time histories of the measured ship speed and the calculated speeds according to a consideration of the environmental load near the entrance of the strait of malacca to conduct a detailed comparison the definition of each symbol is identical to those in fig 18 here a decimal value such as 3 7 days is obtained by dividing the time marked into seconds by 86 400 s because there are 86 400 s in a day there is a change in speed with a large difference when the ship entered the strait of the malacca an insignificant difference between the measured speed and the simulated speed is basically observed when the speed change is not rapid by applying the different rpm commands according to speed deviation as shown in table 5 the rapid change in the speed can be followed in the sailing simulation in comparison with previous research you et al 2017b 2017c consequently figs 18 and 19 confirm that the ship follows the measured speed well figs 16 19 confirm that the measured location and speed of the ship follow well the simulation as its purpose the course and speed change with a large difference can be considered during the simulation since the simulation is confirmed from comparisons the results obtained from the simulation are analyzed in similar research the longitudinal load is only analyzed by considering added resistance due to wind and waves liu 1993 kim et al 2017 yoo et al 2016 yoo and kim 2016 the reason why maneuvering equations of motion are solved will be described by comparing the effect of environmental loads on the dynamic response of the ship during the whole voyage figs 20 22 show the time histories of the surge sway and yaw relative ratio among the loads under no environmental loads figs 23 25 show the time histories of the surge sway and yaw relative ratio among the prescribed loads under the environmental loads in these figures white black yellow and blue colors indicate the ratio of the hull rudder wind and wave loads respectively each ratio is calculated by using equation 13 the reason why the absolute values are summed is to avoid the effect of the sign if the values with the sign are summed the accumulated ratio is acquired over 100 or under 100 case by case to avoid this kind of change the values are represented by its magnitude only since there are no environmental loads acting on the hull relative ratios due to wind and waves are not observed in figs 20 22 all ratios are filled with white color in fig 20 and it means that rudder load along the longitudinal direction is not detected since there are no environmental loads which prevent from going straight the rudder is only used to change the ship s course to a minimum in reality although rudder is deflected to change the course it is very small and it cannot be visibly plotted in fig 21 the rudder loads for sway are ranging up to 2 3 only in fig 22 the rudder loads for yaw are ranging up to 20 since there are wind and wave loads acting on the hull with different conditions relative ratios due to the hull rudder wind and wave loads are significantly different as shown in figs 23 25 in fig 23 the wind load gets a large share of the whole loads the variation of wind load ratio is aligned with the tendency of the relative wind speed as shown in fig 12 about 4 days and 7 days there are peaks of the wind load those times correspond to the times for the ship to be near the entrance and exit to the strait of malacca as the speed of the ship is decreased the relative magnitudes of wind and hull loads become affected in figs 24 and 25 wave loads affect loads for sway and yaw significantly the variation of the ratio of wave load is similar with the time histories of the significant wave height as shown in fig 13 since the wind and wave loads prevent for the ship from going straight it is necessary to control a rudder largely so the relative ratios of rudder loads are observed in figs 23 25 distinctly from the figures of relative ratios the effect of environmental loads acting on the ship is clearly perceived in this period the wind mainly affects the loads for the surge on the other hand waves affect the loads for the sway and yaw if the resistance along the longitudinal direction is only considered to investigate the sailing performance the described characteristics will be ignored 13 r a t i o o f w a v e l o a d x w a x w i x w a x r x h r a t i o o f

the described simulation of the ship has been conducted here the rpm and engine power indicate the rpm and power of the ship there are two types of calculations for whether the environmental loads are considered or not by comparing each result the qualitative and quantitative effects of environmental loads on the rpm and engine power are analyzed as well 4 1 analysis of the predicted rpm fig 26 shows the time histories of the measured rpm and calculated rpm according to the consideration of the environmental loads the black solid line blue squares and red circles indicate the measured rpm calculated rpm considering the environmental loads and calculated rpm not considering the environmental loads respectively the predicted rpms regardless of the presence or absence of the environmental loads show a similar tendency as the measured values and they can follow a change in the rpm with a large difference as well the rpm is confirmed to be basically predicted with a similar tendency by using the suggested simulation of course there is a difference in the tendency according to the results of the calculation from a quantitative point of view the calculated rpm from about 6 days to 12 days is obviously underestimated if the environmental loads are not considered on the other hand the rpms calculated for an identical period are slightly overestimated if the environmental loads are considered this is a result from the effect of the environmental loads acting on the lngc in figs 12 and 13 the wind loads come from bow to stern in that period apparently the wave loads come from the bow quartering or stern quartering at the identical period the environmental loads keep the ship from going forward as additional resistance consequently it is reasonable that a smaller propeller thrust should be needed to follow the measured speed when the environmental loads are not considered by considering the environmental loads during the simulation the predicted rpms are much more similar to the measured values however the rpms predicted from about 3 days to 6 days are commonly overestimated regardless of the presence or absence of the environmental loads this is closely correlated to the non directional characteristics of the environmental load as pointed out above for the period the environmental loads do not significantly act on the hull as additional resistance because the environmental loads come from all directions even the wind and wave conditions are mild enough to be ignored therefore the results of the calculation by ignoring the environmental loads are a slight overestimation during this period in fig 26 frequent fluctuations are observed regardless of presence or absence of the environmental loads in comparison with the measured rpm this is a result of the concept of a simulation based on the full scale measurement data and it is different from the control concept on board namely power is controlled by a seafarer in a sailing ship and this affects the rpm and sailing speed slowly the sailing speed consistently differs according to external loads such as wind waves and currents however in this simulation the ship follows the measured speed which has fluctuations due to the wind waves and current therefore there have to be frequent fluctuations in the predicted rpm the time lags are finely observed regardless of the presence or absence of environmental loads compared to the measured rpm to confirm the observed time lags the time histories of the rpms are drawn up from 3 5 days to 4 2 days in detail fig 27 shows the time histories of the measured rpm and the calculated rpms according to a consideration of the environmental loads near the entrance to the strait of malacca the definition of each symbol is identical to those in fig 26 the time lags of the rpm are clearly recognized during this period when the speed is changed by a seafarer with a large difference the time lag is of about 0 1 days regardless of the consideration of the environmental loads the reason for this is there are time lags between the measured rpm and the calculated rpms due to the control concept of the actual ship being different from that of the simulation as was explained in the actual ship the power is controlled by a seafarer of course this affects the rpm and sailing speed the change in the speed and course is not affected immediately due to a slow dynamic response of a ship when the seafarer tries to change the power and rudder deflection angle to change speed or course you and rhee 2016 since the measured change in the speed of the ship is followed by the ship in this simulation there have to be time lags the time lag can lead to a contorted prediction of the rpm however since the sailing simulation is conducted for 14 days there is an insignificant effect on the prediction of the rpm due to the time lags from a macro perspective as shown in table 1 the propulsion devices are designed with the maximum rpm of about 86 by mcr since the measured rpms are always under 80 there is no overloaded condition however the calculated rpms indicate that the propulsion device is sometimes overloaded from 6 days to 8 days and from 7 days to 9 days especially peak about 96 is observed near 6 days the overload is caused by the fluctuation and a sudden change of the measured speed however overload is not forcibly prevented in the sailing simulation due to following two reasons first the maximum rpm at mcr has a 5 6 margin in general the period of overload is not long enough since the overloads are observed as peaks entire rpms will be insignificantly affected by the overloaded peaks second it is judged that sharing the characteristics of the suggested sailing simulation concept with a reader is needed if there is a condition to prevent the rpm from increasing above the maximum rpm it affects the speed or location calculated in the simulation as well to avoid the potential error or misunderstanding any condition is not inserted for limiting the rpm control it is necessary to analyze the measured rpm and predicted rpm according to a consideration of the environmental loads in detail fig 28 shows the time histories of the errors between the measured rpm and calculated rpms with 10 min intervals the black solid line shows the difference between the measured rpm and calculated rpm considering the environmental loads also the blue squares indicate the difference between the measured rpm and calculated rpm not considering the environmental loads first of all there are large errors toward the positive and negative direction in turn at about 4 days 7 days 13 days and 14 days as previously mentioned there are time lags between the measured rpm and calculated rpm when the speed change with a large difference is conducted therefore a negative error appears first and the positive error subsequently appears since the error occurs due to the time lag the magnitude of the error toward the positive and negative direction is almost similar the magnitude of a peak or off peak of the rpm error is mainly affected by the difference of rpms commanded by a seafarer in addition the underestimated or overestimated rpm which is calculated affects the magnitude of peaks and off peaks subordinately for example in fig 26 after the measured rpm is reduced from about 66 to about 4 by some stages in about 4 days measured rpm returns to about 76 rapidly the differences of rpms are about 60 70 however in fig 28 the magnitude of observed off peak is about 55 and the observed peak is about 50 the magnitude is slightly smaller than the difference between the front and rear rpm commanded by the seafarer as mentioned the magnitude of the peak and off peak have to be smaller than the difference between measured rpms of peak and off peak since the calculated rpm is overestimated in the off peak likewise after rpm is reduced from about 72 to about 50 by some stages in about 7 days rpm returns to about 76 rapidly the differences of rpms are about 20 30 however in fig 28 the magnitude of observed off peak is about 30 and the observed peak is about 35 the magnitude is slightly larger than the difference of the front and rear rpm the magnitude of the peak and off peak has to be larger than the difference between measured rpms of peak and off peak since the calculated rpm is underestimated in the off peak this kind of tendency is also observed in other peaks and off peaks the errors are mostly scattered about zero when the environmental loads are considered the errors obviously shift to positive values from about 6 days to 12 days when the environmental loads are not considered this indicates that the predicted rpm not considering the environmental loads is underestimated since the environmental load is considered the magnitude of the error is remarkably reduced consequently a quantitative error may occur depending on whether the environmental load is considered or not table 7 shows statistical values for the measured rpm and calculated rpms according to a consideration of the environmental loads when the environmental loads are not considered the average error between the measured values and the predicted values is 2 99 and the standard deviation is 7 41 when the environmental loads are considered the average error between the measured values and the predicted values is 2 09 and the standard deviation is 6 55 based on the averaged rpm for 14 days which is 72 69 the relative ratio of the error considering the environmental loads and not considering the environmental loads are 2 88 and 4 10 respectively due to the compensation of the speed loss affected by the environmental loads it seems that the rpm is estimated to be higher when the environmental loads are considered since the error induced by time lags toward the positive and negative direction in turns they are canceled out for the average value of the rpm error however since fluctuations are identically observed the standard deviation is not significantly affected by considering the environmental loads fig 29 shows a histogram of the error between the measured rpm and that calculated from the simulation according to a consideration of the environmental loads the black bars indicate the number of errors between the measured value and the predicted value considering the environmental loads the blue line with squares indicates the number of errors between the measured value and the predicted value not considering the environmental loads a histogram is drawn up from 60 to 60 at 1 interval and the characteristics of the statistical values shown in table 7 are observed again when we do not consider environmental loads the maximum frequency of the error is observed near 4 and it is distributed as a bell around this value on the contrary when we take into account the environmental loads the maximum frequency of the error is observed near 1 the distribution of the error does not change significantly regardless of the presence or absence of the environmental loads it is just obviously observed in that the distribution of the error has shifted from 4 toward 1 according to the consideration of the environmental loads in addition although there are some frequencies with a large error they are caused by the time lags 4 2 analysis of the predicted power fig 30 shows the time histories of the measured power and the calculated powers according to a consideration of the environmental loads the black solid line indicates the measured power the blue squares show the predicted power considering the environmental loads and the red circles indicate the predicted power not considering the environmental loads the predicted powers show a similar tendency as the measured values regardless of the presence or absence of environmental loads and they follow the change in power with a large difference as well however there is a significant difference according to the results of the calculation from a quantitative point of view the power calculated from about 6 days to 14 days is obviously underestimated if the environmental loads are not considered and the deviation from the measured power is of about 5 0 m w if the environmental loads are considered the powers calculated for an identical period are scattered for the measured power or a slightly overestimated value from the measured values the results show that the environmental load affects the propulsion power of a ship during sailing in the comparison of fig 26 the error between the measured values and the predicted values becomes distinctly larger in fig 30 although a similar tendency is observed this is closely connected with equation 7 the power is predicted in proportion to n 3 the prediction error of the measured and calculated power is sometimes about 5 0 m w even if there is no difference of the measured power it is regarded as a great deal of difference of course the suggested simulation concept may be useless if the difference is maintained for all the time the large fluctuation cannot be avoidable because the ship is followed the disturbed speed by wind and waves furthermore the fluctuation becomes worse after wind and wave measuring data are additionally considered if the fluctuations occur with a little different value as the mean it can be allowable in macroscopic point of view a large amount of deviation at the moment cannot affect the sum of the actual power during the whole voyage since they are canceled out the opposite value the fluctuations and time lags are identically observed for the power as shown in fig 27 since the rpm is used to calculate the power as shown in equation 7 similar features have to be observed fig 31 shows the time histories of the measured power and calculated powers according to a consideration of the environmental load near the entrance of the strait of malacca the definition of each symbol is identical to those in fig 30 and the time lags for the power are clearly recognized during this period when the speed changes by a seafarer with a large difference the time lag is of about 0 1 days regardless of the presence or absence of the environmental loads there are time lags between the measured power and calculated power for the same reason mentioned above as shown in table 1 the propulsion devices are designed with the maximum power of about 32 000 k w since the measured powers are always under 21 m w there is no overloaded condition likewise the calculated powers are always under 30 m w even if there is a large difference between the maximum value of measurement and the maximum value of calculation any overload is not observed here there has been an attempt to analyze in detail the power measured and predicted according to a consideration of the environmental loads fig 32 shows the time histories of the error between the measured power and the calculated power according to a consideration of the environmental loads the black solid line shows the difference between the measured power and calculated power considering the environmental loads and the blue squares indicate the difference between measured power and calculated power not considering the environmental loads as mentioned peaks and off peaks are observed in turn in case of the error of rpm as shown in fig 28 however there are some differences in the peaks and off peaks of the error of power in fig 32 the magnitude of power error is also mainly affected by the difference of powers commanded by a seafarer the predicted power is proportional to n 3 the more the value of rpm increases the more the deviation of power obtained according to the same difference of rpm reversely the less the value of rpm decrease the less the deviation of power obtained according to the same difference of rpm in fig 27 there are some steps to reduce or increase the rpm although the interval is not large the difference between rpm commanded by the seafarer is large however the power is amplified of n 3 as rpm is reduced with the small interval power is drastically decreased so the relative magnitude of the difference between powers is smaller than the values between rpms therefore the off peak of the power is not large enough as shown in the off peak of the rpm however the peak of the power is large enough as shown in the peak of the rpm for example from figs 27 and 31 the difference can be clearly understood rpm is decreased from about 64 to 50 for 0 1 days in this period rpm is decreased about 20 sequentially rpm is decreased again from about 50 to about 4 for 0 1 days in this period rpm is decreased about 95 again however the power is decreased from about 12 m w to 6 m w for the first 0 1 days in this period power is decreased about 50 sequentially power is decreased from 6 m w to about 1 m w for the second 0 1 days in this period power is decreased about 85 the errors are mostly scattered about zero or slightly negative value when the environmental loads are considered the errors are obviously shifted to positive values from about 6 days to 12 days when the environmental loads are not considered this indicates that the predicted power is underestimated on the assumption of there being no environmental loads when the environmental loads are considered the magnitude of the error is reduced consequently a quantitative error may occur depending on whether or not the environmental loads are considered table 8 shows the statistical values acquired from the measured power and calculated powers according to a consideration of the environmental loads when the environmental loads are not considered the average error between the measured values is predicted as 3 97 m w with a standard deviation of 3 63 m w when the environmental loads are considered the average error between the measured values and the predicted values is 0 2 m w and the standard deviation is 3 69 m w based on the averaged power for 14 days which is 16 59 m w the relative ratio of the error considering and not considering the environmental loads is 1 17 and 23 97 respectively due to a compensation of the speed loss affected by the environmental loads it seems accurate for the power to be estimated when the environmental load is considered however since fluctuations increase due to a consideration of irregular wind and wave the standard deviation slightly increases from 3 63 m w to 3 69 m w fig 33 shows the histogram of the error between the measured power and that calculated from the simulation according to a consideration of the environmental loads the black bars indicate the number of errors between the measured value and the predicted value considering the environmental loads the blue line with the squares indicates the number of errors between the measured value and the predicted value without considering the environmental loads the histogram is drawn up from 20 m w to 20 m w at 0 5 m w intervals when we do not consider the environmental loads the maximum frequency of the error is observed near 4 m w and it is distributed as a bell around this value in contrast when we take into account the environmental loads the maximum frequency of the error is observed near 1 m w the distribution of the error does not change significantly regardless of the presence or absence of environmental loads it is obvious that the distribution of the error shifted from 4 m w toward 1 m w considering the environmental loads 5 conclusion in this paper we propose a new approach to predict and verify the actual rpm and engine power after the sailing simulation has been conducted by considering the ship design information dynamic characteristics of the ship and several items including the sea route sailing speed and environmental conditions obtained from full scale measurement data the three conclusions are as follows first the whole voyage measured from full scale measurement data is continuously replicated by considering the course and speed change with a large difference decided by a seafarer or autopilot device a comparison of the location speed rpm and power can verify that the simulation is feasible second the rpm and engine power of the lngc are credibly predicted the obtained values are qualitatively and quantitatively reviewed by comparing the predicted results to the measured values the predicted rpm and power regardless of the presence or absence of the environmental loads has a similar tendency as the measured values and the predicted rpm is quantitatively matched with the measured value however in the case of the power there is a significant difference between the predicted values according to a consideration of the environmental loads third the power increment due to the environmental loads can be estimated from a comparison of the predicted power according to a consideration of the environmental loads based on the average power that is measured the error of the average power decreases from 23 97 when not considering the environmental loads to 1 17 and when considering the environmental loads in this study the power increment obtained from the sailing simulation is about 25 14 after this paper was organized there were some supplement items related to the accuracy of the suggested approach first consideration of the geodetic coordinate system will reduce the potential error of the calculated kinematic data the assumption of sphere causes an error of the location bearing and distance groves 2013 by applying the coordinate system for ellipsoid like the wgs84 the more credible simulation will be accomplished with accuracy groves 2013 furthermore detailed characteristics of navigation knowledge including an earth day and the rotation of the earth will be considered to improve the accuracy of the calculated results as well second an accurate mathematical model will raise the confidence of the prediction maneuvering equations of motion are constructed based on the empirical factor here in addition the dynamic characteristics of the ship are considered with the model tests and calculations conducted under idealized conditions third consideration of the tide current and water depth will raise the accuracy of the prediction these are important parameters to affect the hydrodynamic loads acting on the hull besides the more parameters are considered the more sailing routes can be simulated including a restricted water channel etc fourth development for estimating the foc or co2 emission will meet the technical demands of the industry since the emission issue is an important topic of sailing operation in the practical point of

23743,it is important to predict the actual rpm and engine power of a ship because it helps the ship builder and seafarer understand the actual performance of the ship however a precise prediction is difficult because it is closely connected to the ship design resistance seakeeping maneuvering performance etc synthetically in this paper we propose a new approach to predict the actual rpm and engine power of an lngc from full scale measurement data considering the described performance the sea route speed over ground and environmental conditions obtained from the measured data are additionally used to simulate sailing of the ship from the coast of southern taiwan to the coast of madagascar for 14 days the results of the simulation are qualitatively reviewed by comparing the calculated time histories of the rpm and the power with the measured rpm and power the results are quantitatively analyzed by comparing the time histories of errors between the measured values and calculated values finally the power increment due to the environmental load is estimated by comparing the predicted power considering the environmental load with the predicted power not considering the environmental load keywords rpm engine power full scale measurement ship design resistance seakeeping maneuvering environmental conditions 1 introduction recently discussions on applying the eedi eeoi and seemp have been carried out by the imo jung 2011 ball et al 2015 and the regulations of the iso have been updated to consider the environmental effects including wind waves current water depth etc to predict the speed from a sea trial iso 2015 the imo and iso aim to express the actual performance of a vessel objectively by improving the regulations and procedures to evaluate the performance of the ship with assumptions of the actual operating conditions to cope with such changes in regulations and procedures a prediction a measurement and an analysis related to the actual performance have been conducted using various elements from different fields of technology for example conventional studies have compared maneuvering performance indices through simulations model tests and sea trials of the imo maneuvering tests kim et al 2011 2001 2007 and other studies have been carried out to consider the effect of the environmental load including wind waves and current on the resistance and maneuvering performance of a ship from a practical point of view yoon and rhee 2003 seo and kim 2011 liu 1993 you et al 2017a in the field of propeller design research has been conducted to measure and analyze the change in the performance of the propeller during actual operation song et al 2005 choi et al 2011 andersen et al 2002 hur et al 2011 in sailing of a ship and operating an offshore structure researchers have considered the performance of a vessel in estimating the foc to search for an optimal route rindaroy 2013 lin et al 2013 although the described studies have been carried out to estimate the actual performance of a vessel for each element technology it is necessary to consider not only the ship design information resistance seakeeping maneuvering performance etc but also the environmental conditions and sailing records including sea route and sailing speed to estimate the actual performance of a ship synthetically recently research has been conducted to assess the actual performance of the ship regarding the added resistance by using full scale measurement data and design information kim et al 2017 however since each piece of information is strictly protected as intellectual property by shipyards and shipping companies it is difficult to study the estimation and evaluation of the actual performance of a ship to overcome these limitations studies have been carried out to analyze the actual performance of a ship from full scale measurement data by using statistical methods yoo et al 2016 yoo and kim 2016 the uncertainty of the measured speed and power was analyzed insel 2008 and foc was assessed from the effective power borkowski et al a study was recently conducted to estimate the actual performance of a ship by using the design information model test results and ais data you et al 2017b 2017c in this paper we aim to propose a new approach to predict actual rpm and engine power after the sailing simulation has been conducted by considering ship design information model test results calculations and several items including sea routes sailing speed and environmental conditions obtained from full scale measurement data for this purpose a 151 k lngc constructed in the dsme was chosen and it is possible to consider the resistance seakeeping and maneuvering performance of the ship from the ship design information model test results and calculations in addition full scale measurement data of the vessel was secured from a shipping company in particular the latitude longitude sog mean draft measured wind data and measured wave data were selectively used mass of the ship is predicted from principal particulars and measured draft records the measured l c g is directly considered in the simulation the resistance coefficients are estimated by using a linear interpolation according to the mean draft and sailing speed taking into account the resistance model test results with the design draft and ballast draft some modified empirical formulae are used to set the hydrodynamic derivatives for the maneuvering simulation to ensure that the results of the simulation match well with the free running model test results you et al 2017b 2017c kijima et al 1990 fujii and tsuda 1961 1962 since the coefficients are obtained from the empirical formulae using principal particulars including the draft it is possible to consider the effect of the draft on the maneuverability of the ship the wind and wave loads are calculated by using the measured wind and wave information and they are considered as external forces and moment in the maneuvering equations of motion by calculating the maneuvering equations of motion at regular time intervals it is possible to update the acceleration speed location rudder deflection angle heading angle rpm power etc regularly the sailing of a ship was simulated by following the measured sea route and sailing speed from the coast of southern taiwan to the coast of madagascar for 14 days since the course and speed change with a large difference are considered in this simulation the whole voyage can be continuously replicated the results of the simulation are qualitatively reviewed by comparing the calculated time histories of rpm and power with those of the measured rpm and power and the results are quantitatively analyzed by comparing the time histories of the errors between the measured values and the calculated values histograms are drawn up to understand the characteristics of the errors and as a result it is possible to verify the predicted actual rpm and engine power finally the power increment due to environmental load is estimated by comparing the predicted power while considering the environmental loads with the predicted power and not considering the environmental loads in conclusion it is possible to construct a feasible sailing simulation by considering the ship design information dynamic characteristics of the ship and course and speed change with a large difference 2 mathematical model 2 1 coordinate system the 151 k lngc with a single screw that was studied in the previous research is also used here kim et al 2017

is 63 48 m 2 as shown in table 1 fig 2 shows the coordinate system of this research because coordinate systems for maneuvering equations of motion full scale measurement data wind load coefficients wave drift forces and moment are acquired for different coordinate systems it is necessary to arrange the whole values for an identical coordinate system while the calculation is performed the location of the ship is constantly updated in the polar coordinate system to prevent an error that occurs when it is repeatedly converted between the information of the polar coordinate system and that of the plane coordinate system richardus and adler 1972 groves 2013 when the earth is assumed to be a complete sphere in the polar coordinate system equations 1 3 are used to calculate the distance between two points bearing between two points and arrival location by considering the current location bearing and distance first equation 1 calculates the distance between two points when the latitude and longitude are known values equation 2 calculates the relative bearing between two points equation 3 calculates the arrival locations by considering the initial location bearing and distance the three equations that are mentioned are used to calculate the distance from the center of the ship to the waypoint the bearing between the center of the ship and waypoint and the updated

hydrodynamic loads for the hull are calculated as shown in equation 6 many hydrodynamic coefficients including the added mass added mass moment of inertia and rudder lift coefficients can be predicted using empirical formulae kijima et al 1990 fujii and tsuda 1961 1962 the definitions of each hydrodynamic derivative and non dimensionalization are identical to those in the prior research kijima et al 1990 however the slopes and constants related to y v n v n v r r are slightly modified to match the simulated results with free running model test results you et al 2017b 2017c the values are empirically modified by trial and error the simulated zigzag test results are well matched with those obtained from the free running model tests you et al 2017b 2017c however there are some differences between the simulation results and the free running model test results in 35 turning tests the coefficients are tuned to affect the magnitude of the turning trajectories as far as possible

k lngc is constructed as described the maneuverability of the ship with the design and ballast draft was already verified by comparing the results of the simulation for the 35 turning test the 10 10 zigzag test and the 20 20 zigzag test with those obtained from the free running model tests you et al 2017b 2017c the results of the free running model test and results of the calculation for the 10 10 zigzag tests and 20 20 zigzag tests were also reviewed in prior research you et al 2017b 2017c here trajectories of the 35 turning tests with a design and ballast draft are only referred to in fig 3 they are tested under deep water conditions with design speed for each draft the black squares and blue circles indicate the trajectories that were measured from free running model tests with the design and ballast draft the black solid line and blue chain line indicate the trajectories that were calculated with the design draft and ballast draft respectively there are some differences between locations obtained from free running model tests and calculated results later in the trajectories of course it can indicate that the described mathematical model may be inaccurate if the ship conducts large maneuvering behaviors long hours it may be possible to improve the accuracy of the mathematical model by conducting captive model tests or cfd calculations if the expected accuracy is somewhat lower than an individual expectation for the credibility of a sailing simulation however there is an outstanding merit to simulate maneuvering behavior with a different draft by using the empirical formulae despite the potential dissatisfaction for the accuracy due to the merit it is confirmed that the modified empirical formulae are applicable on the sailing simulation of the 151 k lngc after brief explanation for a captive model test and cfd calculation is described the strength is briefly mentioned as follows first captive model tests have been regarded as the most credible approach to obtain hydrodynamic coefficients used in the maneuvering equations of motion however a budget time and slot in a basin have to be secured to conduct a captive model test a few months ago not only those cannot be secured for the lngc constructed in the past but the accuracy increase is not greatly anticipated kim et al 2007 2011 second a set of hydrodynamic coefficients obtained from the cfd calculations can be applied to the simulation of the maneuvering behaviors accurately in reality the value of empirical formulae in maneuvering field has been diminished by applying the cfd on maneuvering simulations due to its accuracy and convenience sung et al 2015 however cfd has to accompany a lot of computing resource in spite of its broad applicability and accuracy it is hard to secure internal resource for this project unfortunately finally the empirical formulae are used to find a set of hydrodynamic coefficients due to the inaccuracy of the obtained results some values are empirically tuned even if the later trajectories are somewhat different the values of the advance transfer and tactical diameters are different less than 5 by sheer numbers only the level of difference observed in fig 3 is not immoderate in comparison to the captive model tests conducted at different basins kim et al 2007 2011 or in cfd calculation results sung et al 2015 consequently the coefficients obtained from empirical formulae and the small correction is regarded as allowable furthermore although there were small differences in the trajectory similar deviations between the calculated trajectories according to the draft and measured values according to the draft were also observed if there is a change of the draft of a vessel during simulation hydrodynamic coefficients cannot be newly acquired from the captive model tests or cfd calculations however since empirical formulae were constructed based on the physical knowledge by applying regression analysis a new set of the coefficients can be acquired from the verified empirical formulae immediately it is advantageous to simulate the sailing simulation 2 2 2 wind load to consider the wind loads acting on the 151 k lngc wind tunnel model test results and measured wind data are used more information can be shared with a reader if a sketch of the ship above the water line is opened due to the security policy of the shipbuilding company more information cannot be provided instead of the detailed lines it is possible to improve an intuitive grasp of the wind load characteristics of the vessel from fig 1 first of all the wind loads are calculated as shown in equations 9 and 10 and the non dimensionalized wind load coefficients were obtained from the wind tunnel model tests for the ship with the design and ballast draft the wind model test was conducted in the 2 6 m wide boundary layer wind tunnel in november 2004 the tunnel size is 20 8 m x 2 6 m x 1 8 m length x width x height here wind speed corresponds to 9 31 m s and a reynolds number is 8 565 10 5 at the reference height 10 0 m in full scale the model was constructed in wood high density foam and brass the tests were carried out with 1 200 scale model of the vessel it was chosen as a compromise between avoiding scale effects from a model that is too small and avoiding blockage in the wind tunnel caused by a model that is too large wind loads are measured using the 6 component strain gauges at the mid ship location the measured wind loads are non dimensionalized by using equation 9 fig 4 shows the wind load coefficients acquired according to the relative wind incident angle acting on the hull dsme 2005 the black solid line blue chain line and red broken line indicate c x ψ r w i c y ψ r w i and c n ψ r w i with the design draft and the black solid line with the squares blue chain line with circles and red broken line with diamonds indicate c x ψ r w i c y ψ r w i and c n ψ r w i with ballast draft respectively in the case of the lngc there is no difference in the shape or arrangement of the superstructure even if there is a change in the cargo consequently there is an insignificant difference in the wind load coefficients according to the draft in equation 10 the relations between the relative values of the wind and the absolute values of wind are summarized you et al 2017a however since relative values are obtained from the full scale measurement any convert is not done here just they are noticed for awareness only in equation 10 the definition of relative wind speed along the x axis y axis is shown and relative wind speed and relative wind incident angle are defined as well since the relative wind speed and relative wind incident angle were measured from a wind sensor installed on the ship the measured values were relatively obtained such as v r w i and ψ r w i l o a a t and a l according to the draft are summarized in table 2 in the sailing simulation the wind load coefficients and the projected areas are predicted using the linear interpolation method according to the mean draft the calculated wind loads are considered as external forces and moment in the maneuvering equations of motion as shown in equation 5 9 c x ψ r w i x 1 2 ρ u 2 a t c y ψ r w i y 1 2 ρ u 2 a l c n ψ r w i n 1 2 ρ u 2 a l l o a 10 x w i c x ψ r w i 1 2 ρ a i r a t v r w i 2 y w i c y ψ r w i 1 2 ρ a i r a

load to consider the wave loads acting on the 151 k lngc the ship design information including the lines and loading conditions and measured wave data were used the concept of a linear superposition is used to calculate the wave drift forces and the moment in irregular waves the increase in mean resistance in irregular waves is calculated by using pre calculated wave drift forces and moment and wave spectrum it is written as follows and the process is well summarized in the references iso 2015 seo and kim 2011 ittc 2011 11 x w a y w a n w a 0 q t f w α w ζ a 2 e w d w e w 5 16 h s 2 w m 4 w

information including the loading conditions hydrostar which is a famous commercial software provided by bv classification is used here in equation 11 qtf means wave drift force as shown in figs 5 10 variation of transfer function related to the ship speed wave frequency and wave heading can be shown in these figures table 3 shows the calculation matrix to acquire the wave loads acting on the hull the wave drift forces and the moment are calculated for five speeds seven wave incident angles and twenty nine wave frequencies respectively to avoid extrapolation of wave loads acting on the hull the minimum speed is determined by zero k n o t s and the maximum speed is determined by design speed of ballast draft which is 19 0 k n o t s the wave drift forces and moment for x y a n d n at an arbitrary time are obtained by using the linear interpolation method according to the speed and wave incident angle the significant wave height wave mean period and wave direction are measured from a wave radar installed on the ship the significant wave height and wave mean period that were measured are used to generate the ittc wave spectrum as explained in ref iso 2015 seo and kim 2011 ittc 2011 the calculated wave loads are considered as external forces and moment in equation 5 figs 4 6 show the non dimensionalized surge sway and yaw wave drift forces and moment for waves from 60 of the lngc with the ballast draft according to the speed figs 7 9 show the non dimensionalized surge and sway wave drift forces and yaw drift moment according to the wave incident angles at 0 6085 frequency of the lngc with the ballast draft according to the speed equation 11 show how to non dimensionalize the forces and moment in the figures since there are many wave drift forces and moments according to the speed frequency and wave direction the plots are drawn up for waves from 60 and the frequency of 0 6085 only the black solid line blue chain line red broken line orange chain line with squares and green broken line with circles indicate results for 0 0 7 5 13 0 17 5 and 19 0 k n o t s respectively the typical tendencies of the wave drift force are well shown in these figures as the ship speed becomes larger the peak values of wave drift force also become larger and the peak frequencies are moved in the small wave frequency and the maximum values of the calculated wave drift forces and moment are observed the waves from 60 to 300 it can be easily guessed that as the ship speed becomes larger a larger amount of waves is scattered and this causes a large peak value also the peak frequency of the wave drift force goes to small wave frequency because the encounter with the wave frequency becomes larger seo and kim 2011 3 concept of sailing simulation 3 1 types of data used in the sailing simulation the sailing simulation of the 151 k lngc is conducted based on full scale measurement data by referring the approach proposed based on the ais data in the previous study you et al 2017b 2017c here kinematic data acquired from full scale measurement are almost identical with those from ais of the 151 k lngc since measured data from various sensors are transmitted through an ais device and recorded on a storing device although each sensor has its own measuring period it is uncertain which technique is applied to the acquisition of the full scale measurement data at 10 min intervals table 4 shows the types of information acquired from the full scale measurement in particular the first and last records are summarized the time in utc can be checked to measure data ranging from 09 00 on november 22 2010 to 09 00 on december 6 2010 the latitude longitude cog sog forward draft after the draft relative wind speed relative wind incident angle significant wave height wave mean period relative wave incident angle rpm and power were measured at 10 min intervals for 14 days among these the information which is used directly in the simulation is the latitude longitude sog and mean draft fig 11 shows the sea route of the ship from the coast of southern taiwan to the coast of madagascar the course and speed change with a large difference when entering and leaving the strait of malacca in most of the remaining paths the ship maintains a straight path since the acquisition of full scale measurement data for a ship which was constructed in dsme is unusual the data are used to study the actual performance of the sailing vessel to simulate a sailing of a ship successive data have to be acquired without large intervals as far as possible consequently the mentioned period is chosen to study the actual sailing performance of the ship in this research if an area on the route is magnified the slight change of its course is sometimes observed the vessel is loaded with liquefied natural gas in west africa and is transported to asia via america then it follows a route from asia to west africa again accordingly it is operated under ballast condition during the selected voyage period in table 4 the draft for 14 days is changed from 9 77 m and 8 34 m to 9 80 m and 8 02 m because there are oil consumption and usage of living creature by crews the draft has to be consistently changed in fig 10 water depth can be briefly perceived from the coloring of a sea the water depth was not measured in the 151 k lngc since there is no sensor to measure the water depth in the vessel it seems that the minimum water depth is observed near the strait of malacca where main shipping channels vary from 14 9 m to over 100 m national geospatial intelligence agency 2016 shallow water effect can be ignored if the value of h t is larger than 4 0 conference 2003 because it is hard to predict water depth according to the actual location of the ship the shallow water effect is not considered here in the strait of malacca on the average between 50 and 60 of all current observation in the strait are 0 5 k n o t s or less national geospatial intelligence agency 2016 a small portion of these observations exceed 2 0 k n o t s national geospatial intelligence agency 2016 however there is no sensor to measure the currents or tides in the vessel they cannot be considered as well the predominant winds over the strait of malacca are monsoon winds normal wind strength is 5 10 k n o t s but may reach 20 to 25 k n o t s for short periods in the north part of the strait national geospatial intelligence agency 2016 it seems that the strong wind observed from 6 days to 9 days as shown in fig 12 may be linked closely with the reported wind characteristics in the north part of the strait of malacca the highest mean wind speed is about 33 k m h 17 82 k n o t s and significant wave height is ranging from 0 5 m to 3 5 m from the annual reporting cycle in the indian ocean reddi 2013 the highest wind and wave conditions are generally observed from june to august due to summer monsoon and the lowest conditions are shown from december to february due to winter monsoon although the maximum wind speed which is relatively acquired from full scale measurement by considering ship speed is about 40 k n o t s the absolute wind speed in the route is under 23 5 k n o t s at that time the maximum significant wave height is about 3 0 m based on the full scale measurement data the measured values for wind and waves are comparable or greater than the values affected by summer monsoon consequently the sailing performance of the 151 k lngc is predicted under stronger environmental conditions than usual fig 12 shows the time histories of the measured relative wind speed and relative wind incident angle measured from a wind sensor the black solid line indicates the relative wind speed and the blue circles indicate the relative wind incident angle as shown in equation 10 the effect of sailing speed is already considered in the relative values of wind data fig 13 shows the time histories of the measured significant wave height and relative wave incident angle obtained from a wave radar the wave radar can measure the wave mean period as well the black solid line indicates a significant wave height and the blue circles indicate the relative incident angle of the wave the identical sailing scenario which was measured is repeatedly simulated according to a consideration of the environmental load in figs 12 and 13 the dotted lines along the time axis indicate every one day from the initial time of the calculation the effect of the environmental load on the rpm and engine power can be basically studied by repeated simulations according to a consideration of the environmental loads in the two figures a certain direction of the wind and waves are maintained for days from the initial time however non directional environmental conditions are distinctly observed from about 3 days to 6 days in particular the wind and wave incident angles are distributed from all directions a significant wave height is obviously small and the observed mild weather conditions with non directional characteristics were due the 151 k lngc going through the strait of the malacca during this period the effect of the non directional environmental load on the rpm and engine power can be further investigated during the analysis rapid changes in the relative wind speed and significant wave height are sometimes observed and this is regarded as the effect of noise in the signal measurement however any filters or smoothing techniques were not applied to post process the values because the measurement data is provided for a relatively long period of time with 10 min intervals and because the locations consistently change due to the sailing of the ship since this concerns a distortion due to the application of any filters and smoothing techniques the effect of noise on the simulation is ignored here based on the measured relative wind speed the wind loads acting on the hull from about 7 days to 9 days were relatively large the maximum wind speed measured from full scale measurement was about 40 k n o t s absolute wind speed is about 23 5 k n o t s and the beaufort number is below 6 bhattacharyya 1978 in the case of the measured significant wave height the values were below 4 0 m therefore the sea state is below 3 lee and rhee 2001 from the maximum beaufort number and sea state the ship can be judged not to operate under extreme weather conditions therefore there is no problem related to predicting the environmental loads described before 3 2 simulation procedure using the full scale measurement data fig 14 shows the general flow chart of the sailing simulation using full scale measurement data among the acquired data the information at the initial time is regarded to be the initial state of the ship the latitude and longitude of the ship obtained from the full scale measurement data are assumed as the waypoints that the ship has to follow during the simulation they are measured from the onboard gps the sog is assumed as the command speed you et al 2017b 2017c the initial speed of the ship is assumed as the acquired initial sog and the initial rpm is estimated based on the initial mean draft and sailing speed by using linear interpolation between the resistance with the design draft and with ballast draft the initial heading angle is assumed as the bearing from the first location to the second location and the ship is always sailing from an arbitrary location toward the determined waypoint if the ship passes through the following waypoint the next location is substituted into the next waypoint the determination of whether the ship arrives at a waypoint or not is done by considering the concept in previous studies you et al 2017b 2017c lee and rhee 2001 you and rhee 2016 whether the relative distance from the center of the ship to the waypoint comes within a certain distance and whether the relative bearing from the current location of the ship and waypoint is larger than current heading angle is then judged the calculation of the distance and relative bearing is conducted by using equations 1 and 2 here the values are assumed to be 0 25 l p p and π 4 fig 15 shows an example of the course of the ship and determined waypoints from full scale measurement data the measured locations of the lngc at 10 min intervals are assumed as waypoints in the figure after the ship goes by the waypoint 1 it is moving toward the waypoint 2 the course is automatically determined by following the waypoints continuously in order to change the course of the ship according to the change in the waypoint the rudder deflection angle is determined by applying fuzzy control which takes into account the turn rate of the ship and the difference between the command heading angle and the current heading angle 36 38 the input variables used in the fuzzy control are defined in fig 15 the relative bearing is calculated by using equation 2 fuzzy membership functions which are nine and triangles and reasoning rules are identically used with those presented by the referred paper lee and rhee 2001 you and rhee 2016 hasegawa and kouzuki 1987 imo 2002 first the triangular membership functions of heading error are made up from 30 d e g to 30 d e g at 10 intervals second the membership functions of time derivative of heading error are defined on 1 0 0 5 0 2 0 05 0 0 05 0 2 0 5 and 1 0 d e g s respectively finally the membership functions of reasoning the command rudder angle are distinguished from 35 d e g to 35 d e g at 8 75 intervals to determine the command rudder angle at 30 s intervals the centroid of the chosen triangular functions is found lee and rhee 2001 the reason why the fuzzy control is applied to the simulation is that the control habits of the seafarers can be considered the decision for the rudder deflection angle in the actual operating vessel depends on the manufacturer of the autopilot devices in some cases since the seafarer controls the ship manually it is almost impossible to use identical control technique in this kind of simulation for the ship therefore fuzzy control is the best alternative to determine the rudder deflection angle during the simulation because the actual sailing draft is determined by the amount of cargo and ballast water etc it continuously changes during sailing because there are oil consumption and usage of living creature by crews the draft has to be changed furthermore if lng is loaded in a vessel in harbor the draft can be significantly changed as the draft is continuously changed during the voyage the mass of the ship is also changed to calculate the mass l p p b c b and mean draft are used in case of x g is updated from the full scale measurement data the resistance coefficients are calculated by applying a linear interpolation method according to the mean draft and sailing speed and the hydrodynamic derivatives are predicted from empirical formulae using principal particulars you et al 2017b 2017c kijima et al 1990 in the sailing simulation it is necessary to adjust an rpm according to the state of the propulsion devices equation 12 has been generally used to tune the rpm during a simulation of maneuvering tests such as turning tests or zigzag tests 39 since the test speed is regulated as at least 90 of the ship s speed corresponding to 85 of the maximum engine output 39 q e is a known variable according to the internal sea trial procedure i p p can be calculated using the design information as well since q p is identical with q denoted in equation 7 n can be predicted according to the prescribed values in case of the mandatory tests however equation 12 is not applicable in this sailing simulation although i p p is known and q p can be calculated using equation 7 q e is continuously changed by a seafarer as mentioned a voyage of the lngc is not conducted by following a simple scenario like maneuvering tests since the engine output is randomly variated equation 12 cannot be solved using the known values consequently another approach is needed to acquire n empirically in the previous research the speed of the ship was compared to the command speed at every 30 s to set the rpm if the speed of the ship was faster than the command speed the rpm decreases by 0 2 when the opposite happens the rpm increases by 0 2 you et al 2017a 2017b 2017c the rpm command is determined by accomplishing for the ship to follow the command speed without great gaps from the full scale measurement data by trial and error there is a limitation due to steps of the rpm command if a seafarer commands speed reduction or speed increase with large differences sailing speed cannot be immediately followed by using the fixed value to overcome the mentioned limitation the rpm command is variated according to the difference between the command speed and sailing speed of the ship as shown in table 5 by considering the updated hydrodynamic loads using the resistance and hydrodynamic coefficients the propeller thrust rudder loads wind loads wave loads rpm etc and maneuvering equations of motion are solved to update the acceleration velocity location etc after judging whether the ship arrives at the final waypoint or not the calculations are repeated until the ship reaches the final waypoint 12 2 π i p p n q e q p table 5 rpm commands per 30 s according to the difference between the command speed and sailing speed of the ship since the coordinates of the model test results full scale measurement data equations and calculation results are different it is necessary to summarize how to convert the coordinates as shown in table 6 first the latitude longitude sog and heading angle based on the global coordinate system are perceived at the present time second maneuvering equations of motion are solved by considering the environmental loads based on body fixed system third longitudinal speed transversal speed and turn rate are acquired by solving the equations fourth the deviations of distance and heading angle on the global coordinate system are calculated from the obtained values finally the updated latitude and longitude are found from the present latitude and longitude by calculating equation 3 the described convert is repeatedly conducted during the sailing simulation linear interpolation is applied to the calculation of resistance coefficient wind load coefficient wind load areas and wave drift forces and moment in the case of resistance coefficient and wind load areas depend on the draft only since the ballast draft is only considered simulation is used by using the values for the ballast draft wind load coefficients depend on draft and wind incident angle by using the coefficients obtained for the ballast draft the linear interpolation according to wind incident angle is applied in the case of wave drift forces and moment the loads depend on the sailing speed of the ship and wave incident angle since the wave load calculation is conducted for the ballast draft only after the linear interpolation is applied to sailing speed the effect of wave incident angle is calculated 3 3 feasibility check of the simulation fig 16 shows a comparison between the ship locations acquired from the full scale measurement data for 14 days and those calculated from the simulation according to a consideration of the environmental load there are two types of calculations one is simulated by considering the environmental loads and the other is simulated by ignoring the environmental loads the purpose is to compare the effect of the environmental loads on the actual rpm and engine power that are predicted qualitatively and quantitatively the black solid line blue squares and red circles indicate the measured locations of the ship predicted locations considering the environmental loads and predicted locations not considering the environmental loads respectively the ship can be seen to follow the measured locations regardless of the presence or absence of the environmental loads of course since the figure shows the entire route that was traveled for 14 days it may be necessary to compare the measured locations with the predicted locations for the enlarged section therefore the part of the course change with a large difference is chosen and it is marked as a rectangle in fig 16 fig 17 shows the enlarged figure of the ship locations acquired from full scale measurement data and those calculated from a simulation according to a consideration of the environmental loads near the entrance of the strait of malacca the definition of each symbol is identical to those in fig 16 only the enlarged figure shows a 0 5 0 5 area here the earth is assumed to be a complete sphere and the length of the base line in fig 17 is of about 55 59 k m even if there is a change in course with a large difference the ship can follow the measured locations as well figs 16 and 17 confirm that the ship passes through the waypoint very closely fig 18 shows the time histories of the measured ship speed and calculated speeds according to a consideration of the environmental loads the black solid line blue squares and red circles indicate the measured speeds of the ship predicted speeds considering the environmental loads and predicted speeds not considering the environmental loads respectively the speed of the ship can be seen to follow the measured speeds as well as the locations when the mean error between the measured values and the predicted values at 10 min intervals is calculated the averages are 0 022 k n o t s and 0 015 k n o t s these values are negligible in particular there are cases where the measured speed cannot be accurately tracked from about 3 days to 8 days as shown in fig 18 and this is a result of the rapid increase or decrease in the relative wind speed namely as the relative wind speed increases rapidly the speed of the ship suddenly decreases due to the increased wind load however the period is very short compared to the total measurement and simulation period and it is regarded to have an insignificant effect for the predicted rpm and engine power fig 19 shows the time histories of the measured ship speed and the calculated speeds according to a consideration of the environmental load near the entrance of the strait of malacca to conduct a detailed comparison the definition of each symbol is identical to those in fig 18 here a decimal value such as 3 7 days is obtained by dividing the time marked into seconds by 86 400 s because there are 86 400 s in a day there is a change in speed with a large difference when the ship entered the strait of the malacca an insignificant difference between the measured speed and the simulated speed is basically observed when the speed change is not rapid by applying the different rpm commands according to speed deviation as shown in table 5 the rapid change in the speed can be followed in the sailing simulation in comparison with previous research you et al 2017b 2017c consequently figs 18 and 19 confirm that the ship follows the measured speed well figs 16 19 confirm that the measured location and speed of the ship follow well the simulation as its purpose the course and speed change with a large difference can be considered during the simulation since the simulation is confirmed from comparisons the results obtained from the simulation are analyzed in similar research the longitudinal load is only analyzed by considering added resistance due to wind and waves liu 1993 kim et al 2017 yoo et al 2016 yoo and kim 2016 the reason why maneuvering equations of motion are solved will be described by comparing the effect of environmental loads on the dynamic response of the ship during the whole voyage figs 20 22 show the time histories of the surge sway and yaw relative ratio among the loads under no environmental loads figs 23 25 show the time histories of the surge sway and yaw relative ratio among the prescribed loads under the environmental loads in these figures white black yellow and blue colors indicate the ratio of the hull rudder wind and wave loads respectively each ratio is calculated by using equation 13 the reason why the absolute values are summed is to avoid the effect of the sign if the values with the sign are summed the accumulated ratio is acquired over 100 or under 100 case by case to avoid this kind of change the values are represented by its magnitude only since there are no environmental loads acting on the hull relative ratios due to wind and waves are not observed in figs 20 22 all ratios are filled with white color in fig 20 and it means that rudder load along the longitudinal direction is not detected since there are no environmental loads which prevent from going straight the rudder is only used to change the ship s course to a minimum in reality although rudder is deflected to change the course it is very small and it cannot be visibly plotted in fig 21 the rudder loads for sway are ranging up to 2 3 only in fig 22 the rudder loads for yaw are ranging up to 20 since there are wind and wave loads acting on the hull with different conditions relative ratios due to the hull rudder wind and wave loads are significantly different as shown in figs 23 25 in fig 23 the wind load gets a large share of the whole loads the variation of wind load ratio is aligned with the tendency of the relative wind speed as shown in fig 12 about 4 days and 7 days there are peaks of the wind load those times correspond to the times for the ship to be near the entrance and exit to the strait of malacca as the speed of the ship is decreased the relative magnitudes of wind and hull loads become affected in figs 24 and 25 wave loads affect loads for sway and yaw significantly the variation of the ratio of wave load is similar with the time histories of the significant wave height as shown in fig 13 since the wind and wave loads prevent for the ship from going straight it is necessary to control a rudder largely so the relative ratios of rudder loads are observed in figs 23 25 distinctly from the figures of relative ratios the effect of environmental loads acting on the ship is clearly perceived in this period the wind mainly affects the loads for the surge on the other hand waves affect the loads for the sway and yaw if the resistance along the longitudinal direction is only considered to investigate the sailing performance the described characteristics will be ignored 13 r a t i o o f w a v e l o a d x w a x w i x w a x r x h r a t i o o f

the described simulation of the ship has been conducted here the rpm and engine power indicate the rpm and power of the ship there are two types of calculations for whether the environmental loads are considered or not by comparing each result the qualitative and quantitative effects of environmental loads on the rpm and engine power are analyzed as well 4 1 analysis of the predicted rpm fig 26 shows the time histories of the measured rpm and calculated rpm according to the consideration of the environmental loads the black solid line blue squares and red circles indicate the measured rpm calculated rpm considering the environmental loads and calculated rpm not considering the environmental loads respectively the predicted rpms regardless of the presence or absence of the environmental loads show a similar tendency as the measured values and they can follow a change in the rpm with a large difference as well the rpm is confirmed to be basically predicted with a similar tendency by using the suggested simulation of course there is a difference in the tendency according to the results of the calculation from a quantitative point of view the calculated rpm from about 6 days to 12 days is obviously underestimated if the environmental loads are not considered on the other hand the rpms calculated for an identical period are slightly overestimated if the environmental loads are considered this is a result from the effect of the environmental loads acting on the lngc in figs 12 and 13 the wind loads come from bow to stern in that period apparently the wave loads come from the bow quartering or stern quartering at the identical period the environmental loads keep the ship from going forward as additional resistance consequently it is reasonable that a smaller propeller thrust should be needed to follow the measured speed when the environmental loads are not considered by considering the environmental loads during the simulation the predicted rpms are much more similar to the measured values however the rpms predicted from about 3 days to 6 days are commonly overestimated regardless of the presence or absence of the environmental loads this is closely correlated to the non directional characteristics of the environmental load as pointed out above for the period the environmental loads do not significantly act on the hull as additional resistance because the environmental loads come from all directions even the wind and wave conditions are mild enough to be ignored therefore the results of the calculation by ignoring the environmental loads are a slight overestimation during this period in fig 26 frequent fluctuations are observed regardless of presence or absence of the environmental loads in comparison with the measured rpm this is a result of the concept of a simulation based on the full scale measurement data and it is different from the control concept on board namely power is controlled by a seafarer in a sailing ship and this affects the rpm and sailing speed slowly the sailing speed consistently differs according to external loads such as wind waves and currents however in this simulation the ship follows the measured speed which has fluctuations due to the wind waves and current therefore there have to be frequent fluctuations in the predicted rpm the time lags are finely observed regardless of the presence or absence of environmental loads compared to the measured rpm to confirm the observed time lags the time histories of the rpms are drawn up from 3 5 days to 4 2 days in detail fig 27 shows the time histories of the measured rpm and the calculated rpms according to a consideration of the environmental loads near the entrance to the strait of malacca the definition of each symbol is identical to those in fig 26 the time lags of the rpm are clearly recognized during this period when the speed is changed by a seafarer with a large difference the time lag is of about 0 1 days regardless of the consideration of the environmental loads the reason for this is there are time lags between the measured rpm and the calculated rpms due to the control concept of the actual ship being different from that of the simulation as was explained in the actual ship the power is controlled by a seafarer of course this affects the rpm and sailing speed the change in the speed and course is not affected immediately due to a slow dynamic response of a ship when the seafarer tries to change the power and rudder deflection angle to change speed or course you and rhee 2016 since the measured change in the speed of the ship is followed by the ship in this simulation there have to be time lags the time lag can lead to a contorted prediction of the rpm however since the sailing simulation is conducted for 14 days there is an insignificant effect on the prediction of the rpm due to the time lags from a macro perspective as shown in table 1 the propulsion devices are designed with the maximum rpm of about 86 by mcr since the measured rpms are always under 80 there is no overloaded condition however the calculated rpms indicate that the propulsion device is sometimes overloaded from 6 days to 8 days and from 7 days to 9 days especially peak about 96 is observed near 6 days the overload is caused by the fluctuation and a sudden change of the measured speed however overload is not forcibly prevented in the sailing simulation due to following two reasons first the maximum rpm at mcr has a 5 6 margin in general the period of overload is not long enough since the overloads are observed as peaks entire rpms will be insignificantly affected by the overloaded peaks second it is judged that sharing the characteristics of the suggested sailing simulation concept with a reader is needed if there is a condition to prevent the rpm from increasing above the maximum rpm it affects the speed or location calculated in the simulation as well to avoid the potential error or misunderstanding any condition is not inserted for limiting the rpm control it is necessary to analyze the measured rpm and predicted rpm according to a consideration of the environmental loads in detail fig 28 shows the time histories of the errors between the measured rpm and calculated rpms with 10 min intervals the black solid line shows the difference between the measured rpm and calculated rpm considering the environmental loads also the blue squares indicate the difference between the measured rpm and calculated rpm not considering the environmental loads first of all there are large errors toward the positive and negative direction in turn at about 4 days 7 days 13 days and 14 days as previously mentioned there are time lags between the measured rpm and calculated rpm when the speed change with a large difference is conducted therefore a negative error appears first and the positive error subsequently appears since the error occurs due to the time lag the magnitude of the error toward the positive and negative direction is almost similar the magnitude of a peak or off peak of the rpm error is mainly affected by the difference of rpms commanded by a seafarer in addition the underestimated or overestimated rpm which is calculated affects the magnitude of peaks and off peaks subordinately for example in fig 26 after the measured rpm is reduced from about 66 to about 4 by some stages in about 4 days measured rpm returns to about 76 rapidly the differences of rpms are about 60 70 however in fig 28 the magnitude of observed off peak is about 55 and the observed peak is about 50 the magnitude is slightly smaller than the difference between the front and rear rpm commanded by the seafarer as mentioned the magnitude of the peak and off peak have to be smaller than the difference between measured rpms of peak and off peak since the calculated rpm is overestimated in the off peak likewise after rpm is reduced from about 72 to about 50 by some stages in about 7 days rpm returns to about 76 rapidly the differences of rpms are about 20 30 however in fig 28 the magnitude of observed off peak is about 30 and the observed peak is about 35 the magnitude is slightly larger than the difference of the front and rear rpm the magnitude of the peak and off peak has to be larger than the difference between measured rpms of peak and off peak since the calculated rpm is underestimated in the off peak this kind of tendency is also observed in other peaks and off peaks the errors are mostly scattered about zero when the environmental loads are considered the errors obviously shift to positive values from about 6 days to 12 days when the environmental loads are not considered this indicates that the predicted rpm not considering the environmental loads is underestimated since the environmental load is considered the magnitude of the error is remarkably reduced consequently a quantitative error may occur depending on whether the environmental load is considered or not table 7 shows statistical values for the measured rpm and calculated rpms according to a consideration of the environmental loads when the environmental loads are not considered the average error between the measured values and the predicted values is 2 99 and the standard deviation is 7 41 when the environmental loads are considered the average error between the measured values and the predicted values is 2 09 and the standard deviation is 6 55 based on the averaged rpm for 14 days which is 72 69 the relative ratio of the error considering the environmental loads and not considering the environmental loads are 2 88 and 4 10 respectively due to the compensation of the speed loss affected by the environmental loads it seems that the rpm is estimated to be higher when the environmental loads are considered since the error induced by time lags toward the positive and negative direction in turns they are canceled out for the average value of the rpm error however since fluctuations are identically observed the standard deviation is not significantly affected by considering the environmental loads fig 29 shows a histogram of the error between the measured rpm and that calculated from the simulation according to a consideration of the environmental loads the black bars indicate the number of errors between the measured value and the predicted value considering the environmental loads the blue line with squares indicates the number of errors between the measured value and the predicted value not considering the environmental loads a histogram is drawn up from 60 to 60 at 1 interval and the characteristics of the statistical values shown in table 7 are observed again when we do not consider environmental loads the maximum frequency of the error is observed near 4 and it is distributed as a bell around this value on the contrary when we take into account the environmental loads the maximum frequency of the error is observed near 1 the distribution of the error does not change significantly regardless of the presence or absence of the environmental loads it is just obviously observed in that the distribution of the error has shifted from 4 toward 1 according to the consideration of the environmental loads in addition although there are some frequencies with a large error they are caused by the time lags 4 2 analysis of the predicted power fig 30 shows the time histories of the measured power and the calculated powers according to a consideration of the environmental loads the black solid line indicates the measured power the blue squares show the predicted power considering the environmental loads and the red circles indicate the predicted power not considering the environmental loads the predicted powers show a similar tendency as the measured values regardless of the presence or absence of environmental loads and they follow the change in power with a large difference as well however there is a significant difference according to the results of the calculation from a quantitative point of view the power calculated from about 6 days to 14 days is obviously underestimated if the environmental loads are not considered and the deviation from the measured power is of about 5 0 m w if the environmental loads are considered the powers calculated for an identical period are scattered for the measured power or a slightly overestimated value from the measured values the results show that the environmental load affects the propulsion power of a ship during sailing in the comparison of fig 26 the error between the measured values and the predicted values becomes distinctly larger in fig 30 although a similar tendency is observed this is closely connected with equation 7 the power is predicted in proportion to n 3 the prediction error of the measured and calculated power is sometimes about 5 0 m w even if there is no difference of the measured power it is regarded as a great deal of difference of course the suggested simulation concept may be useless if the difference is maintained for all the time the large fluctuation cannot be avoidable because the ship is followed the disturbed speed by wind and waves furthermore the fluctuation becomes worse after wind and wave measuring data are additionally considered if the fluctuations occur with a little different value as the mean it can be allowable in macroscopic point of view a large amount of deviation at the moment cannot affect the sum of the actual power during the whole voyage since they are canceled out the opposite value the fluctuations and time lags are identically observed for the power as shown in fig 27 since the rpm is used to calculate the power as shown in equation 7 similar features have to be observed fig 31 shows the time histories of the measured power and calculated powers according to a consideration of the environmental load near the entrance of the strait of malacca the definition of each symbol is identical to those in fig 30 and the time lags for the power are clearly recognized during this period when the speed changes by a seafarer with a large difference the time lag is of about 0 1 days regardless of the presence or absence of the environmental loads there are time lags between the measured power and calculated power for the same reason mentioned above as shown in table 1 the propulsion devices are designed with the maximum power of about 32 000 k w since the measured powers are always under 21 m w there is no overloaded condition likewise the calculated powers are always under 30 m w even if there is a large difference between the maximum value of measurement and the maximum value of calculation any overload is not observed here there has been an attempt to analyze in detail the power measured and predicted according to a consideration of the environmental loads fig 32 shows the time histories of the error between the measured power and the calculated power according to a consideration of the environmental loads the black solid line shows the difference between the measured power and calculated power considering the environmental loads and the blue squares indicate the difference between measured power and calculated power not considering the environmental loads as mentioned peaks and off peaks are observed in turn in case of the error of rpm as shown in fig 28 however there are some differences in the peaks and off peaks of the error of power in fig 32 the magnitude of power error is also mainly affected by the difference of powers commanded by a seafarer the predicted power is proportional to n 3 the more the value of rpm increases the more the deviation of power obtained according to the same difference of rpm reversely the less the value of rpm decrease the less the deviation of power obtained according to the same difference of rpm in fig 27 there are some steps to reduce or increase the rpm although the interval is not large the difference between rpm commanded by the seafarer is large however the power is amplified of n 3 as rpm is reduced with the small interval power is drastically decreased so the relative magnitude of the difference between powers is smaller than the values between rpms therefore the off peak of the power is not large enough as shown in the off peak of the rpm however the peak of the power is large enough as shown in the peak of the rpm for example from figs 27 and 31 the difference can be clearly understood rpm is decreased from about 64 to 50 for 0 1 days in this period rpm is decreased about 20 sequentially rpm is decreased again from about 50 to about 4 for 0 1 days in this period rpm is decreased about 95 again however the power is decreased from about 12 m w to 6 m w for the first 0 1 days in this period power is decreased about 50 sequentially power is decreased from 6 m w to about 1 m w for the second 0 1 days in this period power is decreased about 85 the errors are mostly scattered about zero or slightly negative value when the environmental loads are considered the errors are obviously shifted to positive values from about 6 days to 12 days when the environmental loads are not considered this indicates that the predicted power is underestimated on the assumption of there being no environmental loads when the environmental loads are considered the magnitude of the error is reduced consequently a quantitative error may occur depending on whether or not the environmental loads are considered table 8 shows the statistical values acquired from the measured power and calculated powers according to a consideration of the environmental loads when the environmental loads are not considered the average error between the measured values is predicted as 3 97 m w with a standard deviation of 3 63 m w when the environmental loads are considered the average error between the measured values and the predicted values is 0 2 m w and the standard deviation is 3 69 m w based on the averaged power for 14 days which is 16 59 m w the relative ratio of the error considering and not considering the environmental loads is 1 17 and 23 97 respectively due to a compensation of the speed loss affected by the environmental loads it seems accurate for the power to be estimated when the environmental load is considered however since fluctuations increase due to a consideration of irregular wind and wave the standard deviation slightly increases from 3 63 m w to 3 69 m w fig 33 shows the histogram of the error between the measured power and that calculated from the simulation according to a consideration of the environmental loads the black bars indicate the number of errors between the measured value and the predicted value considering the environmental loads the blue line with the squares indicates the number of errors between the measured value and the predicted value without considering the environmental loads the histogram is drawn up from 20 m w to 20 m w at 0 5 m w intervals when we do not consider the environmental loads the maximum frequency of the error is observed near 4 m w and it is distributed as a bell around this value in contrast when we take into account the environmental loads the maximum frequency of the error is observed near 1 m w the distribution of the error does not change significantly regardless of the presence or absence of environmental loads it is obvious that the distribution of the error shifted from 4 m w toward 1 m w considering the environmental loads 5 conclusion in this paper we propose a new approach to predict and verify the actual rpm and engine power after the sailing simulation has been conducted by considering the ship design information dynamic characteristics of the ship and several items including the sea route sailing speed and environmental conditions obtained from full scale measurement data the three conclusions are as follows first the whole voyage measured from full scale measurement data is continuously replicated by considering the course and speed change with a large difference decided by a seafarer or autopilot device a comparison of the location speed rpm and power can verify that the simulation is feasible second the rpm and engine power of the lngc are credibly predicted the obtained values are qualitatively and quantitatively reviewed by comparing the predicted results to the measured values the predicted rpm and power regardless of the presence or absence of the environmental loads has a similar tendency as the measured values and the predicted rpm is quantitatively matched with the measured value however in the case of the power there is a significant difference between the predicted values according to a consideration of the environmental loads third the power increment due to the environmental loads can be estimated from a comparison of the predicted power according to a consideration of the environmental loads based on the average power that is measured the error of the average power decreases from 23 97 when not considering the environmental loads to 1 17 and when considering the environmental loads in this study the power increment obtained from the sailing simulation is about 25 14 after this paper was organized there were some supplement items related to the accuracy of the suggested approach first consideration of the geodetic coordinate system will reduce the potential error of the calculated kinematic data the assumption of sphere causes an error of the location bearing and distance groves 2013 by applying the coordinate system for ellipsoid like the wgs84 the more credible simulation will be accomplished with accuracy groves 2013 furthermore detailed characteristics of navigation knowledge including an earth day and the rotation of the earth will be considered to improve the accuracy of the calculated results as well second an accurate mathematical model will raise the confidence of the prediction maneuvering equations of motion are constructed based on the empirical factor here in addition the dynamic characteristics of the ship are considered with the model tests and calculations conducted under idealized conditions third consideration of the tide current and water depth will raise the accuracy of the prediction these are important parameters to affect the hydrodynamic loads acting on the hull besides the more parameters are considered the more sailing routes can be simulated including a restricted water channel etc fourth development for estimating the foc or co2 emission will meet the technical demands of the industry since the emission issue is an important topic of sailing operation in the practical point of

23744,optimal design of an autonomous underwater vehicle auv consists of various subsystems and disciplines such as guidance and control payload hydrodynamics power and propulsion sizing structure trajectory and performance the designed vehicle is also employed in an operational environment with tactical parameters such as distance to target uncertainty in estimation of target position and target velocity multidisciplinary design optimization mdo is the best way for finding both optimum and feasible designs in this paper a new optimization design framework is proposed in which multidisciplinary feasible mdf as mdo framework and particle swarm optimization pso as optimizer were combined together for optimal and feasible conceptual design of an auv initially we found an optimal system design by using mdf pso methodology in engineering space for any single tactical situation locally tactical parameters then the optimal off design auvs in tactical subspaces were found by minimizing the difference between the locally optimized objective function and sub optimal objective function in this framework we have shown that not only is the tactical situation affected by auv design parameters but an optimal auv for each tactical regions are also found keywords multidisciplinary design optimization autonomous underwater vehicle mdf pso tactical subspace 1 introduction in recent years the application of autonomous underwater vehicle in many research domains such as underwater exploration and undersea warfare has developed in the design of an auv many engineering design fields such as hydrodynamics propulsion guidance navigation and control gnc and structure have been involved finally designed auv has been launched from a platform and it has been employed in operational environment the simultaneous application of these engineering fields increases the complexity of auv s design and tactic today the traditional design of a complex system that is employed in a bigger system has been outmoded and engineers are researching for new paradigms to solve design problems thus the design process of these systems is changed when new paradigms and techniques are created there are many important parameters for designing an auv such as velocity range payload propulsion system parameter guidance and control parameters hydrodynamic sonar target detection parameter tactical parameters that increase the complexity of the design process and coupling between subsystems or disciplines belegundu et al 2000 yukish et al 2000 frits 2004 mcallister et al 2002 fitzgerald et al 2002 benanzer et al 2008 zhang et al 2013 complexity and hard coupling between these disciplines increase the computational burden and processing time of the design optimization process there are many techniques for designing an auv such as stochastic methods multiobjective methods and reliability based methods in recent years engineers have tended towards using multidisciplinary design optimization mdo methods for designing the complex system designers can simultaneously improve the design and reduce the time and cost of the design cycle by solving the mdo problem the mdo framework and architectures are developed for using numerical optimization to perform the design of systems that involve a number of subsystems or disciplines the type of mdo architecture and optimization method has affected optimization process time and optimal design convergence martins and lambe 2013 in the current auv development the engineering aspect of the design is decoupled from the development of the tactics in which the auv is employed tactics are developed by intelligence experts while auv design is handled by engineers if the design of auv is simultaneously performed with the design of tactics then a more effective auv can be created application of multidisciplinary design optimization methods has been carried out in the design of an auv belegundu et al 2000 developed the collaborative optimization co method and free gradient based optimization for designing undersea exploratory vehicles yukish et al 2000 surveyed requirements for improving the conceptual design of an auv by various methods of mdo such as aao mdf and idf in mcallister et al 2002 based on idf architecture an auv was decomposed into a system module and five subsystems guidance and control payload power machinery and hydrodynamics propulsion and finally payload length for exploratory electronic equipment is maximized fitzgerald et al 2002 introduced the torpedo optimization analysis and design toad program as a parametric sizing and synthesis tool and response surface methodology was introduced as a means for the efficient modeling of different propulsion systems design and optimization of an undersea vehicle in three design modules path planning component selection and sizing and structural analysis are performed by benanzer et al 2008 multidisciplinary design optimization has been used for designing the guidance system of an auv based on idf architecture by zhang et al 2013 luo and lyu 2015 incorporated the collaborative optimization co as mdo framework and particle swarm optimization pso as optimizer to optimize hydrodynamic performances of underwater robots all of the presented methods have only focused on the optimization design of an auv and the engineering aspect of design was decoupled from the development of the tactics in which the auv was employed frits 2004 proposed a new paradigm of simultaneous tactics development and auv design and looked at the implications of various tactics on the optimal design of an auv finally it was shown that if the auv was optimized for any single tactical situation its performance would then be sub optimal for other tactical situations frits et al have done their research in a traditional framework and they had suggested the application of a mdo framework in future works frits s research in the design of auv and tactics is simultaneously a baseline in our research in this paper a new efficient framework as an innovation work is proposed in which auv is optimized from both engineering and tactic aspects for achieving this goal we have found an optimal system design by using mdo pso methodology in engineering space for any single tactical situation and have saved them as a local optimization database if off design performance of any auv in the local optimization database is evaluated for the entire tactical space the performance of the auv is changed and the off design performance is sub optimal with respect to locally optimized performance because the performance of any auv in the local optimization database is not optimized for the entire tactical space by minimizing the difference between the locally optimized objective function and sub optimal objective function we could archive appropriate criterion in tactical space and finally we found the optimal design of auv for each tactical space 2 literature review and background 2 1 multidisciplinary design optimization mdo multidisciplinary design optimization is a methodology that focuses on optimization methods to perform the design of systems that involve a number of subsystems or disciplines and their interactions the design process of complex engineering systems requires mathematical formulations that contain these interactions by solving the mdo problem designers can simultaneously improve the design and reduce the time and cost of the design cycle the mdo methods in various frameworks and architectures have been dedicated to making new formulations of the optimization problem aimed at reducing the complexity of the problem and allowing the more efficient use of traditional optimization methods the mdo methods have developed both on addressing how the different disciplines are coupled and how the overall optimization problem is solved selection of a suitable type of mdo architecture and suitable optimization method depends on the complexity of the system the required disciplines the computation effort the optimal design convergence and improvement in feasibility the mdo architectures have been divided to monolithic single level and distributed multi level methods martins and lambe 2013 in a monolithic approach a single optimization problem is solved common monolithic methods included all at once aao individual discipline feasible idf and multidisciplinary feasible mdf agte et al 2010 martins and lambe 2013 in a distributed approach the same problem is partitioned into multiple subproblems containing small subsets of the variables and constraints the distributed approach included collaborative optimization co bi level integrated system synthesis bliss and concurrent subspace optimization csso in this research because of special structure of design design optimization in tactical space we need to satisfy the feasibility of design in any situation even though optimization process is stopped in other words we are not as concerned with finding an optimal design in the strict mathematical sense as with finding an improved design in the engineering sense among all of mdo architectures mdf method is the best choice as mdo architecture for this context we choose mdf architecture because of its advantage over than the other monolithic architecture that it is always feasible design in other words mdf returns a system design that always satisfies the design constraints in each iteration even if the optimization process is terminated early hence the other monolithic mdo methods do not achieve feasible design until the optimization process is complete the difference between two approaches is shown in fig 1 this is advantageous in an engineering design context if time is limited and our concern is to find an improved design that needs not be optimal in the strict mathematical sense in mdf architecture the optimization problem has been as small as possible since only the design variables objective function and design constraints are under the direct control of the optimizer in this architecture a set of coupling variables must be calculated before each optimization iteration and when they return to the optimization level for evaluating the objective function and constraint this method usually has a slow convergence rate the slow convergence rate can be improved by an appropriate replacement of disciplines for reducing the feedback loop return the output variables of one discipline to the other discipline in the top level gradient calculations are also much more difficult for mdf than for idf and aao but if gradient free optimization is used as the optimizer then this approach can simultaneously improve feasibility and optimality 2 1 1 formulation of multidisciplinary feasible mdf an optimization problem in the mdf architecture can be shown as the following equation min f x 0 x i y i x 0 x i y j i with respect to x x 0 x i 1 subject to g i x 0 x i y i x 0 x i y j i i 1 n in eq 1 x 0 is the vector of shared design variables x i are the local design variables y i are the discipline output variables and f and g i are the objective function and the design constraints respectively the optimizer only controls the vector of design variables shared and local x x 0 x i i 1 n and disciplines analyses for achieving output variables are done before each optimization iteration the discipline analyses that describe governing equations of disciplines d i i 1 n can be given by the following equation 2 y i d i y j j i x 0 x i for having a feasible design multidisciplinary analysis mda block must be used in each iteration this block is placed between disciplines and the optimizer and satisfies the feasibility of all disciplines in the mda loop each disciplinary analysis is repeated until the mda loop is converged in this condition if the optimization process is terminated then the system design will be feasible for example the mdf algorithm for the three disciplines is shown in table 1 in this research the convergence condition of the mda loop is considered as the following context the mda loop has been converged when the sum of relative difference of the n output variables in the two consecutive steps has been less than a constant value such as δ that is shown in the following equation 3 1 n i 1 n y i k y i k 1 y i k 1 1 n i 1 n y i k y i k 1 1 δ the structure of the mdf framework for three disciplines is shown in fig 2 2 2 optimizer in the complex mdo framework the important challenges are finding a global optimization design non differentiable objective functions and constraints disconnected feasible space large dimensionality and multi objective problems usually these challenges really are difficult to solve by using gradient based methods and most of gradient based optimizers are not designed to handle these challenges instead of gradient based optimizers gradient free methods as global optimizers are designed to find multiple local optima and they are able to solve the mentioned challenges gradient based optimizers are not necessarily guaranteed to find the true global optimal solutions in other words they are able to find many good solutions the engineering sense vs the mathematical sense various gradient free methods have been developed we look at some of the most commonly used algorithms genetic algorithm ga is based on the principles of natural evolution of organisms simulated annealing sa is based on the simulation of thermal annealing of critically heated solids particle swarm optimization pso is based on the concept of swarm intelligence and the behavior of swarms such as a flock of insects or birds ant colony optimization aco is based on the cooperative behavior of ant colonies which are able to find the shortest path from their nest to a food source in recent years ga and pso are used in many global optimization literature more than the other heuristic algorithm in this research we require an optimizer to find the global optimum point without the gradient of objective function and it is insensitive to scale of the design variable this optimizer must have a simple algorithm and low parameter for adjusting the algorithm also we need to find good solutions in the engineering sense not in the strict mathematical sense requirements of an appropriate optimizer are summarized in table 2 pso and ga characteristics are also compared together in this table 2 in addition to the pso characteristics in table 2 the pso algorithm works with few particles usually 20 to 50 and there is not any generation unlike the ga algorithm in the pso algorithm there are no chromosomes survival of the fittest selection or crossover operations and design variables are directly updated 2 2 1 formulation of pso algorithm the pso algorithm first described by kennedy and eberhart 1995 is a technique that explores the search space of a given problem to find the variables that maximize a particular objective the pso algorithm is based on two separate concepts as indicated 1 the idea of swarm intelligence based on the observation of swarming habits by certain kinds of animals such as birds and fish 2 the field of evolutionary computation the pso algorithm is usually utilized for an unconstrained minimization problem as shown 4 m i n f x x l x x u where x l and x u are the upper and lower bound of design variable x respectively for solving the minimization problem in eq 4 by the pso algorithm n particles are considered and the velocity and position of the j th particle in the i th iteration are formulated by the following equation 5 v j i θ i v j i 1 c 1 r 1 p b e s t j x j i 1 c 2 r 2 g b e s t x j i 1 x j i x j i 1 χ v j i where c 1 and c 2 are two positive constants called acceleration coefficients cognitive and social coefficients respectively r 1 and r 2 are two independent random numbers uniformly distributed in the range of 0 1 p b e s t j is the best historical position of the j th particle and g best is the best historical position that the entire swarm has passed χ is named the constriction factor and it controls the magnitude of the velocities and θ i is called the inertia factor which is calculated in the i th iteration that follows as 6 θ i θ m a x θ m a x θ m i n i m a x i where θ max θ min are minimum and maximum values of inertia factor in the iteration interval and i max is the maximum iteration number the pso algorithm and updating of the swarm are summarized in table 3 in this research the pso optimization loop has been stopped when one of these conditions occurs 1 the number of iterations i m a x 2 the relative difference between the values of the objective function obtained at the end of any two consecutive iterations has been less than a constant value such as ε that is shown as 7 f x j i f x j i 1 f x j i 1 f x j i f x j i 1 1 ε the design optimization problems are rarely unconstrained and there are usually several design constraints that can be nonlinear in general these constraints often appeared as equality or inequality form and the optimization problem is the named constrained optimization problem that is formulated by the following equation 8 min f x x l x x u s t g k x 0 k 1 m h l x 0 l 1 p in eq 8 g k x and h l x are the k t h inequality and l t h equality constraint respectively and can be nonlinear in general one of the ways to solve constrained optimization problems is by augmenting a penalty function that depends on the constraints to the objective function the idea is to minimize a sequence of unconstrained minimization problems where the infeasibility violation of the constraints is minimized together with the objective function in this research the quadratic exterior penalty function described by rao 2009 is used that is formulated as 9 φ x r i r i f x r i k 1 m m a x g k x 0 2 r i l 1 p h l x 2 where φ x r i r i is the expanded objective function r i and r i that are named penalty coefficients are the function of iteration number i in the quadratic exterior penalty function the penalty coefficients must be increased with respect to iteration number r i 1 r i and r i 1 r i rao 2009 2 3 optimization in tactical space the innovation in this paper is the design of auv and its tactic simultaneously for achieving this goal we have found an optimal system design by using mdo pso methodology in engineering space for any tactical situation and have saved them as a local optimization database for the entire tactical space thus the optimal design vector and minimum objective function are functions of tactical parameters and auv are locally optimized with respect to each tactical situation x l o c o p t p a r g min x f x p f l o c o p t p min x f x p 10 s t g x p 0 h x p 0 where x is the system design vector of auv design variable discipline outputs and state variables and p is the tactical parameter vector now we want to design an auv that is optimized for the entire tactical space or a tactical sub space by defining a criterion in tactical space and minimizing it we could find an optimal auv for each tactical space or each tactical sub space if off design performance of any auv in the local optimization database is evaluated for the entire tactical space the performance of the auv is changed and the off design performance is sub optimal with respect to the locally optimized performance because the performance of any auv in the local optimization database is not optimized for the entire tactical space this context for one dimension tactical space is illustrated in fig 3 by defining the difference between the locally optimized objective function and sub optimal objective function f l o c o p t p f x l o c o p t p p we could archive appropriate criterion in tactical space if the summation of this difference h p in the entire tactical sub space p l p u is minimized the optimized tactical point p opt is achieved since a design vector and objective function are functions of the tactical point so the best optimal design vector x opt in the tactical sub space is also achieved formulation of this context is shown in the following equation h p p l p u g f l o c o p t p f x l o c o p t p p d p p o p t a r g m i n p h p 11 x o p t x l o c o p t p o p t the entire process for designing an auv with its tactic is simultaneously shown in fig 4 3 discipline modeling in this research we consider an auv with five subsystems and disciplines sonar hydrodynamics power propulsion sizing and tactic each subsystem contains a set of complex relationships as design rules but in the conceptual design phase the design rules are considered in simple formulas that are described in the next subsections 3 1 sonar in this discipline the passive sonar is considered as the seeker of the vehicle for detecting a target for having beemforming and a more directional sonar usually an array of acoustic sensors has been used in the passive sonar this array is considered as a planer circular array with diameter d s that was placed in the nose of auv the first design variable in sonar conceptual design is beam width b w that shows the searched area of the sonar the design process begins by determining the size of sonar array length l xa height l ya and diameter d s by means of sonar wavelength λ sonar vertical beam width b w v and sonar horizontal beam width b w h as given in the following equation bobber 1974 urick 1983 l x a 25 3 λ b w h 2 l y a 25 3 λ b w v 2 12 d s 2 m a x l x a l y a according to sonar frequency f r and sound speed in sea water c the sonar wavelength λ is given by 13 λ c f r in this research we consider f r 30 k h z and c 1480 m s the second design variable in sonar conceptual design is the sonar directivity index d i that shows goodness of the sonar or its ability to distinguish a target from background noise d i can be approximated by sonar array size l x a l y a and sonar wavelength λ as shown 14 d i 10 l o g 4 l x a l y a λ 2 now by having target source level sl noise level nl detection threshold dt and di all parameters in db the passive sonar equation must be solved according to passive sonar equation di db directly relates to sonar detection range dr meter as indicated in the following equation that is named the passive sonar equation urick 1983 waite 2002 15 20 log d r a d r 10 3 s l n l d i d t in eq 15 a is named the absorption coefficient of sea water that is determined as 16 a 0 109 fr 2 1 fr 2 43 76 fr 2 4100 fr 2 2 9705 e 4 fr 2 0 0033 the bw defines the width of the sonar beam the width of the sonar beam is used to define the effective search area of the sonar frits 2004 di and bw are inversely related a sharp highly directional pattern has small bw and high di and dr the essential parameter of the sonar has been mentioned in fig 5 3 2 hydrodynamic in this discipline the relationships for calculation of the drag and lift forces and longitudinal trim equations have been outlined the body form and fins of auv and the free diagram of forces on the body are present in fig 6 techniques for estimating the hydrodynamic coefficients of an auv can be done by means of tools originally developed for predicting the aerodynamic coefficients of aircraft and missiles and subsequently adopted for submarines the estimation of hydrodynamic coefficients of an auv by means of semi empirical methods has been previously implemented in many literature for example de barros et al 2008a b have implemented the datcom methods to estimate the hydrodynamic derivatives of an auv in the preliminary design phase and finally for validation the results of datcom method had been compared with the results obtained by using cfd and experimental 3 2 1 drag coefficient drag force is usually considered to consist of two components friction drag that is a function of speed and wetted area and pressure drag which is a function of shape and frontal area paster 1986 friction drag is caused by shearing stress of the boundary layer which arises from the resistance of the viscous fluid to motion of the body passing through it the amount of viscous resistance depends on the reynolds number and pressure disturbance the flow is laminar or turbulent for a closed body immersed in an inviscid fluid pressure drag is zero but for a viscous fluid there is a finite drag that is resulted from an incomplete pressure recovery at the end of the body it is caused by the displacement of boundary layer this drag is a very small amount for a body with high fineness ratio f l t d paster 1986 the reynolds number based on vehicle velocity v total vehicle length l t and sea water kinematic viscosity ν 1 56 e 6 is calculated in the following equation 17 r e v l t ν according the velocity and total length in this research the boundary layer has the turbulent condition over the entire surface so the skin friction coefficient is determined by 18 c f 0 075 log re 2 2 according to the datcom formula on the latter approach the drag coefficient of the body zero lift drag is based on fineness ratio of the body l t d de barros et al 2008b hoak and finck 1978 the drag coefficient of the body is given by following equations 19 c f b c f 1 60 d l t 3 0 0025 l t d 4 s w b π d 2 where d is the maximum diameter of vehicle and s wb is the body wetted area the term 0 0025 l t d mentioned the pressure drag the based drag coefficient is determined by the following equation 20 c d b 0 029 c f b d b d 3 where d b is the based diameter afterbody diameter the following equation indicates the drag coefficient of fins that is placed in the end of the vehicle 21 c d 0 f c f 1 l c t c 100 t c 4 r l s s w f l t 2 where t c is the fin thickness ratio s wf is the fin wetted area l c is the hydrofoil thickness location coefficient and r ls is the fin body interference correlation factor finally the total zero lift drag of the body and fin is given as 22 c d 0 c d 0 f c f b πd 2 4 l t 2 r fb cd b πd 2 4 l t 2 where r fb is named the fin body interference correlation factor 3 2 2 lift coefficient for a vehicle such as auv that is composed of forebody cylinder and afterbody usually the vortex and separation produced by viscous effects at the tail region are neglected if the pressure distribution at the tail is neglected then the slender body method can be used for an auv as is routinely used in the case of missiles with a blunt base de barros et al 2008b according to this approach the lift curve slope for body and fins alone and foil body combination is given by the following equations hoerner 1985 hoak and finck 1978 23 c l α b

fig 5 are calculated by the following equation 27 d f 1 2 ρ v 2 l t 2 c d l f 1 2 ρ v 2 l t 2 c l w f m t g b f ρ v o l t g where ρ 1025 kg m 3 is the sea water density and g 9 81 m s 2 is the gravitational acceleration the m t and vol t are the total mass and total volume of vehicle respectively finally the longitudinal trim equations are derived as shown 28 t f d f cos α l f sin α 0 l f cos α b f w f t f d f sin α 0 where t f is the thrust force that is generated by the propulsion system in this research the pitch moment equation is outlined by a constraint on the distance between center of mass and center of volume center of buoyancy as function of angle of attack 3 3 structure sizing all sections of the auv with the length of each section have been shown in fig 7 the nose section is considered as the truncated nose with a diameter of sonar array and it is connected to the maximum diameter of the vehicle by a smooth curve the after body is considered as an incomplete cone that is begun from the maximum diameter of the vehicle and is ended at the base diameter the hull shape of auv can be shown as the radius of body at each axial position along the centerline r l 0 l l t the total length of auv can be determined by 29 l t l e l p l b l m l a usually the auv dives to the specified maximum operating depth depth max so the body of the vehicle is faced with water pressure the required shell thickness t sh is calculated for the cylindrical configurations by using 30 t s h n s f ρ g d e p t h m a x r m a x σ s h where r max is the maximum radius of auv σ sh is the maximum shell stress for aluminum shell σ sh 20 e 6 mpa and n s f is the safety factor n s f 2 the internal radius of auv at each axial position l along the centerline is shown as 31 r i l r l t s

m sh m e m p m b m m m a are the shell mass the electronic section mass the payload section mass the battery section mass the motor section mass and the afterbody section mass respectively and x sh x e x p x b x m x a x sh are the center of mass for each mentioned section 3 4 power propulsion in this discipline total power is considered to consist of two components 1 the producing power for the guidance and control section electronic and sonar that is named the hotel load 2 the producing power for the propulsive thrust power required to overcome the drag force in this research an electrical dc motor is considered as the propulsive system of auv with the motor efficiency η m the propulsive power of the vehicle is determined in the following equation by using thrust force t f speed of vehicle v propeller efficiency η p and shaft efficiency η sh 36 p o w m t f v η s h η p the length of the motor is then approximated by 37 l m o t o r p o w m c a n d m 2 10 3 where d m is the motor diameter n is the propeller rpm and c a is the motor power coefficient the required power of sonar is approximated by frits 2004 38 p o w s β b w 10 d i 20 where β is the sonar power coefficient the hotel load is calculated by the following equation 39 p o w h p o w e p o w s in eq 39 pow e is the electronic required power that is a constant parameter in hotel load calculations finally total required power pow is determined by 40 p o w p o w h p o w m η m in this research an electrical battery set is considered as the power source of auv with the constant energy density per length e l j m the stored energy in a set of batteries with length l b is calculated by the following equation 41 e l b e l 3 5 tactic in this discipline calculation of the performance of the vehicle in the operational environment in which auv is employed is done the tactical parameters of auv that describe vehicle scenario in the operational environment are defined by design variables such as range endurance target detection time and probability of target detection the range of auv is given in the following equation by using auv speed v stored battery energy e and total power pow 42 r a n g e e v p o w the endurance total time t t of auv mission is then determined by 43 e n d u r a n c e t t r a n g e v e p o w in the calculation of target detection probability the following conditions are assumed 1 the initial distance to target d 0 is estimated at the launch time t 0 the uncertainty in the estimated initial distance is considered as the circle region with radius r 0 as shown in fig 8 a 2 the target speed v tar is assumed constant but we assume that the direction of target is not determined therefore the uncertainty region circularly grows with respect to time at a rate of v tar 3 auv straightly moves to the target due to conditions 1 and 2 the position of the target always has uncertainty and the area of uncertainty is a circular region with the radius r 0 at the launch point and then it grows with respect to time with a rate of v tar as shown in fig 8 b the area of the target uncertainty region region within which the target is randomly located is calculated by the following equation with respect to time 44 a u n c e r t a i n t y π r 0 v t a r t d e t t 2 in eq 44 target detection time t det is determined by the initial distance to target d 0 sonar detection range dr target speed v tar and auv speed v as shown 45 t d e t d 0 d r v v t a r the search rate of the vehicle directly relates to d r b w and v sonar detection front the region that has been searched by the vehicle is equal to the area swept by the sonar detection front during time this area has been described in fig 8 c and has been given as 46 a s e a r c h d r b w v t π 180 finally the ratio of the area that is searched by the vehicle divided by the area of target uncertainty is defined as target detection probability that is defined as 47 p d e t a s e a r c h a u n c e r t a i n t y d r b w v t m a x 180 r 0 v t a r t d e t t m a x 2 where t max is the time that target detection probability has reached the maximum value that is shown as 48 t m a x m i n t t t d e t r 0 v t a r t d e t 4 implementation 4 1 optimization problem and constraints table 4 summarizes the design variables that are exhibited in discipline modeling 4 1 1 objective function in this research the performance index is optimized for tactical effectiveness of auv the most important parameters that are used to define the tactical effectiveness of an auv are the target detection probability p det and the target detection time t d e t as described in section 3 5 p det is a number between zero and one representing the probability of target detection by auv s seeker and maximum value of p det is desired by defining the normalized target detection time t det n o r m equation 46 t det n o r m is also a number between zero and the minimum value of t det n o r m is desired 49 t d e t n o r m t d e t t d e t m a x the objective function is considered based on the maximum target detection probability and the minimum target detection time thus we consider the weighted sum of two parameters as objective function and the optimization problem is also considered a minimization problem as shown below 50 obj fun f k 1 p det k 2 t det norm in this research the weighted coefficients are considered as k 1 k 2 1 4 1 2 constraint the normalized total mass m t m t max the ratio of detection time to total time t det t t and the lower and upper values of some variables such as the total length l t the angle of attack α the battery length l b the motor length l m the sonar nose diameter d s and the sonar beam width b w are considered as inequality constraints that are as follows g 1 m t m t m a x 1 0 g 2 t d e t t t 0 8 0 g 3 c o s t 0 75 0 g 4 l t 8 0 g 5 α 7 0 g 6 7 α 0 g 7 l b 5 0 g 8 1 l b 0 g 9 l m 1 0 g 10 0 3 l m 0 g 11 d s 0 85 d 0 g 12 0 15 d s 0 g 13 b w 120 0 51 g 14 10 b w 0 4 2 mdf pso algorithm by choosing mdf architecture the optimization problem only needed three independent design variables including auv speed v sonar horizontal beam width b w h and battery section length l b the other variables are considered as state and output variables in each discipline the governing equations of discipline analyses must be solved before optimization iteration the disciplines that were introduced in section 3 can be combined together in the mdf architecture and the pso optimizer as shown in fig 9 all of the constraints in section 4 1 2 are inequality constraints so the penalty function can be written as 52 φ x r i f x r i k 1 m m a x g k x 0 2 the penalty parameter r i is considered as the following equation 53 r i 1 ρ r i r 1 r 1 the increase in the penalty parameter for each iteration can range from modest r i 1 1 4 r i to ambitious r i 1 10 r i depending on the problem the mdf pso algorithm is adjusted with parameters that are summarized in table 5 5 results the results of the design process have been obtained through running of the mdf pso as the mdo algorithm for one point of tactical space d 0 5 km r 0 1 km v tar 4 knot since the design space is complex and multi modal multiple running of the mdf pso algorithm with random starting point were used for the optimizer to guarantee a global minimum not just a local minimum fig 10 shows the convergence history of target detection probability as auv performance and the three design variables where the optimizer is trying to maximize the value of p det the pso starts the optimization algorithm with random initial position of particles and fig 10 shows the convergence history for four runs each with a random starting point the results of each run with a random starting point converge to the same value that shows the pso mdf technique is a global optimization algorithm the optimization algorithm also runs for six initial distances d 0 and two initial uncertainty radius r 0 as twelve tactical situations and the various auvs are designed for each tactical situation the results of design optimization are summarized in table 6 table 7 according to the results of table 6 table 7 1 the tactical parameters such as initial distance of auv to target d 0 and the uncertainty in target detection r 0 have a significant impact on the performance of the auv the auv has the best p det value when launched at a short distance to the target and low radius of uncertainty in initial target position estimation this situation corresponds to the best firing position where the auv is dropped close to the target and the auv knows the exact location of the target 2 when the auv is launched close to the target d 0 2 k m with a small radius of uncertainty r 0 0 1 k m a significantly faster auv v 20 m s with a narrow beam sonar b w 70 d e g is preferred if the auv is launched close to the target with a big radius of uncertainty r 0 1 km then a wide beam sonar bw 120 deg is preferred for close range auv it is apparently better to approach the target area quickly and then a wide beam sonar system is required to search larger areas of uncertainty 3 for having the maximum target detection probability the long range auvs must have lower speed this is because it is more important to go slower and search for the target for a longer period of time than it is to approach the target and search the target area uncertainty quickly but less effectively 4 to have higher speed the length of the motor section must be increased and for having a wider range the length of the battery section must be increased 5 according to the results of tables 6 and 7 while the pso optimization algorithm is converged the maximum iteration is 35 so the second condition of the pso stop algorithm relative error of the objective function always occurs fig 11 illustrates the 3d graph of target detection probability based on initial distance d 0 and initial uncertainty radius r 0 the pso mdf algorithm optimizes the design variables for each tactical point d 0 r 0 thus the all optimized auvs based on these design variables are locally optimized for each tactical point thus all points of this space all optimized auvs are ideal points in practical application design engineering wants to design an auv that is employed in a tactical sub space not for the tactical point in the following we focus on optimization of the auv for taccal sub space we had already found an optimal system design by using mdf pso methodology for the entire tactical space 1 km d 0 20 km and 0 5 km r 0 4 km as shown in fig 11 the entire tactical space is broken down into the nine sub spaces as shown in fig 12 according to the framework of optimization in tactical space which is described in section 2 3 we want to design the auvs that are appropriate for any tactical sub space for example a long range auv with good knowledge low uncertainty in target estimation the limitations of these nine sub spaces are summarized in table 8 thus for each sub space that is shown in fig 12 according to the optimization in the tactical space framework an optimal auv is achieved when the difference between locally optimized objective function and sub optimal objective function is minimized the results of design for the nine sub spaces are summarized in table 9 finally we have shown that not only the tactical situation affected auv design parameters but an optimal auv for any tactical sub space could also be found thus by developing the tactics and the auv design simultaneously the best auv is an auv that meets the tactical environments better than others according to the result of table 9 1 if lower bound of uncertainty limitation is considered in design of an auv then design is optimal for entire limitation 2 to have an optimal auv in each sub space if uncertainty is increased from l u to h u then design process must be done in lower bound of initial distance d0 limitation in each sub space 6 conclusions in this paper an auv in both engineering and tactical aspects was simultaneously designed by the mdo framework disciplines of auv included sonar power propulsion structure sizing hydrodynamic and tactic the objective function was defined for the maximum detection probability and minimum detection time mdf architecture has been introduced for the system design of an auv by using mda that satisfies the design feasibility so solution of the design would have been always feasible the pso algorithm as a gradient free optimizer is used to find the global solution for such complex system with coupled disciplines the results of optimization illustrate that the mdf pso framework is a global optimization algorithm because the solution of design is converged to the same value by running this optimization algorithm several times optimal design of an auv for any point of tactical space shows that the tactical situation impresses system design variables thus the design vector and objective function are the functions of tactical situation parameters and thus in designing an auv the tactical aspect of an auv should not be separated from its engineering aspect we want to design an auv that is appropriate for a tactical subspace not for the tactical point for achieving this goal we have found the optimal solution of design by using mdf pso methodology in engineering space for every situation of tactical space and the optimization database through the tactic space has been obtained next we minimize the difference between the locally optimized objective function and sub optimal objective function the results of optimization in the tactical space indicate that despite optimizing auv for the single tactical situation its objective functions would be sub optimal for other tactical situations but by minimizing the difference between the locally optimized objective function and sub optimal objective function we could find an optimal auv for each tactical sub spaces although in the proposed framework conceptual design of an auv has been considered and modeling of disciplines was done by using low fidelity models but in future work preliminary design of an auv will investigate and modeling of disciplines will be improved the other future enhancements include effect of geometry arrangement on auv maneuvering an enhancement on the hydrodynamic coefficient and an improved mdo methodology under uncertainty and multidisciplinary robust design context for an auv 
23744,optimal design of an autonomous underwater vehicle auv consists of various subsystems and disciplines such as guidance and control payload hydrodynamics power and propulsion sizing structure trajectory and performance the designed vehicle is also employed in an operational environment with tactical parameters such as distance to target uncertainty in estimation of target position and target velocity multidisciplinary design optimization mdo is the best way for finding both optimum and feasible designs in this paper a new optimization design framework is proposed in which multidisciplinary feasible mdf as mdo framework and particle swarm optimization pso as optimizer were combined together for optimal and feasible conceptual design of an auv initially we found an optimal system design by using mdf pso methodology in engineering space for any single tactical situation locally tactical parameters then the optimal off design auvs in tactical subspaces were found by minimizing the difference between the locally optimized objective function and sub optimal objective function in this framework we have shown that not only is the tactical situation affected by auv design parameters but an optimal auv for each tactical regions are also found keywords multidisciplinary design optimization autonomous underwater vehicle mdf pso tactical subspace 1 introduction in recent years the application of autonomous underwater vehicle in many research domains such as underwater exploration and undersea warfare has developed in the design of an auv many engineering design fields such as hydrodynamics propulsion guidance navigation and control gnc and structure have been involved finally designed auv has been launched from a platform and it has been employed in operational environment the simultaneous application of these engineering fields increases the complexity of auv s design and tactic today the traditional design of a complex system that is employed in a bigger system has been outmoded and engineers are researching for new paradigms to solve design problems thus the design process of these systems is changed when new paradigms and techniques are created there are many important parameters for designing an auv such as velocity range payload propulsion system parameter guidance and control parameters hydrodynamic sonar target detection parameter tactical parameters that increase the complexity of the design process and coupling between subsystems or disciplines belegundu et al 2000 yukish et al 2000 frits 2004 mcallister et al 2002 fitzgerald et al 2002 benanzer et al 2008 zhang et al 2013 complexity and hard coupling between these disciplines increase the computational burden and processing time of the design optimization process there are many techniques for designing an auv such as stochastic methods multiobjective methods and reliability based methods in recent years engineers have tended towards using multidisciplinary design optimization mdo methods for designing the complex system designers can simultaneously improve the design and reduce the time and cost of the design cycle by solving the mdo problem the mdo framework and architectures are developed for using numerical optimization to perform the design of systems that involve a number of subsystems or disciplines the type of mdo architecture and optimization method has affected optimization process time and optimal design convergence martins and lambe 2013 in the current auv development the engineering aspect of the design is decoupled from the development of the tactics in which the auv is employed tactics are developed by intelligence experts while auv design is handled by engineers if the design of auv is simultaneously performed with the design of tactics then a more effective auv can be created application of multidisciplinary design optimization methods has been carried out in the design of an auv belegundu et al 2000 developed the collaborative optimization co method and free gradient based optimization for designing undersea exploratory vehicles yukish et al 2000 surveyed requirements for improving the conceptual design of an auv by various methods of mdo such as aao mdf and idf in mcallister et al 2002 based on idf architecture an auv was decomposed into a system module and five subsystems guidance and control payload power machinery and hydrodynamics propulsion and finally payload length for exploratory electronic equipment is maximized fitzgerald et al 2002 introduced the torpedo optimization analysis and design toad program as a parametric sizing and synthesis tool and response surface methodology was introduced as a means for the efficient modeling of different propulsion systems design and optimization of an undersea vehicle in three design modules path planning component selection and sizing and structural analysis are performed by benanzer et al 2008 multidisciplinary design optimization has been used for designing the guidance system of an auv based on idf architecture by zhang et al 2013 luo and lyu 2015 incorporated the collaborative optimization co as mdo framework and particle swarm optimization pso as optimizer to optimize hydrodynamic performances of underwater robots all of the presented methods have only focused on the optimization design of an auv and the engineering aspect of design was decoupled from the development of the tactics in which the auv was employed frits 2004 proposed a new paradigm of simultaneous tactics development and auv design and looked at the implications of various tactics on the optimal design of an auv finally it was shown that if the auv was optimized for any single tactical situation its performance would then be sub optimal for other tactical situations frits et al have done their research in a traditional framework and they had suggested the application of a mdo framework in future works frits s research in the design of auv and tactics is simultaneously a baseline in our research in this paper a new efficient framework as an innovation work is proposed in which auv is optimized from both engineering and tactic aspects for achieving this goal we have found an optimal system design by using mdo pso methodology in engineering space for any single tactical situation and have saved them as a local optimization database if off design performance of any auv in the local optimization database is evaluated for the entire tactical space the performance of the auv is changed and the off design performance is sub optimal with respect to locally optimized performance because the performance of any auv in the local optimization database is not optimized for the entire tactical space by minimizing the difference between the locally optimized objective function and sub optimal objective function we could archive appropriate criterion in tactical space and finally we found the optimal design of auv for each tactical space 2 literature review and background 2 1 multidisciplinary design optimization mdo multidisciplinary design optimization is a methodology that focuses on optimization methods to perform the design of systems that involve a number of subsystems or disciplines and their interactions the design process of complex engineering systems requires mathematical formulations that contain these interactions by solving the mdo problem designers can simultaneously improve the design and reduce the time and cost of the design cycle the mdo methods in various frameworks and architectures have been dedicated to making new formulations of the optimization problem aimed at reducing the complexity of the problem and allowing the more efficient use of traditional optimization methods the mdo methods have developed both on addressing how the different disciplines are coupled and how the overall optimization problem is solved selection of a suitable type of mdo architecture and suitable optimization method depends on the complexity of the system the required disciplines the computation effort the optimal design convergence and improvement in feasibility the mdo architectures have been divided to monolithic single level and distributed multi level methods martins and lambe 2013 in a monolithic approach a single optimization problem is solved common monolithic methods included all at once aao individual discipline feasible idf and multidisciplinary feasible mdf agte et al 2010 martins and lambe 2013 in a distributed approach the same problem is partitioned into multiple subproblems containing small subsets of the variables and constraints the distributed approach included collaborative optimization co bi level integrated system synthesis bliss and concurrent subspace optimization csso in this research because of special structure of design design optimization in tactical space we need to satisfy the feasibility of design in any situation even though optimization process is stopped in other words we are not as concerned with finding an optimal design in the strict mathematical sense as with finding an improved design in the engineering sense among all of mdo architectures mdf method is the best choice as mdo architecture for this context we choose mdf architecture because of its advantage over than the other monolithic architecture that it is always feasible design in other words mdf returns a system design that always satisfies the design constraints in each iteration even if the optimization process is terminated early hence the other monolithic mdo methods do not achieve feasible design until the optimization process is complete the difference between two approaches is shown in fig 1 this is advantageous in an engineering design context if time is limited and our concern is to find an improved design that needs not be optimal in the strict mathematical sense in mdf architecture the optimization problem has been as small as possible since only the design variables objective function and design constraints are under the direct control of the optimizer in this architecture a set of coupling variables must be calculated before each optimization iteration and when they return to the optimization level for evaluating the objective function and constraint this method usually has a slow convergence rate the slow convergence rate can be improved by an appropriate replacement of disciplines for reducing the feedback loop return the output variables of one discipline to the other discipline in the top level gradient calculations are also much more difficult for mdf than for idf and aao but if gradient free optimization is used as the optimizer then this approach can simultaneously improve feasibility and optimality 2 1 1 formulation of multidisciplinary feasible mdf an optimization problem in the mdf architecture can be shown as the following equation min f x 0 x i y i x 0 x i y j i with respect to x x 0 x i 1 subject to g i x 0 x i y i x 0 x i y j i i 1 n in eq 1 x 0 is the vector of shared design variables x i are the local design variables y i are the discipline output variables and f and g i are the objective function and the design constraints respectively the optimizer only controls the vector of design variables shared and local x x 0 x i i 1 n and disciplines analyses for achieving output variables are done before each optimization iteration the discipline analyses that describe governing equations of disciplines d i i 1 n can be given by the following equation 2 y i d i y j j i x 0 x i for having a feasible design multidisciplinary analysis mda block must be used in each iteration this block is placed between disciplines and the optimizer and satisfies the feasibility of all disciplines in the mda loop each disciplinary analysis is repeated until the mda loop is converged in this condition if the optimization process is terminated then the system design will be feasible for example the mdf algorithm for the three disciplines is shown in table 1 in this research the convergence condition of the mda loop is considered as the following context the mda loop has been converged when the sum of relative difference of the n output variables in the two consecutive steps has been less than a constant value such as δ that is shown in the following equation 3 1 n i 1 n y i k y i k 1 y i k 1 1 n i 1 n y i k y i k 1 1 δ the structure of the mdf framework for three disciplines is shown in fig 2 2 2 optimizer in the complex mdo framework the important challenges are finding a global optimization design non differentiable objective functions and constraints disconnected feasible space large dimensionality and multi objective problems usually these challenges really are difficult to solve by using gradient based methods and most of gradient based optimizers are not designed to handle these challenges instead of gradient based optimizers gradient free methods as global optimizers are designed to find multiple local optima and they are able to solve the mentioned challenges gradient based optimizers are not necessarily guaranteed to find the true global optimal solutions in other words they are able to find many good solutions the engineering sense vs the mathematical sense various gradient free methods have been developed we look at some of the most commonly used algorithms genetic algorithm ga is based on the principles of natural evolution of organisms simulated annealing sa is based on the simulation of thermal annealing of critically heated solids particle swarm optimization pso is based on the concept of swarm intelligence and the behavior of swarms such as a flock of insects or birds ant colony optimization aco is based on the cooperative behavior of ant colonies which are able to find the shortest path from their nest to a food source in recent years ga and pso are used in many global optimization literature more than the other heuristic algorithm in this research we require an optimizer to find the global optimum point without the gradient of objective function and it is insensitive to scale of the design variable this optimizer must have a simple algorithm and low parameter for adjusting the algorithm also we need to find good solutions in the engineering sense not in the strict mathematical sense requirements of an appropriate optimizer are summarized in table 2 pso and ga characteristics are also compared together in this table 2 in addition to the pso characteristics in table 2 the pso algorithm works with few particles usually 20 to 50 and there is not any generation unlike the ga algorithm in the pso algorithm there are no chromosomes survival of the fittest selection or crossover operations and design variables are directly updated 2 2 1 formulation of pso algorithm the pso algorithm first described by kennedy and eberhart 1995 is a technique that explores the search space of a given problem to find the variables that maximize a particular objective the pso algorithm is based on two separate concepts as indicated 1 the idea of swarm intelligence based on the observation of swarming habits by certain kinds of animals such as birds and fish 2 the field of evolutionary computation the pso algorithm is usually utilized for an unconstrained minimization problem as shown 4 m i n f x x l x x u where x l and x u are the upper and lower bound of design variable x respectively for solving the minimization problem in eq 4 by the pso algorithm n particles are considered and the velocity and position of the j th particle in the i th iteration are formulated by the following equation 5 v j i θ i v j i 1 c 1 r 1 p b e s t j x j i 1 c 2 r 2 g b e s t x j i 1 x j i x j i 1 χ v j i where c 1 and c 2 are two positive constants called acceleration coefficients cognitive and social coefficients respectively r 1 and r 2 are two independent random numbers uniformly distributed in the range of 0 1 p b e s t j is the best historical position of the j th particle and g best is the best historical position that the entire swarm has passed χ is named the constriction factor and it controls the magnitude of the velocities and θ i is called the inertia factor which is calculated in the i th iteration that follows as 6 θ i θ m a x θ m a x θ m i n i m a x i where θ max θ min are minimum and maximum values of inertia factor in the iteration interval and i max is the maximum iteration number the pso algorithm and updating of the swarm are summarized in table 3 in this research the pso optimization loop has been stopped when one of these conditions occurs 1 the number of iterations i m a x 2 the relative difference between the values of the objective function obtained at the end of any two consecutive iterations has been less than a constant value such as ε that is shown as 7 f x j i f x j i 1 f x j i 1 f x j i f x j i 1 1 ε the design optimization problems are rarely unconstrained and there are usually several design constraints that can be nonlinear in general these constraints often appeared as equality or inequality form and the optimization problem is the named constrained optimization problem that is formulated by the following equation 8 min f x x l x x u s t g k x 0 k 1 m h l x 0 l 1 p in eq 8 g k x and h l x are the k t h inequality and l t h equality constraint respectively and can be nonlinear in general one of the ways to solve constrained optimization problems is by augmenting a penalty function that depends on the constraints to the objective function the idea is to minimize a sequence of unconstrained minimization problems where the infeasibility violation of the constraints is minimized together with the objective function in this research the quadratic exterior penalty function described by rao 2009 is used that is formulated as 9 φ x r i r i f x r i k 1 m m a x g k x 0 2 r i l 1 p h l x 2 where φ x r i r i is the expanded objective function r i and r i that are named penalty coefficients are the function of iteration number i in the quadratic exterior penalty function the penalty coefficients must be increased with respect to iteration number r i 1 r i and r i 1 r i rao 2009 2 3 optimization in tactical space the innovation in this paper is the design of auv and its tactic simultaneously for achieving this goal we have found an optimal system design by using mdo pso methodology in engineering space for any tactical situation and have saved them as a local optimization database for the entire tactical space thus the optimal design vector and minimum objective function are functions of tactical parameters and auv are locally optimized with respect to each tactical situation x l o c o p t p a r g min x f x p f l o c o p t p min x f x p 10 s t g x p 0 h x p 0 where x is the system design vector of auv design variable discipline outputs and state variables and p is the tactical parameter vector now we want to design an auv that is optimized for the entire tactical space or a tactical sub space by defining a criterion in tactical space and minimizing it we could find an optimal auv for each tactical space or each tactical sub space if off design performance of any auv in the local optimization database is evaluated for the entire tactical space the performance of the auv is changed and the off design performance is sub optimal with respect to the locally optimized performance because the performance of any auv in the local optimization database is not optimized for the entire tactical space this context for one dimension tactical space is illustrated in fig 3 by defining the difference between the locally optimized objective function and sub optimal objective function f l o c o p t p f x l o c o p t p p we could archive appropriate criterion in tactical space if the summation of this difference h p in the entire tactical sub space p l p u is minimized the optimized tactical point p opt is achieved since a design vector and objective function are functions of the tactical point so the best optimal design vector x opt in the tactical sub space is also achieved formulation of this context is shown in the following equation h p p l p u g f l o c o p t p f x l o c o p t p p d p p o p t a r g m i n p h p 11 x o p t x l o c o p t p o p t the entire process for designing an auv with its tactic is simultaneously shown in fig 4 3 discipline modeling in this research we consider an auv with five subsystems and disciplines sonar hydrodynamics power propulsion sizing and tactic each subsystem contains a set of complex relationships as design rules but in the conceptual design phase the design rules are considered in simple formulas that are described in the next subsections 3 1 sonar in this discipline the passive sonar is considered as the seeker of the vehicle for detecting a target for having beemforming and a more directional sonar usually an array of acoustic sensors has been used in the passive sonar this array is considered as a planer circular array with diameter d s that was placed in the nose of auv the first design variable in sonar conceptual design is beam width b w that shows the searched area of the sonar the design process begins by determining the size of sonar array length l xa height l ya and diameter d s by means of sonar wavelength λ sonar vertical beam width b w v and sonar horizontal beam width b w h as given in the following equation bobber 1974 urick 1983 l x a 25 3 λ b w h 2 l y a 25 3 λ b w v 2 12 d s 2 m a x l x a l y a according to sonar frequency f r and sound speed in sea water c the sonar wavelength λ is given by 13 λ c f r in this research we consider f r 30 k h z and c 1480 m s the second design variable in sonar conceptual design is the sonar directivity index d i that shows goodness of the sonar or its ability to distinguish a target from background noise d i can be approximated by sonar array size l x a l y a and sonar wavelength λ as shown 14 d i 10 l o g 4 l x a l y a λ 2 now by having target source level sl noise level nl detection threshold dt and di all parameters in db the passive sonar equation must be solved according to passive sonar equation di db directly relates to sonar detection range dr meter as indicated in the following equation that is named the passive sonar equation urick 1983 waite 2002 15 20 log d r a d r 10 3 s l n l d i d t in eq 15 a is named the absorption coefficient of sea water that is determined as 16 a 0 109 fr 2 1 fr 2 43 76 fr 2 4100 fr 2 2 9705 e 4 fr 2 0 0033 the bw defines the width of the sonar beam the width of the sonar beam is used to define the effective search area of the sonar frits 2004 di and bw are inversely related a sharp highly directional pattern has small bw and high di and dr the essential parameter of the sonar has been mentioned in fig 5 3 2 hydrodynamic in this discipline the relationships for calculation of the drag and lift forces and longitudinal trim equations have been outlined the body form and fins of auv and the free diagram of forces on the body are present in fig 6 techniques for estimating the hydrodynamic coefficients of an auv can be done by means of tools originally developed for predicting the aerodynamic coefficients of aircraft and missiles and subsequently adopted for submarines the estimation of hydrodynamic coefficients of an auv by means of semi empirical methods has been previously implemented in many literature for example de barros et al 2008a b have implemented the datcom methods to estimate the hydrodynamic derivatives of an auv in the preliminary design phase and finally for validation the results of datcom method had been compared with the results obtained by using cfd and experimental 3 2 1 drag coefficient drag force is usually considered to consist of two components friction drag that is a function of speed and wetted area and pressure drag which is a function of shape and frontal area paster 1986 friction drag is caused by shearing stress of the boundary layer which arises from the resistance of the viscous fluid to motion of the body passing through it the amount of viscous resistance depends on the reynolds number and pressure disturbance the flow is laminar or turbulent for a closed body immersed in an inviscid fluid pressure drag is zero but for a viscous fluid there is a finite drag that is resulted from an incomplete pressure recovery at the end of the body it is caused by the displacement of boundary layer this drag is a very small amount for a body with high fineness ratio f l t d paster 1986 the reynolds number based on vehicle velocity v total vehicle length l t and sea water kinematic viscosity ν 1 56 e 6 is calculated in the following equation 17 r e v l t ν according the velocity and total length in this research the boundary layer has the turbulent condition over the entire surface so the skin friction coefficient is determined by 18 c f 0 075 log re 2 2 according to the datcom formula on the latter approach the drag coefficient of the body zero lift drag is based on fineness ratio of the body l t d de barros et al 2008b hoak and finck 1978 the drag coefficient of the body is given by following equations 19 c f b c f 1 60 d l t 3 0 0025 l t d 4 s w b π d 2 where d is the maximum diameter of vehicle and s wb is the body wetted area the term 0 0025 l t d mentioned the pressure drag the based drag coefficient is determined by the following equation 20 c d b 0 029 c f b d b d 3 where d b is the based diameter afterbody diameter the following equation indicates the drag coefficient of fins that is placed in the end of the vehicle 21 c d 0 f c f 1 l c t c 100 t c 4 r l s s w f l t 2 where t c is the fin thickness ratio s wf is the fin wetted area l c is the hydrofoil thickness location coefficient and r ls is the fin body interference correlation factor finally the total zero lift drag of the body and fin is given as 22 c d 0 c d 0 f c f b πd 2 4 l t 2 r fb cd b πd 2 4 l t 2 where r fb is named the fin body interference correlation factor 3 2 2 lift coefficient for a vehicle such as auv that is composed of forebody cylinder and afterbody usually the vortex and separation produced by viscous effects at the tail region are neglected if the pressure distribution at the tail is neglected then the slender body method can be used for an auv as is routinely used in the case of missiles with a blunt base de barros et al 2008b according to this approach the lift curve slope for body and fins alone and foil body combination is given by the following equations hoerner 1985 hoak and finck 1978 23 c l α b 2 k 2 k 1 s 0 l t 2 24 c lα f s e l t 2 2 π κ ar 2 κ ar 2 cos 4 λ c 4 4 25 c lα c lα b k fb k bf c lα f in eq 23 k 2 k 1 is the apparent mass factor and s 0 is the cross section of the vehicle s 0 πd

the body and the ratio of body lift in the presence of the fin respectively 3 2 3 longitudinal trim equations according to the angel of attack α the drag and lift coefficient can be calculated as 26 c

fig 5 are calculated by the following equation 27 d f 1 2 ρ v 2 l t 2 c d l f 1 2 ρ v 2 l t 2 c l w f m t g b f ρ v o l t g where ρ 1025 kg m 3 is the sea water density and g 9 81 m s 2 is the gravitational acceleration the m t and vol t are the total mass and total volume of vehicle respectively finally the longitudinal trim equations are derived as shown 28 t f d f cos α l f sin α 0 l f cos α b f w f t f d f sin α 0 where t f is the thrust force that is generated by the propulsion system in this research the pitch moment equation is outlined by a constraint on the distance between center of mass and center of volume center of buoyancy as function of angle of attack 3 3 structure sizing all sections of the auv with the length of each section have been shown in fig 7 the nose section is considered as the truncated nose with a diameter of sonar array and it is connected to the maximum diameter of the vehicle by a smooth curve the after body is considered as an incomplete cone that is begun from the maximum diameter of the vehicle and is ended at the base diameter the hull shape of auv can be shown as the radius of body at each axial position along the centerline r l 0 l l t the total length of auv can be determined by 29 l t l e l p l b l m l a usually the auv dives to the specified maximum operating depth depth max so the body of the vehicle is faced with water pressure the required shell thickness t sh is calculated for the cylindrical configurations by using 30 t s h n s f ρ g d e p t h m a x r m a x σ s h where r max is the maximum radius of auv σ sh is the maximum shell stress for aluminum shell σ sh 20 e 6 mpa and n s f is the safety factor n s f 2 the internal radius of auv at each axial position l along the centerline is shown as 31 r i l r l t s

e x p x b x m x a x sh are the center of mass for each mentioned section 3 4 power propulsion in this discipline total power is considered to consist of two components 1 the producing power for the guidance and control section electronic and sonar that is named the hotel load 2 the producing power for the propulsive thrust power required to overcome the drag force in this research an electrical dc motor is considered as the propulsive system of auv with the motor efficiency η m the propulsive power of the vehicle is determined in the following equation by using thrust force t f speed of vehicle v propeller efficiency η p and shaft efficiency η sh 36 p o w m t f v η s h η p the length of the motor is then approximated by 37 l m o t o r p o w m c a n d m 2 10 3 where d m is the motor

the stored energy in a set of batteries with length l b is calculated by the following equation 41 e l b e l 3 5 tactic in this discipline calculation of the performance of the vehicle in the operational environment in which auv is employed is done the tactical parameters of auv that describe vehicle scenario in the operational environment are defined by design variables such as range endurance target detection time and probability of target detection the range of auv is given in the following equation by using auv speed v stored battery energy e and total power pow 42 r a n g e e v p o w the endurance total time t t of auv mission is then determined by 43 e n d u r a n c e t t r a n g e v e p o w in the calculation of target detection probability the following conditions are assumed 1 the initial distance to target d 0 is estimated at the launch time t 0 the uncertainty in the estimated initial distance is considered as the circle region with radius r 0 as shown in fig 8 a 2 the target speed v tar is assumed constant but we assume that the direction of target is not determined therefore the uncertainty region circularly grows with respect to time at a rate of v tar 3 auv straightly moves to the target due to conditions 1 and 2 the position of the target always has uncertainty and the area of uncertainty is a circular region with the radius r 0 at the launch point and then it grows with respect to time with a rate of v tar as shown in fig 8 b the area of the target uncertainty region region within which the target is randomly located is calculated by the following equation with respect to time 44 a u n c e r t a i n t y π r 0 v t a r t d e t t 2 in eq 44 target detection time t det is determined by the initial distance to target d 0 sonar detection range dr target speed v tar and auv speed v as shown 45 t d e t d 0 d r v v t a r the search rate of the vehicle directly relates to d r b w and v sonar detection front the region that has been searched by the vehicle is equal to the area swept by the sonar detection front during time this area has been described in fig 8 c and has been given as 46 a s e a r c h d r b w v t π 180 finally the ratio of the area that is searched by the vehicle divided by the area of target uncertainty is defined as target detection probability that is defined as 47 p d e t a s e a r c h a u n c e r t a i n t

performance index is optimized for tactical effectiveness of auv the most important parameters that are used to define the tactical effectiveness of an auv are the target detection probability p det and the target detection time t d e t as described in section 3 5 p det is a number between zero and one representing the probability of target detection by auv s seeker and maximum value of p det is desired by defining the normalized target detection time t det n o r m equation 46 t det n o r m is also a number between zero and the minimum value of t det n o r m is desired 49 t d e t n o r m t d

mdf pso algorithm by choosing mdf architecture the optimization problem only needed three independent design variables including auv speed v sonar horizontal beam width b w h and battery section length l b the other variables are considered as state and output variables in each discipline the governing equations of discipline analyses must be solved before optimization iteration the disciplines that were introduced in section 3 can be combined together in the mdf architecture and the pso optimizer as shown in fig 9 all of the constraints in section 4 1 2 are inequality constraints so the penalty function can be written as 52 φ x r i f x r i k 1 m m a x g k x 0 2 the penalty parameter r i is considered as the following equation 53 r i 1 ρ r i r 1 r 1 the increase in the penalty parameter for each iteration can range from modest r i 1 1 4 r i to ambitious r i 1 10 r i depending on the problem the mdf pso algorithm is adjusted with parameters that are summarized in table 5 5 results the results of the design process have been obtained through running of the mdf pso as the mdo algorithm for one point of tactical space d 0 5 km r 0 1 km v tar 4 knot since the design space is complex and multi modal multiple running of the mdf pso algorithm with random starting point were used for the optimizer to guarantee a global minimum not just a local minimum fig 10 shows the convergence history of target detection probability as auv performance and the three design variables where the optimizer is trying to maximize the value of p det the pso starts the optimization algorithm with random initial position of particles and fig 10 shows the convergence history for four runs each with a random starting point the results of each run with a random starting point converge to the same value that shows the pso mdf technique is a global optimization algorithm the optimization algorithm also runs for six initial distances d 0 and two initial uncertainty radius r 0 as twelve tactical situations and the various auvs are designed for each tactical situation the results of design optimization are summarized in table 6 table 7 according to the results of table 6 table 7 1 the tactical parameters such as initial distance of auv to target d 0 and the uncertainty in target detection r 0 have a significant impact on the performance of the auv the auv has the best p det value when launched at a short distance to the target and low radius of uncertainty in initial target position estimation this situation corresponds to the best firing position where the auv is dropped close to the target and the auv knows the exact location of the target 2 when the auv is launched close to the target d 0 2 k m with a small radius of uncertainty r 0 0 1 k m a significantly faster auv v 20 m s with a narrow beam sonar b w 70 d e g is preferred if the auv is launched close to the target with a big radius of uncertainty r 0 1 km then a wide beam sonar bw 120 deg is preferred for close range auv it is apparently better to approach the target area quickly and then a wide beam sonar system is required to search larger areas of uncertainty 3 for having the maximum target detection probability the long range auvs must have lower speed this is because it is more important to go slower and search for the target for a longer period of time than it is to approach the target and search the target area uncertainty quickly but less effectively 4 to have higher speed the length of the motor section must be increased and for having a wider range the length of the battery section must be increased 5 according to the results of tables 6 and 7 while the pso optimization algorithm is converged the maximum iteration is 35 so the second condition of the pso stop algorithm relative error of the objective function always occurs fig 11 illustrates the 3d graph of target detection probability based on initial distance d 0 and initial uncertainty radius r 0 the pso mdf algorithm optimizes the design variables for each tactical point d 0 r 0 thus the all optimized auvs based on these design variables are locally optimized for each tactical point thus all points of this space all optimized auvs are ideal points in practical application design engineering wants to design an auv that is employed in a tactical sub space not for the tactical point in the following we focus on optimization of the auv for taccal sub space we had already found an optimal system design by using mdf pso methodology for the entire tactical space 1 km d 0 20 km and 0 5 km r 0 4 km as shown in fig 11 the entire tactical space is broken down into the nine sub spaces as shown in fig 12 according to the framework of optimization in tactical space which is described in section 2 3 we want to design the auvs that are appropriate for any tactical sub space for example a long range auv with good knowledge low uncertainty in target estimation the limitations of these nine sub spaces are summarized in table 8 thus for each sub space that is shown in fig 12 according to the optimization in the tactical space framework an optimal auv is achieved when the difference between locally optimized objective function and sub optimal objective function is minimized the results of design for the nine sub spaces are summarized in table 9 finally we have shown that not only the tactical situation affected auv design parameters but an optimal auv for any tactical sub space could also be found thus by developing the tactics and the auv design simultaneously the best auv is an auv that meets the tactical environments better than others according to the result of table 9 1 if lower bound of uncertainty limitation is considered in design of an auv then design is optimal for entire limitation 2 to have an optimal auv in each sub space if uncertainty is increased from l u to h u then design process must be done in lower bound of initial distance d0 limitation in each sub space 6 conclusions in this paper an auv in both engineering and tactical aspects was simultaneously designed by the mdo framework disciplines of auv included sonar power propulsion structure sizing hydrodynamic and tactic the objective function was defined for the maximum detection probability and minimum detection time mdf architecture has been introduced for the system design of an auv by using mda that satisfies the design feasibility so solution of the design would have been always feasible the pso algorithm as a gradient free optimizer is used to find the global solution for such complex system with coupled disciplines the results of optimization illustrate that the mdf pso framework is a global optimization algorithm because the solution of design is converged to the same value by running this optimization algorithm several times optimal design of an auv for any point of tactical space shows that the tactical situation impresses system design variables thus the design vector and objective function are the functions of tactical situation parameters and thus in designing an auv the tactical aspect of an auv should not be separated from its engineering aspect we want to design an auv that is appropriate for a tactical subspace not for the tactical point for achieving this goal we have found the optimal solution of design by using mdf pso methodology in engineering space for every situation of tactical space and the optimization database through the tactic space has been obtained next we minimize the difference between the locally optimized objective function and sub optimal objective function the results of optimization in the tactical space indicate that despite optimizing auv for the single tactical situation its objective functions would be sub optimal for other tactical situations but by minimizing the difference between the locally optimized objective function and sub optimal objective function we could find an optimal auv for each tactical sub spaces although in the proposed framework conceptual design of an auv has been considered and modeling of disciplines was done by using low fidelity models but in future work preliminary design of an auv will investigate and modeling of disciplines will be improved the other future enhancements include effect of geometry arrangement on auv maneuvering an enhancement on the hydrodynamic coefficient and an improved mdo methodology under uncertainty and multidisciplinary robust design context for an auv
