18090,in vitro diagnostic assays involve various substances that may be released into the environment via a sewage treatment plant if the effluent from diagnostic instruments is discharged into the drains because the release of liquid waste into the public sewer system is regulated at national and or local levels a risk assessment per site should be performed to determine whether the release of the effluent from in vitro diagnostic equipment is compliant with applicable regulations to facilitate the assessment we developed a screening tool to generate exposure scenarios for chemical substances used in in vitro diagnostic assays this screening tool helps in determining a whether release of the effluent into the sewer system would be allowed from a regulatory point of view and b whether such release would result in potential risks to surface water the screening tool is based on conditions encountered at typical usage sites in switzerland and germany with the option to adapt them to other local settings in addition measured analytical results of liquid waste together with typical operational parameters of diagnostic equipment were defined as default input parameters the resulting concentrations in liquid waste and predicted environmental concentrations pec are compared with regulatory limit values for release into the sewer system and predicted no effect concentrations pnec for surface water for risk estimation the functioning of the presented screening tool is demonstrated by two assessments performed for fictitious but typical hospitals in switzerland and germany it identified substances that cause potential concern for which a more advanced assessment is required graphical abstract image 1 keywords hospital laboratory liquid waste wastewater screening tool risk assessment 1 introduction in vitro diagnostic medical device ivd means any reagent calibrator control material kit or instrument intended by the manufacturer to be used outside the human body for the examination of specimens including blood and tissue for the purpose of among other things providing information concerning a physiological or pathological process or state or the predisposition to a medical condition or a disease or to define or monitor therapeutic measures regulation eu 2017 746 even if they only represent 2 3 of healthcare expenditures in the usa and 1 4 in germany rohr et al 2016 they are essential in human and veterinary medicine to enable the correct diagnosis and the appropriate medication or treatment to be prescribed in vitro diagnostic assays are generally performed in laboratories and involve a range of chemical substances that are used as reagents solvents surfactants or with other functions among the substances typically used in in vitro diagnostics some may have adverse effects on the health of the operating personnel or on the environment chemical substances used in reagents such as octyl and nonylphenolethoxylates sodium azide and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta were identified as environmentally relevant in a previous study by stark rogel et al 2016 for instance the degradation products of octyl and nonylphenolethoxylates have endocrine disrupting properties and were therefore listed as substances of very high concern https echa europa eu candidate list table and are now subject to authorisation according to the european regulation ec no 1907 2006 on registration evaluation authorisation and restriction of chemicals reach being used as reagents in in vitro diagnostic assays chemical substances may be released into the environment via a sewage treatment plant if the effluent from diagnostic instruments is released into the drains therefore an environmental risk assessment should be performed for the use of these substances as reagents in in vitro diagnostic assays so far this specific use has not been subject to risk assessment within regulatory frameworks such as the reach registration requirement due to the low tonnage of the chemicals used in ivd indeed the quantity of reagents used in an in vitro diagnostic assay is typically very low often resulting in an overall tonnage per chemical and legal entity below the threshold for a risk assessment of 10 tonnes per year set by the reach regulation despite relatively low tonnages a risk to human health and the environment from substances with critical properties used in in vitro diagnostic assays cannot generally be excluded and should be assessed the need to evaluate the environmental impact and effects on public health caused by healthcare waste is a globally recognized issue eckelmann and sherman 2016 http www who int mediacentre factsheets fs253 en some ivd suppliers already implement specific programs to assess the risks posed by chemical substances to human health and the environment to identify viable potential alternatives and substitute identified critical substances whenever possible and to provide guidance for safe use to their clients and to comply with sustainable procurement requirements and applicable regulations for in vitro diagnostic medical devices regulation eu 2017 746 in this context a detailed chemical analysis of liquid waste from ivd instruments was performed by stark rogel et al 2016 in a regulatory context the term liquid waste is sometimes used for material which is separately collected and treated e g incinerated however in the present publication the term is used for all liquids generated from the in vitro diagnostic instrumentation within the scope of our investigation in the study by stark rogel et al 2016 almost 50 environmentally relevant parameters were analysed in liquid waste from ivd instruments used in clinical chemistry analysis of body fluids or histological examination of tissue samples analysis these 50 parameters included those commonly addressed in water analysis such as ph total organic carbon toc metals and nitrogen compounds the other substances were chosen because of their use in ivd assays or because they are listed by the european chemical agency as substances of very high concern or are considered to be of concern for other reasons the analysed parameters were compared whenever possible with german and or eu reference or limit values and in most cases the measured values were below the thresholds in this previous study stark rogel et al 2016 a site specific risk assessment was not performed however this is most relevant since 1 the release of liquid waste into the public sewer system is regulated at a national or often even at a local level 2 a general concept is needed to support laboratories running ivd assays to ensure that generated waste is disposed of in a compliant manner and 3 to identify priorities for the further development of environmentally friendly ivd to the best of our knowledge site specific compliance of the release of the effluent from ivd equipment or any other professional laboratory equipment into the sewer system and the related risk to receiving waters have not been assessed so far to address this gap we developed a screening tool to generate site specific exposure scenarios for chemical substances present in liquid waste from in vitro diagnostic instruments the purpose of the screening tool presented here is also 1 to determine if liquid waste generated by ivd instruments may be released into the sewer system at a given site 2 to perform a risk assessment for receiving waters in order to identify potentially critical substances for which more advanced assessments would be required and 3 to identify the most significant contributors to the total hazard profile the model is illustrated by two assessments performed for fictitious but typical hospitals in switzerland and germany and can be adapted to apply to other countries 2 materials and methods 2 1 model implemented in the screening tool the present model allows a site specific screening risk assessment for substances used in in vitro diagnostics assays it permits us 1 to assess whether liquid waste generated by ivd at a given site may be released into the sewer system considering national legal requirements and 2 to enable a risk estimation for sewage treatment plants stp and receiving waters to identify substances of potential concern it is currently implemented for the national legal settings of switzerland and germany and allows the generation of reasonable worst case exposure scenarios for a given site via the use of predefined default values in case site specific data are not available see tables s1 to s3 in section 5 supporting information the first part of the assessment namely the evaluation of whether liquid waste may be released into the sewer system is a 4 step approach 1 details on applicable local regulations and local site 2 characterisation of the liquid waste 3 details on ivd uses and volumes of generated liquid waste 4 decision on compliance of release to wastewater for the second part of the assessment i e the risk estimation for the sewage treatment plant and the receiving surface waters two additional steps are required i e 5 further details on local site details on stp and receiving water 6 risk assessment for microorganisms in the sewage treatment plant and for aquatic organisms in the receiving waters an overview of the different steps in the assessment performed using the excel tool developed is provided in fig s1 of the supporting information each step is described in greater detail below 2 1 1 evaluation whether liquid waste may be released into the sewer system part 1 2 1 1 1 details on applicable local regulations and site step 1 in this step the general parameters for local legal requirements and the wastewater volume released from the site should be provided as a basis for the evaluation local legal requirements since the release of liquid waste into the public sewer system is regulated at a national or often even at a local level care should be taken to ensure that the assumption made for the assessment reflects the applicable regulations for the evaluated site for given countries such as switzerland compliance with limit values is required at the point of occurrence of the liquid waste as wastewater may not be mixed or diluted to achieve these values hereinafter referred to as a no dilution scenario see 3 1 1 1 in other countries such as germany the recommended limit values refer to the point of release into the public sewer system i e mixing with other wastewater from the same site is permitted to achieve these values hereinafter referred to as a dilution scenario different reference values apply depending on the country and the scenario see step 4 wastewater discharge rate from the site into the public sewer system m 3 d this parameter is required to calculate the observed concentration in the waste at the point of release into the public sewer system when the dilution scenario applies typical total wastewater volumes from hospitals based on the literature emmanuel et al 2005 escher et al 2011 were implemented as default parameters that may be used if site specific information is not available for further details see tables s1 to s3 in section 5 supporting information local permits with specific provisions in addition to the applicable local requirements it should be verified whether local permits with special provisions have been issued by the local authorities for specific waste releases if yes these should be considered for the assessment 2 1 1 2 characterisation of the liquid waste step 2 to evaluate whether liquid waste from ivd instruments can be introduced into the sewer system for a given site the liquid waste must first be characterised as a starting point the parameters i e set of substances to be measured shall first be defined and the corresponding concentrations have to be determined in the liquid waste there are two possible ways to determine substance concentrations in the liquid waste by calculation based on the assays run on the instruments and the starting concentrations of the reagents or by analytical determinations of substance concentrations in representative liquid waste samples for the first approach complete information on reagent concentrations needs to be available which is not always the case as the available information is often based on safety data sheets for raw materials in addition some reagents may react or decompose so that the identity and concentration in the liquid waste does not correspond to that in the reagent in any case real life measured data are preferred if available however their generation is time consuming and expensive since measured data from the local site for which the environmental risk assessment will be performed are often not available measured data in actual liquid waste samples from different in vitro diagnostic instruments of roche and different laboratories as reported in an extensive previous study from stark rogel et al 2016 were used as a basis for the input of the present screening tool the study from stark rogel et al 2016 provides a large set of parameters substances that were selected based either on their occurrence in in vitro diagnostic reagents or on general public concern e g substances of very high concern under reach and measured in various collected liquid waste samples due to the differences in the chemistry of the generated liquid waste in vitro diagnostic instruments were divided into two types for the purpose of the present assessment clinical chemistry which includes different water based in vitro diagnostic instruments and allows mainly the analysis of body fluids and histology which focuses on the examination of tissue samples while liquid waste generated from clinical chemistry instruments typically consists of an aqueous phase only histological liquid waste consists of both an aqueous and an organic phase the selected parameters and substance concentrations measured in the generated liquid waste from eight samples taken from the clinical chemistry instrument cobas http www cobas com and from five samples taken from histological benchmark ivd instruments https diagnostics roche com global en products systems benchmark ultra system html are reported in stark rogel et al 2016 see also tables s4 to s5 in section 5 supporting information please note that the reported values for the histological liquid waste see table s5 in section 5 supporting information refer to the analysed aqueous phases since the organic waste will usually not be discharged into the drains but rather collected and treated as hazardous waste in the present screening tool the highest measured concentrations for each substance in the aqueous phase of the liquid waste generated from clinical chemistry and histological ivd instruments reported in stark rogel et al 2016 were used for the assessment in order to establish a realistic worst case see table 1 additionally an option was included to account for the undesirable discharge of liquid waste with the organic phase into the drains in adjusting the hydrocarbon index based on information on the organic phase generated by a ventana he600 instrument concentration of c9 c16 alkanes of 130 g l and approx 15 v v of organic phase 2 1 1 3 details on ivd uses and volumes of generated liquid waste step 3 to evaluate whether the generated liquid waste may be introduced into the drains information on the operating parameters of in vitro diagnostic instruments and the daily liquid waste volumes generated for the investigated site are additionally needed to calculate the daily liquid waste volume generated by both clinical chemistry and histology in vitro diagnostics instruments at a given site the following input parameters are required the number of modules used and the quantity of liquid waste generated per module per hour l h and number of operating hours per day h day or the size of liquid waste container installed in a module l and the maximum number of containers that may be emptied per module per day in addition provisions detailing the sampling time allowed at the point of discharge into the sewer system are needed for the calculation of concentrations at the point of discharge for the dilution scenario this is needed if liquid waste is released into the sewer system from containers in order to calculate the concentration at the point of discharge into the public sewer system averaged over the appropriate timeframe i e the allowed sampling time moreover liquid waste has to be checked for ph and other regulatory requirements regulated waste the assessment of ph should be based on local measurements and is thus not included in an automatic comparison with limit values it must also be checked whether the liquid waste from one or both instrument types is already defined as regulated waste not permitted for release into the sewer system if this is the case the liquid waste will be excluded from the assessment the result from this verification is indicated in the tool in case information is not available for the investigated sites default values are implemented in the screening tool corresponding to worst case assumption for a large private laboratory in europe and typical volumes of liquid waste generated by clinical chemistry and histology in vitro diagnostic instruments see tables s1 to s3 in section 5 supporting information 2 1 1 4 decision on waste or wastewater step 4 at this step a preliminary decision is made whether the liquid waste from the instruments may be released into the sewer system or needs to be disposed of as waste to do so the relevant substance concentrations in liquid waste are determined based on requirements from local regulations dilution or no dilution scenario and compared with corresponding limit values the ratio of concentrations to limit values is then calculated and a ratio of 1 indicates that wastewater may be released into the sewer system if all local and permit requirements are fulfilled currently the tool contains the following two alternatives dilution scenario where the limit values need to be met at the point of release to the public sewer system implemented for germany combined waste from all instruments clinical chemistry and histology is considered mixing with other wastewater from the site is allowed the time over which a sample may be taken at the point of release is taken into account 2 h for germany based on the guidance documents of the german association for water wastewater and waste dwa the resulting substance concentrations are calculated at the point of release into the public sewer system and are currently compared with the recommended limit values of the dwa guidance no dilution scenario where limit values need to be met at the point of occurrence of the wastewater implemented for switzerland the waste from the two instrument groups clinical chemistry and histology is considered separately mixing with other wastewater from the site is not allowed by swiss regulations the resulting substance concentrations in the liquid waste are directly compared with the limit values for discharge into public sewers of the swiss waters protection ordinance wpo the limit values for release into public sewer systems applicable in germany and switzerland are summarised in table 2 if the calculated ratio of concentrations to limit values is 1 for all substances the wastewater may be released into the sewer system provided that all local and permit requirements are fulfilled and further risk assessment for the receiving waters should be performed to verify that the generated liquid waste does not contain substances which would pose a risk to the local receiving waters part 2 step 5 to 7 if the ratio to limit value is 1 for one or more substances further assessment may be required as the presented screening model follows a simplified worst case approach therefore with further refinements it is possible to verify whether limit values are in fact surpassed such as refinement of parameters e g laboratory specific adjustment of liquid waste volume if the default values were used substance specific assessment verification of whether a substance occurs in the assay runs at the investigated site or whether the available measured concentrations are applicable for the site e g due to different types of instruments etc in house measurements at the site could be performed to obtain more site specific data clarification with the authorities depending on the parameters release may be allowed under certain conditions if the ratio to limit value remains 1 for one or more substances even after further refinement the generated liquid waste cannot be introduced into the wastewater instead it needs to be collected and treated as waste according to the applicable local national regulations no further risk assessment for the receiving surface waters is required 2 1 2 risk estimation for sewage treatment plant and receiving surface waters part 2 2 1 2 1 further details on local site step 5 in this step additional parameters on the local site should be provided as a basis for the evaluation effluent discharge rate for local stp m3 d this parameter is required to calculate the observed concentration at the point of release into the stp if detailed information on the local stp for dry weather is available it should be provided in the screening tool the default value recommended by the reach regulation for a small town echa 2016 is implemented as a conservative approach see table s1 in section 5 supporting information river flow m3 s at point of release of stp low flow rate this parameter is required to calculate the observed concentration in the receiving waters at the point of release if detailed information on the local river flow into which the local stp releases its effluent is available typically the minimum flow rate on 347 days during 95 of the year q347 this should be provided in the screening tool the default value recommended by the reach regulation and leading to a dilution factor of 10 between stp and a river echa 2016 is implemented as a conservative approach see table s1 in section 5 supporting information 2 1 2 2 risk assessment for microorganisms in the sewage treatment plant and receiving waters step 6 to assess the potential risk to microorganisms in the sewage treatment plant or receiving waters by liquid waste generated by ivd instruments the emissions and related concentrations in the stp and receiving waters must be estimated and compared with available reference concentrations at which no effects on microorganisms or aquatic organisms are expected predicted environmental concentrations pec for the sewage treatment plant and receiving waters were calculated based on dilution considering the stp effluent flow river flow and the load of each substance based on liquid waste volume and concentrations in the described assessment removal processes such as degradation adsorption or volatilisation are not taken into account only dilution is considered as a worst case approach to assess whether there is a risk for the sewage treatment plant or receiving waters from specific substances in wastewater the predicted environmental concentrations need to be compared with the defined reference concentrations in the stp and surface waters at or below which no effects are expected predicted no effect concentrations pnecs in the screening tool the reference values for stps if available were compiled from the reach registration dossiers as published on the website of the european chemical agency echa see table 3 for receiving waters the reference values if available were compiled from the following sources see table 3 reach registration dossiers as published on the website of the european chemical agency echa environmental quality standards eqs based on european directive 2013 39 eu regarding priority substances in the field of water policy requirements for watercourses as defined in annex 2 12 additional requirements for watercourses of the swiss waters protection ordinance wpo sr 814 201 the values for total metals from the wpo are used where available as total metal concentrations were determined in the waste measurements if no values are available in the wpo pnec values for dissolved metals are used from reach registrations the values are given as of september 2018 new or updated data may become available especially in reach registration dossiers and will need to be included in future updates of the tool if pec pnec ratios are 1 for all investigated substances this indicates that the liquid waste does not pose any risk to the microorganisms in stp and the aquatic organisms in the receiving water if the pec pnec ratio is equal to or greater than 1 indicating a potential concern for the given substances refinements to verify whether reference values are actually surpassed are required this could be done for example by including more realistic site specific parameters e g for liquid waste volumes and operating times or actual river and stp flow rates if default values are used or chemical analysis of the specific waste from the site has to be performed if necessary a specific assessment using reach tools such as the european union system for the evaluation of substances euses 2 0 2003 can be used to take the removal processes in stp into account and verify whether a risk to an stp receiving water is confirmed 2 2 example of risk assessment in switzerland and germany to illustrate the functioning of the screening tool two example assessments were performed based on the approach presented above for a fictitious but typical hospital located either in switzerland or germany the same parameters for the site ivd uses and generated liquid waste were assumed for the evaluation in both countries to allow the comparison between the two different local legal requirements i e the dilution and no dilution scenario applicable in germany and switzerland respectively these typically correspond to a large hospital located in switzerland e g zürich or an average size hospital in germany e g bochum 2 2 1 details on the site the example site consists of a hospital with a daily capacity of 850 beds it was assumed to be connected to an stp for 400 000 inhabitants with a discharge rate of 250 000 m3 d during dry weather and a minimum flow rate in the receiving river of 40 m3 s q347 i e the flow that is reached for 95 of the year the dilution rate between the stp and river of 14 is therefore slightly higher than the reach default value of 10 2 2 2 characterisation of the liquid waste no site specific data on substances in the liquid waste or substance concentrations are available therefore the default concentrations of the liquid waste available in the screening tool for clinical chemistry and histology are used for assessment both in germany and switzerland in stark rogel et al 2016 the ph values for the clinical chemistry and histology liquid waste reported for given ivd modules is below or above the range recommended by the dwa ph 6 5 10 or allowed in switzerland ph 6 5 9 however as the ph in the hospital wastewater is typically neutralised before release into the sewer system the ph is assumed to be adjusted to these ranges the ph is therefore compliant with the requirements in the example assessments 2 2 3 details on ivd uses and volumes of generated liquid waste data was collected on the number of operating clinical chemistry and histology ivd modules as well as the corresponding generated waste from given large european laboratories hospitals based on this information the worst case usage i e the simultaneous operation of 7 clinical chemistry and 12 histology modules on the selected site was selected for the assessment a default average liquid waste volume of 15 l h per clinical chemistry module operated over 24 h day was assumed liquid waste generated by the histology modules was presumed to be collected in two 20l containers per module being released to the sewer system during 1 day before release the organic phase from the liquid waste normally approx 15 was assumed to be removed and disposed of as hazardous waste for the specific case of germany where dilution with further wastewater from the hospital may be taken into account dilution scenario the time allowed to obtain an average sample at the point of discharge to verify whether limit values are met was set to 2 h as recommended by the dwa the input parameters selected for the performed assessments are summarised in table s6 and s7 in section 5 supporting information 3 results and discussion the results of the two examples for screening assessments performed for a hypothetical hospital located either in switzerland or germany using the above described procedure are addressed in the following in the first step a high level screening assessment for both countries was performed to verify whether critical substances are identified with respect to allowing release to the sewer system or the risk for the stp or receiving surface waters see section 3 1 in a second step the assessment was refined for the critical substances identified in the first step see section 3 2 3 1 screening assessment to verify whether critical substances are identified with respect to allowing release to the sewer system or the risk for the stp or receiving surface waters 3 1 1 evaluation if critical substances are identified with respect to allowing release to wastewater part 1 3 1 1 1 switzerland no dilution scenario case 1 due to the location in switzerland dilution of the liquid waste generated by the clinical chemistry and histology modules with further wastewater from the hospital is not allowed therefore the no dilution scenario applies and the liquid waste from both clinical chemistry and histology modules needs to be separately investigated at the outlet of the module before comparison with the limit values set in the swiss water protection ordinance the results of the screening assessment of whether liquid waste from either the clinical chemistry or the histology modules may be released into the swiss sewer system is presented in table 4 as can be seen in table 4 the calculated ratio to limit values rlv are below 1 for most substances in the liquid waste from the clinical chemistry and histology instruments and for which a limit value in the swiss regulation is defined nonetheless the screening tool identified critical parameters showing an rlv greater than 1 in both the liquid waste from clinical chemistry and histology instruments i e clinical chemistry volatile halogenated hydrocarbons and easily released cyanides histology hydrocarbon index volatile halogenated hydrocarbons copper and easily released cyanides the results of the screening assessment show that the liquid waste generated by either the clinical chemistry or the histology modules would not be allowed to be released into the swiss sewer system and that further assessment is required to verify whether threshold values would indeed be surpassed in a realistic hospital 3 1 1 2 germany dilution scenario case 2 due to the location in germany dilution of the liquid waste generated by the clinical chemistry and histology modules with further wastewater from the hospital may be taken into account therefore the dilution scenario applies and the liquid waste from both clinical chemistry and histology modules may be combined further with hospital wastewater before comparison with the limit value recommended by dwa at the point of discharge to the sewer system the results of the calculations and evaluation for the combined liquid waste from the clinical chemistry and histology modules diluted with further wastewater from the hospital that may be released into the sewer system is presented in table 5 as for switzerland the rlvs were below 1 for most substances from clinical chemistry and histology instruments for which a limit value at the point of release into the sewer system is recommended by the dwa however the combined liquid waste from clinical chemistry and histology instruments contains three substances for which the concentration surpasses the limit value for release into the sewer system recommended by the dwa rlv 1 i e semi volatile lipophilic substances the hydrocarbon index and the volatile halogenated hydrocarbons this indicates that the combined liquid waste generated in the defined hospital would not be allowed to be released into the sewer system under the assumed conditions of use further assessment is therefore required to verify whether threshold values would indeed be surpassed in a realistic hospital the results of part 1 of the two example assessments performed for a hypothetical hospital located either in germany or switzerland showed that in both cases the release of liquid waste in the wastewater may not be possible due to specific critical substances overall 5 critical substances with an rlv 1 were identified in the example cases among the 5 substances identified the volatile halogenated hydrocarbons and hydrocarbon index were identified as critical independently of the national legal requirements applying in germany and switzerland variations in the calculated rlvs for the two investigated countries are mainly due to differences in the list of substances for which limits values are defined e g limit values available for the semi volatile lipophilic substances for germany but not for switzerland the identification of more critical substances 4 substances for switzerland versus 3 for germany and some rlvs far above 1 for switzerland are in line with the differences in the applicable national provisions 3 1 2 risk estimation for sewage treatment plant and receiving surface waters part 2 to illustrate the model implemented in the screening tool it was assumed that the release into the sewer system was allowed for the liquid waste from clinical chemistry and histology instruments for both the swiss and german cases because the hospital use conditions the local receiving stp and receiving environment and the reference values as defined in the reach registrations were assumed to be the same in the two example cases the results of the estimation of the risks for the stp and the receiving surface waters apply to both switzerland and germany the results are presented in table 6 from the calculations presented in table 6 no substances were identified with a risk characterisation ratio above 1 for the stp or the surface waters therefore the results do not indicate any issues for the stp or receiving surface waters for the two examples investigated i e the swiss and german cases it has to be noted though that reference values are not available for all parameters especially some of the substances identified as critical in part 1 of the assessment 3 2 refinement of the assessment where critical substances have been identified the results of part 1 of the screening assessment show that the liquid waste generated by either the clinical chemistry or the histology modules would not be allowed to be released into the swiss or german sewer system and that further assessment is required to verify whether threshold values would indeed be surpassed in a realistic hospital on the other hand the second part of the assessment indicated that no risk was expected for the stp and surface waters with the predefined parameters available in the tool for both germany and switzerland a refinement is therefore only required for part 1 of the assessment because the screening assessments are based on default composition of the liquid waste and standard usage scenarios the first step is to examine closely whether the predefined composition of the liquid waste available in the tool is realistic this is particularly relevant for the swiss case for which the generated waste is not allowed to be diluted with other wastewater to meet the limit values 3 2 1 switzerland no dilution scenario case 1 the default liquid waste compositions implemented in the screening tool correspond to the highest values observed in liquid waste from different ivd instruments to verify whether threshold values are surpassed the first step is to verify the validity of the default values assumed in the tool for the critical substances identified in section 3 1 of the assessment for the liquid waste from clinical chemistry instruments the volatile halogenated hydrocarbons and easily released cyanides were identified as critical because of an rlv above 1 in the example assessment the corresponding default values implemented in the screening tools are discussed below volatile halogenated hydrocarbons the default worst case concentration in liquid waste from clinical chemistry was set to the highest limit of detection of 1 mg l reported in stark rogel et al 2016 in the screening tool however when looking at the reported results from stark rogel et al 2016 such a high limit of detection was only observed for one clinical chemistry instrument due to high interference from the analysed sample in all other investigated samples the limit of detection was far below i e 0 01 in addition the highest actual value measured on the clinical chemistry modules was 0 11 mg l therefore if the actual maximum concentration in the liquid waste at the site were lower by a factor of 10 as may well be possible based on the results from stark rogel et al 2016 an rlv below 1 could be observed for the volatile halogenated hydrocarbons easily released cyanides the default worst case concentration in liquid waste from clinical chemistry instruments implemented in the tool is 1 mg l as reported in stark rogel et al 2016 for the clinical chemistry instrument 6 see table s4 in section 5 supporting information all of the other reported measured values or detection limits are at least a factor of 100 below to obtain an rlv below 1 the actual maximum concentration in the liquid waste at a real site would need to be lower by a factor of 2 this would need to be verified e g based on the presence of easily released cyanides in the reagents used in the specific assays performed in a real hospital based on site specific refinement applied to a real case it may be possible to demonstrate that limit values would not be surpassed for the liquid waste from clinical chemistry instruments this could be done by referencing the assays performed onsite and verifying whether the critical substances identified with the screening tool are present in the compositions of the reagents used in the performed assays alternatively measurements of the substances identified with the screening tool could be performed on samples taken at the outlet of the clinical chemistry and histology modules installed in the investigated site however such investigations are time consuming and may lead to significant additional costs for the liquid waste from histology instruments the hydrocarbon index volatile halogenated hydrocarbons copper and easily released cyanides were identified as critical because of an rlv above 1 in the example assessment the corresponding default values implemented in the screening tools are discussed below due to the organic substance dissolved in the aqueous phase a very high hydrocarbon index of 1 49 107 μg l is expected even after the removal of the organic phase this results in an rlv of 745 well above 1 unless it can be proven that the hydrocarbon index is significantly lower in the specific liquid waste generated from instruments operated in a real hospital i e based on the reagents used or measurements it may not be possible to show that the limit values are not surpassed for the histology waste in case it can be shown that the limit values for the hydrocarbon index are met the further substances with an rlv above 1 i e volatile halogenated hydrocarbons copper and easily released cyanides would need to be evaluated similarly to the refinements presented above for the liquid waste from clinical chemistry instruments as the hydrocarbon index is far above the threshold value for release into wastewater in the preliminary assessment it will be difficult to demonstrate that limit values would not be surpassed for the liquid waste histology instruments therefore liquid waste from histology instruments will likely need to be disposed of as waste this is consistent with common practice in switzerland to collect and dispose of liquid waste from histology instruments as waste 3 2 2 germany dilution scenario case 2 as for switzerland the default worst case compositions of liquid waste implemented in the screening tool need to be investigated in greater details the default values for the critical substances identified in the combined liquid waste are discussed below semi volatile lipophilic substances and hydrocarbon index the ratio is only slightly above 1 see table 4 therefore if not all liquid waste contains the maximum amount of semi volatile lipophilic substances and hydrocarbons the limit values will likely be met volatile halogenated hydrocarbons the default worst case concentrations in the screening tool were set to the highest detection limits of 1 mg l and 250 mg l observed in selected liquid waste samples from clinical chemistry and histology instruments respectively stark rogel et al 2016 such high limits of detection are due to strong interference in the selected samples in addition it can be noted that all the values reported by stark rogel et al 2016 correspond to limits of detection for the histology instruments data format provided as 250 mg l volatile halogenated hydrocarbons may thus not be present at all in the liquid waste furthermore the contribution of volatile halogenated hydrocarbons from clinical chemistry alone does not surpass the limit value therefore only the presence in liquid waste from histology would need to be verified e g based on its presence in the reagents used in the assays performed in a real hospital to confirm if the limit value is really surpassed before verifying the occurrence of the critical substances in the reagents and or analysing combined liquid waste samples one should bear in mind that unlike switzerland the dilution of the liquid waste generated by the clinical chemistry and histology modules with further wastewater from the hospital may be taken into account in germany further input parameters related to the assumed usage conditions e g liquid waste volume number and volumes of containers emptied in a day and wastewater volumes per hospital bed etc may therefore significantly influence the results of the assessment however further refinement would only be possible when performing the screening assessment for a real case this can be done either by identifying which instruments and assays are used on the investigated site and if the assumed usage conditions are realistic for these instruments in such a case the selected input parameters on the uses of ivd modules can be adapted accordingly for instance adaptations may be possible if the average liquid waste generated in a real hospital differs from the calculated rate of 15 l h volume for clinical chemistry and or if the number and volume of containers emptied on the same day per histology module differs from the default values 2 containers of 20 l emptied on the same day or if 1 m3 of wastewater per day per hospital bed and thus a wastewater volume of 850 m3 per day is not consistent with the actual local generation of wastewater based on the results obtained in the first part of the assessment and usage and or substance specific refinements applied to a real case it may be possible to demonstrate that limit values would not be surpassed for the combined liquid waste from clinical chemistry and histology instruments in germany if this is not the case additional in house measurements of the critical parameters identified in the assessment in the combined liquid waste at the real site may be performed to verify whether the ratio to limit value rlv is still greater than 1 3 3 advantages and limitations of the screening tool the two examples presented above show that the developed screening tool facilitates an assessment to determine whether the liquid waste generated under the normal operating conditions for in vitro diagnostic equipment can be released to the sewer system the tool permits a worst case risk assessment for receiving waters in order to identify potentially critical substances for more advanced assessment using tools that take into account removal processes degradation adsorption etc it includes standard scenarios and standard input parameters permitting a screening assessment representing a reasonable worst case without site specific information on all parameters in the event of critical results for release into the sewer system obtained with the reasonable worst case scenario further refinements are possible to best reflect the specific site usage and local settings since the release of wastewater into the sewer system is frequently regulated locally it needs to be verified whether the assumptions on which the scenarios are based are in line with local regulations and locally issued permits similarly if the site is situated in a different country from germany or switzerland it needs to be verified whether the applicable regulations can be represented by the developed scenarios in addition site specific parameters should always be used as far as possible to allow for a more targeted assessment this is especially true for cases where the default parameters may not represent a worst case for the specific site indeed only specific chemicals present in the reagents used in roche s diagnostic instruments as well as a limited number of substances of public concern measured in liquid waste by stark rogel et al 2016 are assessed in the implemented model therefore care should be taken regarding the interpretation of the results when investigating liquid waste generated from ivd instruments other than from roche using default values it is indeed possible for local concentrations of specific substances in liquid waste to be higher than the ones currently implemented as default in the tool or that further substances are relevant that have not yet been listed in such cases refinement at a substance specific level including the verification of occurrence and concentration of critical substances in liquid waste at the site may need to be performed should potential concern be indicated only for the stp and or surface waters and given substances a more advanced assessment may need to be performed taking into account removal processes such as adsorption and biodegradation in the stp for such an assessment substance specific data such as physicochemical data and information on biodegradation are required the standard reach tools such as the european union system for the evaluation of substances euses 2 0 2003 can be used for such an assessment however it has to be noted that additional contributions to the release to the stp from other ivd activities taking place in the fictitious site and additional site connected to the same stp are not considered in the assessment this would need to be addressed separately further actions such as risk management measures are only required if the risk is confirmed after a more refined assessment as described above for the exposure scenarios and assessment tool to represent a reasonable worst case up to date information for default parameters and legal frameworks needs to be reflected in the tool therefore the parameters as reported in the present paper will be updated in the event of significant changes in reference or limit values or legal frameworks or significant changes based on the further development of ivd equipment and assays including the addition of further substances that are identified as relevant based on the composition of typical reagents furthermore it is planned to include limit values for release into the sewer system for other countries for example the us the developed screening tool is implemented as a microsoft excel file and is available free of charge upon request for at least one year after the publication date 4 conclusions the presented exposure scenarios and tool permit an assessment to determine whether the liquid waste can be released into wastewater and whether such release would result in a risk to surface water unlike a typical first tier model used for the purpose of risk assessment for instance the european union system for the evaluation of substances euses 2 0 2003 where the calculation is based on the total amount of a chemical substance used in the reagents in all in vitro diagnostics assays per site and pre defined environmental release categories using default release factors as a starting point the presented model is based on reasonable worst case substance concentrations obtained by chemical analysis of representative liquid waste samples and reflects site specific use conditions the screening tool therefore corresponds to a second tier model for the estimation of the release before the sewage treatment plant further the screening tool assumes as a worst case that no removal of the substance takes place in the sewage treatment plant positioning it between a first and a second tier model the model was applied to two examples of fictitious but representative hospitals with the same site specific uses located in countries with different local legal requirements i e germany and switzerland to allow the comparison the results of the assessment showed that in both cases the release of liquid waste to the wastewater may not be possible due to specific substances further assessment refinement would be required to confirm whether disposal as waste is needed on the other hand no risk was identified for the stp and surface waters with the default input parameters available in the screening tool as shown with the examples the presented exposure scenarios facilitate a screening assessment of liquid waste from ivd instruments based on reasonable worst case default parameters without the need for comprehensive site specific information on the hospital and or laboratories it allows specific parameters to be adjusted as well as adaptations in line with different local requirements for a refined assessment it aims to support ivd developers and users to make informed decisions on the substances to be looked at in priority when designing new ivd devices and on how to handle liquid waste from ivd instruments in agreement with the requirements of the new

18090,in vitro diagnostic assays involve various substances that may be released into the environment via a sewage treatment plant if the effluent from diagnostic instruments is discharged into the drains because the release of liquid waste into the public sewer system is regulated at national and or local levels a risk assessment per site should be performed to determine whether the release of the effluent from in vitro diagnostic equipment is compliant with applicable regulations to facilitate the assessment we developed a screening tool to generate exposure scenarios for chemical substances used in in vitro diagnostic assays this screening tool helps in determining a whether release of the effluent into the sewer system would be allowed from a regulatory point of view and b whether such release would result in potential risks to surface water the screening tool is based on conditions encountered at typical usage sites in switzerland and germany with the option to adapt them to other local settings in addition measured analytical results of liquid waste together with typical operational parameters of diagnostic equipment were defined as default input parameters the resulting concentrations in liquid waste and predicted environmental concentrations pec are compared with regulatory limit values for release into the sewer system and predicted no effect concentrations pnec for surface water for risk estimation the functioning of the presented screening tool is demonstrated by two assessments performed for fictitious but typical hospitals in switzerland and germany it identified substances that cause potential concern for which a more advanced assessment is required graphical abstract image 1 keywords hospital laboratory liquid waste wastewater screening tool risk assessment 1 introduction in vitro diagnostic medical device ivd means any reagent calibrator control material kit or instrument intended by the manufacturer to be used outside the human body for the examination of specimens including blood and tissue for the purpose of among other things providing information concerning a physiological or pathological process or state or the predisposition to a medical condition or a disease or to define or monitor therapeutic measures regulation eu 2017 746 even if they only represent 2 3 of healthcare expenditures in the usa and 1 4 in germany rohr et al 2016 they are essential in human and veterinary medicine to enable the correct diagnosis and the appropriate medication or treatment to be prescribed in vitro diagnostic assays are generally performed in laboratories and involve a range of chemical substances that are used as reagents solvents surfactants or with other functions among the substances typically used in in vitro diagnostics some may have adverse effects on the health of the operating personnel or on the environment chemical substances used in reagents such as octyl and nonylphenolethoxylates sodium azide and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta were identified as environmentally relevant in a previous study by stark rogel et al 2016 for instance the degradation products of octyl and nonylphenolethoxylates have endocrine disrupting properties and were therefore listed as substances of very high concern https echa europa eu candidate list table and are now subject to authorisation according to the european regulation ec no 1907 2006 on registration evaluation authorisation and restriction of chemicals reach being used as reagents in in vitro diagnostic assays chemical substances may be released into the environment via a sewage treatment plant if the effluent from diagnostic instruments is released into the drains therefore an environmental risk assessment should be performed for the use of these substances as reagents in in vitro diagnostic assays so far this specific use has not been subject to risk assessment within regulatory frameworks such as the reach registration requirement due to the low tonnage of the chemicals used in ivd indeed the quantity of reagents used in an in vitro diagnostic assay is typically very low often resulting in an overall tonnage per chemical and legal entity below the threshold for a risk assessment of 10 tonnes per year set by the reach regulation despite relatively low tonnages a risk to human health and the environment from substances with critical properties used in in vitro diagnostic assays cannot generally be excluded and should be assessed the need to evaluate the environmental impact and effects on public health caused by healthcare waste is a globally recognized issue eckelmann and sherman 2016 http www who int mediacentre factsheets fs253 en some ivd suppliers already implement specific programs to assess the risks posed by chemical substances to human health and the environment to identify viable potential alternatives and substitute identified critical substances whenever possible and to provide guidance for safe use to their clients and to comply with sustainable procurement requirements and applicable regulations for in vitro diagnostic medical devices regulation eu 2017 746 in this context a detailed chemical analysis of liquid waste from ivd instruments was performed by stark rogel et al 2016 in a regulatory context the term liquid waste is sometimes used for material which is separately collected and treated e g incinerated however in the present publication the term is used for all liquids generated from the in vitro diagnostic instrumentation within the scope of our investigation in the study by stark rogel et al 2016 almost 50 environmentally relevant parameters were analysed in liquid waste from ivd instruments used in clinical chemistry analysis of body fluids or histological examination of tissue samples analysis these 50 parameters included those commonly addressed in water analysis such as ph total organic carbon toc metals and nitrogen compounds the other substances were chosen because of their use in ivd assays or because they are listed by the european chemical agency as substances of very high concern or are considered to be of concern for other reasons the analysed parameters were compared whenever possible with german and or eu reference or limit values and in most cases the measured values were below the thresholds in this previous study stark rogel et al 2016 a site specific risk assessment was not performed however this is most relevant since 1 the release of liquid waste into the public sewer system is regulated at a national or often even at a local level 2 a general concept is needed to support laboratories running ivd assays to ensure that generated waste is disposed of in a compliant manner and 3 to identify priorities for the further development of environmentally friendly ivd to the best of our knowledge site specific compliance of the release of the effluent from ivd equipment or any other professional laboratory equipment into the sewer system and the related risk to receiving waters have not been assessed so far to address this gap we developed a screening tool to generate site specific exposure scenarios for chemical substances present in liquid waste from in vitro diagnostic instruments the purpose of the screening tool presented here is also 1 to determine if liquid waste generated by ivd instruments may be released into the sewer system at a given site 2 to perform a risk assessment for receiving waters in order to identify potentially critical substances for which more advanced assessments would be required and 3 to identify the most significant contributors to the total hazard profile the model is illustrated by two assessments performed for fictitious but typical hospitals in switzerland and germany and can be adapted to apply to other countries 2 materials and methods 2 1 model implemented in the screening tool the present model allows a site specific screening risk assessment for substances used in in vitro diagnostics assays it permits us 1 to assess whether liquid waste generated by ivd at a given site may be released into the sewer system considering national legal requirements and 2 to enable a risk estimation for sewage treatment plants stp and receiving waters to identify substances of potential concern it is currently implemented for the national legal settings of switzerland and germany and allows the generation of reasonable worst case exposure scenarios for a given site via the use of predefined default values in case site specific data are not available see tables s1 to s3 in section 5 supporting information the first part of the assessment namely the evaluation of whether liquid waste may be released into the sewer system is a 4 step approach 1 details on applicable local regulations and local site 2 characterisation of the liquid waste 3 details on ivd uses and volumes of generated liquid waste 4 decision on compliance of release to wastewater for the second part of the assessment i e the risk estimation for the sewage treatment plant and the receiving surface waters two additional steps are required i e 5 further details on local site details on stp and receiving water 6 risk assessment for microorganisms in the sewage treatment plant and for aquatic organisms in the receiving waters an overview of the different steps in the assessment performed using the excel tool developed is provided in fig s1 of the supporting information each step is described in greater detail below 2 1 1 evaluation whether liquid waste may be released into the sewer system part 1 2 1 1 1 details on applicable local regulations and site step 1 in this step the general parameters for local legal requirements and the wastewater volume released from the site should be provided as a basis for the evaluation local legal requirements since the release of liquid waste into the public sewer system is regulated at a national or often even at a local level care should be taken to ensure that the assumption made for the assessment reflects the applicable regulations for the evaluated site for given countries such as switzerland compliance with limit values is required at the point of occurrence of the liquid waste as wastewater may not be mixed or diluted to achieve these values hereinafter referred to as a no dilution scenario see 3 1 1 1 in other countries such as germany the recommended limit values refer to the point of release into the public sewer system i e mixing with other wastewater from the same site is permitted to achieve these values hereinafter referred to as a dilution scenario different reference values apply depending on the country and the scenario see step 4 wastewater discharge rate from the site into the public sewer system m 3 d this parameter is required to calculate the observed concentration in the waste at the point of release into the public sewer system when the dilution scenario applies typical total wastewater volumes from hospitals based on the literature emmanuel et al 2005 escher et al 2011 were implemented as default parameters that may be used if site specific information is not available for further details see tables s1 to s3 in section 5 supporting information local permits with specific provisions in addition to the applicable local requirements it should be verified whether local permits with special provisions have been issued by the local authorities for specific waste releases if yes these should be considered for the assessment 2 1 1 2 characterisation of the liquid waste step 2 to evaluate whether liquid waste from ivd instruments can be introduced into the sewer system for a given site the liquid waste must first be characterised as a starting point the parameters i e set of substances to be measured shall first be defined and the corresponding concentrations have to be determined in the liquid waste there are two possible ways to determine substance concentrations in the liquid waste by calculation based on the assays run on the instruments and the starting concentrations of the reagents or by analytical determinations of substance concentrations in representative liquid waste samples for the first approach complete information on reagent concentrations needs to be available which is not always the case as the available information is often based on safety data sheets for raw materials in addition some reagents may react or decompose so that the identity and concentration in the liquid waste does not correspond to that in the reagent in any case real life measured data are preferred if available however their generation is time consuming and expensive since measured data from the local site for which the environmental risk assessment will be performed are often not available measured data in actual liquid waste samples from different in vitro diagnostic instruments of roche and different laboratories as reported in an extensive previous study from stark rogel et al 2016 were used as a basis for the input of the present screening tool the study from stark rogel et al 2016 provides a large set of parameters substances that were selected based either on their occurrence in in vitro diagnostic reagents or on general public concern e g substances of very high concern under reach and measured in various collected liquid waste samples due to the differences in the chemistry of the generated liquid waste in vitro diagnostic instruments were divided into two types for the purpose of the present assessment clinical chemistry which includes different water based in vitro diagnostic instruments and allows mainly the analysis of body fluids and histology which focuses on the examination of tissue samples while liquid waste generated from clinical chemistry instruments typically consists of an aqueous phase only histological liquid waste consists of both an aqueous and an organic phase the selected parameters and substance concentrations measured in the generated liquid waste from eight samples taken from the clinical chemistry instrument cobas http www cobas com and from five samples taken from histological benchmark ivd instruments https diagnostics roche com global en products systems benchmark ultra system html are reported in stark rogel et al 2016 see also tables s4 to s5 in section 5 supporting information please note that the reported values for the histological liquid waste see table s5 in section 5 supporting information refer to the analysed aqueous phases since the organic waste will usually not be discharged into the drains but rather collected and treated as hazardous waste in the present screening tool the highest measured concentrations for each substance in the aqueous phase of the liquid waste generated from clinical chemistry and histological ivd instruments reported in stark rogel et al 2016 were used for the assessment in order to establish a realistic worst case see table 1 additionally an option was included to account for the undesirable discharge of liquid waste with the organic phase into the drains in adjusting the hydrocarbon index based on information on the organic phase generated by a ventana he600 instrument concentration of c9 c16 alkanes of 130 g l and approx 15 v v of organic phase 2 1 1 3 details on ivd uses and volumes of generated liquid waste step 3 to evaluate whether the generated liquid waste may be introduced into the drains information on the operating parameters of in vitro diagnostic instruments and the daily liquid waste volumes generated for the investigated site are additionally needed to calculate the daily liquid waste volume generated by both clinical chemistry and histology in vitro diagnostics instruments at a given site the following input parameters are required the number of modules used and the quantity of liquid waste generated per module per hour l h and number of operating hours per day h day or the size of liquid waste container installed in a module l and the maximum number of containers that may be emptied per module per day in addition provisions detailing the sampling time allowed at the point of discharge into the sewer system are needed for the calculation of concentrations at the point of discharge for the dilution scenario this is needed if liquid waste is released into the sewer system from containers in order to calculate the concentration at the point of discharge into the public sewer system averaged over the appropriate timeframe i e the allowed sampling time moreover liquid waste has to be checked for ph and other regulatory requirements regulated waste the assessment of ph should be based on local measurements and is thus not included in an automatic comparison with limit values it must also be checked whether the liquid waste from one or both instrument types is already defined as regulated waste not permitted for release into the sewer system if this is the case the liquid waste will be excluded from the assessment the result from this verification is indicated in the tool in case information is not available for the investigated sites default values are implemented in the screening tool corresponding to worst case assumption for a large private laboratory in europe and typical volumes of liquid waste generated by clinical chemistry and histology in vitro diagnostic instruments see tables s1 to s3 in section 5 supporting information 2 1 1 4 decision on waste or wastewater step 4 at this step a preliminary decision is made whether the liquid waste from the instruments may be released into the sewer system or needs to be disposed of as waste to do so the relevant substance concentrations in liquid waste are determined based on requirements from local regulations dilution or no dilution scenario and compared with corresponding limit values the ratio of concentrations to limit values is then calculated and a ratio of 1 indicates that wastewater may be released into the sewer system if all local and permit requirements are fulfilled currently the tool contains the following two alternatives dilution scenario where the limit values need to be met at the point of release to the public sewer system implemented for germany combined waste from all instruments clinical chemistry and histology is considered mixing with other wastewater from the site is allowed the time over which a sample may be taken at the point of release is taken into account 2 h for germany based on the guidance documents of the german association for water wastewater and waste dwa the resulting substance concentrations are calculated at the point of release into the public sewer system and are currently compared with the recommended limit values of the dwa guidance no dilution scenario where limit values need to be met at the point of occurrence of the wastewater implemented for switzerland the waste from the two instrument groups clinical chemistry and histology is considered separately mixing with other wastewater from the site is not allowed by swiss regulations the resulting substance concentrations in the liquid waste are directly compared with the limit values for discharge into public sewers of the swiss waters protection ordinance wpo the limit values for release into public sewer systems applicable in germany and switzerland are summarised in table 2 if the calculated ratio of concentrations to limit values is 1 for all substances the wastewater may be released into the sewer system provided that all local and permit requirements are fulfilled and further risk assessment for the receiving waters should be performed to verify that the generated liquid waste does not contain substances which would pose a risk to the local receiving waters part 2 step 5 to 7 if the ratio to limit value is 1 for one or more substances further assessment may be required as the presented screening model follows a simplified worst case approach therefore with further refinements it is possible to verify whether limit values are in fact surpassed such as refinement of parameters e g laboratory specific adjustment of liquid waste volume if the default values were used substance specific assessment verification of whether a substance occurs in the assay runs at the investigated site or whether the available measured concentrations are applicable for the site e g due to different types of instruments etc in house measurements at the site could be performed to obtain more site specific data clarification with the authorities depending on the parameters release may be allowed under certain conditions if the ratio to limit value remains 1 for one or more substances even after further refinement the generated liquid waste cannot be introduced into the wastewater instead it needs to be collected and treated as waste according to the applicable local national regulations no further risk assessment for the receiving surface waters is required 2 1 2 risk estimation for sewage treatment plant and receiving surface waters part 2 2 1 2 1 further details on local site step 5 in this step additional parameters on the local site should be provided as a basis for the evaluation effluent discharge rate for local stp m3 d this parameter is required to calculate the observed concentration at the point of release into the stp if detailed information on the local stp for dry weather is available it should be provided in the screening tool the default value recommended by the reach regulation for a small town echa 2016 is implemented as a conservative approach see table s1 in section 5 supporting information river flow m3 s at point of release of stp low flow rate this parameter is required to calculate the observed concentration in the receiving waters at the point of release if detailed information on the local river flow into which the local stp releases its effluent is available typically the minimum flow rate on 347 days during 95 of the year q347 this should be provided in the screening tool the default value recommended by the reach regulation and leading to a dilution factor of 10 between stp and a river echa 2016 is implemented as a conservative approach see table s1 in section 5 supporting information 2 1 2 2 risk assessment for microorganisms in the sewage treatment plant and receiving waters step 6 to assess the potential risk to microorganisms in the sewage treatment plant or receiving waters by liquid waste generated by ivd instruments the emissions and related concentrations in the stp and receiving waters must be estimated and compared with available reference concentrations at which no effects on microorganisms or aquatic organisms are expected predicted environmental concentrations pec for the sewage treatment plant and receiving waters were calculated based on dilution considering the stp effluent flow river flow and the load of each substance based on liquid waste volume and concentrations in the described assessment removal processes such as degradation adsorption or volatilisation are not taken into account only dilution is considered as a worst case approach to assess whether there is a risk for the sewage treatment plant or receiving waters from specific substances in wastewater the predicted environmental concentrations need to be compared with the defined reference concentrations in the stp and surface waters at or below which no effects are expected predicted no effect concentrations pnecs in the screening tool the reference values for stps if available were compiled from the reach registration dossiers as published on the website of the european chemical agency echa see table 3 for receiving waters the reference values if available were compiled from the following sources see table 3 reach registration dossiers as published on the website of the european chemical agency echa environmental quality standards eqs based on european directive 2013 39 eu regarding priority substances in the field of water policy requirements for watercourses as defined in annex 2 12 additional requirements for watercourses of the swiss waters protection ordinance wpo sr 814 201 the values for total metals from the wpo are used where available as total metal concentrations were determined in the waste measurements if no values are available in the wpo pnec values for dissolved metals are used from reach registrations the values are given as of september 2018 new or updated data may become available especially in reach registration dossiers and will need to be included in future updates of the tool if pec pnec ratios are 1 for all investigated substances this indicates that the liquid waste does not pose any risk to the microorganisms in stp and the aquatic organisms in the receiving water if the pec pnec ratio is equal to or greater than 1 indicating a potential concern for the given substances refinements to verify whether reference values are actually surpassed are required this could be done for example by including more realistic site specific parameters e g for liquid waste volumes and operating times or actual river and stp flow rates if default values are used or chemical analysis of the specific waste from the site has to be performed if necessary a specific assessment using reach tools such as the european union system for the evaluation of substances euses 2 0 2003 can be used to take the removal processes in stp into account and verify whether a risk to an stp receiving water is confirmed 2 2 example of risk assessment in switzerland and germany to illustrate the functioning of the screening tool two example assessments were performed based on the approach presented above for a fictitious but typical hospital located either in switzerland or germany the same parameters for the site ivd uses and generated liquid waste were assumed for the evaluation in both countries to allow the comparison between the two different local legal requirements i e the dilution and no dilution scenario applicable in germany and switzerland respectively these typically correspond to a large hospital located in switzerland e g zürich or an average size hospital in germany e g bochum 2 2 1 details on the site the example site consists of a hospital with a daily capacity of 850 beds it was assumed to be connected to an stp for 400 000 inhabitants with a discharge rate of 250 000 m3 d during dry weather and a minimum flow rate in the receiving river of 40 m3 s q347 i e the flow that is reached for 95 of the year the dilution rate between the stp and river of 14 is therefore slightly higher than the reach default value of 10 2 2 2 characterisation of the liquid waste no site specific data on substances in the liquid waste or substance concentrations are available therefore the default concentrations of the liquid waste available in the screening tool for clinical chemistry and histology are used for assessment both in germany and switzerland in stark rogel et al 2016 the ph values for the clinical chemistry and histology liquid waste reported for given ivd modules is below or above the range recommended by the dwa ph 6 5 10 or allowed in switzerland ph 6 5 9 however as the ph in the hospital wastewater is typically neutralised before release into the sewer system the ph is assumed to be adjusted to these ranges the ph is therefore compliant with the requirements in the example assessments 2 2 3 details on ivd uses and volumes of generated liquid waste data was collected on the number of operating clinical chemistry and histology ivd modules as well as the corresponding generated waste from given large european laboratories hospitals based on this information the worst case usage i e the simultaneous operation of 7 clinical chemistry and 12 histology modules on the selected site was selected for the assessment a default average liquid waste volume of 15 l h per clinical chemistry module operated over 24 h day was assumed liquid waste generated by the histology modules was presumed to be collected in two 20l containers per module being released to the sewer system during 1 day before release the organic phase from the liquid waste normally approx 15 was assumed to be removed and disposed of as hazardous waste for the specific case of germany where dilution with further wastewater from the hospital may be taken into account dilution scenario the time allowed to obtain an average sample at the point of discharge to verify whether limit values are met was set to 2 h as recommended by the dwa the input parameters selected for the performed assessments are summarised in table s6 and s7 in section 5 supporting information 3 results and discussion the results of the two examples for screening assessments performed for a hypothetical hospital located either in switzerland or germany using the above described procedure are addressed in the following in the first step a high level screening assessment for both countries was performed to verify whether critical substances are identified with respect to allowing release to the sewer system or the risk for the stp or receiving surface waters see section 3 1 in a second step the assessment was refined for the critical substances identified in the first step see section 3 2 3 1 screening assessment to verify whether critical substances are identified with respect to allowing release to the sewer system or the risk for the stp or receiving surface waters 3 1 1 evaluation if critical substances are identified with respect to allowing release to wastewater part 1 3 1 1 1 switzerland no dilution scenario case 1 due to the location in switzerland dilution of the liquid waste generated by the clinical chemistry and histology modules with further wastewater from the hospital is not allowed therefore the no dilution scenario applies and the liquid waste from both clinical chemistry and histology modules needs to be separately investigated at the outlet of the module before comparison with the limit values set in the swiss water protection ordinance the results of the screening assessment of whether liquid waste from either the clinical chemistry or the histology modules may be released into the swiss sewer system is presented in table 4 as can be seen in table 4 the calculated ratio to limit values rlv are below 1 for most substances in the liquid waste from the clinical chemistry and histology instruments and for which a limit value in the swiss regulation is defined nonetheless the screening tool identified critical parameters showing an rlv greater than 1 in both the liquid waste from clinical chemistry and histology instruments i e clinical chemistry volatile halogenated hydrocarbons and easily released cyanides histology hydrocarbon index volatile halogenated hydrocarbons copper and easily released cyanides the results of the screening assessment show that the liquid waste generated by either the clinical chemistry or the histology modules would not be allowed to be released into the swiss sewer system and that further assessment is required to verify whether threshold values would indeed be surpassed in a realistic hospital 3 1 1 2 germany dilution scenario case 2 due to the location in germany dilution of the liquid waste generated by the clinical chemistry and histology modules with further wastewater from the hospital may be taken into account therefore the dilution scenario applies and the liquid waste from both clinical chemistry and histology modules may be combined further with hospital wastewater before comparison with the limit value recommended by dwa at the point of discharge to the sewer system the results of the calculations and evaluation for the combined liquid waste from the clinical chemistry and histology modules diluted with further wastewater from the hospital that may be released into the sewer system is presented in table 5 as for switzerland the rlvs were below 1 for most substances from clinical chemistry and histology instruments for which a limit value at the point of release into the sewer system is recommended by the dwa however the combined liquid waste from clinical chemistry and histology instruments contains three substances for which the concentration surpasses the limit value for release into the sewer system recommended by the dwa rlv 1 i e semi volatile lipophilic substances the hydrocarbon index and the volatile halogenated hydrocarbons this indicates that the combined liquid waste generated in the defined hospital would not be allowed to be released into the sewer system under the assumed conditions of use further assessment is therefore required to verify whether threshold values would indeed be surpassed in a realistic hospital the results of part 1 of the two example assessments performed for a hypothetical hospital located either in germany or switzerland showed that in both cases the release of liquid waste in the wastewater may not be possible due to specific critical substances overall 5 critical substances with an rlv 1 were identified in the example cases among the 5 substances identified the volatile halogenated hydrocarbons and hydrocarbon index were identified as critical independently of the national legal requirements applying in germany and switzerland variations in the calculated rlvs for the two investigated countries are mainly due to differences in the list of substances for which limits values are defined e g limit values available for the semi volatile lipophilic substances for germany but not for switzerland the identification of more critical substances 4 substances for switzerland versus 3 for germany and some rlvs far above 1 for switzerland are in line with the differences in the applicable national provisions 3 1 2 risk estimation for sewage treatment plant and receiving surface waters part 2 to illustrate the model implemented in the screening tool it was assumed that the release into the sewer system was allowed for the liquid waste from clinical chemistry and histology instruments for both the swiss and german cases because the hospital use conditions the local receiving stp and receiving environment and the reference values as defined in the reach registrations were assumed to be the same in the two example cases the results of the estimation of the risks for the stp and the receiving surface waters apply to both switzerland and germany the results are presented in table 6 from the calculations presented in table 6 no substances were identified with a risk characterisation ratio above 1 for the stp or the surface waters therefore the results do not indicate any issues for the stp or receiving surface waters for the two examples investigated i e the swiss and german cases it has to be noted though that reference values are not available for all parameters especially some of the substances identified as critical in part 1 of the assessment 3 2 refinement of the assessment where critical substances have been identified the results of part 1 of the screening assessment show that the liquid waste generated by either the clinical chemistry or the histology modules would not be allowed to be released into the swiss or german sewer system and that further assessment is required to verify whether threshold values would indeed be surpassed in a realistic hospital on the other hand the second part of the assessment indicated that no risk was expected for the stp and surface waters with the predefined parameters available in the tool for both germany and switzerland a refinement is therefore only required for part 1 of the assessment because the screening assessments are based on default composition of the liquid waste and standard usage scenarios the first step is to examine closely whether the predefined composition of the liquid waste available in the tool is realistic this is particularly relevant for the swiss case for which the generated waste is not allowed to be diluted with other wastewater to meet the limit values 3 2 1 switzerland no dilution scenario case 1 the default liquid waste compositions implemented in the screening tool correspond to the highest values observed in liquid waste from different ivd instruments to verify whether threshold values are surpassed the first step is to verify the validity of the default values assumed in the tool for the critical substances identified in section 3 1 of the assessment for the liquid waste from clinical chemistry instruments the volatile halogenated hydrocarbons and easily released cyanides were identified as critical because of an rlv above 1 in the example assessment the corresponding default values implemented in the screening tools are discussed below volatile halogenated hydrocarbons the default worst case concentration in liquid waste from clinical chemistry was set to the highest limit of detection of 1 mg l reported in stark rogel et al 2016 in the screening tool however when looking at the reported results from stark rogel et al 2016 such a high limit of detection was only observed for one clinical chemistry instrument due to high interference from the analysed sample in all other investigated samples the limit of detection was far below i e 0 01 in addition the highest actual value measured on the clinical chemistry modules was 0 11 mg l therefore if the actual maximum concentration in the liquid waste at the site were lower by a factor of 10 as may well be possible based on the results from stark rogel et al 2016 an rlv below 1 could be observed for the volatile halogenated hydrocarbons easily released cyanides the default worst case concentration in liquid waste from clinical chemistry instruments implemented in the tool is 1 mg l as reported in stark rogel et al 2016 for the clinical chemistry instrument 6 see table s4 in section 5 supporting information all of the other reported measured values or detection limits are at least a factor of 100 below to obtain an rlv below 1 the actual maximum concentration in the liquid waste at a real site would need to be lower by a factor of 2 this would need to be verified e g based on the presence of easily released cyanides in the reagents used in the specific assays performed in a real hospital based on site specific refinement applied to a real case it may be possible to demonstrate that limit values would not be surpassed for the liquid waste from clinical chemistry instruments this could be done by referencing the assays performed onsite and verifying whether the critical substances identified with the screening tool are present in the compositions of the reagents used in the performed assays alternatively measurements of the substances identified with the screening tool could be performed on samples taken at the outlet of the clinical chemistry and histology modules installed in the investigated site however such investigations are time consuming and may lead to significant additional costs for the liquid waste from histology instruments the hydrocarbon index volatile halogenated hydrocarbons copper and easily released cyanides were identified as critical because of an rlv above 1 in the example assessment the corresponding default values implemented in the screening tools are discussed below due to the organic substance dissolved in the aqueous phase a very high hydrocarbon index of 1 49 107 μg l is expected even after the removal of the organic phase this results in an rlv of 745 well above 1 unless it can be proven that the hydrocarbon index is significantly lower in the specific liquid waste generated from instruments operated in a real hospital i e based on the reagents used or measurements it may not be possible to show that the limit values are not surpassed for the histology waste in case it can be shown that the limit values for the hydrocarbon index are met the further substances with an rlv above 1 i e volatile halogenated hydrocarbons copper and easily released cyanides would need to be evaluated similarly to the refinements presented above for the liquid waste from clinical chemistry instruments as the hydrocarbon index is far above the threshold value for release into wastewater in the preliminary assessment it will be difficult to demonstrate that limit values would not be surpassed for the liquid waste histology instruments therefore liquid waste from histology instruments will likely need to be disposed of as waste this is consistent with common practice in switzerland to collect and dispose of liquid waste from histology instruments as waste 3 2 2 germany dilution scenario case 2 as for switzerland the default worst case compositions of liquid waste implemented in the screening tool need to be investigated in greater details the default values for the critical substances identified in the combined liquid waste are discussed below semi volatile lipophilic substances and hydrocarbon index the ratio is only slightly above 1 see table 4 therefore if not all liquid waste contains the maximum amount of semi volatile lipophilic substances and hydrocarbons the limit values will likely be met volatile halogenated hydrocarbons the default worst case concentrations in the screening tool were set to the highest detection limits of 1 mg l and 250 mg l observed in selected liquid waste samples from clinical chemistry and histology instruments respectively stark rogel et al 2016 such high limits of detection are due to strong interference in the selected samples in addition it can be noted that all the values reported by stark rogel et al 2016 correspond to limits of detection for the histology instruments data format provided as 250 mg l volatile halogenated hydrocarbons may thus not be present at all in the liquid waste furthermore the contribution of volatile halogenated hydrocarbons from clinical chemistry alone does not surpass the limit value therefore only the presence in liquid waste from histology would need to be verified e g based on its presence in the reagents used in the assays performed in a real hospital to confirm if the limit value is really surpassed before verifying the occurrence of the critical substances in the reagents and or analysing combined liquid waste samples one should bear in mind that unlike switzerland the dilution of the liquid waste generated by the clinical chemistry and histology modules with further wastewater from the hospital may be taken into account in germany further input parameters related to the assumed usage conditions e g liquid waste volume number and volumes of containers emptied in a day and wastewater volumes per hospital bed etc may therefore significantly influence the results of the assessment however further refinement would only be possible when performing the screening assessment for a real case this can be done either by identifying which instruments and assays are used on the investigated site and if the assumed usage conditions are realistic for these instruments in such a case the selected input parameters on the uses of ivd modules can be adapted accordingly for instance adaptations may be possible if the average liquid waste generated in a real hospital differs from the calculated rate of 15 l h volume for clinical chemistry and or if the number and volume of containers emptied on the same day per histology module differs from the default values 2 containers of 20 l emptied on the same day or if 1 m3 of wastewater per day per hospital bed and thus a wastewater volume of 850 m3 per day is not consistent with the actual local generation of wastewater based on the results obtained in the first part of the assessment and usage and or substance specific refinements applied to a real case it may be possible to demonstrate that limit values would not be surpassed for the combined liquid waste from clinical chemistry and histology instruments in germany if this is not the case additional in house measurements of the critical parameters identified in the assessment in the combined liquid waste at the real site may be performed to verify whether the ratio to limit value rlv is still greater than 1 3 3 advantages and limitations of the screening tool the two examples presented above show that the developed screening tool facilitates an assessment to determine whether the liquid waste generated under the normal operating conditions for in vitro diagnostic equipment can be released to the sewer system the tool permits a worst case risk assessment for receiving waters in order to identify potentially critical substances for more advanced assessment using tools that take into account removal processes degradation adsorption etc it includes standard scenarios and standard input parameters permitting a screening assessment representing a reasonable worst case without site specific information on all parameters in the event of critical results for release into the sewer system obtained with the reasonable worst case scenario further refinements are possible to best reflect the specific site usage and local settings since the release of wastewater into the sewer system is frequently regulated locally it needs to be verified whether the assumptions on which the scenarios are based are in line with local regulations and locally issued permits similarly if the site is situated in a different country from germany or switzerland it needs to be verified whether the applicable regulations can be represented by the developed scenarios in addition site specific parameters should always be used as far as possible to allow for a more targeted assessment this is especially true for cases where the default parameters may not represent a worst case for the specific site indeed only specific chemicals present in the reagents used in roche s diagnostic instruments as well as a limited number of substances of public concern measured in liquid waste by stark rogel et al 2016 are assessed in the implemented model therefore care should be taken regarding the interpretation of the results when investigating liquid waste generated from ivd instruments other than from roche using default values it is indeed possible for local concentrations of specific substances in liquid waste to be higher than the ones currently implemented as default in the tool or that further substances are relevant that have not yet been listed in such cases refinement at a substance specific level including the verification of occurrence and concentration of critical substances in liquid waste at the site may need to be performed should potential concern be indicated only for the stp and or surface waters and given substances a more advanced assessment may need to be performed taking into account removal processes such as adsorption and biodegradation in the stp for such an assessment substance specific data such as physicochemical data and information on biodegradation are required the standard reach tools such as the european union system for the evaluation of substances euses 2 0 2003 can be used for such an assessment however it has to be noted that additional contributions to the release to the stp from other ivd activities taking place in the fictitious site and additional site connected to the same stp are not considered in the assessment this would need to be addressed separately further actions such as risk management measures are only required if the risk is confirmed after a more refined assessment as described above for the exposure scenarios and assessment tool to represent a reasonable worst case up to date information for default parameters and legal frameworks needs to be reflected in the tool therefore the parameters as reported in the present paper will be updated in the event of significant changes in reference or limit values or legal frameworks or significant changes based on the further development of ivd equipment and assays including the addition of further substances that are identified as relevant based on the composition of typical reagents furthermore it is planned to include limit values for release into the sewer system for other countries for example the us the developed screening tool is implemented as a microsoft excel file and is available free of charge upon request for at least one year after the publication date 4 conclusions the presented exposure scenarios and tool permit an assessment to determine whether the liquid waste can be released into wastewater and whether such release would result in a risk to surface water unlike a typical first tier model used for the purpose of risk assessment for instance the european union system for the evaluation of substances euses 2 0 2003 where the calculation is based on the total amount of a chemical substance used in the reagents in all in vitro diagnostics assays per site and pre defined environmental release categories using default release factors as a starting point the presented model is based on reasonable worst case substance concentrations obtained by chemical analysis of representative liquid waste samples and reflects site specific use conditions the screening tool therefore corresponds to a second tier model for the estimation of the release before the sewage treatment plant further the screening tool assumes as a worst case that no removal of the substance takes place in the sewage treatment plant positioning it between a first and a second tier model the model was applied to two examples of fictitious but representative hospitals with the same site specific uses located in countries with different local legal requirements i e germany and switzerland to allow the comparison the results of the assessment showed that in both cases the release of liquid waste to the wastewater may not be possible due to specific substances further assessment refinement would be required to confirm whether disposal as waste is needed on the other hand no risk was identified for the stp and surface waters with the default input parameters available in the screening tool as shown with the examples the presented exposure scenarios facilitate a screening assessment of liquid waste from ivd instruments based on reasonable worst case default parameters without the need for comprehensive site specific information on the hospital and or laboratories it allows specific parameters to be adjusted as well as adaptations in line with different local requirements for a refined assessment it aims to support ivd developers and users to make informed decisions on the substances to be looked at in priority when designing new ivd devices and on how to handle liquid waste from ivd instruments in agreement with the requirements of the new

following combined catalysis and biodegradation treatment trains for mixtures of 1 4 dioxane and chlorinated volatile organic compounds cvocs in laboratory microcosms although a few specific bacterial taxa are capable of removing 1 4 dioxane and individual cvocs many microorganisms are inhibited when these contaminants are present in mixtures chemical catalysis by tungstated zirconia wox zro2 and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 as a non selective treatment was designed to achieve nearly 20 1 4 dioxane and over 60 trichloroethene and 50 dichloroethene removals post catalysis bioaugmentation with 1 4 dioxane metabolizing bacterial strain pseudonocardia dioxanivorans cb1190 removed the remaining 1 4 dioxane the evolution of the microbial community under different conditions was time dependent but relatively independent of the concentrations of contaminants the compositions of microbiomes tended to be similar regardless of complex contaminant mixtures during the biodegradation phase indicating a r k strategy transition attributed to the shock experienced during catalysis and the subsequent incubation the originally dominant genera pseudomonas and ralstonia were sensitive to catalytic oxidation and were overwhelmed by sphingomonas rhodococcus and other catalyst tolerant microbes but microbes capable of biodegradation of organics thrived during the incubation methane metabolism chloroalkane and chloroalkene degradation pathways appeared to be responsible for cvoc degradation based on the identifications of haloacetate dehalogenases 2 haloacid dehalogenases and cytochrome p450 family network analysis highlighted the potential interspecies competition or commensalism and dynamics of microbiomes during the biodegradation phase that were in line with shifting predominant genera confirming the deterministic processes guiding the microbial assembly collectively this study demonstrated that catalysis followed by bioaugmentation is an effective treatment for 1 4 dioxane in the presence of high cvoc concentrations and it enhanced our understanding of microbial ecological impacts resulting from abiotic biological treatment trains these results will be valuable for predicting treatment synergies that lead to cost savings and improve remedial outcomes in short term active remediation as well as long term changes to the environmental microbial communities

many alternatives for the remediation of sites with complex soil and groundwater contaminations to date oxidative catalytic miao et al 2018a oxidative biological xu et al 2016 wang et al 2017 medina et al 2018 miao et al 2019 electrochemical biological lobo et al 2014 jasmann et al 2017 and plasma biological xiong et al 2019 treatment strategies have been studied in soil and groundwater contaminations however given the broad physicochemical properties of contaminant mixtures and microbial communities across different sites applying general decontamination methods to achieve cost effective remediation management becomes very challenging this problem is especially difficult when attempting to include bioremediation steps that generally rely on a recovery in the functionality of the soil and groundwater microbial community for optimal performance 1 4 dioxane is a carcinogen and a chemical by product in various industrial processes and enters groundwater or soil through accidental release improper storage and disposal practices or ineffective removal with conventional wastewater treatment gedalanga et al 2016 mohr et al 2016 suthersan et al 2016 jasmann et al 2017 because of the heterocyclic structure of the molecule with four ether bonds 1 4 dioxane is considered relatively recalcitrant in subsurface environments and natural attenuation has only been reported in two aquifers adamson et al 2015 li et al 2015b and a former landfill site gedalanga et al 2016 even though several laboratory based studies have established aerobic biodegradation of 1 4 dioxane zhang et al 2017 moreover due to its extensive use as a solvent stabilizer of chlorinated vapor degreasers in various industries 1 4 dioxane contamination is often reported to co occur with chlorinated volatile organic compounds cvocs at contaminated groundwater sites which increases the difficulty of remediation adamson et al 2014 because cvocs have been reported to inhibit bacterial growth rates reduce membrane permeability and damage nucleic acids segura et al 2012 the properties of soil and groundwater with comingled 1 4 dioxane and cvoc plumes pose unique challenges to engineered 1 4 dioxane remediation processes due to scale lobo et al 2014 cost choi et al 2017 and energy xiong et al 2019 limitations of chemical oxidation technologies and negative impacts of cvocs on microorganisms that can perform bioremediation zhang et al 2016 zhao et al 2018 the treatment of 1 4 dioxane and cvoc mixtures requires combined technologies jasmann et al 2017 used electrochemical oxidation with ti iro2 ta2o5 mesh electrodes and bioaugmentation to achieve significant reductions in 1 4 dioxane in a lab scale study similarly application of heterogeneous catalysts for the treatment of 1 4 dioxane and cvocs is a growing field of study heck et al 2019 with the benefits of shorter reaction times and lower chemical oxygen demands choi et al 2017 as well as reduced energy requirements and higher efficiencies yang et al 2015 catalytic oxidation processes have previously been demonstrated to effectively mineralize 1 4 dioxane to carbon dioxide without by products by oh and pt ceo2 zro2 sno2 sba 16 catalyst choi et al 2017 additionally metal oxide catalysts such as ceo2 based transition metal oxides could oxidize cvocs with improved stability of the active components yang et al 2015 tungstated zirconia wox zro2 has improved activity and higher stability than previously studied catalysts soultanidis et al 2010 and has been used to treat 1 4 dioxane with hydrogen peroxide h2o2 by generating superoxide species on its surface and reacting with 1 4 dioxane co adsorbed to lewis acidic sites heck et al 2019 although more efficient h2o2 use and higher 1 4 dioxane degradation activities were achieved the performance of wox zro2 under cvocs stress as well as its further impacts on biodegradation are still unknown in the present study a novel synergistic catalysis biodegradation treatment train was considered to target 1 4 dioxane and cvocs mixtures with the expectation that wox zro2 can degrade 1 4 dioxane and cvocs simultaneously benefiting the subsequent biodegradation phase the post catalysis bioaugmentation was also conducted to determine if specific 1 4 dioxane metabolizing bacteria could increase degradation kinetics compared to indigenous microorganisms bacterial community structure has been suggested as one of the critical indicators for the long term stabilization of subsurface ecosystems during in situ bioremediation but few studies have focused on monitoring and assessing microbial dynamics during demonstration of 1 4 dioxane and or cvocs degradation catalytic oxidation may change the levels of 1 4 dioxane and cvocs create transformation products of different toxicity li et al 2018b and cause shifts in the redox conditions which can alter the bacterial community due to their differential sensitivities chao et al 2016 in addition restructuring of the bacterial community in the biodegradation phase after chemical reactions may also occur miao et al 2019 as different species may be more tolerant to changing conditions that can influence the efficacy of biodegradation low decarie et al 2015 thus assessing compositions and functions of soil microbes that are subjected to catalytic oxidation may be critically important to evaluate engineered treatment trains additionally predicting community evolution under specific conditions based on models metcalf et al 2016 and interactions among microbial taxa based on network analysis has been neglected thus far ju et al 2017 with the aim of filling the technological and analytical gaps described above this study evaluated a catalysis biodegradation treatment train in laboratory microcosms constructed using contaminated soil and groundwater with the objectives to 1 analyze the diversity and identify key microbes in different conditions or treatment phases 2 explore microbial functions co occurrence and co exclusion patterns among microbial taxa and 3 track the overall microbial dynamic trends under different conditions through the biodegradation process by addressing these questions this study aimed to validate a proposed novel engineered 1 4 dioxane remediation technology and provide comprehensive insights into molecular mechanisms to guide the application of in situ remediation management strategies 2 materials and methods 2 1 ex situ microcosm setup groundwater and soil were collected for laboratory studies from a contaminated location where large portions of the groundwater aquifer were naturally aerobic text s1 and table s1 microcosms were constructed using 50 ml of groundwater and 10 g of soil in sterile 250 ml boston round bottles fitted with caps containing mininert valves for repetitive sampling contaminant mixtures simulating high 7000 μg l or low 1000 μg l concentrations of 1 4 dioxane and cvocs were spiked into microcosms table s2 these two levels were selected because they represent a low to moderate concentration and a high concentration respectively using typical contaminated groundwater plume concentration ranges for 1 4 dioxane and cvocs described in adamson et al 2015 the following naturally simulated conditions tested high 1 4 dioxane with high cvocs h h high 1 4 dioxane with low cvocs h l low 1 4 dioxane with low cvocs l l and low 1 4 dioxane only l dx the bioaugmentation condition bioaug was set up in individual microcosms starting with concentrations as h l and spiked with a 1 4 dioxane metabolizing bacterium pseudonocardia dioxanivorans strain cb1190 cb1190 mahendra and alvarez cohen 2005 containing 45 ml of groundwater 5 ml seed bacterial culture and 10 g soil each of the above conditions was conducted in triplicate microcosms 2 2 combined catalysis biodegradation treatment train and samplings the doses of h2o2 and wox zro2 were first tested using scaled down versions of the microcosms 10 ml groundwater and 2 g soil table s3 and expected 20 degradation of 1 4 dioxane was observed under a catalyst dose of 8 gcat l and h2o2 dose of 310 mm the microcosms were first established with different concentrations of 1 4 dioxane and cvocs then 400 mg of wox zro2 catalyst 20 wox w w was added along with 1600 μl 30 w w h2o2 in each bottle and stirred for 24 h complete h2o2 degradation was confirmed by centrifuging 0 5 ml of the solution then titrating with tioso4 and measuring any absorbance at 405 nm via uv vis heck et al 2019 samples consisting of 500 μl slurry were collected before cb0 and after cb1 the catalysis phase these samples were split for 1 4 dioxane analysis 200 μl text s2 and total nucleic acids extraction 300 μl afterward the same microcosm bottles were continuously incubated at 30 c and shaken at 150 rpm for 17 weeks to represent the biodegradation phase samples were collected at the middle day 63 cb2 and the end day 119 cb3 of the biodegradation phase for the bioaugmentation condition cb1190 was added at day 63 before the cb2 sampling table s4 cvocs were sampled before and after catalysis and after biodegradation by direct headspace analytical method described in text s2 2 3 dna extraction and quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr the dna extraction was performed by using the commercial kit fastdna mp biomedicals san diego usa based on the manufacturer s protocols and the triplicate dna belonging to the same condition were mixed for future qpcr and sequencing steps a set of genes encoding 1 4 dioxane degradation enzymes dioxane monooxygenase encoded by dxmb and aldehyde dehydrogenase encoded by aldh gedalanga et al 2014 were quantified on a steponeplus thermocycler life technologies carlsbad usa with 20 μl reactions including 2 luminaris color higreen hirox qpcr master mix thermofisher waltham usa and specific primers table s5 and text s3 2 4 illumina miseq sequencing and data preprocessing the experimental triplicate mixed dna of each sample was used for 16s rrna gene amplification targeting the v3 v4 hypervariable regions following primer sets and reaction conditions in klindworth et al 2013 each sample was amplified in duplicates then the amplicons were purified and inserted with adapter and barcode based on dual index strategy before pooling together and sequenced on illumina miseq platform pe300 laragen inc culver city usa all generated 16s rrna reads were preprocessed in mothur v 1 39 5 following a methodology from previous studies miao et al 2018a miao et al 2019 briefly pair end reads were assembled to de multiplex and produce high quality reads at least 400 bp without any ambiguous bases with removing chimera chloroplast mitochondria unknown archaea eukaryota reads all denoised samples were normalized to the same depth of 16 000 reads and clustered into 2065 otus 97 similarity containing at least 5 sequences then otus were classified against the silva database the α diversity shannon ace chao observed species and β diversity bray curtis unifrac distances were calculated for all samples based on mothur and r package phyloseq mcmurdie and holmes 2013 principal coordinates analysis pcoa was conducted to compare similarities among samples based on phylogenetic information ju et al 2017 with r package phyloseq mcmurdie and holmes 2013 samples grouped in time or contaminants variables were fitted onto the ordination analysis using the envfit function of the vegan package the linear discriminant analysis lda effect size lefse method was used to determine the taxa that were most likely to explain differences of microbial communities among groups contaminant conditions or treatment processes by using pre built python script with non parametric factorial kruskal wallis sum rank test and unpaired wilcoxon rank sum test segata et al 2011 and the determining taxon was defined as the representative biomarker of the specific group miao et al 2018a 2 5 predictive functions the microbial functions were predicted by using tax4fun aβhauer et al 2015 based on generated otus table and otus taxonomy with r package tax4fun pathways and functions related to 1 4 dioxane and cvocs degradation in kegg ortholog were searched and picked manually with enzyme commission ec number 2 6 network and correlation analysis based on the otus table and predicted kegg functional profiles correlations were constructed to focus on the potential correlations of species species and genus function otus only occurring in at least 50 of samples with average abundance over 0 1 ju et al 2017 li et al 2018a as well as picked pathways or genes of interest were selected to calculate all pairwise spearman s ranks ju and zhang 2015 a generated correlation between two items was regarded as statistically significant for spearman s correlation coefficient ρ 0 8 or 0 8 and p value 0 01 then p values were further adjusted based on the benjamini hochberg method benjamini and hochberg 1995 to control the false discovery rate fdr the correlations were calculated and adjusted with r packages hmisc and psych and then were visualized and explored by gephi v 0 9 0 bastian et al 2009 2 7 random forests rf regression models supervised regression model based on machine learning is a powerful tool to explore the patterns in complicated datasets and can manifest community development over the course of time 1 4 dioxane and cvocs prediction models were constructed by the random forest rf regression metcalf et al 2016 belk et al 2018 as a function of the changing microbiomes four sampling points were categorized by numbers cb0 day 0 cb1 day 1 cb2 day 63 and cb3 day 119 and trained in a numerical model replicate samples were pooled together to train the regression model and 10 fold cross validation was performed to tune and evaluate the models metcalf et al 2016 then randomly picked samples were predicted by built models the accuracy of models is measured as r2 and mean absolute error mae belk et al 2018 the modeling results were compiled and graphics were generated in r environments following previous work belk et al 2018 3 results 3 1 catalysis biological treatment and biomarker analysis the 24 h catalysis phase removed 20 1 4 dioxane under all conditions as expected fig 1 meanwhile over 60 tce and 50 dce were also removed fig 1 table s6 even though the h2o2 was completely consumed in the catalysis phase 1 4 dioxane concentrations decreased continuously in the first two weeks of incubation the degradation rates were 49 37 19 and 23 μg l day under h h h l l and l dx conditions respectively significant 1 4 dioxane degradation was found with lower cvoc concentrations p value 0 05 paired t test but without apparent decreasing trends after 17 weeks 119 days however tce and cis 1 2 dce were removed to below detection limits and 1 1 dce was only present under the h h condition after biodegradation the bioaug condition showed 1 4 dioxane removal after cb1190 was added at day 63 where 1 4 dioxane started to drop from 5000 μg l to 1000 μg l in four weeks and slowly declined to below 4 μg l the dxmb gene was not detected in naturally simulated conditions while aldh gene was detected below 100 copies ml fig s1 both dxmb and aldh gene abundances increased under bioaug condition from day 63 to day 91 and remained stable afterward with aldh showing higher abundances than dxmb 3 2 microbial community dynamics during the treatment train five parallel treatment trains were monitored at four time points each and the unifrac distance including membership unweighted fig 2 a and abundance weighted fig 2b shown on pcoa displayed more differences with respect to incubation time fig 2 color coded than among conditions fig 2 shape coded this was also consistent with envfit analysis that only time variables showed significant influences on both membership r2 0 89 p value 0 001 and abundance r2 0 80 p value 0 001 the original cb0 yellow and post catalysis cb1 green microbes distributed separately and microbes were more proximal cb2 red to cb3 brown than that from cb1 green to cb2 red demonstrating the relatively stronger shift of the microbial community right after the catalysis while contaminants only differentiated microbial compositions at specific time point when compared without phylogenetic information all naturally simulated conditions were adjacent in the second biodegradation stage based on bray curtis distances fig s2 inoculation of cb1190 under the bioaug condition dominated the microbial community and compressed the relative abundances of other microbes because of the high abundance while the microbial memberships were similar to other conditions moreover lefse analysis using the kruskall wallis test identified representative microbial taxa among different treatment phases times fig s3 but no representative taxa were determined when analyzed by different simulated conditions contaminants 3 3 temporal and conditional distributions of bacteria the microbial community under the bioaug condition was changed due to the influence of cb1190 added at day 63 after bioaugmentation cb1190 occupied 20 16 of the microbial community but dropped to 17 18 by the end of the biodegradation phase fig 3 with decreasing 1 4 dioxane under the naturally simulated conditions pseudomonas ralstonia and perlucidibaca were the main genera before treatment and then reduced by the catalysis phase however pseudomonas was able to recover during the biodegradation phase eventually becoming dominant especially under the l dx only condition more genera such as sphingomonas rhodococcus lacibacter rhizobacter arenimonas aeromicrobium and mesorhizobium thrived after the catalysis phase demonstrating their potential catalysis tolerances but then decreased by the end of the biodegradation phase ramlibacter and methylobacillus were found to accumulate under all conditions additionally the specific 1 4 dioxane and cvoc combinations promoted specific microbes e g both ohtaekwangia and rhodoplanes increased during biodegradation under both h h and l l conditions and both bradyrhizobium and acidovorax preferred higher 1 4 dioxane during the biodegradation phase the diversity and richness of the microbial community were stable after the catalysis phase but increased under all conditions during the first stage of biodegradation fig 3 interestingly the remaining 1 1 dce under the h h condition further reduced the richness during the second stage of biodegradation 3 4 predictive functional features of the bacterial community tax4fun was used in this study to find and identify a total of 6317 functional genes and 279 pathways based on kegg databases in non metric multidimensional scaling nmds of various distances methods both pathways and genes were only differentiated by the catalysis phase but mixed when compared with samples from later time points green in fig s4 the methane metabolism pathway was more abundant than the toluene degradation pathway as well as cvocs related pathways and their abundances were stable during the treatment process fig s5 the genes encoding haloalkane dehalogenase cytochrome p450 family 125 alkane 1 monooxygenase haloacetate dehalogenase and phenol 2 monooxygenase were abundant under the bioaug condition table s7 the relative abundances of methane monooxygenases were stable during the treatment train and toluene monooxygenases were dominated by proteins a and e both of which peaked in the first stage of biodegradation and reduced by the end while the general monooxygenase ec 1 14 13 abundance was only elevated under the bioaug condition due to the addition of cb1190 table s7 3 5 species species and genera functions associations the correlations between predicted functional features and the top 20 abundant genera under four naturally simulated conditions were used to show potential carriers of specific genes fig 4 the dominant pseudomonas correlated positively with genes encoding toluene and alkanal monooxygenases alpha and beta chains but negatively with cytochrome p450 families however sphingomonas rhodococcus and lacibacter were positively correlated with genes encoding cytochrome p450 families and negatively correlated with toluene and alkanal monooxygenases for cvoc related functional enzymes haloacetate and haloacid dehalogenases were positively correlated with ramlibacter methylobacillus bradyrhizobium and acidovorax while haloalkane dehalogenase was positively correlated with sphingomonas rhodococcus and methylobacillus additionally alkanal monooxygenases were only significantly positively correlated with pseudomonas and variovorax but tended to be negatively correlated with other genera while the dehalogenases were significantly and widely distributed in various microbes co occurrence and co exclusion were represented by positive and negative spearman s correlations respectively and the network among species otus only incorporated taxa under naturally simulated conditions in the biodegradation phase cb1 cb3 the strong ρ 0 8 and significant p value 0 01 positive correlations consisted of 112 nodes and 377 edges including 9 modules modularity 0 583 fig 5 d module iii viii and ix were isolated without any edges to other modules but occupied with different phyla fig 5a phylum proteobacteria mainly occupied module ii iv v and ix and shared modules ii iv v with actinobacteria and module vi with bacteroidetes the most abundant genus pseudomonas otu1 2 3 distributed in three modules ii v ix and mainly connected with ramlibacter otu9 15 acidovorax otu8 bradyrhizobium otu12 variibacter otu45 92 methylobacillus otu10 and rhizobium otu31 56 however sphingomonas otu14 18 35 48 64 145 rhodococcus otu5 and lacibacter otu7 were found co occurring in module iv and vi additionally acidovorax otu8 bradyrhizobium otu12 and variibacter otu45 92 were the densely connected nodes within module v while sphingomonas otu35 was the bridge between module iv and vi fig 5b furthermore the peak abundance of each otu was used to show the abundance trends among cb1 cb2 and cb3 the otus peaking at cb1 mainly distributed in module iv vi and vii while otus with peak abundance at cb2 and cb3 were mixed and spread in module ii and v indicating that the dominant species were closely related in the second stage of biodegradation fig 5c the negative strong ρ 0 8 and significant p value 0 01 correlations contained 56 nodes and 112 edges and were separated into 7 modules modularity 0 408 fig s6c genera pseudomonas otu1 and sphingomonas otu18 were in the same module ii and negatively connected indicating their potential competition that were also observed between pseudomonas otu1 and rhizobacter otu13 in module ii as well as sphingomonas otu35 and ramlibacter otu9 in module i besides sphingomonas otu35 also negatively connected with pseudarthrobacter otu6 in different modules fig s6b 3 6 predictions of microbial community using random forests the relative abundance of all otus were used to construct rf regression models that were utilized to predict the distributions of microbes during the treatment process and the ideal distribution should be on the diagonal where prediction days are equal to actual days when putting h h and h l conditions together as the training dataset and data in l l and l dx only conditions used as input r2 0 63 mae 20 82 the first two time points day 0 and 1 were beyond the diagonal and samples at day 63 and 119 were predicted below the diagonal fig 6 a a similar prediction r2 0 67 mae 19 27 was obtained after switching the training and testing datasets fig 6b however when only inputting bioaug samples into the naturally simulated model microbes were predicted to be consistent during the biodegradation phase showing the potential impacts and dominance of spiked cb1190 in the microbial community fig s7a the earlier stabilization of microbial community was also predicted by using model with naturally simulated data fig s7 4 discussion 1 4 dioxane and cvocs have been widely reported co contaminants in groundwater plumes at multiple contaminated sites adamson et al 2014 and the inhibitory impact of individual mixed cvocs on the biodegradation kinetics of 1 4 dioxane has also been studied zhang et al 2016 therefore catalytic oxidation was necessary to reduce co contaminant levels before biodegradation the wox zro2 h2o2 system used 310 mm h2o2 to achieve nearly 20 1 4 dioxane removals which was a larger dose than in the initial catalyst screening experiments 15 mm heck et al 2019 and the potential reason was likely due to the presence of many different species in the groundwater soil microcosms that poisoned catalytic sites or physically fouled the catalyst surface or blocked pores subsequently 1 4 dioxane continued to decrease even after the quenching of the 24 h catalytic oxidation indicating the potential photoactivity of wox zro2 cheng et al 2016 moreover superoxide radicals adsorbed on lewis acidic sites of catalysts could contribute to continuous 1 4 dioxane degradation heck et al 2019 similarly chlorinated compounds were also primarily degraded by oxidative radicals which was observed during electrochemical oxidation jasmann et al 2017 or by using so4 2 fe2o3 catalysts zhang et al 2018 and persulfate oxidation chang et al 2018 but this study is the first to demonstrate tce 1 1 dce and cis 1 2 dce catalysis by wox zro2 and h2o2 higher removal efficiency of tce than that of 1 4 dioxane was in line with the findings of eberle et al 2016 however the accumulated 1 1 dce in the microcosms at higher levels suggests that some combination of limited 1 1 dce catalytic degradation occurred furthermore tce and cis 1 2 dce were completely degraded during the biodegradation phase under all conditions indicating that aerobic bacteria removed these cvocs by utilizing dissolved oxygen from decomposed h2o2 li et al 2015a or potential photoactivity the increasing gene abundances of dxmb and aldh after the cb1190 spike corresponded to the metabolism of 1 4 dioxane and the higher aldh abundance indicated the availability of a diversity of carbon sources gedalanga et al 2014 however the non detection of biomarkers in naturally simulated microcosms indicates a lack of intrinsic 1 4 dioxane metabolizers and the potential intrinsic 1 4 dioxane co metabolizing bacteria could have been reduced and inhibited by catalysis the biodegradation of cvocs is likely related to the intermediates produced which acted as carbon sources to induce co metabolism of cvocs over 1 4 dioxane similar to that has been observed during the oxidation bioremediation of a diesel contaminated soil sutton et al 2014 the in depth microbial community analysis explored the behavior of microbial communities under different 1 4 dioxane and cvocs conditions over time the original dominant genera pseudomonas and ralstonia were described by sheu et al 2018 to biodegrade chlorinated compounds in soil however both of these were declined but were not completely eliminated by the catalysis phase due to their weak peroxide tolerances however the higher recovered abundance of pseudomonas during the biodegradation phase under the l dx only condition suggests that pseudomonas could consume the catalysis produced intermediates due to carrying alkanal monooxygenases alpha and beta chains but had weak cvoc tolerances sphingomonas replaced pseudomonas as the dominant genus after the catalysis phase which was reported to remain active even after 500 mg l h2o2 exposure dziga et al 2018 sphingomonas and rhodococcus hosts of cytochrome p450 families could also increase after chloropicrin fumigation in soil remediation and were utilized for the biodegradation of toxic environmental contaminants li et al 2017 however rhodococcus and variovorax were found to be abundant after the first 9 week stage of the biodegradation phase potentially due to their capabilities for co metabolizing cvocs sercu et al 2013 with different enzymes moreover ramlibacter and methylobacillus both of which belong to betaproteobacteria with many members that can degrade light hydrocarbons increased during the biodegradation phase and were identified in olive mill wastewaters kavroulakis and ntougias 2011 demonstrating potential consumption of catalytic transformation products overall besides the previously mentioned bacteria the microbes that were enriched after 17 weeks of incubation were generally more capable of utilizing catalysis produced and 1 4 dioxane cvoc biodegradation intermediates e g ohtaekwangia in hydrocarbon degradation ma et al 2015 acidovorax in carbon tetrachloride and trichloroethylene degradation kwon et al 2016 and bradyrhizobium in chlorinated compound remediation krzmarzick and novak 2014 showing strong potential for long term natural attenuation after engineered remediation even with the increasing absolute degradation gene abundances dxmb and aldh the relative abundance of cb1190 decreased during the second stage of biodegradation attributed to the potentially weak competition capability with other native microbes miao et al 2019 the stable biodiversity after catalytic oxidation was inconsistent with previous work in that species richness and diversity dramatically declined after aops medina et al 2018 which could be attributed to the lower oxidation potentials of wox zro2 generated superoxide radicals heck et al 2019 on the other hand h2o2 might selectively impact the microbes that were the most abundant in the original microbial community pseudomonas allowing the tolerant species to survive and increase in abundance to the point of detection resulting in the compensation of microbial diversity miao et al 2018b this was identified by the decline of previously dominant genus pseudomonas 40 whose relative abundance was distributed into other representative microbes after catalysis based on lefse analysis the continuously increasing biodiversity in the first stage of biodegradation can be attributed to the generation of catalytic byproducts with enhanced solubility and biodegradability zhu et al 2015 as well as reduced toxicity carboneras et al 2018 that could better support microbial growth the remaining cvocs or degradation products under h h conditions inhibited microbial richness and diversity during the second stage of biodegradation and liu et al 2018 also observed decreasing diversity in vinyl chloride enriched groundwater and zhang et al 2016 reported the 1 1 dce as the strongest known inhibitor with respect to 1 4 dioxane biodegradation tardy et al 2014 suggested that biodiversity might increase with available soil resources and enhanced functional and structural stability explaining the cvocs removals under h h h l and l l conditions overall the biodiversity under each condition was enhanced after the whole treatment train leading to a more stable microbial ecosystem in the soil for long term resistance to future contaminant shocks the predicted functions were not separated over time except for the catalysis phase and this was described as the functional redundancy that increased functional stability vanwonterghem et al 2014 reflected on the stable abundances of pathways the significant correlations between dehalogenases and multiple genera indicated the presence of widespread cvoc degradation potential as well as the presence of phylogenetically distinct microbes that were able to fulfill the same functional group li et al 2018a the high abundance of methane metabolism and methane monooxygenases could be attributed to ubiquitous methane oxidizing bacteria e g proteobacteria and catalytic oxidation improved bioavailability and oxygen content chen et al 2018 although 1 4 dioxane can be degraded by many monooxygenase containing bacteria mahendra and alvarez cohen 2006 mahendra et al 2007 mesophilic methanotrophs which are also known for co metabolic oxidation of halogenated compounds weigold et al 2016 were reported to rapidly oxidize tce but not 1 4 dioxane during natural attenuation or enhanced biodegradation hatzinger et al 2017 the increasing abundance of chloroalkane and chloroalkene degradation in cvoc containing conditions indicates a potential pathway for cvoc degradation which has been previously identified as abundant in pce tce contaminated groundwater kao et al 2016 and chlorinated hydrocarbon contaminated sites kappell et al 2014 specifically high abundances of haloalkane haloacetate and 2 haloacid dehalogenases could correspond to the existence of cvocs weigold et al 2016 and potential oxidative intermediate haloacetic acids from tce chang et al 2018 the stable abundances of methane and toluene monooxygenases had no improvement on 1 4 dioxane removals likely due to the impacts of cvocs on monooxygenase driven degradation zhang et al 2016 or selection of monooxygenases unable to mediate 1 4 dioxane degradation mahendra and alvarez cohen 2006 although specific microbes changed among different conditions a common temporal succession pattern in microbial assembly including memberships and abundances was shared across conditions indicating the population dynamics in the complex community were mainly synchronized over time vanwonterghem et al 2014 which is consistent with ju et al 2017 where shifts in the microbial community present in an anaerobic biogas digestor were more dependent on operating time rather than physiochemical and operational parameters this niche based e g nutrient substrate availability environmental selection biological competition deterministic temporal succession is supported by the pcoa and nmds analyses that showed that microbes were temporally clustered jiao et al 2017b in addition the lefse analysis could only pick up changes in representative microbes among phases instead of among conditions the initial catalysis phase removed contaminants to different levels and microbes were separately clustered cb0 vs cb1 depicting the catalysis impact on microbial deterministic succession shi et al 2018 also found the deterministic process in places with distinct environments that contained a few interchangeable bacteria in the following first stage of the biodegradation phase microbes were separated because of the access to the remaining oxidative products while community compositions approached each other in similarity during the second stage indicating the slow succession that could be attributed to decreasing availability of carbon sources which has also been observed in microbial communities after heat disturbance jurburg et al 2017 moreover the l dx only condition exhibited the most dissimilar community post treatment train indicating that cvocs can play minor roles in determining and differentiating the individual microbial progress just within the deterministic process vanwonterghem et al 2014 indicated that even if microbial communities had minor differences at the specific time point the communities as a whole would still follow similar trajectories and jiao et al 2017b observed similar dynamic patterns of microbial communities induced by individual or mixed contaminants furthermore the microbes from cb1 to cb2 were dominated by r strategists fast unstable competitive condition that led to relatively faster succession because of the shocks caused by the photoactivity of the remaining wox zro2 after this stage the increasing stability indicated by higher biodiversity and slower deviations between microbial communities indicated that the microcosms were occupied by k strategists slow stable same condition jurburg et al 2017 from cb2 to cb3 the gradual shift from r to k strategists along successional gradients has recently been shown for microbes in mercury tardy et al 2014 and hydrocarbon contaminated soils medina et al 2018 additionally the predictions from rf models also support the deterministic succession that the more similar distributions at day 63 and 119 indicates slower succession compared to the first stage of succession the predicted microbes under the bioaug condition were stable from day 63 119 showing the potential impacts and dominance of spiked cb1190 in the microbial community and jiao et al 2017a reported that temporal microbial turnovers were mainly controlled by abundant bacteria which was mainly driven by deterministic processes all models showing the similar prediction trends confirms the earlier stabilization in the microbial community the earlier stabilization also indicated the self recovery of microbial community as well as the recovery of soil properties and ecosystem moreover nearly identical community composition suggests a return to similar initial soil conditions after remediation process when considering taxonomy and functions together the dominant taxa might contribute primary functions in the community while the rare minor microbes could act as a source of functional diversity jiao et al 2017a pseudomonas the dominant genus that rebounded during the biodegradation phase was observed to co occur with a diversity of minor community members which is consistent with flower microbiota where the most prominent microbe co occur with minor members shade et al 2013 this inter genera co occurrence could be attributed to microbial interactions e g commensalism or mutualism ju and zhang 2015 moreover the minor microbes e g bradyrhizobium and variibacter also appear to be crucial in the co occurring network by constructing connections among genotype specific microbes a pattern that has also been observed in lettuce root microbiota cardinale et al 2015 sphingomonas rhodococcus and lacibacter were phylogenetically distinct but positively correlated in networks and identified catalytic tolerant in relative abundances as determined by their functional relevance cardinale et al 2015 and confirmed by carrying dehalogenases and cytochrome p450 simultaneously thelusmond et al 2016 also reported that sphingomonas and rhodobacteraceae were linked to carbamazepine degradation and might result from their sharing the similar niches e g environmental conditions similar to what has been observed at a uranium contaminated site li et al 2018a furthermore pseudomonas otu1 sphingomonas otu18 and pseudomonas otu1 rhizobacter otu13 were co exclusive with each other and inter taxa co exclusion were prevalent in taxonomically distinct species ju and zhang 2015 the predicted functional feature showed that pseudomonas toluene monooxygenase carried different genes from sphingomonas cytochrome p450 and rhizobacter methane monooxygenase respectively suggesting that the hosts might not carry toluene and alkanal monooxygenases with cytochrome p450 simultaneously however these enzymes were functionally equivariant and fierce competition would occur among these microbes for limited nutrients carbon substrates e g 1 4 dioxane cvocs and intermediates in this study or other factors ju and zhang 2015 the network analysis also supports the observed deterministic process that ecological niches bacterial interactions microbial competitions and substrate availabilities etc could guide the community assembly and dynamics vanwonterghem et al 2014 additionally the microbial turnovers peaked abundances along with time from module iii v vi to modules i and iv in the co occurrence networks highlights the role of interspecies competition for resources in intensifying community dynamics these shifts have also been observed in anaerobic biogas digesters ju et al 2017 and heat disturbed soil jurburg et al 2017 the 1 4 dioxane and the cvoc mediated deterministic process could also be related to high biodiversity both of which corresponded to the microbial stability and high cvocs removals 5 conclusions in laboratory microcosm treatment trains pre exposure to catalytic oxidation enhanced 1 4 dioxane biodegradation by cb1190 and triggered cvocs biodegradation by intrinsic microbes a more stable microbial community was achieved under all conditions after the treatment train containing a higher biodiversity of microbes with xenobiotic biodegradation capabilities the potential functional redundancy found that monooxygenases remained constant during the biodegradation phase while enzymes related to chloroalkane and chloroalkene degradation increased and this pattern corresponded to increasing cvoc removals the microbial assembly was guided following deterministic temporal succession even under different contamination conditions which was supported by the pcoa analysis random forests models and network analysis this study s findings of novel insights into the ecological mechanisms underlying the degradation of 1 4 dioxane and cvocs will be valuable for selecting remediation strategies for other contaminant mixtures declaration of

following combined catalysis and biodegradation treatment trains for mixtures of 1 4 dioxane and chlorinated volatile organic compounds cvocs in laboratory microcosms although a few specific bacterial taxa are capable of removing 1 4 dioxane and individual cvocs many microorganisms are inhibited when these contaminants are present in mixtures chemical catalysis by tungstated zirconia wox zro2 and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 as a non selective treatment was designed to achieve nearly 20 1 4 dioxane and over 60 trichloroethene and 50 dichloroethene removals post catalysis bioaugmentation with 1 4 dioxane metabolizing bacterial strain pseudonocardia dioxanivorans cb1190 removed the remaining 1 4 dioxane the evolution of the microbial community under different conditions was time dependent but relatively independent of the concentrations of contaminants the compositions of microbiomes tended to be similar regardless of complex contaminant mixtures during the biodegradation phase indicating a r k strategy transition attributed to the shock experienced during catalysis and the subsequent incubation the originally dominant genera pseudomonas and ralstonia were sensitive to catalytic oxidation and were overwhelmed by sphingomonas rhodococcus and other catalyst tolerant microbes but microbes capable of biodegradation of organics thrived during the incubation methane metabolism chloroalkane and chloroalkene degradation pathways appeared to be responsible for cvoc degradation based on the identifications of haloacetate dehalogenases 2 haloacid dehalogenases and cytochrome p450 family network analysis highlighted the potential interspecies competition or commensalism and dynamics of microbiomes during the biodegradation phase that were in line with shifting predominant genera confirming the deterministic processes guiding the microbial assembly collectively this study demonstrated that catalysis followed by bioaugmentation is an effective treatment for 1 4 dioxane in the presence of high cvoc concentrations and it enhanced our understanding of microbial ecological impacts resulting from abiotic biological treatment trains these results will be valuable for predicting treatment synergies that lead to cost savings and improve remedial outcomes in short term active remediation as well as long term changes to the environmental microbial communities

many alternatives for the remediation of sites with complex soil and groundwater contaminations to date oxidative catalytic miao et al 2018a oxidative biological xu et al 2016 wang et al 2017 medina et al 2018 miao et al 2019 electrochemical biological lobo et al 2014 jasmann et al 2017 and plasma biological xiong et al 2019 treatment strategies have been studied in soil and groundwater contaminations however given the broad physicochemical properties of contaminant mixtures and microbial communities across different sites applying general decontamination methods to achieve cost effective remediation management becomes very challenging this problem is especially difficult when attempting to include bioremediation steps that generally rely on a recovery in the functionality of the soil and groundwater microbial community for optimal performance 1 4 dioxane is a carcinogen and a chemical by product in various industrial processes and enters groundwater or soil through accidental release improper storage and disposal practices or ineffective removal with conventional wastewater treatment gedalanga et al 2016 mohr et al 2016 suthersan et al 2016 jasmann et al 2017 because of the heterocyclic structure of the molecule with four ether bonds 1 4 dioxane is considered relatively recalcitrant in subsurface environments and natural attenuation has only been reported in two aquifers adamson et al 2015 li et al 2015b and a former landfill site gedalanga et al 2016 even though several laboratory based studies have established aerobic biodegradation of 1 4 dioxane zhang et al 2017 moreover due to its extensive use as a solvent stabilizer of chlorinated vapor degreasers in various industries 1 4 dioxane contamination is often reported to co occur with chlorinated volatile organic compounds cvocs at contaminated groundwater sites which increases the difficulty of remediation adamson et al 2014 because cvocs have been reported to inhibit bacterial growth rates reduce membrane permeability and damage nucleic acids segura et al 2012 the properties of soil and groundwater with comingled 1 4 dioxane and cvoc plumes pose unique challenges to engineered 1 4 dioxane remediation processes due to scale lobo et al 2014 cost choi et al 2017 and energy xiong et al 2019 limitations of chemical oxidation technologies and negative impacts of cvocs on microorganisms that can perform bioremediation zhang et al 2016 zhao et al 2018 the treatment of 1 4 dioxane and cvoc mixtures requires combined technologies jasmann et al 2017 used electrochemical oxidation with ti iro2 ta2o5 mesh electrodes and bioaugmentation to achieve significant reductions in 1 4 dioxane in a lab scale study similarly application of heterogeneous catalysts for the treatment of 1 4 dioxane and cvocs is a growing field of study heck et al 2019 with the benefits of shorter reaction times and lower chemical oxygen demands choi et al 2017 as well as reduced energy requirements and higher efficiencies yang et al 2015 catalytic oxidation processes have previously been demonstrated to effectively mineralize 1 4 dioxane to carbon dioxide without by products by oh and pt ceo2 zro2 sno2 sba 16 catalyst choi et al 2017 additionally metal oxide catalysts such as ceo2 based transition metal oxides could oxidize cvocs with improved stability of the active components yang et al 2015 tungstated zirconia wox zro2 has improved activity and higher stability than previously studied catalysts soultanidis et al 2010 and has been used to treat 1 4 dioxane with hydrogen peroxide h2o2 by generating superoxide species on its surface and reacting with 1 4 dioxane co adsorbed to lewis acidic sites heck et al 2019 although more efficient h2o2 use and higher 1 4 dioxane degradation activities were achieved the performance of wox zro2 under cvocs stress as well as its further impacts on biodegradation are still unknown in the present study a novel synergistic catalysis biodegradation treatment train was considered to target 1 4 dioxane and cvocs mixtures with the expectation that wox zro2 can degrade 1 4 dioxane and cvocs simultaneously benefiting the subsequent biodegradation phase the post catalysis bioaugmentation was also conducted to determine if specific 1 4 dioxane metabolizing bacteria could increase degradation kinetics compared to indigenous microorganisms bacterial community structure has been suggested as one of the critical indicators for the long term stabilization of subsurface ecosystems during in situ bioremediation but few studies have focused on monitoring and assessing microbial dynamics during demonstration of 1 4 dioxane and or cvocs degradation catalytic oxidation may change the levels of 1 4 dioxane and cvocs create transformation products of different toxicity li et al 2018b and cause shifts in the redox conditions which can alter the bacterial community due to their differential sensitivities chao et al 2016 in addition restructuring of the bacterial community in the biodegradation phase after chemical reactions may also occur miao et al 2019 as different species may be more tolerant to changing conditions that can influence the efficacy of biodegradation low decarie et al 2015 thus assessing compositions and functions of soil microbes that are subjected to catalytic oxidation may be critically important to evaluate engineered treatment trains additionally predicting community evolution under specific conditions based on models metcalf et al 2016 and interactions among microbial taxa based on network analysis has been neglected thus far ju et al 2017 with the aim of filling the technological and analytical gaps described above this study evaluated a catalysis biodegradation treatment train in laboratory microcosms constructed using contaminated soil and groundwater with the objectives to 1 analyze the diversity and identify key microbes in different conditions or treatment phases 2 explore microbial functions co occurrence and co exclusion patterns among microbial taxa and 3 track the overall microbial dynamic trends under different conditions through the biodegradation process by addressing these questions this study aimed to validate a proposed novel engineered 1 4 dioxane remediation technology and provide comprehensive insights into molecular mechanisms to guide the application of in situ remediation management strategies 2 materials and methods 2 1 ex situ microcosm setup groundwater and soil were collected for laboratory studies from a contaminated location where large portions of the groundwater aquifer were naturally aerobic text s1 and table s1 microcosms were constructed using 50 ml of groundwater and 10 g of soil in sterile 250 ml boston round bottles fitted with caps containing mininert valves for repetitive sampling contaminant mixtures simulating high 7000 μg l or low 1000 μg l concentrations of 1 4 dioxane and cvocs were spiked into microcosms table s2 these two levels were selected because they represent a low to moderate concentration and a high concentration respectively using typical contaminated groundwater plume concentration ranges for 1 4 dioxane and cvocs described in adamson et al 2015 the following naturally simulated conditions tested high 1 4 dioxane with high cvocs h h high 1 4 dioxane with low cvocs h l low 1 4 dioxane with low cvocs l l and low 1 4 dioxane only l dx the bioaugmentation condition bioaug was set up in individual microcosms starting with concentrations as h l and spiked with a 1 4 dioxane metabolizing bacterium pseudonocardia dioxanivorans strain cb1190 cb1190 mahendra and alvarez cohen 2005 containing 45 ml of groundwater 5 ml seed bacterial culture and 10 g soil each of the above conditions was conducted in triplicate microcosms 2 2 combined catalysis biodegradation treatment train and samplings the doses of h2o2 and wox zro2 were first tested using scaled down versions of the microcosms 10 ml groundwater and 2 g soil table s3 and expected 20 degradation of 1 4 dioxane was observed under a catalyst dose of 8 gcat l and h2o2 dose of 310 mm the microcosms were first established with different concentrations of 1 4 dioxane and cvocs then 400 mg of wox zro2 catalyst 20 wox w w was added along with 1600 μl 30 w w h2o2 in each bottle and stirred for 24 h complete h2o2 degradation was confirmed by centrifuging 0 5 ml of the solution then titrating with tioso4 and measuring any absorbance at 405 nm via uv vis heck et al 2019 samples consisting of 500 μl slurry were collected before cb0 and after cb1 the catalysis phase these samples were split for 1 4 dioxane analysis 200 μl text s2 and total nucleic acids extraction 300 μl afterward the same microcosm bottles were continuously incubated at 30 c and shaken at 150 rpm for 17 weeks to represent the biodegradation phase samples were collected at the middle day 63 cb2 and the end day 119 cb3 of the biodegradation phase for the bioaugmentation condition cb1190 was added at day 63 before the cb2 sampling table s4 cvocs were sampled before and after catalysis and after biodegradation by direct headspace analytical method described in text s2 2 3 dna extraction and quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr the dna extraction was performed by using the commercial kit fastdna mp biomedicals san diego usa based on the manufacturer s protocols and the triplicate dna belonging to the same condition were mixed for future qpcr and sequencing steps a set of genes encoding 1 4 dioxane degradation enzymes dioxane monooxygenase encoded by dxmb and aldehyde dehydrogenase encoded by aldh gedalanga et al 2014 were quantified on a steponeplus thermocycler life technologies carlsbad usa with 20 μl reactions including 2 luminaris color higreen hirox qpcr master mix thermofisher waltham usa and specific primers table s5 and text s3 2 4 illumina miseq sequencing and data preprocessing the experimental triplicate mixed dna of each sample was used for 16s rrna gene amplification targeting the v3 v4 hypervariable regions following primer sets and reaction conditions in klindworth et al 2013 each sample was amplified in duplicates then the amplicons were purified and inserted with adapter and barcode based on dual index strategy before pooling together and sequenced on illumina miseq platform pe300 laragen inc culver city usa all generated 16s rrna reads were preprocessed in mothur v 1 39 5 following a methodology from previous studies miao et al 2018a miao et al 2019 briefly pair end reads were assembled to de multiplex and produce high quality reads at least 400 bp without any ambiguous bases with removing chimera chloroplast mitochondria unknown archaea eukaryota reads all denoised samples were normalized to the same depth of 16 000 reads and clustered into 2065 otus 97 similarity containing at least 5 sequences then otus were classified against the silva database the α diversity shannon ace chao observed species and β diversity bray curtis unifrac distances were calculated for all samples based on mothur and r package phyloseq mcmurdie and holmes 2013 principal coordinates analysis pcoa was conducted to compare similarities among samples based on phylogenetic information ju et al 2017 with r package phyloseq mcmurdie and holmes 2013 samples grouped in time or contaminants variables were fitted onto the ordination analysis using the envfit function of the vegan package the linear discriminant analysis lda effect size lefse method was used to determine the taxa that were most likely to explain differences of microbial communities among groups contaminant conditions or treatment processes by using pre built python script with non parametric factorial kruskal wallis sum rank test and unpaired wilcoxon rank sum test segata et al 2011 and the determining taxon was defined as the representative biomarker of the specific group miao et al 2018a 2 5 predictive functions the microbial functions were predicted by using tax4fun aβhauer et al 2015 based on generated otus table and otus taxonomy with r package tax4fun pathways and functions related to 1 4 dioxane and cvocs degradation in kegg ortholog were searched and picked manually with enzyme commission ec number 2 6 network and correlation analysis based on the otus table and predicted kegg functional profiles correlations were constructed to focus on the potential correlations of species species and genus function otus only occurring in at least 50 of samples with average abundance over 0 1 ju et al 2017 li et al 2018a as well as picked pathways or genes of interest were selected to calculate all pairwise spearman s ranks ju and zhang 2015 a generated correlation between two items was regarded as statistically significant for spearman s correlation coefficient ρ 0 8 or 0 8 and p value 0 01 then p values were further adjusted based on the benjamini hochberg method benjamini and hochberg 1995 to control the false discovery rate fdr the correlations were calculated and adjusted with r packages hmisc and psych and then were visualized and explored by gephi v 0 9 0 bastian et al 2009 2 7 random forests rf regression models supervised regression model based on machine learning is a powerful tool to explore the patterns in complicated datasets and can manifest community development over the course of time 1 4 dioxane and cvocs prediction models were constructed by the random forest rf regression metcalf et al 2016 belk et al 2018 as a function of the changing microbiomes four sampling points were categorized by numbers cb0 day 0 cb1 day 1 cb2 day 63 and cb3 day 119 and trained in a numerical model replicate samples were pooled together to train the regression model and 10 fold cross validation was performed to tune and evaluate the models metcalf et al 2016 then randomly picked samples were predicted by built models the accuracy of models is measured as r2 and mean absolute error mae belk et al 2018 the modeling results were compiled and graphics were generated in r environments following previous work belk et al 2018 3 results 3 1 catalysis biological treatment and biomarker analysis the 24 h catalysis phase removed 20 1 4 dioxane under all conditions as expected fig 1 meanwhile over 60 tce and 50 dce were also removed fig 1 table s6 even though the h2o2 was completely consumed in the catalysis phase 1 4 dioxane concentrations decreased continuously in the first two weeks of incubation the degradation rates were 49 37 19 and 23 μg l day under h h h l l and l dx conditions respectively significant 1 4 dioxane degradation was found with lower cvoc concentrations p value 0 05 paired t test but without apparent decreasing trends after 17 weeks 119 days however tce and cis 1 2 dce were removed to below detection limits and 1 1 dce was only present under the h h condition after biodegradation the bioaug condition showed 1 4 dioxane removal after cb1190 was added at day 63 where 1 4 dioxane started to drop from 5000 μg l to 1000 μg l in four weeks and slowly declined to below 4 μg l the dxmb gene was not detected in naturally simulated conditions while aldh gene was detected below 100 copies ml fig s1 both dxmb and aldh gene abundances increased under bioaug condition from day 63 to day 91 and remained stable afterward with aldh showing higher abundances than dxmb 3 2 microbial community dynamics during the treatment train five parallel treatment trains were monitored at four time points each and the unifrac distance including membership unweighted fig 2 a and abundance weighted fig 2b shown on pcoa displayed more differences with respect to incubation time fig 2 color coded than among conditions fig 2 shape coded this was also consistent with envfit analysis that only time variables showed significant influences on both membership r2 0 89 p value 0 001 and abundance r2 0 80 p value 0 001 the original cb0 yellow and post catalysis cb1 green microbes distributed separately and microbes were more proximal cb2 red to cb3 brown than that from cb1 green to cb2 red demonstrating the relatively stronger shift of the microbial community right after the catalysis while contaminants only differentiated microbial compositions at specific time point when compared without phylogenetic information all naturally simulated conditions were adjacent in the second biodegradation stage based on bray curtis distances fig s2 inoculation of cb1190 under the bioaug condition dominated the microbial community and compressed the relative abundances of other microbes because of the high abundance while the microbial memberships were similar to other conditions moreover lefse analysis using the kruskall wallis test identified representative microbial taxa among different treatment phases times fig s3 but no representative taxa were determined when analyzed by different simulated conditions contaminants 3 3 temporal and conditional distributions of bacteria the microbial community under the bioaug condition was changed due to the influence of cb1190 added at day 63 after bioaugmentation cb1190 occupied 20 16 of the microbial community but dropped to 17 18 by the end of the biodegradation phase fig 3 with decreasing 1 4 dioxane under the naturally simulated conditions pseudomonas ralstonia and perlucidibaca were the main genera before treatment and then reduced by the catalysis phase however pseudomonas was able to recover during the biodegradation phase eventually becoming dominant especially under the l dx only condition more genera such as sphingomonas rhodococcus lacibacter rhizobacter arenimonas aeromicrobium and mesorhizobium thrived after the catalysis phase demonstrating their potential catalysis tolerances but then decreased by the end of the biodegradation phase ramlibacter and methylobacillus were found to accumulate under all conditions additionally the specific 1 4 dioxane and cvoc combinations promoted specific microbes e g both ohtaekwangia and rhodoplanes increased during biodegradation under both h h and l l conditions and both bradyrhizobium and acidovorax preferred higher 1 4 dioxane during the biodegradation phase the diversity and richness of the microbial community were stable after the catalysis phase but increased under all conditions during the first stage of biodegradation fig 3 interestingly the remaining 1 1 dce under the h h condition further reduced the richness during the second stage of biodegradation 3 4 predictive functional features of the bacterial community tax4fun was used in this study to find and identify a total of 6317 functional genes and 279 pathways based on kegg databases in non metric multidimensional scaling nmds of various distances methods both pathways and genes were only differentiated by the catalysis phase but mixed when compared with samples from later time points green in fig s4 the methane metabolism pathway was more abundant than the toluene degradation pathway as well as cvocs related pathways and their abundances were stable during the treatment process fig s5 the genes encoding haloalkane dehalogenase cytochrome p450 family 125 alkane 1 monooxygenase haloacetate dehalogenase and phenol 2 monooxygenase were abundant under the bioaug condition table s7 the relative abundances of methane monooxygenases were stable during the treatment train and toluene monooxygenases were dominated by proteins a and e both of which peaked in the first stage of biodegradation and reduced by the end while the general monooxygenase ec 1 14 13 abundance was only elevated under the bioaug condition due to the addition of cb1190 table s7 3 5 species species and genera functions associations the correlations between predicted functional features and the top 20 abundant genera under four naturally simulated conditions were used to show potential carriers of specific genes fig 4 the dominant pseudomonas correlated positively with genes encoding toluene and alkanal monooxygenases alpha and beta chains but negatively with cytochrome p450 families however sphingomonas rhodococcus and lacibacter were positively correlated with genes encoding cytochrome p450 families and negatively correlated with toluene and alkanal monooxygenases for cvoc related functional enzymes haloacetate and haloacid dehalogenases were positively correlated with ramlibacter methylobacillus bradyrhizobium and acidovorax while haloalkane dehalogenase was positively correlated with sphingomonas rhodococcus and methylobacillus additionally alkanal monooxygenases were only significantly positively correlated with pseudomonas and variovorax but tended to be negatively correlated with other genera while the dehalogenases were significantly and widely distributed in various microbes co occurrence and co exclusion were represented by positive and negative spearman s correlations respectively and the network among species otus only incorporated taxa under naturally simulated conditions in the biodegradation phase cb1 cb3 the strong ρ 0 8 and significant p value 0 01 positive correlations consisted of 112 nodes and 377 edges including 9 modules modularity 0 583 fig 5 d module iii viii and ix were isolated without any edges to other modules but occupied with different phyla fig 5a phylum proteobacteria mainly occupied module ii iv v and ix and shared modules ii iv v with actinobacteria and module vi with bacteroidetes the most abundant genus pseudomonas otu1 2 3 distributed in three modules ii v ix and mainly connected with ramlibacter otu9 15 acidovorax otu8 bradyrhizobium otu12 variibacter otu45 92 methylobacillus otu10 and rhizobium otu31 56 however sphingomonas otu14 18 35 48 64 145 rhodococcus otu5 and lacibacter otu7 were found co occurring in module iv and vi additionally acidovorax otu8 bradyrhizobium otu12 and variibacter otu45 92 were the densely connected nodes within module v while sphingomonas otu35 was the bridge between module iv and vi fig 5b furthermore the peak abundance of each otu was used to show the abundance trends among cb1 cb2 and cb3 the otus peaking at cb1 mainly distributed in module iv vi and vii while otus with peak abundance at cb2 and cb3 were mixed and spread in module ii and v indicating that the dominant species were closely related in the second stage of biodegradation fig 5c the negative strong ρ 0 8 and significant p value 0 01 correlations contained 56 nodes and 112 edges and were separated into 7 modules modularity 0 408 fig s6c genera pseudomonas otu1 and sphingomonas otu18 were in the same module ii and negatively connected indicating their potential competition that were also observed between pseudomonas otu1 and rhizobacter otu13 in module ii as well as sphingomonas otu35 and ramlibacter otu9 in module i besides sphingomonas otu35 also negatively connected with pseudarthrobacter otu6 in different modules fig s6b 3 6 predictions of microbial community using random forests the relative abundance of all otus were used to construct rf regression models that were utilized to predict the distributions of microbes during the treatment process and the ideal distribution should be on the diagonal where prediction days are equal to actual days when putting h h and h l conditions together as the training dataset and data in l l and l dx only conditions used as input r2 0 63 mae 20 82 the first two time points day 0 and 1 were beyond the diagonal and samples at day 63 and 119 were predicted below the diagonal fig 6 a a similar prediction r2 0 67 mae 19 27 was obtained after switching the training and testing datasets fig 6b however when only inputting bioaug samples into the naturally simulated model microbes were predicted to be consistent during the biodegradation phase showing the potential impacts and dominance of spiked cb1190 in the microbial community fig s7a the earlier stabilization of microbial community was also predicted by using model with naturally simulated data fig s7 4 discussion 1 4 dioxane and cvocs have been widely reported co contaminants in groundwater plumes at multiple contaminated sites adamson et al 2014 and the inhibitory impact of individual mixed cvocs on the biodegradation kinetics of 1 4 dioxane has also been studied zhang et al 2016 therefore catalytic oxidation was necessary to reduce co contaminant levels before biodegradation the wox zro2 h2o2 system used 310 mm h2o2 to achieve nearly 20 1 4 dioxane removals which was a larger dose than in the initial catalyst screening experiments 15 mm heck et al 2019 and the potential reason was likely due to the presence of many different species in the groundwater soil microcosms that poisoned catalytic sites or physically fouled the catalyst surface or blocked pores subsequently 1 4 dioxane continued to decrease even after the quenching of the 24 h catalytic oxidation indicating the potential photoactivity of wox zro2 cheng et al 2016 moreover superoxide radicals adsorbed on lewis acidic sites of catalysts could contribute to continuous 1 4 dioxane degradation heck et al 2019 similarly chlorinated compounds were also primarily degraded by oxidative radicals which was observed during electrochemical oxidation jasmann et al 2017 or by using so4 2 fe2o3 catalysts zhang et al 2018 and persulfate oxidation chang et al 2018 but this study is the first to demonstrate tce 1 1 dce and cis 1 2 dce catalysis by wox zro2 and h2o2 higher removal efficiency of tce than that of 1 4 dioxane was in line with the findings of eberle et al 2016 however the accumulated 1 1 dce in the microcosms at higher levels suggests that some combination of limited 1 1 dce catalytic degradation occurred furthermore tce and cis 1 2 dce were completely degraded during the biodegradation phase under all conditions indicating that aerobic bacteria removed these cvocs by utilizing dissolved oxygen from decomposed h2o2 li et al 2015a or potential photoactivity the increasing gene abundances of dxmb and aldh after the cb1190 spike corresponded to the metabolism of 1 4 dioxane and the higher aldh abundance indicated the availability of a diversity of carbon sources gedalanga et al 2014 however the non detection of biomarkers in naturally simulated microcosms indicates a lack of intrinsic 1 4 dioxane metabolizers and the potential intrinsic 1 4 dioxane co metabolizing bacteria could have been reduced and inhibited by catalysis the biodegradation of cvocs is likely related to the intermediates produced which acted as carbon sources to induce co metabolism of cvocs over 1 4 dioxane similar to that has been observed during the oxidation bioremediation of a diesel contaminated soil sutton et al 2014 the in depth microbial community analysis explored the behavior of microbial communities under different 1 4 dioxane and cvocs conditions over time the original dominant genera pseudomonas and ralstonia were described by sheu et al 2018 to biodegrade chlorinated compounds in soil however both of these were declined but were not completely eliminated by the catalysis phase due to their weak peroxide tolerances however the higher recovered abundance of pseudomonas during the biodegradation phase under the l dx only condition suggests that pseudomonas could consume the catalysis produced intermediates due to carrying alkanal monooxygenases alpha and beta chains but had weak cvoc tolerances sphingomonas replaced pseudomonas as the dominant genus after the catalysis phase which was reported to remain active even after 500 mg l h2o2 exposure dziga et al 2018 sphingomonas and rhodococcus hosts of cytochrome p450 families could also increase after chloropicrin fumigation in soil remediation and were utilized for the biodegradation of toxic environmental contaminants li et al 2017 however rhodococcus and variovorax were found to be abundant after the first 9 week stage of the biodegradation phase potentially due to their capabilities for co metabolizing cvocs sercu et al 2013 with different enzymes moreover ramlibacter and methylobacillus both of which belong to betaproteobacteria with many members that can degrade light hydrocarbons increased during the biodegradation phase and were identified in olive mill wastewaters kavroulakis and ntougias 2011 demonstrating potential consumption of catalytic transformation products overall besides the previously mentioned bacteria the microbes that were enriched after 17 weeks of incubation were generally more capable of utilizing catalysis produced and 1 4 dioxane cvoc biodegradation intermediates e g ohtaekwangia in hydrocarbon degradation ma et al 2015 acidovorax in carbon tetrachloride and trichloroethylene degradation kwon et al 2016 and bradyrhizobium in chlorinated compound remediation krzmarzick and novak 2014 showing strong potential for long term natural attenuation after engineered remediation even with the increasing absolute degradation gene abundances dxmb and aldh the relative abundance of cb1190 decreased during the second stage of biodegradation attributed to the potentially weak competition capability with other native microbes miao et al 2019 the stable biodiversity after catalytic oxidation was inconsistent with previous work in that species richness and diversity dramatically declined after aops medina et al 2018 which could be attributed to the lower oxidation potentials of wox zro2 generated superoxide radicals heck et al 2019 on the other hand h2o2 might selectively impact the microbes that were the most abundant in the original microbial community pseudomonas allowing the tolerant species to survive and increase in abundance to the point of detection resulting in the compensation of microbial diversity miao et al 2018b this was identified by the decline of previously dominant genus pseudomonas 40 whose relative abundance was distributed into other representative microbes after catalysis based on lefse analysis the continuously increasing biodiversity in the first stage of biodegradation can be attributed to the generation of catalytic byproducts with enhanced solubility and biodegradability zhu et al 2015 as well as reduced toxicity carboneras et al 2018 that could better support microbial growth the remaining cvocs or degradation products under h h conditions inhibited microbial richness and diversity during the second stage of biodegradation and liu et al 2018 also observed decreasing diversity in vinyl chloride enriched groundwater and zhang et al 2016 reported the 1 1 dce as the strongest known inhibitor with respect to 1 4 dioxane biodegradation tardy et al 2014 suggested that biodiversity might increase with available soil resources and enhanced functional and structural stability explaining the cvocs removals under h h h l and l l conditions overall the biodiversity under each condition was enhanced after the whole treatment train leading to a more stable microbial ecosystem in the soil for long term resistance to future contaminant shocks the predicted functions were not separated over time except for the catalysis phase and this was described as the functional redundancy that increased functional stability vanwonterghem et al 2014 reflected on the stable abundances of pathways the significant correlations between dehalogenases and multiple genera indicated the presence of widespread cvoc degradation potential as well as the presence of phylogenetically distinct microbes that were able to fulfill the same functional group li et al 2018a the high abundance of methane metabolism and methane monooxygenases could be attributed to ubiquitous methane oxidizing bacteria e g proteobacteria and catalytic oxidation improved bioavailability and oxygen content chen et al 2018 although 1 4 dioxane can be degraded by many monooxygenase containing bacteria mahendra and alvarez cohen 2006 mahendra et al 2007 mesophilic methanotrophs which are also known for co metabolic oxidation of halogenated compounds weigold et al 2016 were reported to rapidly oxidize tce but not 1 4 dioxane during natural attenuation or enhanced biodegradation hatzinger et al 2017 the increasing abundance of chloroalkane and chloroalkene degradation in cvoc containing conditions indicates a potential pathway for cvoc degradation which has been previously identified as abundant in pce tce contaminated groundwater kao et al 2016 and chlorinated hydrocarbon contaminated sites kappell et al 2014 specifically high abundances of haloalkane haloacetate and 2 haloacid dehalogenases could correspond to the existence of cvocs weigold et al 2016 and potential oxidative intermediate haloacetic acids from tce chang et al 2018 the stable abundances of methane and toluene monooxygenases had no improvement on 1 4 dioxane removals likely due to the impacts of cvocs on monooxygenase driven degradation zhang et al 2016 or selection of monooxygenases unable to mediate 1 4 dioxane degradation mahendra and alvarez cohen 2006 although specific microbes changed among different conditions a common temporal succession pattern in microbial assembly including memberships and abundances was shared across conditions indicating the population dynamics in the complex community were mainly synchronized over time vanwonterghem et al 2014 which is consistent with ju et al 2017 where shifts in the microbial community present in an anaerobic biogas digestor were more dependent on operating time rather than physiochemical and operational parameters this niche based e g nutrient substrate availability environmental selection biological competition deterministic temporal succession is supported by the pcoa and nmds analyses that showed that microbes were temporally clustered jiao et al 2017b in addition the lefse analysis could only pick up changes in representative microbes among phases instead of among conditions the initial catalysis phase removed contaminants to different levels and microbes were separately clustered cb0 vs cb1 depicting the catalysis impact on microbial deterministic succession shi et al 2018 also found the deterministic process in places with distinct environments that contained a few interchangeable bacteria in the following first stage of the biodegradation phase microbes were separated because of the access to the remaining oxidative products while community compositions approached each other in similarity during the second stage indicating the slow succession that could be attributed to decreasing availability of carbon sources which has also been observed in microbial communities after heat disturbance jurburg et al 2017 moreover the l dx only condition exhibited the most dissimilar community post treatment train indicating that cvocs can play minor roles in determining and differentiating the individual microbial progress just within the deterministic process vanwonterghem et al 2014 indicated that even if microbial communities had minor differences at the specific time point the communities as a whole would still follow similar trajectories and jiao et al 2017b observed similar dynamic patterns of microbial communities induced by individual or mixed contaminants furthermore the microbes from cb1 to cb2 were dominated by r strategists fast unstable competitive condition that led to relatively faster succession because of the shocks caused by the photoactivity of the remaining wox zro2 after this stage the increasing stability indicated by higher biodiversity and slower deviations between microbial communities indicated that the microcosms were occupied by k strategists slow stable same condition jurburg et al 2017 from cb2 to cb3 the gradual shift from r to k strategists along successional gradients has recently been shown for microbes in mercury tardy et al 2014 and hydrocarbon contaminated soils medina et al 2018 additionally the predictions from rf models also support the deterministic succession that the more similar distributions at day 63 and 119 indicates slower succession compared to the first stage of succession the predicted microbes under the bioaug condition were stable from day 63 119 showing the potential impacts and dominance of spiked cb1190 in the microbial community and jiao et al 2017a reported that temporal microbial turnovers were mainly controlled by abundant bacteria which was mainly driven by deterministic processes all models showing the similar prediction trends confirms the earlier stabilization in the microbial community the earlier stabilization also indicated the self recovery of microbial community as well as the recovery of soil properties and ecosystem moreover nearly identical community composition suggests a return to similar initial soil conditions after remediation process when considering taxonomy and functions together the dominant taxa might contribute primary functions in the community while the rare minor microbes could act as a source of functional diversity jiao et al 2017a pseudomonas the dominant genus that rebounded during the biodegradation phase was observed to co occur with a diversity of minor community members which is consistent with flower microbiota where the most prominent microbe co occur with minor members shade et al 2013 this inter genera co occurrence could be attributed to microbial interactions e g commensalism or mutualism ju and zhang 2015 moreover the minor microbes e g bradyrhizobium and variibacter also appear to be crucial in the co occurring network by constructing connections among genotype specific microbes a pattern that has also been observed in lettuce root microbiota cardinale et al 2015 sphingomonas rhodococcus and lacibacter were phylogenetically distinct but positively correlated in networks and identified catalytic tolerant in relative abundances as determined by their functional relevance cardinale et al 2015 and confirmed by carrying dehalogenases and cytochrome p450 simultaneously thelusmond et al 2016 also reported that sphingomonas and rhodobacteraceae were linked to carbamazepine degradation and might result from their sharing the similar niches e g environmental conditions similar to what has been observed at a uranium contaminated site li et al 2018a furthermore pseudomonas otu1 sphingomonas otu18 and pseudomonas otu1 rhizobacter otu13 were co exclusive with each other and inter taxa co exclusion were prevalent in taxonomically distinct species ju and zhang 2015 the predicted functional feature showed that pseudomonas toluene monooxygenase carried different genes from sphingomonas cytochrome p450 and rhizobacter methane monooxygenase respectively suggesting that the hosts might not carry toluene and alkanal monooxygenases with cytochrome p450 simultaneously however these enzymes were functionally equivariant and fierce competition would occur among these microbes for limited nutrients carbon substrates e g 1 4 dioxane cvocs and intermediates in this study or other factors ju and zhang 2015 the network analysis also supports the observed deterministic process that ecological niches bacterial interactions microbial competitions and substrate availabilities etc could guide the community assembly and dynamics vanwonterghem et al 2014 additionally the microbial turnovers peaked abundances along with time from module iii v vi to modules i and iv in the co occurrence networks highlights the role of interspecies competition for resources in intensifying community dynamics these shifts have also been observed in anaerobic biogas digesters ju et al 2017 and heat disturbed soil jurburg et al 2017 the 1 4 dioxane and the cvoc mediated deterministic process could also be related to high biodiversity both of which corresponded to the microbial stability and high cvocs removals 5 conclusions in laboratory microcosm treatment trains pre exposure to catalytic oxidation enhanced 1 4 dioxane biodegradation by cb1190 and triggered cvocs biodegradation by intrinsic microbes a more stable microbial community was achieved under all conditions after the treatment train containing a higher biodiversity of microbes with xenobiotic biodegradation capabilities the potential functional redundancy found that monooxygenases remained constant during the biodegradation phase while enzymes related to chloroalkane and chloroalkene degradation increased and this pattern corresponded to increasing cvoc removals the microbial assembly was guided following deterministic temporal succession even under different contamination conditions which was supported by the pcoa analysis random forests models and network analysis this study s findings of novel insights into the ecological mechanisms underlying the degradation of 1 4 dioxane and cvocs will be valuable for selecting remediation strategies for other contaminant mixtures declaration of

18092,efficient removal of the non biodegradable organics from the biological effluent of industrial wastewater is becoming more and more important with the increasing demand for stringent discharge regulation in this study a synchronized oxidation adsorption soa technology was proposed for the removal of hardly biodegradable cod hard cod from the biological effluent of coking wastewater and its performance was verified in a full scale coking industrial park wastewater treatment plant q 5 000 m3 d the soa was performed by coupling oxidation by hydroxyl radical molar ratio of fe2 to h2o2 of 1 1 and ph 5 0 0 2 and adsorption by in situ formed nano hydrolyzed fe3 particles nano feooh the nano hydrolyzed fe3 particles formed during the soa exhibited a much higher specific surface area 22 83 m2 g than the particles 10 87 m2 g formed during the polyferric sulfate coagulation pfsc in comparison to pfsc soa performed better in terms of average cod removal 39 vs 18 from the biological effluent wastewater fractionation result showed that soa performed better in the removal of the hydrophobic acid matters which was supported by the experiment using fulvic acid as the model organics mechanism studies using both biological effluent and fulvic acid solution showed that more carboxylic substances were adsorbed by the in situ formed nano hydrolyzed fe3 particles formed by soa than by pfsc which was likely due to the generation of carboxylic substances by hydroxyl radical oxidation in the full scale the cod was reduced from 118 5 198 0 mg l in the pfsc pretreated effluent to 61 5 104 0 mg l through soa treatment the soa treatment characterized with a mild ph condition ph 5 and low molar ratio of fe2 to h2o2 1 1 is particularly suitable for the polishing purpose to remove limited amount of organic pollutants from wastewater before discharge graphical abstract image 1 keywords tertiary treatment industrial wastewater in situ synchronized oxidation adsorption nano hydrolyzed fe3 particles carboxyl compounds 1 introduction as an advanced process fenton oxidation has been widely used for the removal of bio refractory organic pollutants in industrial wastewater behin et al 2017 panizza and cerisola 2004 because of the strong oxidation potential of the hydroxyl radical oh generated during the reaction fenton oxidation can mineralize most organic compounds in wastewater solano et al 2015 thiam et al 2015 if sufficient amounts of reagent are supplied in addition to oxidizing power several studies have stated that the adsorption capacity of the ferric hydroxide particles formed during fenton oxidation should not be neglected gao et al 2004 meriç et al 2005 zhang et al 2014 reported that adsorption by ferric hydroxide plays an important role in chemical oxygen demand cod removal when using fenton oxidation to treat dye wastewater we also observed a similar phenomenon when treating oilfield wastewater via the fenton process gao et al 2004 the fe3 generated during fenton oxidation exhibits a much higher hydrolysis rate than the normal coagulation process using ferric salt gao et al 2009 the hydrolyzed fe3 produced in the fenton process may be an important reason for the relatively high adsorption performance of fenton process on the other hand some compounds with carboxylic groups are also produced during fenton oxidation kallel et al 2009 lyu et al 2015 and these compounds are reported to be easily removed by forming complexes with ferric oxyhydroxide or oxide cheng and chi 2002 yost et al 1990 industrial wastewater often contains leftover bio refractory compounds hard cod in biological effluents which need to be removed to meet the increasingly stringent discharge standards wu et al 2018 although fenton oxidation is very effective in the removal of hard cod from wastewater the low reaction ph 3 0 iskander et al 2019 and slow cycle between fe3 and fe2 make it a complicated and costly approach for tertiary treatment purposes xing et al 2018 as biological effluent usually contains hard cod requiring further removal we assumed that the strong adsorption potential of the hydrolyzed fe3 particles formed during fenton oxidation could be fully employed for tertiary treatment with a smaller footprint and lower chemical doses in such a case reactions could occur under moderate ph conditions as there would be no need to promote the cycle between fe3 and fe2 thus a synchronized oxidation adsorption technology soa was proposed as a tertiary treatment approach where the oxidation of fe2 to fe3 hydrolysis of fe3 and transformation and adsorption of organic compounds could proceed simultaneously under moderate ph conditions treatment of coking wastewater has been a big challenge because considerable amount of unknown organic compounds still remain in the biologically treated effluents requiring further treatment li et al 2016a qian et al 1994 wu et al 2018 excitation emission matrix eem resin fractionation and size exclusion chromatography have been used to characterize organics from the biological effluents the residual organics in the biological effluents have been found to mainly include fulvic acid like substances and hydrophobic compounds with a relatively low molecular weight ren et al 2018 yang et al 2018 zhao et al 2009 these residual organic compounds are difficult to remove even with ozonation or fenton oxidation processes jiang et al 2011 zhang et al 2015 coagulation using iron salts has been employed to treat the biological effluents of coking wastewater shen et al 2014 lai et al 2007 assumed that charge neutralization and complexation might be the major mechanisms for the removal of the organics from coking wastewater by coagulation however coagulation alone is still not sufficient for meeting the discharge standard the aim of the present study was to investigate the performance mechanism and engineering application of the proposed soa technology by treating biological effluent of coking wastewater thus we evaluated the performance of soa in the removal of hard cod from the biological effluent of coking wastewater by comparing with the conventional polyferric sulfate coagulation pfsc to better understand the cod removal mechanisms the organic compounds in the biological effluent were fractionated using xad resins with the organics removal efficiency of each fraction then evaluated fulvic acid was used as model organics to further explore the organics removal mechanism in addition the soa technology was adopted in a full scale coking industrial park wastewater treatment plant wuhai china to determine the applicability of this approach in practice the results of this study should provide a scientific basis for establishing effective tertiary treatment technology to improve industrial wastewater 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and wastewater all reagents were of analytical grade except where noted deionized water was used for the preparation of solutions solutions of 0 5 mm h2o2 and 0 5 mm feso4 were freshly prepared before the soa experiments industrial grade polyferric sulfate total concentration of fe of 18 5 w w was used for the coagulation experiments the biological effluent from a coking plant in tangshan city hebei province china were collected and stored in the lab at 4 c another biological effluent from coking plant in handan city was also collected and selected to verify the cod removal performances of coking wastewater treatment by soa the biological effluent of coking wastewater was pretreated using polyferric sulfate prior to the experiments the optimum ph for the pretreatment was determined to be 5 0 0 2 fig s1a as shown in fig s1b the cod removal efficiency only increased a little when the fe dosage was higher than 1 mm therefore the dosage of fe for pretreatment was 1 mm for biological effluent from handan city the dosage of fe for pretreatment was 0 8 mm shown in fig s5a the pretreated wastewater ph 5 0 0 2 fe dose 1 mm was mentioned as biological effluent in the following description water quality parameters of biological effluent which collected from coking plant in tangshan city before and after pretreatment ph 5 0 0 2 fe dose 1 mm are presented in table s1 fulvic acid bosf china was used as model organics to prepare synthetic wastewater 2 2 experimental procedure both the soa and pfsc experiments were conducted in 300 ml glass beakers under the same reaction conditions for soa treatment feso4 solution was added to the beakers containing 200 ml of biological effluent followed by the addition of h2o2 solution molar ratio of fe2 to h2o2 of 1 1 under magnetic stirring at 200 rpm and the reaction time lasted for 30 min the optimum ph for soa treatment was determined over a ph range between 4 0 0 2 and 7 0 0 2 the ph was adjusted to targeted values using 5 m naoh or 3 m h2so4 during the experiment the treated wastewater was then collected and filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane filter for analysis for pfsc treatment 0 25 m polyferric sulfate solution was added to the beakers containing 200 ml of biological effluent followed by the addition of 5 m naoh to adjust ph all other procedures were the same as the soa experiment fulvic acid concentration 0 1 g l solutions were prepared to simulate wastewater and were treated as described above the full scale coking wastewater treatment plant is located in a coking industrial park in wuhai city china the influent of the coking industrial park wastewater treatment plant was mainly from five local coking plants in the industrial park with a total inflow to the treatment plant of 5 000 m3 d the influent was initially treated by a biological system in the five coking plants respectively and then discharged into the coking industrial park wastewater treatment plant the water quality of effluent discharged from five coking plants and the influent in the full scale plant of the industrial park are shown in table s2 to enhance cod removal soa was adopted in the upgrade of the full scale coking industrial park wastewater treatment process the treatment processes before and after the upgrade are shown in fig s2 the retention time for both of pfsc and soa was 45 min the tank volume information is listed in table s3 2 3 fractionation of wastewater modified wastewater fractionation was performed using dax 8 supelite dax 8 supelco and xad 4 amberlite xad 4 sigma aldrich resins in succession according to the procedures described by leenheer 1981 and malcolm and maccarthy 1992 briefly 200 ml of filtered sample was acidified to ph 2 0 with 12 1 m hcl after that the sample recorded as dissolved organic carbon 1 doc 1 was pumped through dax 8 and then xad 4 at a flow rate of 120 ml h following the procedure shown in fig s3 the doc of the effluent from dax 8 e 8 was recorded as doc 2 and included transphilic and hydrophilic substances the doc of the effluent from xad 4 was recorded as doc 5 and assigned as hydrophilic hpi hydrophobic substances which included hydrophobic acid hpoa and hydrophobic neutral hpon were adsorbed on the dax 8 resin and hpoa was eluted as doc 3 with 0 1 m naoh at a flow rate of 60 ml h transphilic substances which contained transphilic acid tpia and transphilic neutral tpin were retained on the xad 4 resin and tpia was eluted as doc 4 in the same manner both hpon and tpin were calculated using the following equations 5 hpon doc 1 doc 2 doc 3 6 tpin doc 2 doc 5 doc 4 the volumes of all fractions were increased to 200 ml

cod and in cost analysis the highest cod removal was acquired at ph 5 in the biological effluent during soa treatment as shown in fig s4 thus the ph was fixed at 5 0 0 2 for the following treatment experiments fig 1 a compares the efficiencies of soa molar ratio of fe2 to h2o2 1 1 ph 5 0 0 2 and pfsc ph 5 0 0 2 in removing cod from biological effluent under different fe doses in the pfsc system the removal efficiency of cod increased from 8 6 to 17 9 with the increase in fe dose from 1 to 4 mm this increase is understandable as the biological effluent was already pretreated with polyferric sulfate 1 mm fe and most organic compounds that could be adsorbed by the hydrolyzed fe3 particles had already been removed in the soa system however the cod removal efficiency increased to 18 1 by only employing an fe dose of 1 mm and further increased to 38 7 with the further increase of the fe dose to 4 mm showing that the soa system could remove some organic fractions that could not be removed by pfsc a similar result was achieved in treating biological effluent from another coking plant from handan city as seen in fig s5 comparison of the soa and pfsc treatment costs was conducted as shown in table 1 to achieve the same cod removal target the cost of soa treatment was approximately one fifth of that of the pfsc treatment more important the soa treatment can achieve a cod removal that the pfsc cannot to figure out the brief contribution of adsorption for organics removal the toc content in the particles after soa treatment was evaluated as shown in table s5 the absorbed toc in the particles 4 38 mg was similar to the toc difference before and after soa treatment 4 17 mg of the biological effluent of coking wastewater this result suggested that the organics removal was mainly contributed by adsorption while the role of the oxidation process was to modify the organics several factors might be responsible for the differences observed in cod removal performance between the two processes e g transformation of organics by hydroxyl radicals during soa and higher adsorption capacity of the hydrolyzed fe3 oxidized from fe2 which will be explored in the following sections 3 2 comparison between soa and pfsc in removing different organic fractions as depicted in fig 2 a the biological effluent included hpoa hpi tpia tpin and hpon which accounted for 34 2 27 5 13 3 12 9 and 12 1 of doc respectively hpoa and hpi were the two main fractions present in the biological effluent which was similar to that reported in a previous study zhao et al 2009 pfsc could remove a small portion of the transphilic and hydrophilic fractions including hpi tpia and tpin but not hpoa or hpon the most significant difference between the two processes was that soa could remove a substantial portion of hpoa the eem intensity changes in hpoa tpia and hpi during soa and pfsc are shown in fig 2b results indicated that soa was much more efficient than pfsc in reducing the fluorescence intensities of hpoa and hpi as the doc of the hpi fraction was not significantly reduced by soa it may be possible that soa destroyed the fluorescent structure in the hpi fraction through oxidation 3 3 changes in functional groups after soa and pfsc treatment to explore the removal mechanisms the pollutants in wastewater and on particles were characterized before and after soa and pfsc treatment xps c1s spectrum measurement was performed to reveal the changes in the chemical structure of the pollutants in the biological soa and pfsc effluent according to the binding energies the detected c1s spectra were assigned to aromatic carbon cc aliphatic carbon c c ether or alcohol carbon c o ketonic carbon co and carboxylic carbon o co lin et al 2014 monteil rivera et al 2000 shao et al 2014 as shown in fig 3 and fig s6 it was clear that only the carboxylic carbons were not detected in the biological effluent interestingly the carboxylic groups were detected after soa treatment mainly in the hpoa and tpia fractions suggesting that some new compounds possessing carboxylic groups were formed which may be due to oxidation by oh as shown in table 2 and fig s7 the oxygen containing group o containing group was found at a much higher percentage in the soa effluent 14 4 than in the pfsc effluent 2 1 and the carboxylic group was found at a much higher percentage on the soa particles 9 8 than on the pfsc particles 3 8 during soa the hydroxyl radical oh was produced as shown in fig s8a thus the increased o containing group and carboxylic group in the soa effluent and particles were likely associated with the oxidation of organic matter by oh the o containing groups particularly the carboxylic group are known to exhibit a higher affinity to iron oxyhydroxide surfaces lv et al 2016 which could partly explain the advantage of the soa system 3 4 differences between soa and pfsc in nano hydrolyzed fe3 particles the nano hydrolyzed fe3 particles formed in pure water with soa and pfsc treatment were characterized using different methods characterization of the particles using xps figs s9a b atr ftir fig s10a raman fig s10b xrd fig s11 and hr tem fig s12 revealed no obvious structural differences between the soa and pfsc particles both the soa and pfsc particles belonged to feooh fig s9 and fig s10 li et al 2018 liu et al 2016 and exhibited an amorphous structure fig s11 and fig s12 as shown in fig s13 however the average particle size in the soa system increased from 71 9 nm to 125 3 nm over 30 min which was much smaller than that formed during pfsc from 149 8 nm to 322 9 nm our previous study revealed that h2o2 can form a complex with fe3 which can inhibit the complexation of fe3 with the hydroxide ligand gao et al 2009 and may lead to a slower growth rate of nano hydrolyzed fe3 particles as shown in table 3 the specific surface area and pore volume of the nano hydrolyzed fe3 particles in the soa system were 22 83 m2 g and 0 042 cm3 g respectively much higher than those in the pfsc system 10 37 m2 g and 0 016 cm3 g the smaller particle size and larger specific surface area and pore volume of the soa particles likely contributed to the higher cod adsorption capacity 3 5 exploration of soa treatment mechanisms using model organics fulvic acid was used as model organic matter to further explore the removal mechanism of organics in the soa system as shown in fig 1b the doc removal efficiency increased to 59 6 with the increase of the fe dose to 5 mm in the soa system but only increased to 16 6 with the same fe doses in the pfsc system showing that the soa system was much more efficient in the removal of fulvic acid similar with the result of the soa treatment for biological effluent the removal of toc was also found to be mainly contributed by adsorption table s5 as shown in fig s14 both the biological effluent of coking wastewater and fulvic acid solution mainly contained organic fractions with a molecular weight below 500 da suggesting that fulvic acid could to some extent to represent the organic fractions in biological effluent of coking wastewater the organic compounds with different molecular weights were reduced further which was consistent with fulvic acid treatment result the atr ftir analysis results of the nano hydrolyzed fe3 particles formed during soa or pfsc treatment over a wide range of fe doses are shown in fig s15 the adsorption bands at 1639 1600 cm 1 and 1400 1380 cm 1 were assigned to the carboxyl groups fu and quan 2006 gu et al 1994 the intensities at 1610 cm 1 and 1380 cm 1 on the soa particles were much higher than those in the pfsc particles at the same dose suggesting that the nano hydrolyzed fe3 particles formed in the soa system could adsorb more fulvic acid with carboxyl groups than those formed in the pfsc system the atr ftir analysis results of fulvic acid lyophilized from the solution before and after soa or pfsc treatment under different fe doses are shown in fig s16 in the soa system the intensity of the band at 1600 cm 1 increased at first and then decreased with the increase in fe dose from 0 5 to 5 mm however almost no carboxyl group signals could be detected in the fulvic acid solution after pfsc treatment from 0 5 to 5 mm these results suggest that carboxyl groups were generated and were removed by the nano hydrolyzed fe3 particles previous study revealed ligand exchange or bond formation between carboxyl groups and fe during organics adsorption by fe oxyhydroxides chen et al 2014 which could well explain the higher adsorption of fulvic acid with carboxyl groups in the soa system in addition the band at 1639 cm 1 of fulvic acid shifted to a lower frequency 1601 1610 cm 1 after soa treatment suggesting the formation of complexes between carboxyl groups and iron gu et al 1994 the xps results showed that the soa particles contained higher percentage of carboxyl groups 7 2 10 4 than the pfsc particles 4 0 2 6 at the same fe dose fig s17 which was consistent with results of ftir the role of oh in fulvic acid removal by the soa treatment was further investigated by spiking isopropanol ipa as an oh quencher as shown in fig 4 li et al 2016b the content of fulvic acid was measured using a uv vis spectrophotometer at 270 nm chang et al 2017 xu et al 2012 as shown in fig 4a only oh radicals were detected in the soa treatment an ipa dose of 4 mm largely reduced the oh radical signals resulting in marked decrease in fulvic acid removal fig 4b in order to confirm if the competitive adsorption between ipa and fa had reduced the fa removal the adsorption capabilities of the nano particles for ipa were evaluated at 2 and 4 mm respectively as shown in fig s18 the fa concentration determined as doc exhibited positive correlation with the absorbance of uv270 on the other hand ipa has little absorption at 270 nm fig 4b so the adsorbed amounts of fa and ipa onto the nano particles could be approximately calculated by simultaneously analyzing the changes of doc and absorbance at uv270 before and after the soa treatment as shown in table s6 the adsorbed amounts of fa decreased from 206 3 mg g fe to 121 4 mg g fe and 108 9 mg g fe when ipa was added with a concentration of 2 and 4 mm respectively by comparison the corresponding adsorbed amounts of ipa were only 25 9 mg g fe and 14 3 mg g fe respectively suggesting that ipa was not a strong competitor of fa for the adsorption sites therefore we can speculate that the quench effect of oh not the competitive adsorption of ipa might have mainly accounted for the decrease of the adsorption capability of the nano particles for fa at the same time the ftir analysis showed that the peak intensities of the carboxyl groups in both soa particles and fulvic acid solution treated by soa were reduced largely in the presence of ipa fig s19 similarly the xps analysis results also showed that the carboxyl groups detected on the surface of the soa particles almost disappeared once ipa was added fig s20 thus both the ftir and xps analysis results supported that ipa addition could inhibit the generation of the carboxyl groups due to its oh quenching effect based on the above results the organics removal mechanism of soa treatment was proposed during the soa treatment process oh and fresh nano hydrolyzed fe3 particles were generated via reaction between h2o2 and fe2 compared with those formed in the pfsc system the nano hydrolyzed fe3 particles formed in the soa system exhibited stronger organic adsorption capacity because of their larger specific surface area particularly for the hpoa fraction with rich carboxyl groups fulvic acid which is normally extracted from natural water using dax 8 christensen et al 1998 has been considered to represent the hpoa fraction jung et al 2017 lai et al 2009 of course some hpi fraction may also be included in it chen et al 2003 at the same time the oh generated in the soa system could transform some organic compounds into carboxyl bearing ones which would further enhance the cod removal capacity of soa treatment the hpoa fraction is dominant in diverse industrial wastewaters including textile wastewater and landfill leachate hong et al 2016 labanowski and feuillade 2009 thus it is expected that soa should have wide application in the removal of hard cod from different biological effluents of industrial wastewaters 3 6 application of soa technology in a full scale coking industrial park wastewater treatment plant the feasibility of the soa technology was further verified in a full scale coking industrial park wastewater treatment plant receiving biological effluents from five coking plants in the industrial park the cod of the full scale biological effluent as well as the pfsc and soa effluents was monitored over a period of 27 d as shown in fig 5 the cod of the biological effluent was 274 377 mg l which reduced to 118 5 198 0 mg l after pfsc pretreatment fe dose 1 5 mm ph 4 5 the cod was further reduced to 61 5 104 0 mg l by soa under an fe dose of 1 mm molar ratio of fe2 to h2o2 1 1 ph 4 5 the full scale coking industrial park wastewater treatment plant employing the soa technology has been operated for over one year with satisfactory performance the full scale result was highly consistent with the results achieved in the lab and demonstrated that soa is a promising technology for the treatment of coking wastewater we are evaluating the feasibility of applying the soa technology for the tertiary treatment of other industrial wastewaters the soa technology is on the base of the fenton reaction the major difference between them is that the fenton reaction is mainly focusing on the removal of organic pollutants through hydroxyl radical oxidation while the soa treatment is mainly emphasizing the removal of organic pollutants through coupling oxidation and adsorption process the formation of carboxylic substances and nano particles of hydrolyzed fe3 with a large surface area should be two key factors for the soa technology it is known that the conventional fenton reaction treatment requires an acidic condition ph 3 and high molar ratio of fe2 to h2o2 usually in the range of 1 3 1 40 behin et al 2017 elmolla and chaudhuri 2012 elmolla et al 2010 kavitha and palanivelu 2005 tekin et al 2006 wu et al 2010 the soa treatment is characterized with its mild ph condition ph 5 and much lower molar ratio of fe2 to h2o2 1 1 resulting much less consumption of chemicals and shorter time for the treatment this technology is particularly suitable for the polishing purpose to remove limited amount of organic pollutants from wastewater before discharge 4 conclusions this study demonstrated that synchronized oxidation adsorption process soa was an efficient technique to remove the hard cod from biological effluent of coking wastewater compared with pfsc soa performed higher removal efficiencies of cod at the same ph and dosages of fe soa can remove some parts of organics which pfsc could not remove hpoa was the dominant fraction in biological effluent and soa enhanced the removal of hpoa compared to pfsc during the process of coking wastewater treatment by soa carboxylation of organics occurred though the oxidation of oh meanwhile fulvic acid was used as the model organics to analyze the mechanism of soa in this study a possible mechanism of soa was proposed the intermediate products rich in carboxyl groups were generated though the functional groups modification of oh and then the intermediate products were effectively adsorbed by the newly state nano hydrolyzed fe3 particles moreover full scale experiment demonstrated that soa was an effective

18092,efficient removal of the non biodegradable organics from the biological effluent of industrial wastewater is becoming more and more important with the increasing demand for stringent discharge regulation in this study a synchronized oxidation adsorption soa technology was proposed for the removal of hardly biodegradable cod hard cod from the biological effluent of coking wastewater and its performance was verified in a full scale coking industrial park wastewater treatment plant q 5 000 m3 d the soa was performed by coupling oxidation by hydroxyl radical molar ratio of fe2 to h2o2 of 1 1 and ph 5 0 0 2 and adsorption by in situ formed nano hydrolyzed fe3 particles nano feooh the nano hydrolyzed fe3 particles formed during the soa exhibited a much higher specific surface area 22 83 m2 g than the particles 10 87 m2 g formed during the polyferric sulfate coagulation pfsc in comparison to pfsc soa performed better in terms of average cod removal 39 vs 18 from the biological effluent wastewater fractionation result showed that soa performed better in the removal of the hydrophobic acid matters which was supported by the experiment using fulvic acid as the model organics mechanism studies using both biological effluent and fulvic acid solution showed that more carboxylic substances were adsorbed by the in situ formed nano hydrolyzed fe3 particles formed by soa than by pfsc which was likely due to the generation of carboxylic substances by hydroxyl radical oxidation in the full scale the cod was reduced from 118 5 198 0 mg l in the pfsc pretreated effluent to 61 5 104 0 mg l through soa treatment the soa treatment characterized with a mild ph condition ph 5 and low molar ratio of fe2 to h2o2 1 1 is particularly suitable for the polishing purpose to remove limited amount of organic pollutants from wastewater before discharge graphical abstract image 1 keywords tertiary treatment industrial wastewater in situ synchronized oxidation adsorption nano hydrolyzed fe3 particles carboxyl compounds 1 introduction as an advanced process fenton oxidation has been widely used for the removal of bio refractory organic pollutants in industrial wastewater behin et al 2017 panizza and cerisola 2004 because of the strong oxidation potential of the hydroxyl radical oh generated during the reaction fenton oxidation can mineralize most organic compounds in wastewater solano et al 2015 thiam et al 2015 if sufficient amounts of reagent are supplied in addition to oxidizing power several studies have stated that the adsorption capacity of the ferric hydroxide particles formed during fenton oxidation should not be neglected gao et al 2004 meriç et al 2005 zhang et al 2014 reported that adsorption by ferric hydroxide plays an important role in chemical oxygen demand cod removal when using fenton oxidation to treat dye wastewater we also observed a similar phenomenon when treating oilfield wastewater via the fenton process gao et al 2004 the fe3 generated during fenton oxidation exhibits a much higher hydrolysis rate than the normal coagulation process using ferric salt gao et al 2009 the hydrolyzed fe3 produced in the fenton process may be an important reason for the relatively high adsorption performance of fenton process on the other hand some compounds with carboxylic groups are also produced during fenton oxidation kallel et al 2009 lyu et al 2015 and these compounds are reported to be easily removed by forming complexes with ferric oxyhydroxide or oxide cheng and chi 2002 yost et al 1990 industrial wastewater often contains leftover bio refractory compounds hard cod in biological effluents which need to be removed to meet the increasingly stringent discharge standards wu et al 2018 although fenton oxidation is very effective in the removal of hard cod from wastewater the low reaction ph 3 0 iskander et al 2019 and slow cycle between fe3 and fe2 make it a complicated and costly approach for tertiary treatment purposes xing et al 2018 as biological effluent usually contains hard cod requiring further removal we assumed that the strong adsorption potential of the hydrolyzed fe3 particles formed during fenton oxidation could be fully employed for tertiary treatment with a smaller footprint and lower chemical doses in such a case reactions could occur under moderate ph conditions as there would be no need to promote the cycle between fe3 and fe2 thus a synchronized oxidation adsorption technology soa was proposed as a tertiary treatment approach where the oxidation of fe2 to fe3 hydrolysis of fe3 and transformation and adsorption of organic compounds could proceed simultaneously under moderate ph conditions treatment of coking wastewater has been a big challenge because considerable amount of unknown organic compounds still remain in the biologically treated effluents requiring further treatment li et al 2016a qian et al 1994 wu et al 2018 excitation emission matrix eem resin fractionation and size exclusion chromatography have been used to characterize organics from the biological effluents the residual organics in the biological effluents have been found to mainly include fulvic acid like substances and hydrophobic compounds with a relatively low molecular weight ren et al 2018 yang et al 2018 zhao et al 2009 these residual organic compounds are difficult to remove even with ozonation or fenton oxidation processes jiang et al 2011 zhang et al 2015 coagulation using iron salts has been employed to treat the biological effluents of coking wastewater shen et al 2014 lai et al 2007 assumed that charge neutralization and complexation might be the major mechanisms for the removal of the organics from coking wastewater by coagulation however coagulation alone is still not sufficient for meeting the discharge standard the aim of the present study was to investigate the performance mechanism and engineering application of the proposed soa technology by treating biological effluent of coking wastewater thus we evaluated the performance of soa in the removal of hard cod from the biological effluent of coking wastewater by comparing with the conventional polyferric sulfate coagulation pfsc to better understand the cod removal mechanisms the organic compounds in the biological effluent were fractionated using xad resins with the organics removal efficiency of each fraction then evaluated fulvic acid was used as model organics to further explore the organics removal mechanism in addition the soa technology was adopted in a full scale coking industrial park wastewater treatment plant wuhai china to determine the applicability of this approach in practice the results of this study should provide a scientific basis for establishing effective tertiary treatment technology to improve industrial wastewater 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and wastewater all reagents were of analytical grade except where noted deionized water was used for the preparation of solutions solutions of 0 5 mm h2o2 and 0 5 mm feso4 were freshly prepared before the soa experiments industrial grade polyferric sulfate total concentration of fe of 18 5 w w was used for the coagulation experiments the biological effluent from a coking plant in tangshan city hebei province china were collected and stored in the lab at 4 c another biological effluent from coking plant in handan city was also collected and selected to verify the cod removal performances of coking wastewater treatment by soa the biological effluent of coking wastewater was pretreated using polyferric sulfate prior to the experiments the optimum ph for the pretreatment was determined to be 5 0 0 2 fig s1a as shown in fig s1b the cod removal efficiency only increased a little when the fe dosage was higher than 1 mm therefore the dosage of fe for pretreatment was 1 mm for biological effluent from handan city the dosage of fe for pretreatment was 0 8 mm shown in fig s5a the pretreated wastewater ph 5 0 0 2 fe dose 1 mm was mentioned as biological effluent in the following description water quality parameters of biological effluent which collected from coking plant in tangshan city before and after pretreatment ph 5 0 0 2 fe dose 1 mm are presented in table s1 fulvic acid bosf china was used as model organics to prepare synthetic wastewater 2 2 experimental procedure both the soa and pfsc experiments were conducted in 300 ml glass beakers under the same reaction conditions for soa treatment feso4 solution was added to the beakers containing 200 ml of biological effluent followed by the addition of h2o2 solution molar ratio of fe2 to h2o2 of 1 1 under magnetic stirring at 200 rpm and the reaction time lasted for 30 min the optimum ph for soa treatment was determined over a ph range between 4 0 0 2 and 7 0 0 2 the ph was adjusted to targeted values using 5 m naoh or 3 m h2so4 during the experiment the treated wastewater was then collected and filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane filter for analysis for pfsc treatment 0 25 m polyferric sulfate solution was added to the beakers containing 200 ml of biological effluent followed by the addition of 5 m naoh to adjust ph all other procedures were the same as the soa experiment fulvic acid concentration 0 1 g l solutions were prepared to simulate wastewater and were treated as described above the full scale coking wastewater treatment plant is located in a coking industrial park in wuhai city china the influent of the coking industrial park wastewater treatment plant was mainly from five local coking plants in the industrial park with a total inflow to the treatment plant of 5 000 m3 d the influent was initially treated by a biological system in the five coking plants respectively and then discharged into the coking industrial park wastewater treatment plant the water quality of effluent discharged from five coking plants and the influent in the full scale plant of the industrial park are shown in table s2 to enhance cod removal soa was adopted in the upgrade of the full scale coking industrial park wastewater treatment process the treatment processes before and after the upgrade are shown in fig s2 the retention time for both of pfsc and soa was 45 min the tank volume information is listed in table s3 2 3 fractionation of wastewater modified wastewater fractionation was performed using dax 8 supelite dax 8 supelco and xad 4 amberlite xad 4 sigma aldrich resins in succession according to the procedures described by leenheer 1981 and malcolm and maccarthy 1992 briefly 200 ml of filtered sample was acidified to ph 2 0 with 12 1 m hcl after that the sample recorded as dissolved organic carbon 1 doc 1 was pumped through dax 8 and then xad 4 at a flow rate of 120 ml h following the procedure shown in fig s3 the doc of the effluent from dax 8 e 8 was recorded as doc 2 and included transphilic and hydrophilic substances the doc of the effluent from xad 4 was recorded as doc 5 and assigned as hydrophilic hpi hydrophobic substances which included hydrophobic acid hpoa and hydrophobic neutral hpon were adsorbed on the dax 8 resin and hpoa was eluted as doc 3 with 0 1 m naoh at a flow rate of 60 ml h transphilic substances which contained transphilic acid tpia and transphilic neutral tpin were retained on the xad 4 resin and tpia was eluted as doc 4 in the same manner both hpon and tpin were calculated using the following equations 5 hpon doc 1 doc 2 doc 3 6 tpin doc 2 doc 5 doc 4 the volumes of all fractions were increased to 200 ml

here xps measurement was not only used to determine iron species in particles but also the functional groups in organics from the coking wastewater before xps analyses the liquid state samples and

background raman spectra were recorded using a raman system horiba jy hr evolution france equipped with a 532 nm laser 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparison between soa and pfsc in removal of hard cod and in cost analysis the highest cod removal was acquired at ph 5 in the biological effluent during soa treatment as shown in fig s4 thus the ph was fixed at 5 0 0 2 for the following treatment experiments fig 1 a compares the efficiencies of soa molar ratio of fe2 to h2o2 1 1 ph 5 0 0 2 and pfsc ph 5 0 0 2 in removing cod from biological effluent under different fe doses in the pfsc system the removal efficiency of cod increased from 8 6 to 17 9 with the increase in fe dose from 1 to 4 mm this increase is understandable as the biological effluent was already pretreated with polyferric sulfate 1 mm fe and most organic compounds that could be adsorbed by the hydrolyzed fe3 particles had already been removed in the soa system however the cod removal efficiency increased to 18 1 by only employing an fe dose of 1 mm and further increased to 38 7 with the further increase of the fe dose to 4 mm showing that the soa system could remove some organic fractions that could not be removed by pfsc a similar result was achieved in treating biological effluent from another coking plant from handan city as seen in fig s5 comparison of the soa and pfsc treatment costs was conducted as shown in table 1 to achieve the same cod removal target the cost of soa treatment was approximately one fifth of that of the pfsc treatment more important the soa treatment can achieve a cod removal that the pfsc cannot to figure out the brief contribution of adsorption for organics removal the toc content in the particles after soa treatment was evaluated as shown in table s5 the absorbed toc in the particles 4 38 mg was similar to the toc difference before and after soa treatment 4 17 mg of the biological effluent of coking wastewater this result suggested that the organics removal was mainly contributed by adsorption while the role of the oxidation process was to modify the organics several factors might be responsible for the differences observed in cod removal performance between the two processes e g transformation of organics by hydroxyl radicals during soa and higher adsorption capacity of the hydrolyzed fe3 oxidized from fe2 which will be explored in the following sections 3 2 comparison between soa and pfsc in removing different organic fractions as depicted in fig 2 a the biological effluent included hpoa hpi tpia tpin and hpon which accounted for 34 2 27 5 13 3 12 9 and 12 1 of doc respectively hpoa and hpi were the two main fractions present in the biological effluent which was similar to that reported in a previous study zhao et al 2009 pfsc could remove a small portion of the transphilic and hydrophilic fractions including hpi tpia and tpin but not hpoa or hpon the most significant difference between the two processes was that soa could remove a substantial portion of hpoa the eem intensity changes in hpoa tpia and hpi during soa and pfsc are shown in fig 2b results indicated that soa was much more efficient than pfsc in reducing the fluorescence intensities of hpoa and hpi as the doc of the hpi fraction was not significantly reduced by soa it may be possible that soa destroyed the fluorescent structure in the hpi fraction through oxidation 3 3 changes in functional groups after soa and pfsc treatment to explore the removal mechanisms the pollutants in wastewater and on particles were characterized before and after soa and pfsc treatment xps c1s spectrum measurement was performed to reveal the changes in the chemical structure of the pollutants in the biological soa and pfsc effluent according to the binding energies the detected c1s spectra were assigned to aromatic carbon cc aliphatic carbon c c ether or alcohol carbon c o ketonic carbon co and carboxylic carbon o co lin et al 2014 monteil rivera et al 2000 shao et al 2014 as shown in fig 3 and fig s6 it was clear that only the carboxylic carbons were not detected in the biological effluent interestingly the carboxylic groups were detected after soa treatment mainly in the hpoa and tpia fractions suggesting that some new compounds possessing carboxylic groups were formed which may be due to oxidation by oh as shown in table 2 and fig s7 the oxygen containing group o containing group was found at a much higher percentage in the soa effluent 14 4 than in the pfsc effluent 2 1 and the carboxylic group was found at a much higher percentage on the soa particles 9 8 than on the pfsc particles 3 8 during soa the hydroxyl radical oh was produced as shown in fig s8a thus the increased o containing group and carboxylic group in the soa effluent and particles were likely associated with the oxidation of organic matter by oh the o containing groups particularly the carboxylic group are known to exhibit a higher affinity to iron oxyhydroxide surfaces lv et al 2016 which could partly explain the advantage of the soa system 3 4 differences between soa and pfsc in nano hydrolyzed fe3 particles the nano hydrolyzed fe3 particles formed in pure water with soa and pfsc treatment were characterized using different methods characterization of the particles using xps figs s9a b atr ftir fig s10a raman fig s10b xrd fig s11 and hr tem fig s12 revealed no obvious structural differences between the soa and pfsc particles both the soa and pfsc particles belonged to feooh fig s9 and fig s10 li et al 2018 liu et al 2016 and exhibited an amorphous structure fig s11 and fig s12 as shown in fig s13 however the average particle size in the soa system increased from 71 9 nm to 125 3 nm over 30 min which was much smaller than that formed during pfsc from 149 8 nm to 322 9 nm our previous study revealed that h2o2 can form a complex with fe3 which can inhibit the complexation of fe3 with the hydroxide ligand gao et al 2009 and may lead to a slower growth rate of nano hydrolyzed fe3 particles as shown in table 3 the specific surface area and pore volume of the nano hydrolyzed fe3 particles in the soa system were 22 83 m2 g and 0 042 cm3 g respectively much higher than those in the pfsc system 10 37 m2 g and 0 016 cm3 g the smaller particle size and larger specific surface area and pore volume of the soa particles likely contributed to the higher cod adsorption capacity 3 5 exploration of soa treatment mechanisms using model organics fulvic acid was used as model organic matter to further explore the removal mechanism of organics in the soa system as shown in fig 1b the doc removal efficiency increased to 59 6 with the increase of the fe dose to 5 mm in the soa system but only increased to 16 6 with the same fe doses in the pfsc system showing that the soa system was much more efficient in the removal of fulvic acid similar with the result of the soa treatment for biological effluent the removal of toc was also found to be mainly contributed by adsorption table s5 as shown in fig s14 both the biological effluent of coking wastewater and fulvic acid solution mainly contained organic fractions with a molecular weight below 500 da suggesting that fulvic acid could to some extent to represent the organic fractions in biological effluent of coking wastewater the organic compounds with different molecular weights were reduced further which was consistent with fulvic acid treatment result the atr ftir analysis results of the nano hydrolyzed fe3 particles formed during soa or pfsc treatment over a wide range of fe doses are shown in fig s15 the adsorption bands at 1639 1600 cm 1 and 1400 1380 cm 1 were assigned to the carboxyl groups fu and quan 2006 gu et al 1994 the intensities at 1610 cm 1 and 1380 cm 1 on the soa particles were much higher than those in the pfsc particles at the same dose suggesting that the nano hydrolyzed fe3 particles formed in the soa system could adsorb more fulvic acid with carboxyl groups than those formed in the pfsc system the atr ftir analysis results of fulvic acid lyophilized from the solution before and after soa or pfsc treatment under different fe doses are shown in fig s16 in the soa system the intensity of the band at 1600 cm 1 increased at first and then decreased with the increase in fe dose from 0 5 to 5 mm however almost no carboxyl group signals could be detected in the fulvic acid solution after pfsc treatment from 0 5 to 5 mm these results suggest that carboxyl groups were generated and were removed by the nano hydrolyzed fe3 particles previous study revealed ligand exchange or bond formation between carboxyl groups and fe during organics adsorption by fe oxyhydroxides chen et al 2014 which could well explain the higher adsorption of fulvic acid with carboxyl groups in the soa system in addition the band at 1639 cm 1 of fulvic acid shifted to a lower frequency 1601 1610 cm 1 after soa treatment suggesting the formation of complexes between carboxyl groups and iron gu et al 1994 the xps results showed that the soa particles contained higher percentage of carboxyl groups 7 2 10 4 than the pfsc particles 4 0 2 6 at the same fe dose fig s17 which was consistent with results of ftir the role of oh in fulvic acid removal by the soa treatment was further investigated by spiking isopropanol ipa as an oh quencher as shown in fig 4 li et al 2016b the content of fulvic acid was measured using a uv vis spectrophotometer at 270 nm chang et al 2017 xu et al 2012 as shown in fig 4a only oh radicals were detected in the soa treatment an ipa dose of 4 mm largely reduced the oh radical signals resulting in marked decrease in fulvic acid removal fig 4b in order to confirm if the competitive adsorption between ipa and fa had reduced the fa removal the adsorption capabilities of the nano particles for ipa were evaluated at 2 and 4 mm respectively as shown in fig s18 the fa concentration determined as doc exhibited positive correlation with the absorbance of uv270 on the other hand ipa has little absorption at 270 nm fig 4b so the adsorbed amounts of fa and ipa onto the nano particles could be approximately calculated by simultaneously analyzing the changes of doc and absorbance at uv270 before and after the soa treatment as shown in table s6 the adsorbed amounts of fa decreased from 206 3 mg g fe to 121 4 mg g fe and 108 9 mg g fe when ipa was added with a concentration of 2 and 4 mm respectively by comparison the corresponding adsorbed amounts of ipa were only 25 9 mg g fe and 14 3 mg g fe respectively suggesting that ipa was not a strong competitor of fa for the adsorption sites therefore we can speculate that the quench effect of oh not the competitive adsorption of ipa might have mainly accounted for the decrease of the adsorption capability of the nano particles for fa at the same time the ftir analysis showed that the peak intensities of the carboxyl groups in both soa particles and fulvic acid solution treated by soa were reduced largely in the presence of ipa fig s19 similarly the xps analysis results also showed that the carboxyl groups detected on the surface of the soa particles almost disappeared once ipa was added fig s20 thus both the ftir and xps analysis results supported that ipa addition could inhibit the generation of the carboxyl groups due to its oh quenching effect based on the above results the organics removal mechanism of soa treatment was proposed during the soa treatment process oh and fresh nano hydrolyzed fe3 particles were generated via reaction between h2o2 and fe2 compared with those formed in the pfsc system the nano hydrolyzed fe3 particles formed in the soa system exhibited stronger organic adsorption capacity because of their larger specific surface area particularly for the hpoa fraction with rich carboxyl groups fulvic acid which is normally extracted from natural water using dax 8 christensen et al 1998 has been considered to represent the hpoa fraction jung et al 2017 lai et al 2009 of course some hpi fraction may also be included in it chen et al 2003 at the same time the oh generated in the soa system could transform some organic compounds into carboxyl bearing ones which would further enhance the cod removal capacity of soa treatment the hpoa fraction is dominant in diverse industrial wastewaters including textile wastewater and landfill leachate hong et al 2016 labanowski and feuillade 2009 thus it is expected that soa should have wide application in the removal of hard cod from different biological effluents of industrial wastewaters 3 6 application of soa technology in a full scale coking industrial park wastewater treatment plant the feasibility of the soa technology was further verified in a full scale coking industrial park wastewater treatment plant receiving biological effluents from five coking plants in the industrial park the cod of the full scale biological effluent as well as the pfsc and soa effluents was monitored over a period of 27 d as shown in fig 5 the cod of the biological effluent was 274 377 mg l which reduced to 118 5 198 0 mg l after pfsc pretreatment fe dose 1 5 mm ph 4 5 the cod was further reduced to 61 5 104 0 mg l by soa under an fe dose of 1 mm molar ratio of fe2 to h2o2 1 1 ph 4 5 the full scale coking industrial park wastewater treatment plant employing the soa technology has been operated for over one year with satisfactory performance the full scale result was highly consistent with the results achieved in the lab and demonstrated that soa is a promising technology for the treatment of coking wastewater we are evaluating the feasibility of applying the soa technology for the tertiary treatment of other industrial wastewaters the soa technology is on the base of the fenton reaction the major difference between them is that the fenton reaction is mainly focusing on the removal of organic pollutants through hydroxyl radical oxidation while the soa treatment is mainly emphasizing the removal of organic pollutants through coupling oxidation and adsorption process the formation of carboxylic substances and nano particles of hydrolyzed fe3 with a large surface area should be two key factors for the soa technology it is known that the conventional fenton reaction treatment requires an acidic condition ph 3 and high molar ratio of fe2 to h2o2 usually in the range of 1 3 1 40 behin et al 2017 elmolla and chaudhuri 2012 elmolla et al 2010 kavitha and palanivelu 2005 tekin et al 2006 wu et al 2010 the soa treatment is characterized with its mild ph condition ph 5 and much lower molar ratio of fe2 to h2o2 1 1 resulting much less consumption of chemicals and shorter time for the treatment this technology is particularly suitable for the polishing purpose to remove limited amount of organic pollutants from wastewater before discharge 4 conclusions this study demonstrated that synchronized oxidation adsorption process soa was an efficient technique to remove the hard cod from biological effluent of coking wastewater compared with pfsc soa performed higher removal efficiencies of cod at the same ph and dosages of fe soa can remove some parts of organics which pfsc could not remove hpoa was the dominant fraction in biological effluent and soa enhanced the removal of hpoa compared to pfsc during the process of coking wastewater treatment by soa carboxylation of organics occurred though the oxidation of oh meanwhile fulvic acid was used as the model organics to analyze the mechanism of soa in this study a possible mechanism of soa was proposed the intermediate products rich in carboxyl groups were generated though the functional groups modification of oh and then the intermediate products were effectively adsorbed by the newly state nano hydrolyzed fe3 particles moreover full scale experiment demonstrated that soa was an effective

evidencing that meromixis is common at sonachi the high radiation extinction rate could reflect the abundance of pelagic algal biomass e g cyanobacteria ballot et al 2005 and the large amount of dom

typically reported for freshwaters sobek et al 2007 chen et al 2015 and even slight higher than those reported for endorheic saline waters around the world song et al 2019 osburn et al 2011 mariot et al 2007 spe dom showed marked differences with in respect to what is usually reported in inland waters contributions of cram and aromatics were remarkably lower respect to riedel et al 2016 stubbins

in a tropical reservoir during a cyanobacterial bloom bittar et al 2015 respectively overall spe dom at sonachi was more reduced less aromatic and more saturated than typical spe dom from inland waters raeke et al 2017 dadi et al 2017 kellerman et al 2018 the relative low contribution of aromatics and ca pointed to the presence of highly degraded and processed dom altered by intense photodegradation stubbins et al 2006 bittar et al 2015 the relatively high abundance of aliphatics might reflect dom release from pelagic cyanobacteria welker and von dohren 2006 biller et al 2015 aliphatics are considered to be unaffected by photodegradation stubbins et al 2006 timko et al 2015 and their relative contribution might have been additionally amplified by the photodegradation of aromatics at mixolimniom spe dom properties were homogeneous thus evidencing a rapid mixing between the most superficial and oxic layer and the underneath anoxic mixolimnion a subtle change was detected at surface with a slight relative accumulation of o poor cram and o poor aliphatic compounds together to a relative decrease of o rich aromatics fig 3 these small molecular shifts in comparison to the rest of the mixolimnion might be attributable to photo decarboxylation of o rich aromatic molecules lv et al 2017 suggesting that photodegradation might be limited to thet first few

recovery rates of spe extractions in samples collected at the bottom and at the chemocline appendix table si1 were lower compared to the samples from the mixolimnion consequently a large fraction of aliphatic compounds might be missing in the ms analysis of bottom waters additionally highly reduced conditions at the bottom together with high ph probably boosted dom release because of the

signatures higher than 10 in interstitial water pointing to the occurrence of high microbial activities therefore the high contribution of o poor saturated aliphatic substances in out the bottom

et al 2015 but the impact of lake stratification on dom molecular signatures is almost overlooked dadi et al 2017 reported that in a reservoir with a doc fe molar ratio of around 40 the unsaturated and o rich spe dom components were adsorbed onto ferric iron minerals under epilimnetic oxic conditions and were released under anoxic and reduced conditions at the sediments following reduction of solid ferric iron to soluble ferrous iron at lake sonachi the dom absorption desorption processes related to iron redox cycling appeared to be less relevant because the oxic conditions persisted only in the first meter of the water column further total dissolved iron concentration in water was below 0 7 μm unpublished data from authors and the doc fe molar ratio was higher than 10000 in consequence the influence of adsorption desorption processes of unsaturated and o rich dom bound to ferric iron minerals can be considered negligible regarding to non oxygen heteroatomic molecules the relative intensity of n bearing molecules was about 3 4 times higher than that reported in large rivers and it was in the same range of that measured in ancient ocean waters riedel et al 2016 and in submarine hydrothermal fluids gomez saez et al 2016 on the other side the percentage of chos molecules was similar to that reported in freshwaters riedel et al 2016 kellermann et al 2018 but much lower than in hydrothermal fluids with evidence of abiotic sulfurisation by h2s gomez saez et al 2016 or in sewage sludge waters lv et al 2017 further chos molecules tend to be slightly smaller and

song et al 2019 dom in saline alkaline endorheic systems has attracted little attention and these ecosystems are missing in reviews focused on dom quantity and quality in inland waters worldwide sobek

conclusion our study reveals that slars provide unique reservoirs of microbially derived photodegraded low aromatic and saturated o poor dom suggesting that a full understanding of the processes governing dom availability and properties in inland waters sobek et al 2007 chen et al 2015 kellermann et al 2015 needs to include a recognition of the processes taking place in endorheic saline alkaline lakes characterized by a high productivity the dom molecular signature in endorheic saline alkaline lake sonachi reflected the pressure exerted by photodegradation acting at the same time as microbial production and degradation photodegradation might be at work within the first few centimeters of the water surface while the greatest changes in quantity reactivity and molecular signature were located at the chemocline under steep geochemical gradients these findings emphasize that next to regional scale climatic and hydrological drivers small scale internal discontinuities create

respectively meybeck 1995 dodds and whiles 2002 wurtsbaugh et al 2017 the saline alkaline lakes of the east african rift thereafter slars are among the most distinctive in the world slars contribute up to 75 of total lake area in this region and cover a total area of 13000 km2 with single lake areas ranging from 8800 km2 lake turkana down to tens of crater lakes smaller than 0 5 km2 their ph and alkalinity are typically in excess of 9 5 and 50 meq l 1 respectively hecky and kilham 1973 a striking feature is a daily pelagic primary production of more than 10 g o2 m 2 melack 1982 oduor and schagerl 2007 which is significantly higher than that recorded in freshwater ecosystems lewis 2011 this high productivity is sustained by planktonic cyanobacteria up to 107 108 cells ml 1 zinabu and

high density of pelagic cyanobacteria and high and constant incident solar radiation are likely to strongly affect dom quality as well cyanobacteria release aliphatic compounds bittar et al 2015 as a

of a mass peak is referred to as molecule in this article although one molecular formula can represent several different structural isomers only formulas with 10 dbe o 10 dbe double bound equivalents

stratification on dom the sample at chemocline resulted the most dissimilar one fig 2 van krevelen space visually illustrated how spe dom differed across samples fig 2 the chemocline sample showed relatively high peak intensities ranks 1 and 2 in the region h c 1 and o c 0 6 in contrast the weakest peaks ranks 6 and 7 were preferentially located at o c 0 5 in the monimolimnion the most intense

lake water electrical conductivity oxygen ph and light extinction rate reported in the present study were similar to those reported in previous studies melack et al 1982 melack and macintyre 2016 evidencing that meromixis is common at sonachi the high radiation extinction rate could reflect the abundance of pelagic algal biomass e g cyanobacteria ballot et al 2005 and the large amount of dom suggesting that its photo degradation is effective only within the first few centimeters of the water column doc concentrations within the water column were 1 2 orders of magnitude higher than those typically reported for freshwaters sobek et al 2007 chen et al 2015 and even slight higher than those reported for endorheic saline waters around the world song et al 2019 osburn et al 2011 mariot et al 2007 spe dom showed marked differences with in respect to what is usually reported in inland waters contributions of cram and aromatics were remarkably lower respect to riedel et al 2016 stubbins et al 2006 while aliphatics were significantly higher fig 4 higher or comparable aliphatic relative contributions were reported only in a coastal antarctic pond i e pony lake kellerman et al 2018 and in a tropical reservoir during a cyanobacterial bloom bittar et al 2015 respectively overall spe dom at sonachi was more reduced less aromatic and more saturated than typical spe dom from inland waters raeke et al 2017 dadi et al 2017 kellerman et al 2018 the relative low contribution of aromatics and ca pointed to the presence of highly degraded and processed dom altered by intense photodegradation stubbins et al 2006 bittar et al 2015 the relatively high abundance of aliphatics might reflect dom release from pelagic cyanobacteria welker and von dohren 2006 biller et al 2015 aliphatics are considered to be unaffected by photodegradation stubbins et al 2006 timko et al 2015 and their relative contribution might have been additionally amplified by the photodegradation of aromatics at mixolimniom spe dom properties were homogeneous thus evidencing a rapid mixing between the most superficial and oxic layer and the underneath anoxic mixolimnion a subtle change was detected at surface with a slight relative accumulation of o poor cram and o poor aliphatic compounds together to a relative decrease of o rich aromatics fig 3 these small molecular shifts in comparison to the rest of the mixolimnion might be attributable to photo decarboxylation of o rich aromatic molecules lv et al 2017 suggesting that photodegradation might be limited to thet first few centimeters of the water column as suggested by underwater uva and uvb vertical profiles fig 1e interestingly most spe dom descriptors i e noscw massw aliphaticw aromaticw o cw h cw table 1 and fig 3 showed abrupt changes at chemocline this finding together with dom mass balance estimates evidenced that the chemocline was a site of remarkable readjustment of dom concentration and of the spe dom molecular signature at the bottom and at the chemocline the additional increase in the relative contribution of saturated o poor aliphatics was interpreted to reflect the release of microbially derived dom lechtenfeld et al 2015 and the degradation of cyanobacteria algae detritus accumulated at the sediments water interface verschuren 1999 the abundance of aliphatic substances at the lake bottom might be even larger than that detected by ft icr ms analyses raeke et al 2016 reported that ppl sorbents are less efficient in retaining o poor o c 0 4 and saturated i e h c 1 5 molecules dom recovery rates of spe extractions in samples collected at the bottom and at the chemocline appendix table si1 were lower compared to the samples from the mixolimnion consequently a large fraction of aliphatic compounds might be missing in the ms analysis of bottom waters additionally highly reduced conditions at the bottom together with high ph probably boosted dom release because of the deprotonation of mineral sediments with subsequent reduction of their dom adsorption potential grybos et al 2009 organic rich sediment of slar host a highly complex and unique consortium of alkaliphilic prokaryotes grant and jones 2016 almost nothing is known about the magnitude of their in situ activities but a rough idea can be deduced from ceiling 1996 who reported values of δ13cdic signatures higher than 10 in interstitial water pointing to the occurrence of high microbial activities therefore the high contribution of o poor saturated aliphatic substances in out the bottom samples is likely a signature of high microbial activity at the sediment water interface ft icr ms has been extensively used to explore spe dom chemodiversity across lakes at regional scale kellerman et al 2015 but the impact of lake stratification on dom molecular signatures is almost overlooked dadi et al 2017 reported that in a reservoir with a doc fe molar ratio of around 40 the unsaturated and o rich spe dom components were adsorbed onto ferric iron minerals under epilimnetic oxic conditions and were released under anoxic and reduced conditions at the sediments following reduction of solid ferric iron to soluble ferrous iron at lake sonachi the dom absorption desorption processes related to iron redox cycling appeared to be less relevant because the oxic conditions persisted only

18094,biocide emissions have been shown to pose a comparable risk to aquatic life as pesticides in urbanized catchments sources of biocides have been reported to be steady flows from wastewater treatment plants as well as direct building wash off during rain events a simple methodology to separate wastewater from surface runoff contribution during flood waves had been missing until now this study introduces an elegant passive sampler method used to derive source allocation during flood waves based on the recalcitrant wastewater tracer carbamazepine field calibration of sampling rates during low and high flow with continuous autosampler monitoring indicated that uptake rates of polar compounds in caged pocis are very close in both hydrological situations allowing for a direct comparison the passive sampler regressions showed that on a regional level carbendazim originated essentially from wastewater flows while surface runoff contributed 31 and 74 respectively to terbutryn and diuron mass flows during flood waves a local autosampler campaign on a 38 km2 catchment using the same wastewater marker approach found increasing surface runoff allocations with event flow in the order terbutryn carbendazim diuron in accordance with results from a nearby combined sewer overflow both source allocation methods can be used to establish pertinent regional and local biocide mitigation plans the passive sampler approach is by far the more cost efficient method graphical abstract image 1 keywords biocides wastewater surface runoff passive samplers tracers 1 introduction biocides came under scrutiny in the last decade as it appeared they might have at least a comparable impact on surface waters to pesticides originating from agricultural surface runoff wittmer et al 2010 2011 a common narrative focused rapidly on façade render as an important source of biocide emissions and extensive studies were devoted to the dynamics of release as well as possible exhaustion of emission sources over time burkhardt et al 2012 coutu et al 2012 bollmann et al 2014a b however biocides like diuron terbutryn and carbendazim which are the most prominent compounds used in façade render are also constantly present in wastewater treatment plant wwtp inlets gallé et al 2019a and in surface waters under low flow conditions gallé et al 2019b dry vs wet weather balancing at wwtp inlets bollmann et al 2014a b as well as catchment source balancing wittmer et al 2011 gave a large share to dry weather wwtp inputs for common biocides often 50 the cleaning of painting equipment like brushes has been proposed as a regular dry weather source bollmann et al 2014a b for carbendazim a recent investigation puts forward its use in textiles and paper as a constant source from households and industry merel et al 2018 the current knowledge has however been derived from a few case studies in small catchments individual wwtp inlets or combined sewer overflows methods to distinguish sources of biocides rely on temporally highly resolved monitoring with autosamplers and the interpretation of chemographs in the light of dilution or mobilisation during rain events wittmer et al 2010 the ratio between dry weather concentrations of biocides and pharmaceuticals was used to differentiate first flush contributions from surface runoff in sewer overflows during rain events launay et al 2016 this method showed diuron and terbutryn to have dominant runoff sources during rain events while carbendazim had a weaker dry weather wet weather ratio of 1 indicating much less mobilization the cited investigations were limited in time and differences in loads between events were sometimes important wittmer et al 2011 in view of the reduced representativeness the variability of the results and given the important effort involved in order to gain locally relevant results allowing water managers to formulate adequate mitigation strategies the need for a simpler and yet reliable monitoring approach is obvious here we propose a strategy that uses passive samplers as yet another variant of inert tracer use to derive contributions of surface runoff for biocides on larger scales the tracer approach has already been used for the determination of wwtp elimination rates and inlet loads gallé et al 2019a as well as the characterization of the immission situation in surface waters via geographical information data gallé et al 2019b to corroborate the findings chemograph analysis during flood waves in a river as well as the pollutant dynamics in a sewer overflow will be evaluated in parallel giving a multiscale perspective to the approach 2 materials and methods 2 1 monitoring strategy passive samplers can be used to continuously monitor water resources during extended periods of time where they outcompete more cumbersome approaches like autosampling by their ease of use lower cost and potential deployment on a higher number of sites however the uncertainty prevailing on how to transform collected masses of pollutants to ambient concentrations during the exposure period still discourages many regulators and scientific investigators from a quantitative use of passive samplers miège et al 2015 in principle the calculation of the time weighted average twa is rather straightforward for kinetic passive samplers through the application of a compound specific sampling rate rs that is easily calibrated through a defined uptake experiment in the laboratory however sampling rates in the field have been reported to deviate strongly during field exposures and found to be dependent on local environmental conditions such as flow velocity temperature and membrane fouling harman et al 2012 performance reference compounds prc mostly consisting of deuterated analogues of the target compounds that are spiked to the passive sampler before exposure and whose loss during the exposure period is used to adjust the sampling rate proved to be useful for hydrophobic compounds but have been questioned for polar compounds in pocis type passive samplers harman et al 2011a the mixed nature of the hlb resin in pocis with partitioning as well as more specific sorption interactions in parallel yield different reversibility and desorption kinetics making it difficult to find matching prcs for target compounds field calibrations with parallel autosampler monitoring yield the most reliable local sampling rates although their representativeness might be limited harman et al 2011b moschet et al 2015 our approach has been to calibrate passive samplers during low flow conditions in many sites with the help of grab samples assuming the variability of the concentration for pharmaceuticals is low and using multisite regressions to explore the variability of rs and derive a single rs for use in a whole campaign gallé et al 2019a 2019b the influence of flow velocity on sampling rates in rivers with realistic exposures in est cages proved to be of limited variability with a factor 2 between sites under low flow conditions gallé et al 2019b flow velocity has nevertheless been shown to affect sampling rate on naked disks in laboratory uptake experiments hence if we want to compare the contaminant masses collected during low flow to those gathered in flood waves with potentially 10 fold differences in water velocity we need to either show that differences in sampling rates are negligible or to provide a pertinent calibration for each hydrological situation for this purpose autosamplers with event triggered high resolution sampling were used in parallel to passive sampling the calibration was then simply done on the basis of an event mean concentration emc which was compared to the passive sampler contaminant mass with mt the collected mass at time t r s m t e m c t the setup was installed in the upper catchment of the mamer river 35 km2 downstream of a major wwtp outlet with a water level triggered iscco 6712 autosampler using 12 1 l glass bottles per set sampling was discrete and programmed to be at half an hour frequency at the beginning of the sampling followed by larger spaced intervals five flood waves were successfully sampled during october 2013 fig 5 samples were analysed for basic parameters like nh4 doc and anions as well as pharmaceuticals and biocides in addition a ysi 600 oms continuously recorded the conductivity and turbidity on the sampling site 15 min intervals passive samplers were exchanged after each event and consisted of two separate discs with 200 mg oasis hlb as absorber each held by a pes membrane between two washers discs were exposed in small est canisters installed midstream and attached to a spiral anchor that was secured in the river bed once the sampling rate issue settled the method consists in comparing the slopes of the regressions between carbamazepine as a wastewater indicator and the corresponding biocide between low flow situations and flood waves the difference in slope is equivalent to the contribution by surface runoff since wastewater also contributes biocides discharged via wwtps and combined sewer overflows the surface runoff contribution is estimated from the difference of the mass ratios of the biocides and the pharmaceutical tracer assuming that the contribution of biocides by wastewater estimated for base flow remains proportional to carbamazepine in flood waves hence we have a very simple method with which to calculate source contribution applicable to a whole catchment through the exposure of a larger number of passive samplers the only condition is to achieve successful exposures during low flow and defined high flow conditions during the campaign eight passive samplers two discs each were exposed on eight sites characterised by different impact of wwtp outlets and sealed surfaces as well as different surface runoff regimes combined vs separate sewers the sites of the passive and autosampler together with their catchment properties can be inspected in the supplementary material s1 the autosampler data from the mamer site were also used to calculate the surface runoff contribution through chemograph analysis by setting a low flow ratio of biocides vs pharmaceuticals like carbamazepine and diclofenac and using the excess load during flood waves for surface runoff contribution discharge data used to calculate loads came from a nearby gauge 500 m upstream of the wwtp during flood waves the discharge contribution of the wwtp is minor compared to the natural runoff and as all calculations have the same basis our comparative evaluation is not affected by this absolute error in addition an autosampler was installed in the combined sewer overflow at the inlet of the mamer wwtp to check for the consistence of the biocide source contribution in the combined sewer signal we used an isco 6712 autosampler triggered by water level in the combined sewer overflow dry under normal conditions data were exploited for a global analysis of dilution of biocides with respect to nh4 or pharmaceuticals during rain events 2 2 sample treatment and analysis after collection the hlb resin of passive samplers was transferred to 3 ml glass columns extraction of the columns was performed with 10 ml of 1 1 acetonitrile dichloromethane on a gilson gx 274 liquid handler and furthermore reduced in volume under nitrogen flow for analysis concentrations of the target analytes in the passive sampler extracts have been determined using an lc esi ms ms system finnigan tsq quantum discovery max with a finnigan surveyor lc pump plus and a finnigan surveyor ms pump plus thermo electron corporation san josé ca usa the samples have been injected using an autosampler htc pal ctc analytics ag zwingen switzerland the separation of the target compounds was carried out with a column hypersil gold aq 100 2 1 mm with 3 μm particle size thermo scientific bonn germany the elution was started with 70 30 ultrapure water 18 mω methanol acidified with 0 1 formic acid with a flow rate of 0 2 ml per minute during the acquisition methanol was increased from 30 to

and the chromatography column hypersil gold 20 2 1 mm particle size 12 μm from thermo scientific bonn germany per measurement cycle 1 ml was injected and extracted with the trapping column afterwards the target compounds were separated in the chromatography column and analysed with a triple quad mass spectrometer a seven point calibration had been prepared in pure water and measured at the beginning of each sequence after ten samples a quality control sample qc and a blank was injected to control system stability qc recoveries varied between 97 7 and 105 6 on average for all compounds with rsds well below 10 blanks were below 1 ng l for all compounds except for terbutryn which was below 3 ng l internal deuterated standards used for quantification were the following carbamazepine d10 diclofenac d4 isoproturon d6 terbuthylazine d5 atrazine 2 hydroxy d5 and atrazine d5 analytical and internal standards for quantification had been purchased from lgc standards molsheim france internal standard recovery had rsds from 7 to 13 for the array of compounds investigated the investigated compounds were the pharmaceuticals carbamazepine diclofenac the biocides diuron terbutryn carbendazim irgarol ipbc iodopropynyl butylcarbamate and oit 2 octyl 2h isothiazol 3 one the latter 3 could not be exploited because of a lack of instrumental sensitivity for highly diluted samples collected during flood waves nh4 was measured using a complexometric method on a photometer doc values came from a tekmar torch combustion toc tn analyzer and anions were determined by a metrohm ion chromatograph 3 results and discussion 3 1 biocide profiles during low flow the results presented here have been collected during a low flow immission characterization campaign over 14 sites with different wastewater impact in a study that has been reported elsewhere fig 1 a gallé et al 2019b the classical biocides diuron terbutryn and carbendazim dominated the profile the relationship between the three most prominent compounds differs for the densely populated catchments and the rural sites fig 1b while the rural areas are dominated by carbendazim and terbutryn with low contributions of diuron 8 sites on the right side of the graph the latter plays a more prominent role in the densely populated catchments with alternating dominance of the three compounds correlations with sealed surfaces are strongest for diuron and terbutryn while carbendazim evolves closer to the pharmaceutical carbamazepine fig 1c this agrees with precedent findings allocating more constant wastewater related sources to carbendazim launay et al 2016 merel et al 2018 however there is a strong autocorrelation between wastewater treatment plant contribution and the sealed surface area in a catchment hence this correlation is not an absolute differentiation criterion it is noteworthy that the outphased irgarol cybutrin and more recent compounds like oit or ipbc were a factor 10 to 100 below the recovered masses of the classical compounds supplementary material s2 3 2 pocis mass and grab sample concentrations three grab samples had been taken during the exposure of the passive samplers in the low flow campaign in order to calculate the sampling rates under the assumption that the substance flows and consequently the concentrations were constant over the period although the exposure period featured a small flood wave fig 2 a which led to a dilution of the last grab sample the correlation between pocis mass and grab sample is still high for the pharmaceutical carbamazepine r 0 91 fig 2b this suggests that the three grab samples average the discharge situation and hence the dilution of the constant carbamazepine input in a realistic way the biocide carbendazim also showed good agreement between grab samples and pocis mass which was to be expected from its source profile while terbutryn and diuron correlated less meaning that their concentration variability was much larger however biocides were always detected during the low flow situations and their concentrations were globally proportional to the mass collected in the passive samplers this suggests that constant discharge from wastewater treatment plants is an important substance flow route note that for diuron due to detection limit issues positives for grab samples were only available in the more densely populated catchments from these regressions a global sampling rate for each compound can be calculated and corresponds to 1 a t for a y ax regression with t being the time of exposure fig 2c the regressions yielded sampling rates that were in accordance with field determined values published in the literature gallé et al 2019b moschet et al 2015 3 3 sampling rate determination in flood waves the monitoring point on the mamer with its parallel passive samplers and a water level triggered autosampler sampling offered the opportunity to calculate event mean concentrations emc from the compounds chemographs and to put them into a direct relation with the collected mass in the passive samplers fig 3 a shows the flood events of different sizes that were monitored with passive samplers and discrete samples from the autosampler only the periods 1 2 and 4 were sufficiently covered by the autosampler to allow the comparison even within these passive sampler periods a number of time spans without autosampler coverage could exist be it because they were simply low flow periods or that the autosampler had run out of bottles and had not been refilled yet low flow periods as well as the chemograph during the flood wave had been completed with the use of an extrapolation based on a regression of conductivity vs pharmaceutical biocide concentration as shown in fig 3b the regressions can be found in supplementary materials s3 extrapolation has only been used where no grab samples were available grab samples have been interpolated within the periods where the autosampler was running the results of the calculation of the sampling rates via emc and collected masses in the pocis are shown in fig 3c the data used to calculate the event sampling rates can be found in supplementary material s4 the goal of the exercise is to verify if sampling rates differ strongly under varying hydrological conditions to this effect the calculated flood wave sampling rates are compared to those of the low flow regression fig 3c as can be seen most of the sampling rates are close to the low flow value with the exception of diclofenac in wave 4 and diuron in wave 2 which is due to the very low emc and pocis mass during this period adding uncertainty to the calculation supplementary material s4 overall the uncertainties of emc and pocis mass considered it is safe to assume that for the passive sampler s exposure conditions i e in the shielding est canister flow velocity has little effect on sampling rates possibly due to a damping effect of the cages recent literature also suggest that although there are strong differences between quiescent and turbulent conditions differences in flow velocities from 6 to 21 cm s are marginal djomte et al 2018 although more qualitative reported factors for pocis sampling rate increase upon turbulence span from a factor 2 to 7 harman et al 2012 a recent study to validate the in situ use of prcs for pcbs found a maximum factor of increase of roughly 2 estoppey et al 2014 based on prc corrections a canadian study showed that sampling rates for atrazine varied by a factor 4 with a variability however largely explained by differences in temperature and less by water velocity dalton et al 2014 these pocis were directly exposed in a shield in the river based on our results we assume that when exposed in est canisters sampling rates do not differ significantly between low flow and high flow situations and that therefore collected masses can be compared directly between the different hydrological regimes 3 4 biocide source allocation derived from passive sampler data carbamazepine a recalcitrant pharmaceutical that passes conventional treatment plants unaltered has been proposed as a wastewater indicator in the water cycle jekel et al 2015 and correlates well to parameters like sanitary pressure a measure of population equivalents per catchment surface pe ha gallé et al 2019b given that biocides are also released under low flow conditions by wwtps the relationship between concentrations or loads of carbamazepine and the different biocides give insight on the generalized nature of this mass flow from the receiving water viewpoint variability of these ratios could be due to different inlet loads at treatment plant or varying elimination efficiency in a recent survey of 18 wwtps the elimination of biocides in conventional activated sludge treatment proved to be moderate diuron terbutryn to poor carbendazim with median daily eliminations of less than 50 gallé et al 2019a fig 4 c shows the relationship between the passive sampler masses collected on the 8 different sites in the south of luxembourg during the low flow period of the second half of november 2013 fig 4a the relationship is clearly linear with a pearson r of 0 87 and a slope of 0 071 indicating a rather constant relation between diuron and carbamazepine terbutryn and carbendazim align comparably to carbamazepine with a slightly smaller correlation coefficient that is mainly due to one outlier in the chiers catchment related to a suspected industrial source supplementary material s5 if only the dry weather mass flows of biocides were active during flood waves then the ratio between biocides and carbamazepine should remain the same however if additional sources like facades are activated during rain events then the biocides to carbamazepine ratio should increase when applying this to the slopes of the biocide carbamazepine relationship then the differences between the slopes yields the fraction of biocide mobilized by surface runoff hence passive samplers can provide a straightforward estimation of the fractional contribution of both sources in a regionalized averaged way the only thing needed is the sampling of a distinct wet and a dry weather period local differences can also be detected by deviations from the linear relationship fig 4b shows the relationship between diuron and carbamazepine during the high flow period in the first half of november 2013 and yields a much higher slope of 0 2692 compared to the dry weather slope this results in 74 surface runoff contribution for diuron in wet weather situations fig 4d in the same way terbutryn has a share of 31 surface runoff while carbendazim even shows a slight dilution i e wastewater is the main source even during wet weather these findings agree partly with those from bollmann et al 2014b who report that carbendazim mass flows did not differ between dry and wet weather while diuron had a clear wet weather dominance terbutryn however had a dry weather dominance in their case due to a single wwtp inlet note that the standard errors calculated reflect the diversity of the surface runoff contributions in the different catchments and not methodological imprecision the contributions could also be calculated individually the large standard error of the terbutryn contribution is caused by one outlier in the chiers catchment site 1 supplemental material s5 under low flow which is due to an industrial source the censored alternative excluded site 1 while the overall contribution by surfaces remains close the standard error is in that case largely improved standard errors were determined according to error propagation rules for calculated values berthouex and brown 2002 one might question the role of combined overflows spilling untreated wastewater into the receiving water course while it makes no difference for carbamazepine whether treated or untreated wastewater is discharged since the compound is recalcitrant to activated sludge treatment the relationship between carbamazepine concentrations and those of the biocides will not be the same in the cso and at the wwtp outlet the wastewater source might therefore be slightly underestimated even more so that the elimination in the wwtp is also reduced to at most half the dry weather performance because of reduced hydraulic retention time wwtps take up a maximum of twice their dry weather discharge however given the reduced impact on the overall mass flow of first flushes and wwtp outlets in bigger flood events and the fact that biocides from façade emissions are released relatively constantly during rain events burkhardt et al 2012 bollmann et al 2014a the error is probably negligible launay et al 2016 found a mobilisation of carbamazepine during first flushes in combined sewer overflows and explained their origin in sewer deposits we could not find any indication that this was the case in our catchments since carbamazepine followed a general dilution scheme in the combined sewer overflow fig 6 a 3 5 surface runoff contribution via flood wave chemograph analysis since highly resolved flood wave sampling was available for the mamer site the data could also be used for a detailed chemograph analysis and source quantification the individual flood waves are described and commented in the supplementary material s6 here the focus will be placed on the separation of contributing sources which is in essence based on the same principle than for the passive sampler approach the calculation of a ratio between the biocides and a steady flow pharmaceutical such as carbamazepine the only difference here is that for passive samplers the integrated signal over a whole flood event is treated over several sites while for autosamplers discrete samples in the course of the flood wave are considered individually and then used further on to calculate a flood wave load the rationale is that with increasing river discharge the steady mass flow of the pharmaceutical will become further diluted while surface runoff contribution for biocides will increase the ratio between the biocide and the pharmaceutical will therefore increase with increasing discharge this is exactly what can be observed as documented in fig 5b for the pair diuron carbamazepine data processing for source separation operates as follows first the median of the low discharge q90 biocide carbamazepine ratio was used as the steady flow wastewater contribution red dots in fig 5b based on the carbamazepine extrapolation from conductivity measurements this ratio was used to predict the wastewater contribution throughout the flood wave chemograph yielding a wastewater biocide concentration curve along the total biocide curve both curves were used to calculate the instantaneous loads which were then summed up for the event the difference between the total load and the wastewater load will yield the surface runoff load and its fractional contribution fig 5c shows the results in terms of surface runoff contributions as related to event discharge surface runoff contributions increased with event discharge as expected where diuron and carbendazim rapidly reached high levels of 80 90 while terbutryn showed a less steep increase the hierarchy of the 3 compounds runoff contributions also changed in the smaller waves reported mass loads of biocides in pure storm water drained catchments from the literature did not show any correlation to total rain fall but rather to so called driven rain the product of rain intensity and wind speed bollmann et al 2014a b in the present case a catchment of mixed combined sewer and stormwater drainage releases by combined sewers are also expected to vary with rain intensity which makes causal relationships difficult to establish 3 6 dilution tendencies in the combined sewer overflow the autosampler at the combined sewer overflow constitutes the excerpt of the catchment that actually contributes first flush components to the river mass flow because of the patchiness of the overflow activation and the difficulties to quantify its discharge because of the autosampler setting these data are used only qualitatively to inspect whether surface runoff contributions can be detected in the samples for this purpose the simple relationship to ammonium is the most straightforward approach because as opposed to surface waters the source of the latter can only be wastewater fig 6 shows the regressions of carbamazepine and the 3 biocides to ammonium in the grab samples that were sampled in the combined overflow note that these consist of a gradient of concentrated wastewater spills with ammonium concentrations of around 40 mg l to precipitation water diluted samples with ammonium concentration below 10 mg l carbamazepine shows the expected positive correlation to ammonium r 0 704 as does more surprisingly also terbutryn r 0 646 diuron is the only biocide to show a slight negative correlation meaning that upon dilution of ammonium the diuron concentration increases because of surface runoff contribution carbendazim for its part does not show a consistent relation to ammonium these results fit well with the in stream balances of the receiving river where terbutryn also showed the weakest contributions from surface runoff while diuron had a clear input from facades note however that the mamer river catchment features large new build areas including high schools drained in stormwater regime and that these buildings are probably very influential on the immission situation during rain events this might explain the nuances in the contribution profiles between the cso and the in stream balance in the case of carbendazim for instance 4 conclusions this article explores the possibilities to investigate the origin of biocides during flood events by applying 3 methods at different scales the main focus is on discerning the true surface runoff from first flush and wastewater contributions by combined sewer overflows and wwtps during flood waves this is of relevance since there seems to be a constant flow of biocides through wastewater in the perspective of formulating efficient mitigation measures sources and pathways have to be distinguished while the campaigns here were too limited in time to assess the impact of the different sources over a whole year and calculate total loads they nevertheless introduced techniques with which to pinpoint the sources during the events the passive sampling method seems to be the most appropriate method to analyse the source contributions on a larger scale and to describe the general source distribution while the autosamplers are best used in detailed studies in smaller catchments or sewer systems one lesson of this study is that the contributions of surface runoff and wastewater runoff can differ at the small scale mamer river catchment and cso but seem to be rather consistent at the regional scale linear relationship to carbamazepine during flood events this is not a contradiction but should be kept in mind to avoid unwarranted generalizations to analyse the contribution of facades and thereby the pattern of biocides use in a region with dominant combined sewer drainage passive samplers would be the first choice specific local emission patterns for instance in the case of outliers in the passive sampler regressions can only be dealt with with autosamplers if catchments fall below a certain size where the variability of wastewater input is too small for the passive sampler regression approach declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

wittmer et al 2010 the ratio between dry weather concentrations of biocides and pharmaceuticals was used to differentiate first flush contributions from surface runoff in sewer overflows during rain events launay et al 2016 this method showed diuron and terbutryn to have dominant runoff sources during rain events while carbendazim had a weaker dry weather wet weather ratio of 1 indicating much less mobilization the cited investigations were limited in time and differences in loads between events were sometimes important wittmer et al 2011 in view of the reduced representativeness the variability of the results and given the important effort involved in order to gain locally relevant results allowing water managers to formulate adequate mitigation strategies the need for a simpler and yet reliable monitoring approach is obvious here we propose a strategy that uses passive samplers as yet another variant of inert tracer use to derive contributions of surface runoff for biocides on larger scales the tracer approach has already been used for the determination of wwtp elimination rates and inlet loads gallé et al 2019a as well as the characterization of the immission situation in surface waters via geographical information data gallé et al 2019b to corroborate the findings chemograph analysis during flood waves in a river as well as the pollutant dynamics in a sewer overflow will be evaluated in parallel giving a multiscale perspective to the approach 2 materials and methods 2 1 monitoring strategy passive samplers can be used to continuously monitor water resources during extended periods of time where they outcompete more cumbersome approaches like autosampling by their ease of use lower cost and potential deployment on a higher number of sites however the uncertainty prevailing on how to transform collected masses of pollutants to ambient concentrations during the exposure period still discourages many regulators and scientific investigators from a quantitative use of passive samplers miège et al 2015 in principle the calculation of the time weighted average twa is rather straightforward for kinetic passive samplers through the application of a compound specific sampling rate rs that is easily calibrated through a defined uptake experiment in the laboratory however sampling rates in the field have been reported to deviate strongly during field exposures and found to be dependent on local environmental conditions such as flow velocity temperature and membrane fouling harman et al 2012 performance reference compounds prc mostly consisting of deuterated analogues of the target compounds that are spiked to the passive sampler before exposure and whose loss during the exposure period is used to adjust the sampling rate proved to be useful for hydrophobic compounds but have been questioned for polar compounds in pocis type passive samplers harman et al 2011a the mixed nature of the hlb resin in pocis with partitioning as well as more specific sorption interactions in parallel yield different reversibility and desorption kinetics making it difficult to find matching prcs for target compounds field calibrations with parallel autosampler monitoring yield the most reliable local sampling rates although their representativeness might be limited harman et al 2011b moschet et al 2015 our approach has been to calibrate passive samplers during low flow conditions in many sites with the help of grab samples assuming the variability of the concentration for pharmaceuticals is low and using multisite regressions to explore the variability of rs and derive a single rs for use in a whole campaign gallé et al 2019a 2019b the influence of flow velocity on sampling rates in rivers with realistic exposures in est cages proved to be of limited variability with a factor 2 between sites under low flow conditions gallé et al 2019b flow velocity has nevertheless been shown to affect sampling rate on naked disks in laboratory uptake experiments hence if we want to compare the contaminant masses collected during low flow to those gathered in flood waves with potentially 10 fold differences in water velocity we need to either show that differences in sampling rates are negligible or to provide a pertinent calibration for each hydrological situation for this purpose autosamplers with event triggered high resolution sampling were used in parallel to passive sampling the calibration was then simply done on the basis of an event mean concentration emc which was compared to the passive sampler contaminant mass with mt the collected mass at time t r s m t e m c t the setup was installed in the upper catchment of the mamer river 35 km2 downstream of a major wwtp outlet with a water level triggered iscco 6712 autosampler using 12 1 l glass bottles per set sampling was discrete and programmed to be at half an hour frequency at the beginning of the sampling followed by larger spaced intervals five flood waves were successfully sampled during october 2013 fig 5 samples were analysed for basic parameters like nh4 doc and anions as well as pharmaceuticals and biocides in addition a ysi 600 oms continuously recorded the conductivity and turbidity on the sampling site 15 min intervals passive samplers were exchanged after each event and consisted of two separate discs with 200 mg oasis hlb as absorber each held by a pes membrane between two washers discs were exposed in small est canisters installed midstream and attached to a spiral anchor that was secured in the river bed once the sampling rate issue settled the method consists in comparing the slopes of the regressions between carbamazepine as a wastewater indicator and the corresponding biocide between low flow situations and flood waves the difference in slope is equivalent to the contribution by surface runoff since wastewater also contributes biocides discharged via wwtps and combined sewer overflows the surface runoff contribution is estimated from the difference of the mass ratios of the biocides and the pharmaceutical tracer assuming that the contribution of biocides by wastewater estimated for base flow remains proportional to carbamazepine in flood waves hence we have a very simple method with which to calculate source contribution applicable to a whole catchment through the exposure of a larger number of passive samplers the only condition is to achieve successful exposures during low flow and defined high flow conditions during the campaign eight passive samplers two discs each were exposed on eight sites characterised by different impact of wwtp outlets and sealed surfaces as well as different surface runoff regimes combined vs separate sewers the sites of the passive and autosampler together with their catchment properties can be inspected in the supplementary material s1 the autosampler data from the mamer site were also used to calculate the surface runoff contribution through chemograph analysis by setting a low flow ratio of biocides vs pharmaceuticals like carbamazepine and diclofenac and using the excess load during flood waves for surface runoff contribution discharge data used to calculate loads came from a nearby gauge 500 m upstream of the wwtp during flood waves the discharge contribution of the wwtp is minor compared to the natural runoff and as all calculations have the same basis our comparative evaluation is not affected by this absolute error in addition an autosampler was installed in the combined sewer overflow at the inlet of the mamer wwtp to check for the consistence of the biocide source contribution in the combined sewer signal we used an isco 6712 autosampler triggered by water level in the combined sewer overflow dry under normal conditions data were exploited for a global analysis of dilution of biocides with respect to nh4 or pharmaceuticals during rain events 2 2 sample treatment and analysis after collection the hlb resin of passive samplers was transferred to 3 ml glass columns extraction of the columns was performed with 10 ml of 1 1 acetonitrile dichloromethane on a gilson gx 274 liquid handler and furthermore reduced in volume under nitrogen flow for analysis concentrations of the target analytes in the passive sampler extracts have been determined using an lc esi ms ms system finnigan tsq quantum discovery max with a finnigan surveyor lc pump plus and a finnigan surveyor ms pump plus thermo electron corporation san josé ca usa the samples have been injected using an autosampler htc pal ctc analytics ag zwingen switzerland the separation of the target compounds was carried out with a column hypersil gold aq 100 2 1 mm with 3 μm particle size thermo scientific bonn germany the elution was started with 70 30 ultrapure water 18 mω methanol acidified with 0 1 formic acid with a flow rate of 0 2 ml per minute during the acquisition methanol was increased from 30 to

the target compounds were separated in the chromatography column and analysed with a triple quad mass spectrometer a seven point calibration had been prepared in pure water and measured at the beginning of each sequence after ten samples a quality control sample qc and a blank was injected to control system stability qc recoveries varied between 97 7 and 105 6 on average for all compounds with rsds well below 10 blanks were below 1 ng l for all compounds except for terbutryn which was below 3 ng l internal deuterated standards used for quantification were the following carbamazepine d10 diclofenac d4 isoproturon d6 terbuthylazine d5 atrazine 2 hydroxy d5 and atrazine d5 analytical and internal standards for quantification had been purchased from lgc standards molsheim france internal standard recovery had rsds from 7 to 13 for the array of compounds investigated the investigated compounds were the pharmaceuticals carbamazepine diclofenac the biocides diuron terbutryn carbendazim irgarol ipbc iodopropynyl butylcarbamate and oit 2 octyl 2h isothiazol 3 one the latter 3 could not be exploited because of a lack of instrumental sensitivity for highly diluted samples collected during flood waves nh4 was measured using a complexometric method on a photometer doc values came from a tekmar torch combustion toc tn analyzer and anions were determined by a metrohm ion chromatograph 3 results and discussion 3 1 biocide profiles during low flow the results presented here have been collected during a low flow immission characterization campaign over 14 sites with different wastewater impact in a study that has been reported elsewhere fig 1 a gallé et al 2019b the classical biocides diuron terbutryn and carbendazim dominated the profile the relationship between the three most prominent compounds differs for the densely populated catchments and the rural sites fig 1b while the rural areas are dominated by carbendazim and terbutryn with low contributions of diuron 8 sites on the right side of the graph the latter plays a more prominent role in the densely populated catchments with alternating dominance of the three compounds correlations with sealed surfaces are strongest for diuron and terbutryn while carbendazim evolves closer to the pharmaceutical carbamazepine fig 1c this agrees with precedent findings allocating more constant wastewater related sources to carbendazim launay et al 2016 merel et al 2018 however there is a strong autocorrelation between wastewater treatment plant contribution and the sealed surface area in a catchment hence this correlation is not an absolute differentiation criterion it is noteworthy that the outphased irgarol cybutrin and more recent compounds like oit or ipbc were a factor 10 to 100 below the recovered masses of the classical compounds supplementary material s2 3 2 pocis mass and grab sample concentrations three grab samples had been taken during the exposure of the passive samplers in the low flow campaign in order to calculate the sampling rates under the assumption that the substance flows and consequently the concentrations were constant over the period although the exposure period featured a small flood wave fig 2 a which led to a dilution of the last grab sample the correlation between pocis mass and grab sample is still high for the pharmaceutical carbamazepine r 0 91 fig 2b this suggests that the three grab samples average the discharge situation and hence the dilution of the constant carbamazepine input in a realistic way the biocide carbendazim also showed good agreement between grab samples and pocis mass which was to be expected from its source profile while terbutryn and diuron correlated less meaning that their concentration variability was much larger however biocides were always detected during the low flow situations and their concentrations were globally proportional to the mass collected in the passive samplers this suggests that constant discharge from wastewater treatment plants is an important substance flow route note that for diuron due to detection limit issues positives for grab samples were only available in the more densely populated catchments from these regressions a global sampling rate for each compound can be calculated and corresponds to 1 a t for a y ax regression with t being the time of exposure fig 2c the regressions yielded sampling rates that were in accordance with field determined values published in the literature gallé et al 2019b moschet et al 2015 3 3 sampling rate determination in flood waves the monitoring point on the mamer with its parallel passive samplers and a water level triggered autosampler sampling offered the opportunity to calculate event mean concentrations emc from the compounds chemographs and to put them into a direct relation with the collected mass in the passive samplers fig 3 a shows the flood events of different sizes that were monitored with passive samplers and discrete samples from the autosampler only the periods 1 2 and 4 were sufficiently covered by the autosampler to allow the comparison even within these passive sampler periods a number of time spans without autosampler coverage could exist be it because they were simply low flow periods or that the autosampler had run out of bottles and had not been refilled yet low flow periods as well as the chemograph during the flood wave had been completed with the use of an extrapolation based on a regression of conductivity vs pharmaceutical biocide concentration as shown in fig 3b the regressions can be found in supplementary materials s3 extrapolation has only been used where no grab samples were available grab samples have been interpolated within the periods where the autosampler was running the results of the calculation of the sampling rates via emc and collected masses in the pocis are shown in fig 3c the data used to calculate the event sampling rates can be found in supplementary material s4 the goal of the exercise is to verify if sampling rates differ strongly under varying hydrological conditions to this effect the calculated flood wave sampling rates are compared to those of the low flow regression fig 3c as can be seen most of the sampling rates are close to the low flow value with the exception of diclofenac in wave 4 and diuron in wave 2 which is due to the very low emc and pocis mass during this period adding uncertainty to the calculation supplementary material s4 overall the uncertainties of emc and pocis mass considered it is safe to assume that for the passive sampler s exposure conditions i e in the shielding est canister flow velocity has little effect on sampling rates possibly due to a damping effect of the cages recent literature also suggest that although there are strong differences between quiescent and turbulent conditions differences in flow velocities from 6 to 21 cm s are marginal djomte et al 2018 although more qualitative reported factors for pocis sampling rate increase upon turbulence span from a factor 2 to 7 harman et al 2012 a recent study to validate the in situ use of prcs for pcbs found a maximum factor of increase of roughly 2 estoppey et al 2014 based on prc corrections a canadian study showed that sampling rates for atrazine varied by a factor 4 with a variability however largely explained by differences in temperature and less by water velocity dalton et al 2014 these pocis were directly exposed in a shield in the river based on our results we assume that when exposed in est canisters sampling rates do not differ significantly between low flow and high flow situations and that therefore collected masses can be compared directly between the different hydrological regimes 3 4 biocide source allocation derived from passive sampler data carbamazepine a recalcitrant pharmaceutical that passes conventional treatment plants unaltered has been proposed as a wastewater indicator in the water cycle jekel et al 2015 and correlates well to parameters like sanitary pressure a measure of population equivalents per catchment surface pe ha gallé et al 2019b given that biocides are also released under low flow conditions by wwtps the relationship between concentrations or loads of carbamazepine and the different biocides give insight on the generalized nature of this mass flow from the receiving water viewpoint variability of these ratios could be due to different inlet loads at treatment plant or varying elimination efficiency in a recent survey of 18 wwtps the elimination of biocides in conventional activated sludge treatment proved to be moderate diuron terbutryn to poor carbendazim with median daily eliminations of less than 50 gallé et al 2019a fig 4 c shows the relationship between the passive sampler masses collected on the 8 different sites in the south of luxembourg during the low flow period of the second half of november 2013 fig 4a the relationship is clearly linear with a pearson r of 0 87 and a slope of 0 071 indicating a rather constant relation between diuron and carbamazepine terbutryn and carbendazim align comparably to carbamazepine with a slightly smaller correlation coefficient that is mainly due to one outlier in the chiers catchment related to a suspected industrial source supplementary material s5 if only the dry weather mass flows of biocides were active during flood waves then the ratio between biocides and carbamazepine should remain the same however if additional sources like facades are activated during rain events then the biocides to carbamazepine ratio should increase when applying this to the slopes of the biocide carbamazepine relationship then the differences between the slopes yields the fraction of biocide mobilized by surface runoff hence passive samplers can provide a straightforward estimation of the fractional contribution of both sources in a regionalized averaged way the only thing needed is the sampling of a distinct wet and a dry weather period local differences can also be detected by deviations from the linear relationship fig 4b shows the relationship between diuron and carbamazepine during the high flow period in the first half of november 2013 and yields a much higher slope of 0 2692 compared to the dry weather slope this results in 74 surface runoff contribution for diuron in wet weather situations fig 4d in the same way terbutryn has a share of 31 surface runoff while carbendazim even shows a slight dilution i e wastewater is the main source even during wet weather these findings agree partly with those from bollmann et al 2014b who report that carbendazim mass flows did not differ between dry and wet weather while diuron had a clear wet weather dominance terbutryn however had a dry weather dominance in their case due to a single wwtp inlet note that the standard errors calculated reflect the diversity of the surface runoff contributions in the different catchments and not methodological imprecision the contributions could also be calculated individually the large standard error of the terbutryn contribution is caused by one outlier in the chiers catchment site 1 supplemental material s5 under low flow which is due to an industrial source the censored alternative excluded site 1 while the overall contribution by surfaces remains close the standard error is in that case largely improved standard errors were determined according to error propagation rules for calculated values berthouex and brown 2002 one might question the role of combined overflows spilling untreated wastewater into the receiving water course while it makes no difference for carbamazepine whether treated or untreated wastewater is discharged since the compound is recalcitrant to activated sludge treatment the relationship between carbamazepine concentrations and those of the biocides will not be the same in the cso and at the wwtp outlet the wastewater source might therefore be slightly underestimated even more so that the elimination in the wwtp is also reduced to at most half the dry weather performance because of reduced hydraulic retention time wwtps take up a maximum of twice their dry weather discharge however given the reduced impact on the overall mass flow of first flushes and wwtp outlets in bigger flood events and the fact that biocides from façade emissions are released relatively constantly during rain events burkhardt et al 2012 bollmann et al 2014a the error is probably negligible launay et al 2016 found a mobilisation of carbamazepine during first flushes in combined sewer overflows and explained their origin in sewer deposits we could not find any indication that this was the case in our catchments since carbamazepine followed a general dilution scheme in the combined sewer overflow fig 6 a 3 5 surface runoff contribution via flood wave chemograph analysis since highly resolved flood wave sampling was available for the mamer site the data could also be used for a detailed chemograph analysis and source quantification the individual flood waves are described and commented in the supplementary material s6 here the focus will be placed on the separation of contributing sources which is in essence based on the same principle than for the passive sampler approach the calculation of a ratio between the biocides and a steady flow pharmaceutical such as carbamazepine the only difference here is that for passive samplers the integrated signal over a whole flood event is treated over several sites while for autosamplers discrete samples in the course of the flood wave are considered individually and then used further on to calculate a flood wave load the rationale is that with increasing river discharge the steady mass flow of the pharmaceutical will become further diluted while surface runoff contribution for biocides will increase the ratio between the biocide and the pharmaceutical will therefore increase with increasing discharge this is exactly what can be observed as documented in fig 5b for the pair diuron carbamazepine data processing for source separation operates as follows first the median of the low discharge q90 biocide carbamazepine ratio was used as the steady flow wastewater contribution red dots in fig 5b based on the carbamazepine extrapolation from conductivity measurements this ratio was used to predict the wastewater contribution throughout the flood wave chemograph yielding a wastewater biocide concentration curve along the total biocide curve both curves were used to calculate the instantaneous loads which were then summed up for the event the difference between the total load and the wastewater load will yield the surface runoff load and its fractional contribution fig 5c shows the results in terms of surface runoff contributions as related to event discharge surface runoff contributions increased with event discharge as expected where diuron and carbendazim rapidly reached high levels of 80 90 while terbutryn showed a less steep increase the hierarchy of the 3 compounds runoff contributions also changed in the smaller waves reported mass loads of biocides in pure storm water drained catchments from the literature did not show any correlation to total rain fall but rather to so called driven rain the product of rain intensity and wind speed bollmann et al 2014a b in the present case a catchment of mixed combined sewer and stormwater drainage releases by combined sewers are also expected to vary with rain intensity which makes causal relationships difficult to establish 3 6 dilution tendencies in the combined sewer overflow the autosampler at the combined sewer overflow constitutes the excerpt of the catchment that actually contributes first flush components to the river mass flow because of the patchiness of the overflow activation and the difficulties to quantify its discharge because of the autosampler setting these data are used only qualitatively to inspect whether surface runoff contributions can be detected in the samples for this purpose the simple relationship to ammonium is the most straightforward approach because as opposed to surface waters the source of the latter can only be wastewater fig 6 shows the regressions of carbamazepine and the 3 biocides to ammonium in the grab samples that were sampled in the combined overflow note that these consist of a gradient of concentrated wastewater spills with ammonium concentrations of around 40 mg l to precipitation water diluted samples with ammonium concentration below 10 mg l carbamazepine shows the expected positive correlation to ammonium r 0 704 as does more surprisingly also terbutryn r 0 646 diuron is the only biocide to show a slight negative correlation meaning that upon dilution of ammonium the diuron concentration increases because of surface runoff contribution carbendazim for its part does not show a consistent relation to ammonium these results fit well with the in stream balances of the receiving river where terbutryn also showed the weakest contributions from surface runoff while diuron had a clear input from facades note however that the mamer river catchment features large new build areas including high schools drained in stormwater regime and that these buildings are probably very influential on the immission situation during rain events this might explain the nuances in the contribution profiles between the cso and the in stream balance in the case of carbendazim for instance 4 conclusions this article explores the possibilities to investigate the origin of biocides during flood events by applying 3 methods at different scales the main focus is on discerning the true surface runoff from first flush and wastewater contributions by combined sewer overflows and wwtps during flood waves this is of relevance since there seems to be a constant flow of biocides through wastewater in the perspective of formulating efficient mitigation measures sources and pathways have to be distinguished while the campaigns here were too limited in time to assess the impact of the different sources over a whole year and calculate total loads they nevertheless introduced techniques with which to pinpoint the sources during the events the passive sampling method seems to be the most appropriate method to analyse the source contributions on a larger scale and to describe the general source distribution while the autosamplers are best used in detailed studies in smaller catchments or sewer systems one lesson of this study is that the contributions of surface runoff and wastewater runoff can differ at the small scale mamer river catchment and cso but seem to be rather consistent at the regional scale linear relationship to carbamazepine during flood events this is not a contradiction but should be kept in mind to avoid unwarranted generalizations to analyse the contribution of facades and thereby the pattern of biocides use in a region with dominant combined sewer drainage passive samplers would be the first choice specific local emission patterns for instance in the case of outliers in the passive sampler regressions can only be dealt with with autosamplers if catchments fall below a certain size where the variability of wastewater input is too small for the passive sampler regression approach declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal
