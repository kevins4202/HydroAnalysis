fig 3 the plateau weathered canal command plwc unit occupies the largest area extending over 320 80 km2 44 06 of the watershed it is marked by the jamada left bank canal and the lower girna canal because of the undulating topography which results from differential weathering and erosion of horizontal basalt flows and the perennial flow in the canals recharge is promoted within this geomorphic unit and hence the highest ranking 8 is assigned the plateau weathered plw class occurred mainly in the southwest and center of the watershed with a small patch in the northeast and is marked by comparatively flat to somewhat undulating topography the plw is the second largest geomorphic unit 256 29 km2 35 64 of the study area and has a ranking of 5 the alluvial plain ap in the north central

facilitates infiltration the moderate slope was most prevalent in the southeast and some central parts of the a j watershed 4 8 irrigation in the study area major irrigation sources include canals tanks and various types of wells with the most significant component of groundwater resources being used for irrigation the jamda canal project releases water from the girna dam which contributes irrigation water to about 17200 ha of agricultural land the total length of canal in the a j watershed is 238 27 km the canal command area occupies the majority of the watershed 57 78 415 50 km2 and is assigned a high ranking 8 based on canal water seepage table 1 fig 10 the remaining 42 20 303 50 km2 of the watershed is groundwater irrigated via shallow dug wells and deep bore wells 4 9 delineation of groundwater recharge potential zones the delineation of groundwater recharge potential zones is one of the most fundamental criteria for systematic analysis and planning for water resources management in the present study the a j watershed is divided into high moderate and low potential recharge zones fig 11 the high potential recharge zones occupy 272 72 km2 37 92 and tend to occur in the northern low land part of the watershed which is geologically characterized by alluvium gravel sand and silt and weathered basalt strata of 20 25m thickness the high potential recharge zones include ap and gl geomorphic units which are marked by low drainage density with nearly level to no slope the moderate potential recharge zones which cover 316 94 km2 44 08 tend to occur in weathered basalt strata in the central and southern parts of the watershed these zones include the plw and plwc landforms with 3rd to 4th order drainage networks medium to high drainage density and high lineament density generally soils in the moderate potential recharge zones consist of clay clay loam sandy clay loam and loam the low potential recharge zones occupy 129 44 km2 18 particularly in upland areas in the southwest and southeast parts of the watershed these zones are marked by relatively unweathered to weathered basalt with gentle to moderate slopes headwater 1st and 2nd order streams and high drainage density the low potential recharge zones include the plm landform which occurs with stony outcrops and land without scrub or with a thin veneer of loam silt loam and gravelly loam soil 4 10 proposed groundwater recharge structures this study proposes potential groundwater recharge structures based on hydro geomorphological unit and groundwater recharge potential zones fig 12 the proposed structures are check dams stream bunds desilting tanks and percolation tanks in the plw unit in the central and southern parts of the watershed five check dams are suggested on 2nd and 3rd order drainages with 3 8 slopes and six stream bunds are suggested on 3rd and 4th order drainages surface water bodies on the map were updated with satellite images for authentication partially silted water bodies have reduced the water storage capacity and water availability hence three desilting tanks are suggested for the plw unit in the central part of the watershed in areas where recharge occurs from unlined irrigation canals streams rivers and other water bodies the water table has risen and no recharge structures are needed two percolation tanks in the ap and gl units in the northern part of the watershed are suggested but are considered low priority 5 conclusion the present study integrates hydrogeological geospatial and ahp techniques to identify the potential groundwater recharge zones and suggests suitable recharge structures in the a j watershed within the semi arid tapi river basin of north maharashtra agriculture is the main occupation with conventional flood irrigation practices that need lots of water the slope of the basin varies from 0 to 7 88 with 189 m of relief the primary geologic unit in the watershed is the deccan basalt group with alluvium occurring along valleys in the lower parts of the watershed eight lulc units in the watershed have been extracted more than 80 of the watershed is covered by cropland clay soils cover more than 70 of the watershed followed by various types of loam ahp based mcda techniques enable determination of the potential groundwater recharge zones which are divided into high moderate and low categories the low potential zones mainly occur near the divide in the southwest and southeast parts of the watershed where plateau geomorphic units plwc and plm are developed on massive and weathered basalt with moderate slope and high drainage density moderate potential groundwater recharge zones occupy almost half the watershed mainly in the plw plwc and ap geomorphic units which are developed on weathered basalt with medium drainage density and parallel lineaments high potential groundwater recharge zones occur in areas where the slope is less than 1 2 and drainage density is low which coincides with ap and gl geomorphic units the suggested four kinds of recharging structures check dams stream bunds desilting tanks and percolation tanks are low cost and easy to build with the community participation approach the study outcomes will be helpful to assist policymakers and water professionals in the development of suitable recharge structures for sustainable water resource management in the watershed declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they do not have any competing financial interests or personal relationships that influence the work reported in

fig 3 the plateau weathered canal command plwc unit occupies the largest area extending over 320 80 km2 44 06 of the watershed it is marked by the jamada left bank canal and the lower girna canal because of the undulating topography which results from differential weathering and erosion of horizontal basalt flows and the perennial flow in the canals recharge is promoted within this geomorphic unit and hence the highest ranking 8 is assigned the plateau weathered plw class occurred mainly in the southwest and center of the watershed with a small patch in the northeast and is marked by comparatively flat to somewhat undulating topography the plw is the second largest geomorphic unit 256 29 km2 35 64 of the study area and has a ranking of 5 the alluvial plain ap in the north central part of the watershed occupies 79 03 km2 11 02 of the entire watershed and has a high groundwater recharge potential 7 gullied landforms gl include bad lands and dissected areas in unconsolidated materials such as silt sand and gravel guo et al 2013 the gl class occurs along the downstream channels of the ajani and jhiri rivers and occupies 39 55 km2 5 50 of the study area the groundwater recharge potential is classified as moderate to good 6 the plateau moderately dissected plm class occupies 23 33 km2 3 24 of the a j watershed and is classified as having a low groundwater recharge potential 3 4 2 geology the a j watershed is mainly composed of deccan trap basalt of the ajantha hill ranges except for the north central part where tapi alluvium deposits fig 4 cover the basalt the basalt and alluvium are assigned weights of 7 and 4 respectively table 1 the basalt is upper cretaceous to lower eocene age and covers 601 km2 with a surficial weathered layer 20 25 m thick the groundwater occurrence mainly depends on the secondary porosity in the basalt cgwb 2013 the tapi alluvium occupies an area of 118 km2 and contains the tahakali formation recent which consists of red

facilitates infiltration the moderate slope was most prevalent in the southeast and some central parts of the a j watershed 4 8 irrigation in the study area major irrigation sources include canals tanks and various types of wells with the most significant component of groundwater resources being used for irrigation the jamda canal project releases water from the girna dam which contributes irrigation water to about 17200 ha of agricultural land the total length of canal in the a j watershed is 238 27 km the canal command area occupies the majority of the watershed 57 78 415 50 km2 and is assigned a high ranking 8 based on canal water seepage table 1 fig 10 the remaining 42 20 303 50 km2 of the watershed is groundwater irrigated via shallow dug wells and deep bore wells 4 9 delineation of groundwater recharge potential zones the delineation of groundwater recharge potential zones is one of the most fundamental criteria for systematic analysis and planning for water resources management in the present study the a j watershed is divided into high moderate and low potential recharge zones fig 11 the high potential recharge zones occupy 272 72 km2 37 92 and tend to occur in the northern low land part of the watershed which is geologically characterized by alluvium gravel sand and silt and weathered basalt strata of 20 25m thickness the high potential recharge zones include ap and gl geomorphic units which are marked by low drainage density with nearly level to no slope the moderate potential recharge zones which cover 316 94 km2 44 08 tend to occur in weathered basalt strata in the central and southern parts of the watershed these zones include the plw and plwc landforms with 3rd to 4th order drainage networks medium to high drainage density and high lineament density generally soils in the moderate potential recharge zones consist of clay clay loam sandy clay loam and loam the low potential recharge zones occupy 129 44 km2 18 particularly in upland areas in the southwest and southeast parts of the watershed these zones are marked by relatively unweathered to weathered basalt with gentle to moderate slopes headwater 1st and 2nd order streams and high drainage density the low potential recharge zones include the plm landform which occurs with stony outcrops and land without scrub or with a thin veneer of loam silt loam and gravelly loam soil 4 10 proposed groundwater recharge structures this study proposes potential groundwater recharge structures based on hydro geomorphological unit and groundwater recharge potential zones fig 12 the proposed structures are check dams stream bunds desilting tanks and percolation tanks in the plw unit in the central and southern parts of the watershed five check dams are suggested on 2nd and 3rd order drainages with 3 8 slopes and six stream bunds are suggested on 3rd and 4th order drainages surface water bodies on the map were updated with satellite images for authentication partially silted water bodies have reduced the water storage capacity and water availability hence three desilting tanks are suggested for the plw unit in the central part of the watershed in areas where recharge occurs from unlined irrigation canals streams rivers and other water bodies the water table has risen and no recharge structures are needed two percolation tanks in the ap and gl units in the northern part of the watershed are suggested but are considered low priority 5 conclusion the present study integrates hydrogeological geospatial and ahp techniques to identify the potential groundwater recharge zones and suggests suitable recharge structures in the a j watershed within the semi arid tapi river basin of north maharashtra agriculture is the main occupation with conventional flood irrigation practices that need lots of water the slope of the basin varies from 0 to 7 88 with 189 m of relief the primary geologic unit in the watershed is the deccan basalt group with alluvium occurring along valleys in the lower parts of the watershed eight lulc units in the watershed have been extracted more than 80 of the watershed is covered by cropland clay soils cover more than 70 of the watershed followed by various types of loam ahp based mcda techniques enable determination of the potential groundwater recharge zones which are divided into high moderate and low categories the low potential zones mainly occur near the divide in the southwest and southeast parts of the watershed where plateau geomorphic units plwc and plm are developed on massive and weathered basalt with moderate slope and high drainage density moderate potential groundwater recharge zones occupy almost half the watershed mainly in the plw plwc and ap geomorphic units which are developed on weathered basalt with medium drainage density and parallel lineaments high potential groundwater recharge zones occur in areas where the slope is less than 1 2 and drainage density is low which coincides with ap and gl geomorphic units the suggested four kinds of recharging structures check dams stream bunds desilting tanks and percolation tanks are low cost and easy to build with the community participation approach the study outcomes will be helpful to assist policymakers and water professionals in the development of suitable recharge structures for sustainable water resource

11831,this paper reports the first conceptual model of non magmatic system in central brazil constrained by structural hydrochemical and isotopic data the study involved analyses of carbon oxygen and hydrogen isotopes 14c 18o 2h and ³h in addition to the chemical signatures of water samples from natural springs and borehole samples were classified into three hydrochemical groups based on their ph electric conductivity ec and temperature group 1 shows the lowest temperature range and lowest ph and ec values respectively averages of 27 c 5 0 and 15 μs cm group 3 shows higher temperature ph ec 42 c 7 1 and 215 μs cm and group 2 shows intermediate values average of 38 c 6 2 and 80 μs cm the conceptual flow model indicates that the recharge area is located in the higher plateau areas and the only recharge source is rainwater the groundwater flows towards the southwest for 15 25 km up to the são joaquim fault system where the hydraulic conductivity contrast due to different rock types induces upward flow to the hot springs area buoyancy due to heating through deep circulation can also influence the upward flow however it is not the main process the flow path from ne to sw is controlled by secondary brittle structures related to fractures represented by long lineaments environmental radioisotopes of water 3h and 14c were used to determine the residence time of thermal waters ³h data indicate that samples mv2 and toc1 respectively from groups 2 and 3 are related entirely to the deep thermal reservoir with no mixing influence between reservoirs samples sj1 and ch3 show ³h values from 0 9 to 0 64 tu indicating mixture of water from recent cold waters and the deep thermal reservoir group 3 samples yielded a raw 14c age of 9270 years and the most coherent correction model applied was the international atomic energy agency resulting in an age of 7877 years group 2 yielded age of 2280 years and the most consistent correction model applied was the pearson equation ensuing an age of 2281 years group 1 samples resulted in negative age interpreted as contamination from external carbon sources likely related to algae sample sj1 from a deep well yielded an age of 1 470 and the correction by the pearson model resulted in age of 1352 years the δ2h and δ18o data are plotted above the local meteoric water line indicating enrichment of lighter isotopes the values measured for the total dissolved solids electric conductivity and ph are in agreement with the isotopic data interpretations and with the aquifer mineralogy graphical abstract image 1 keywords heating mechanism groundwater flow system groundwater dating amagmatic 1 introduction thermal springs can be associated with different heat sources including magma intrusions active volcanos and thermal gradient moeck 2014 their occurrence can also be directly related to tectonic backgrounds such as continental collision plate subduction extrusion and the presence of deep faults and fractures faulds et al 2005 therefore the reservoirs that feed thermal springs can have completely different configurations understanding the main configuration of these reservoirs is a matter of key importance for both conservation and economical use of thermal springs in addition understanding recharge runoff and discharge processes is indispensable to comprehend the heating mechanisms as well as water rock interaction processes li et al 2019 groundwater hydrochemical analysis can be useful in indicating the main processes influencing the general quality of the reservoir and provide information that is helpful in developing and upgrading conceptual models of groundwater flow the isotopic content of geothermal water can provide information about their flow pattern interactions among different reservoirs as well as their sources and origin apart from this cooling during ascent toward the surface mixing of thermal and no thermal water and their geochemical evolution can be investigated using isotope techniques plummer 2012 keesari et al 2019a cartwright et al 2020 tritium h³ measurement is a standard dating tool that has been useful in the study of geothermal systems as a tracer of the groundwater movement and for determining their relative ages morgenstern and taylor 2009 kitaoka 1990 ansari et al 2017 it is an ideal tracer because it is part of the water molecule decreased only by radioactive decay and thus not affected by hydrochemical reactions nor influenced by underground production the tritium unit tu is equal to one tritium atom per 1018 hydrogen atoms and corresponds to 0 120 bq l for water at the standard temperature and pressure lucas and urterwerger 2000 in addition to this methodology as an environmental tool many studies have applied radiocarbon dating to constrain water chronology blavoux and olive 1981 gallagher et al 2000 keesari et al 2019a 2019b as well as 3h 2h and 18o constitute part of the water molecule and are considered ideal process tracers the application of combined δ2h and δ18o isotopes began in the 1950s urey et al 1947 epstein and mayeda 1953 and is used to trace surface and groundwater in provenance studies and location of recharge areas clark and fritz 1997 all groundwater dating methods have limitations and due to the complexity of groundwater processes two age tracers with different transport mechanisms are ideally to constrain trustable results tritium 3h with 12 3 years half life time and radiocarbon 14c with 5 730 years half life are the commonly used radiogenic isotopes in hydrogeological studies mook 1980 geyh and ploethner 1995 while 3h levels are evaluated in the molecular constitution of water 14c determinations are made on dissolved species co2 water isotopic measurements along with the conventional hydrochemical analysis help in assessing the nature of geothermal fields from the component s chemistry and subsurface flow regiments of the hot fluids almeida and campos 2013 in central brazil hot springs are distributed in different rock types such as quartzite siltstone slate and phyllite in the chapada dos veadeiros region 12 geothermal springs were identified and classified as non magmatic and fault related junqueira 2020 although thermal waters are of great economic importance in the study region this is the first study addressing the chemical and isotopic characteristics of these resources in the region the aim of this paper is to i understand the flow dynamics of the chapada dos veadeiros system producing and analyzing different datasets that include hydrochemistry physicochemistry besides stable and radiogenic isotopes data ii contribute to the comprehension of groundwater chemical evolution over the hydrological cycle and iii estimation of the deep water outflow proportions at the chapada dos veadeiros hot springs 2 geological and hydrogeological setting 2 1 geological setting the veadeiros supergroup martins ferreira et al 2018a is a paleo mesoproterozoic sedimentary megasequence that covers the central part of brazil it is inserted in the neoproterozoic tocantins province more specifically in the northern brasilia fold and thrust belt fuck et al 2013 2014 fig 1 in the study area the veadeiros supergroup is represented by the araí traíras and the paranoá groups fig 2 these sequences are underlain by the paleoproterozoic crystalline basement formed by the cavalcante almas natividade terrane fuck et al 2014 the araí group is interpreted as rift sequence deposited over a paleoproterozoic crystalline basement subdivided into two tectonosequences pre rift água morna formation and rift arraias formation martins ferreira et al 2018a previous geochronological data of the araí group from u pb of rift related bimodal volcanic rocks indicate depositional ages of 1771 2 ma pimentel et al 2001 seraine et al 2020 martins ferreira et al 2018a classified the traíras group as an intracontinental sag type basin separated from the araí rift by a hiatus of at least 228 ma and marked by an expressive erosive unconformity the maximum deposition age of the traíras group was calculated at 1543 31 ma martins ferreira et al 2018a in the study area two units are particularly important the rio preto formation composed essentially of quartzite and the rosario formation characterized by pelitic psamo pelitic and psamo pelitic carbonated sequences tanizaki et al 2015 fig 2 the paranoá group covers the traíras group and represents a shallow water marine succession composed mainly of sandstone and siltstone with occurrence of limestone lenses seraine et al 2020 previous geochronological data indicates maximum depositional age of 1560 10 ma obtained via u pb ages of detrital zircon and minimum age of 1042 22 ma via u pb age of diagenetic xenotime overgrowths matteini et al 2012 2 2 tectonic framework according to faulds et al 2005 and uzelli et al 2017 the study of the tectonic framework of a region is extremely important to the understanding of the geothermal system the presence of faults joints and fractures is of great importance in verifying the reservoir geometry and flow pathways in hydrothermal systems the extension strain generated during the araí rift in the statherian resulted in zones of weakness in the ne sw and nw se directions during the evolution of the traíras and paranoá basins the araí rift structures were reactivated respectively in the calymmian and stenian periods the serra do cristal fault system fig 3 effectively acted during the initiation of the paranoá basin by controlling basement highs and lows martins ferreira et al 2018b the brittle structures generated during the development of these basins were inherited and reworked in the neoproterozoic brasiliano orogeny gondwanaland amalgamation and again reactivated by extensional neotectonic processes in the cretaceous related to the opening of the atlantic ocean martins ferreira et al 2018a these quaternary faults occur in different styles and are superimposed over pre existing rocks and structures both of which may also influence the structural control of geothermal systems due to the brittle behavior of the traíras group quartzite the dissipation of the stress has triggered a series of discontinuities in different directions developing structures responsible for the water flux structural statistics demonstrate the existence of three main fracture directions n60 70e lineaments n40w and n30e lineaments besides two regional systems related to the são joaquim and serra do cristal fault zones junqueira 2020 martins ferreira and campos 2017 2 3 structural controls on the geothermal system the n60 70e brittle structures along with the bedding anisotropies and horizontal fractures are responsible for the recharge and flow of water to deep portions of the araí and traíras groups rocks the water flowing from ne to sw is barred by the são joaquim fault system and is forced upwards junqueira et al 2020 the spring systems occur due to the intersection and interconnection of the fault joint network however the main control can be attributed to the change of rock rheology considering that the rocks to the west of the são joaquim fault were submitted to higher metamorphism than the rocks to the east fault damage zones with high fracture density are known to be important pathways for fluid transport within the crust yan et al 2016 although the major thermal springs flow over the são joaquim fault main plane others can surge in its damage zone fig 3 2 4 hydrogeological properties detailed knowledge of the stratigraphy hydrodynamic properties and fracture patterns of an area are fundamental factors to model its geothermal system the hydrogeological properties of the studied area were based on the above described geological units the water circulation controlled by faults and fractures ne sw and nw se orientated water from precipitation surface run off and stream drainage infiltrate through these intensely fractured quartzite rocks and feed the hydrothermal system three aquifer systems were proposed for the study area araí aquifer system aas traíras aquifer system tas and paranoá aquifer system pas all of them classified as fractured aquifers and associated with the rocks of the araí traíras and paranoá groups the phreatic aquifer system is considered inefficient due to the presence of incepsols and regosols which are less favorable to the water storage and transmission the araí aquifer system is associated with the metasediments of the araí group rocks and lies directly above the crystalline basement it is composed of sandy and conglomerate rocks besides little occurrence of pelitic rocks the statherian faults and fractures are abundant and act as aquifer recharge controls the dominant rock quartzite have high hydraulic conductivity and transmissivity and a low storage coefficient the meta pelitic rocks are less present and work as aquicludes where they occur due to their low hydraulic conductivity transmissivity and storage coefficient the traíras aquifer system is related to the traíras group rocks and is a fractured heterogeneous and anisotropic aquifer it can be cold or thermal unconfined or confined and is controlled by extensional fracture zones this system can be subdivided into psammitic subsystem and pelitic subsystem the psammitic subsystem is controlled by the faults and fractures which control the aquifer recharge and discharge this system presents high hydraulic conductivity high transmissivity and variable storage coefficient in confined conditions this system presents a high potentiometric hydraulic head due to the high altitude of its recharge area the pelitic system is a confining layer due to low hydraulic conductivity and transmissivity compared to the psammitic system its low fracture density results in a barrier to descending and arising water flow this aquifer may contain hot springs from the psammitic subsystem rising from fractures that intersect all stratigraphy and make it possible to mix hot and cold waters the temperatures of the waters obtained in thermal springs are controlled by the depth of circulation and the mixtures of upstream flowing waters and cold local flowing waters the paranoá aquifer system in the area is limited by the basal rocks of the unit represented by the ribeirão são miguel conglomerate followed upwards by quartzite formations it is also considered a fractured aquifer and it has high hydraulic conductivity and low storage coefficient 3 material and methods 3 1 continuous monitoring and sampling twelve field trips were undertaken in the region with the objective of sampling in different seasons besides detailing the local geology geomorphology and soil type descriptions eight field campaigns were conducted for water sampling in 2018 and 2019 during which twelve specific sites were monitored all samples were collected from hot springs located at different stratigraphic levels of the araí traíras and paranoá groups samples mv1 mv2 and sj1 are representative of the ribeirão são miguel formation of the paranoá group and the samples toc1 pg1 ps3 ch3 ch1 ma1 ba1 ed1 and jq1 represent the rosario formation of the traíras group table 1 3 2 analytical methods for the present study 48 water samples have been analyzed including well samples sj01 and sj02 and springs pg01 ps03 toc01 mv01 mv02 ma01 ba01 ch01 ch03 jq01 and ed01 this dataset was investigated in terms of averages to each sampling site and by climatic season the ph temperature and ec data were measured in situ using field multimeters the metal concentrations in all extracts derived from different stages acid soluble reducible oxidizable and residual fraction were determined using icp oes 5100 agilent usa at the university of brasília geochemistry laboratory the fluoride chloride nitrate phosphate and sulfate anions were determined by ion chromatography ic alkalinity was determined using the titrimetric method of analysis with h2so4 0 084 mg l using a manual titrator the results presented in this work achieved less than 5 error in the ionic balance and are consistent with the error calculation performed by custodio and llamas 1983 3 3 groundwater age tracers in order to obtain isotopic analyses groundwater samples were collected from 3 springs and one well with 80 m of depth in april 2019 oxygen 18 18o and deuterium 2h have been analyzed by mass spectrometry at the beta laboratory with analytical errors of 0 2 and 0 8 respectively tritium ³h has been measured at the laboratory of the brazilian nuclear technology development center by counting β decay in a liquid scintillation counter the electrolytic enrichment in two stages was carried out before the measurement this allowed decreasing the detection limit to 0 03 tu all groundwater dating methods have limitations and due to the complexity of groundwater processes two age tracers with different transport mechanisms should be applied to find age solutions tritium 3h with 12 3 years half lifetime and radiocarbon 14c with 5 730 years half life are the commonly used radiogenic isotopes in hydrogeological studies mook 1980 geyh and ploethner 1995 while 3h levels are evaluated in the molecular constitution of water 14c determinations were made on dissolved species co2 water samples for stable isotopes analysis of water were collected in order to establish water balance conditions in groundwater samples are reported in the δ notation in per mil relative to vienna standard mean ocean water v smow and after normalization on the smow slap scale the samples were analyzed for δ18o and δ2h using established methods gonfiantini 1986 3 3 1 tritium to complement the isotopic study of the collected samples the analysis of tritium using the liquid scintillation spectrometry method with electrolyte enrichment and detection limit of 0 2 tritium units ut was analyzed at the laboratory of the nuclear technology development center the results in ut units of tritium were applied as a tool to identify if the recharge of the geothermal fluids is a modern or ancient process morgenstern et al 2010 kitaoka 1990 ansari et al 2017 the presence of ³h in groundwater can be applied in evaluating the mixing of different reservoirs and to trace the contribution of modern recharge to the geothermal reservoir morgenstern and daughney 2012 keesari et al 2019a given the absence of long term data and standard curves for the southern hemisphere it was opted for the qualitative approach rather than quantitative as proposed by clark and fritz 1997 for continental regions 3 3 2 radiocarbon the samples for radiocarbon dating were sent to the beta laboratory located in the state of florida united states of america the method used was accelerator mass spectrometry ams the ams measurement is done on graphite produced by hydrogen reduction of the co2 sample over a cobalt catalyst the co2 is obtained from the combustion of the sample at 800 c under a 100 oxygen atmosphere the co2 is first dried with methanol dry ice then collected in liquid nitrogen for the subsequent graphitization reaction the analytical result in percent modern carbon pmc is obtained by measuring sample 14c 13c relative to the 14c 13c in oxalic acid ii nist 4990c in one of beta s laboratory multiple in house particle accelerators using snics ion source depending on the time elapsed since groundwater infiltrates through the aquifers the 14c activity decreases which makes it possible to infer the groundwater time residence however direct estimation of groundwater age based on measured 14c data can be changed by several geochemical processes as the dissolution of dead carbon or contamination with carbonates present in the aquifer therefore groundwater raw ages need to be corrected according to aquifer conditions to arrive at the most reliable values there are several models for 14c age correction and the most suitable model needs to be selected according to the aquifer conditions in the present case six models were applied and their estimates are discussed considering prevailing the geological setup of each spring and well analyzed the use of 14c method is admitted for water dating between 1000 and 30 000 years geyh and ploethner 1995 over the past 50 years an extensive literature of investigations and applications of radiocarbon in hydrological systems has followed many advances in collection and analysis of 14c have also followed and now 14c content is almost routinely determined on carbon samples as small as 1 mg by using accelerator mass spectrometry ams the software applied to correction models for each sample was the diagrammes version 6 59 which calculates and compares the equations obtained by the models proposed by tamers 1967 pearson 1965 mook 1980 fontes and garnier 1979 evans 1979 eichinger 1983 and iaea 1983 the results are given in table 5 3 3 3 o and h stable isotopes the basis of environmental isotope geochemistry is the comparison of results from mass spectrometer analysis with a reference as the smow craig 1961 or vsmow iaea 1983 standards vsmow has been accepted as an international reference for δ18o and δ2h usually the δ18o and δ2h are plotted in a binary graph and the groundwater samples data are compared directly so that the main processes acting in the isotopic signal can be interpreted among the main processes there are evaporation silicate hydration clay dehydration geothermal exchange and mixing gonfiantini 1986 geyh 2001 the stable isotope evaluations consist of comparing the current precipitation data and the groundwater data to be evaluated considering the dimensional and temporal aspects inherent to the process silva 2016 when groundwater data do not resemble local precipitation data it is interpreted as not local recharge as some factors may change the isotopic signal of water before during and after recharge lousada and campos 2011 4 results 4 1 physicochemical properties of groundwater from the study area the physicochemical data are shown in table 2 in the study area geothermal springs have surface discharge temperatures in the range from 27 c to 42 c sample toc01 is the highest temperature sample while the sample ch3 represents the lowest geothermal temperature water was considered thermal when the temperature is above 27 c according to the brazilian water classification brazil 1945 the average temperature obtained in non thermal waters in the region is 23 c electrical conductivity ec shows values ranging from 9 to 241 μs cm ph and tds vary among the samples table 2 the alkalinity varies from 4 1 to 215 03 mg l 4 2 isotopic properties of water resources radiocarbon 14c age calculations were based on the assumption that the initial activity of the water was 100 of modern co2 activity 100 pmc the total dissolved inorganic carbon has two main sources carbon derived from the soil zone and dead carbon derived from solid carbonate in the soil and the reservoir matrix the initial activity a14 is derived from a combination of the two sources and it is defined as the 14c content after all chemical and isotopic processes have taken place and before any decay gallagher et al 2000 fontes 1992 the corresponding values obtained by the ams method are in table 3 along with the values obtained for oxygen and hydrogen isotopes in order to obtain the best value of a14 the use of correction models is required table 4 lists the detailed description and limitations of each method constrained by fontes 1992 for the correction of the gross radiocarbon values the models proposed by tamers 1967 pearson 1965 mook 1980 fontes and garnier 1979 evans 1979 eichinger 1983 and iaea 1983 were applied the results are given in table 5 soil δ13c can be estimated by considering the type of vegetation in the study area and it is highly related to the region soil type and climate given that the most abundant vegetation type is the cerrado strictu sensu a type of savanna the δ13c values range from 14 to 24 neufeldt 2006 with an average value of about 20 seven models were applied in the present research table 4 and the results are discussed in a comparative examination of their relative merits since the ca and mg content of the samples are usually lower than 10 mg l only the toc1 sample contains the content high enough to require the use of the proposed models due to the high co2 loss to the atmosphere however for comparison purposes the models were applied to the toc1 sj1 and mv2 samples due to its negative age it was not able to apply the models to the ch3 sample 5 discussions 5 1 interpretation of hydrochemical facies and water sources the series of results obtained consistently demonstrate the presence of three geochemically distinct hydrochemical groups based on ph temperature major ions composition total dissolved solids content stable and radiogenic isotopic data three hydrochemical facies were determined and the distinction between them is a consequence of local geology and distance from the recharge area given that the springs farthest from the recharge area present higher tds due to the pathway time 5 2 isotopic properties of water resources 5 2 1 tritium ³h according to hurst 2003 waters with 0 20 0 8 tu correspond to recharge before 1952 0 8 4 tu indicates a mix of recent water and pre 1952 recharge and 5 15tu points out to recharge from the last 5 10 years morgenstern et al 2010 affirm that atmospheric nuclear weapons tests tritium was mostly released in the northern hemisphere and only about 5 of it mixed via the stratospheric circulation into the southern hemisphere which means that low values as 0 8 tu already indicates mixing of the younger reservoir and the older reservoir in south america as such the ³h values ranging from 0 68 0 13 tu ch3 sample to 0 94 0 17 tu sj1 sample can be considered a general indicator of minimum age and mixing between younger recharge and some component of older waters for the ch3 sample the small 3h amount is sufficient to estimate younger water mixing given that for south american groundwater small quantities are already indicative of mixing in contrast the values of toc1 and mv2 samples the values did not reach the minimum detection value of the equipment 0 20 tu values below 0 8 found in the toc1 and mv2 samples indicate that there is no mixing between the deep thermal reservoir and recent recharge from the latest 6 decades the sample sj1 0 94 0 17 tu presents a small contribution of recent waters probably for being intercepted by a well of 80 m of depth where there might be mixing with local flow 5 2 2 radiocarbon there is close agreement between age estimates using models ages from pearson et al 1965 eichinger 1983 evans et al 1979 and fontes and garnier 1979 while the iaea 1983 and mook 1980 models ages yielded results marginally older on the other hand the pearson model produced relative lower age values corrections our results indicate that tamers 1967 mook 1980 and international atomic energy agency iaea 1983 models gave anomalous ages due to their inability to correct solid phase isotopic exchange despite differing approaches to model derivation the pearson et al 1965 fontes and garnier 1979 evans et al 1979 and eichinger et al 1983 models produced results that were in agreement for all water samples the ch3 sample resulted in a negative age indicating the presence of 14c derived from external sources which suggests that there was contamination during sampling it is important to notice that green algae were observed in the sampling site 5 2 3 oxygen and hydrogen isotopes fig 5 shows the δ2h versus δ18o graph of samples ch3 group 1 mv2 group 2 toc1 group 3 and sj1 deep well since there is no rainfall isotope data in the study region the meteoric line of brasilia was chosen whose equation is δ2h 9 14 δ18o 15 03 santos 2018 and presents meteorological data very similar to the study region due to its proximity the stable isotope analyses from the characteristic sample of each of the three groups yielded the following results 10 69 δ18o 8 74 and 71 58 δ2h 52 51 the relationship between the δ2h and δ18o values is shown in fig 5 where the local meteoric water line lmwl δ2h 9 14 δ18o 15 03 santos 2018 and the global meteoric water line gmwl δ2h 8 δ18o 10 craig 1961 are also illustrated samples collected in the study region presents light isotope enrichment when compared to the local pluviometry equation and are located above the local meteorological curve the samples then show δ2h enrichment and δ18o depletion the values obtained are lower than the local mean values of atmospheric water which means that the groundwater analyzed suffered processes capable of modifying the original isotopic signal suggesting that samples may fall on a mixing line between modern water and older late recharge with a depleted isotopic composition surface waters from the ch3 and sj1 fall on or very close to the gmwl which indicates different water sources or different reservoirs mixing fig 5 5 3 3 conceptual model the occurrence of water with anomalous temperature in the study area is due exclusively to geothermic grade associated with the flow model since there are no thermal anomalies of magmatic origin in the region the understanding of groundwater flow behavior hydrogeological flow regimes were determined including analyses of recharge and discharge areas positions control and influence of the fractured system the confining condition hydrothermalism characteristics and hydrochemistry signatures hubbert 1940 analyzed the parameters that run groundwater flow and concluded that the hydraulic gradient is responsible for controlling the velocity and flow direction in a homogeneous reservoir the same can be considered for fractured reservoirs which in addition to the hydraulic gradient fracture directions and interconnections also play an important role in the study area the topography is the main flow control which determines the recharge area to be the highly fractured quartzite of the rio preto formation at the chapada dos veadeiros national park northwest of the hot springs reaching 1200 m of altitude fig 6 the distance from the discharge area to the recharge area the groundwater chemistry the 14c and ³h ages in addition to the stable isotopes signature define that the heating processes are due to the geothermal gradient with absence or little influence of recent recharge since the influence of geothermal gradient flow implies greater flow depths the anomalous temperatures increase as it moves away from the recharge the presence of a kilometric statherian fault são joaquim fault and its damage zone which places rocks with different metamorphic degrees and therefore different rheology cause a rapid rise of the flow which emerges in in the valley with temperatures above the atmospheric region average buoyancy due to heating through deep circulation can influence the upward flow however it is not the main process woods 2014 volpi et al 2018 this regime presents little influence of meteoric waters consequently presenting values of ³h content less than 0 5 tu or below the detection limit also samples are generally more mineralized presenting larger amounts of total dissolved solids tds as it moves away from the recharge area and consequently are exposed to longer periods of water rock interaction fig 7 the flow paths are guided by the fracture system therefore the wells that intercept anisotropies linked to the deeper thermal reservoir present higher temperatures which is the case of the sj1 sample on the other hand wells that intercept fractures that receive exclusively recent water flow do not present anomalous temperatures wells that intersect fractures linked to the thermal reservoir but at a shallower depth will also have low temperature water the 0 9 ut result indicates that the well represented by the sample sj intercepted fractures linked to the thermal and the cold reservoirs the deep fault system is responsible for the heating of the waters observed in the present study in this case it is considered that the cold infiltrating water should reach more than 1000 m deep fig 8 the heating generated by the geothermal gradient tends to increase proportionally to the distance from the recharge area considering that the greater the distance the greater the depth reached fig 8 resulting in temperatures up to 42 c and high tds for the water samples the proposed flow model fig 8 is supported by contrasting physiochemical data table 2 for the different groups group 3 average temperatures of 38 c and tds of about 125 mg l for the more distant area from de recharge plateau group 2 samples tds of 45 mg l and temperatures varying from 28 to 34 c and average temperatures of 27 c and low tds for group 1 samples table 2 6 conclusions ³h data indicate that there is no influence from recent recharge with no mixing between the thermal reservoir and the cold reservoir samples mv2 and toc1 from groups 2 and 3 respectively the result of 0 9 tu for ³h indicates a mixture of two different reservoirs sample sj1 from the deep tubular well the value of 0 64 tu for tritium indicates mixture of the thermal reservoir and cold reservoir sample ch3 group 1 the possibility of external contamination is not excluded analyses of radiocarbon were analyzed in years and demonstrate a raw age of 9 270 which corrected by the iaea model resulted in an age of 7877 sample toc 1 group 3 raw age of 2280 was corrected by the pearson model resulting in 2281 years sample mv2 group 2 raw age of 1470 was corrected by pearson resulting in an age of 1352 sample sj1 deep well sample ch3 group 1 presented negative age suggesting contamination from external carbon likely from the algae observed in the water pool the radioisotope ages determined in this study refer to the time elapsed between recharge circulation in the reservoir and the point where the sample was collected however in these cases the age must include the time of water stagnancy in the deeper portions of the reservoir the ages obtained are directly related to the distance of the sample from the recharge area where the oldest samples from group 3 are located in the most distal portion of the recharge area in contrast to group 1 which are younger and located closer to the recharge area the results obtained so far enable identification of the flow patterns the recharge and the hydrochemical behavior of the groundwater in the araí traíras and paranoá reservoirs as well as to contribute to the isotopic study of the groundwater in this region however the present study still allows the development of research in greater detail in order to contribute to the knowledge of the area geophysical techniques are indispensable to better characterize the anisotropies in addition hydrochemical monitoring is recommended including analysis of parameters that complement the water characterization including turbidity organic components biochemical oxygen demand bod dissolved oxygen od and in parallel the study of surface waters maintained by the thermal springs author statement

11831,this paper reports the first conceptual model of non magmatic system in central brazil constrained by structural hydrochemical and isotopic data the study involved analyses of carbon oxygen and hydrogen isotopes 14c 18o 2h and ³h in addition to the chemical signatures of water samples from natural springs and borehole samples were classified into three hydrochemical groups based on their ph electric conductivity ec and temperature group 1 shows the lowest temperature range and lowest ph and ec values respectively averages of 27 c 5 0 and 15 μs cm group 3 shows higher temperature ph ec 42 c 7 1 and 215 μs cm and group 2 shows intermediate values average of 38 c 6 2 and 80 μs cm the conceptual flow model indicates that the recharge area is located in the higher plateau areas and the only recharge source is rainwater the groundwater flows towards the southwest for 15 25 km up to the são joaquim fault system where the hydraulic conductivity contrast due to different rock types induces upward flow to the hot springs area buoyancy due to heating through deep circulation can also influence the upward flow however it is not the main process the flow path from ne to sw is controlled by secondary brittle structures related to fractures represented by long lineaments environmental radioisotopes of water 3h and 14c were used to determine the residence time of thermal waters ³h data indicate that samples mv2 and toc1 respectively from groups 2 and 3 are related entirely to the deep thermal reservoir with no mixing influence between reservoirs samples sj1 and ch3 show ³h values from 0 9 to 0 64 tu indicating mixture of water from recent cold waters and the deep thermal reservoir group 3 samples yielded a raw 14c age of 9270 years and the most coherent correction model applied was the international atomic energy agency resulting in an age of 7877 years group 2 yielded age of 2280 years and the most consistent correction model applied was the pearson equation ensuing an age of 2281 years group 1 samples resulted in negative age interpreted as contamination from external carbon sources likely related to algae sample sj1 from a deep well yielded an age of 1 470 and the correction by the pearson model resulted in age of 1352 years the δ2h and δ18o data are plotted above the local meteoric water line indicating enrichment of lighter isotopes the values measured for the total dissolved solids electric conductivity and ph are in agreement with the isotopic data interpretations and with the aquifer mineralogy graphical abstract image 1 keywords heating mechanism groundwater flow system groundwater dating amagmatic 1 introduction thermal springs can be associated with different heat sources including magma intrusions active volcanos and thermal gradient moeck 2014 their occurrence can also be directly related to tectonic backgrounds such as continental collision plate subduction extrusion and the presence of deep faults and fractures faulds et al 2005 therefore the reservoirs that feed thermal springs can have completely different configurations understanding the main configuration of these reservoirs is a matter of key importance for both conservation and economical use of thermal springs in addition understanding recharge runoff and discharge processes is indispensable to comprehend the heating mechanisms as well as water rock interaction processes li et al 2019 groundwater hydrochemical analysis can be useful in indicating the main processes influencing the general quality of the reservoir and provide information that is helpful in developing and upgrading conceptual models of groundwater flow the isotopic content of geothermal water can provide information about their flow pattern interactions among different reservoirs as well as their sources and origin apart from this cooling during ascent toward the surface mixing of thermal and no thermal water and their geochemical evolution can be investigated using isotope techniques plummer 2012 keesari et al 2019a cartwright et al 2020 tritium h³ measurement is a standard dating tool that has been useful in the study of geothermal systems as a tracer of the groundwater movement and for determining their relative ages morgenstern and taylor 2009 kitaoka 1990 ansari et al 2017 it is an ideal tracer because it is part of the water molecule decreased only by radioactive decay and thus not affected by hydrochemical reactions nor influenced by underground production the tritium unit tu is equal to one tritium atom per 1018 hydrogen atoms and corresponds to 0 120 bq l for water at the standard temperature and pressure lucas and urterwerger 2000 in addition to this methodology as an environmental tool many studies have applied radiocarbon dating to constrain water chronology blavoux and olive 1981 gallagher et al 2000 keesari et al 2019a 2019b as well as 3h 2h and 18o constitute part of the water molecule and are considered ideal process tracers the application of combined δ2h and δ18o isotopes began in the 1950s urey et al 1947 epstein and mayeda 1953 and is used to trace surface and groundwater in provenance studies and location of recharge areas clark and fritz 1997 all groundwater dating methods have limitations and due to the complexity of groundwater processes two age tracers with different transport mechanisms are ideally to constrain trustable results tritium 3h with 12 3 years half life time and radiocarbon 14c with 5 730 years half life are the commonly used radiogenic isotopes in hydrogeological studies mook 1980 geyh and ploethner 1995 while 3h levels are evaluated in the molecular constitution of water 14c determinations are made on dissolved species co2 water isotopic measurements along with the conventional hydrochemical analysis help in assessing the nature of geothermal fields from the component s chemistry and subsurface flow regiments of the hot fluids almeida and campos 2013 in central brazil hot springs are distributed in different rock types such as quartzite siltstone slate and phyllite in the chapada dos veadeiros region 12 geothermal springs were identified and classified as non magmatic and fault related junqueira 2020 although thermal waters are of great economic importance in the study region this is the first study addressing the chemical and isotopic characteristics of these resources in the region the aim of this paper is to i understand the flow dynamics of the chapada dos veadeiros system producing and analyzing different datasets that include hydrochemistry physicochemistry besides stable and radiogenic isotopes data ii contribute to the comprehension of groundwater chemical evolution over the hydrological cycle and iii estimation of the deep water outflow proportions at the chapada dos veadeiros hot springs 2 geological and hydrogeological setting 2 1 geological setting the veadeiros supergroup martins ferreira et al 2018a is a paleo mesoproterozoic sedimentary megasequence that covers the central part of brazil it is inserted in the neoproterozoic tocantins province more specifically in the northern brasilia fold and thrust belt fuck et al 2013 2014 fig 1 in the study area the veadeiros supergroup is represented by the araí traíras and the paranoá groups fig 2 these sequences are underlain by the paleoproterozoic crystalline basement formed by the cavalcante almas natividade terrane fuck et al 2014 the araí group is interpreted as rift sequence deposited over a paleoproterozoic crystalline basement subdivided into two tectonosequences pre rift água morna formation and rift arraias formation martins ferreira et al 2018a previous geochronological data of the araí group from u pb of rift related bimodal volcanic rocks indicate depositional ages of 1771 2 ma pimentel et al 2001 seraine et al 2020 martins ferreira et al 2018a classified the traíras group as an intracontinental sag type basin separated from the araí rift by a hiatus of at least 228 ma and marked by an expressive erosive unconformity the maximum deposition age of the traíras group was calculated at 1543 31 ma martins ferreira et al 2018a in the study area two units are particularly important the rio preto formation composed essentially of quartzite and the rosario formation characterized by pelitic psamo pelitic and psamo pelitic carbonated sequences tanizaki et al 2015 fig 2 the paranoá group covers the traíras group and represents a shallow water marine succession composed mainly of sandstone and siltstone with occurrence of limestone lenses seraine et al 2020 previous geochronological data indicates maximum depositional age of 1560 10 ma obtained via u pb ages of detrital zircon and minimum age of 1042 22 ma via u pb age of diagenetic xenotime overgrowths matteini et al 2012 2 2 tectonic framework according to faulds et al 2005 and uzelli et al 2017 the study of the tectonic framework of a region is extremely important to the understanding of the geothermal system the presence of faults joints and fractures is of great importance in verifying the reservoir geometry and flow pathways in hydrothermal systems the extension strain generated during the araí rift in the statherian resulted in zones of weakness in the ne sw and nw se directions during the evolution of the traíras and paranoá basins the araí rift structures were reactivated respectively in the calymmian and stenian periods the serra do cristal fault system fig 3 effectively acted during the initiation of the paranoá basin by controlling basement highs and lows martins ferreira et al 2018b the brittle structures generated during the development of these basins were inherited and reworked in the neoproterozoic brasiliano orogeny gondwanaland amalgamation and again reactivated by extensional neotectonic processes in the cretaceous related to the opening of the atlantic ocean martins ferreira et al 2018a these quaternary faults occur in different styles and are superimposed over pre existing rocks and structures both of which may also influence the structural control of geothermal systems due to the brittle behavior of the traíras group quartzite the dissipation of the stress has triggered a series of discontinuities in different directions developing structures responsible for the water flux structural statistics demonstrate the existence of three main fracture directions n60 70e lineaments n40w and n30e lineaments besides two regional systems related to the são joaquim and serra do cristal fault zones junqueira 2020 martins ferreira and campos 2017 2 3 structural controls on the geothermal system the n60 70e brittle structures along with the bedding anisotropies and horizontal fractures are responsible for the recharge and flow of water to deep portions of the araí and traíras groups rocks the water flowing from ne to sw is barred by the são joaquim fault system and is forced upwards junqueira et al 2020 the spring systems occur due to the intersection and interconnection of the fault joint network however the main control can be attributed to the change of rock rheology considering that the rocks to the west of the são joaquim fault were submitted to higher metamorphism than the rocks to the east fault damage zones with high fracture density are known to be important pathways for fluid transport within the crust yan et al 2016 although the major thermal springs flow over the são joaquim fault main plane others can surge in its damage zone fig 3 2 4 hydrogeological properties detailed knowledge of the stratigraphy hydrodynamic properties and fracture patterns of an area are fundamental factors to model its geothermal system the hydrogeological properties of the studied area were based on the above described geological units the water circulation controlled by faults and fractures ne sw and nw se orientated water from precipitation surface run off and stream drainage infiltrate through these intensely fractured quartzite rocks and feed the hydrothermal system three aquifer systems were proposed for the study area araí aquifer system aas traíras aquifer system tas and paranoá aquifer system pas all of them classified as fractured aquifers and associated with the rocks of the araí traíras and paranoá groups the phreatic aquifer system is considered inefficient due to the presence of incepsols and regosols which are less favorable to the water storage and transmission the araí aquifer system is associated with the metasediments of the araí group rocks and lies directly above the crystalline basement it is composed of sandy and conglomerate rocks besides little occurrence of pelitic rocks the statherian faults and fractures are abundant and act as aquifer recharge controls the dominant rock quartzite have high hydraulic conductivity and transmissivity and a low storage coefficient the meta pelitic rocks are less present and work as aquicludes where they occur due to their low hydraulic conductivity transmissivity and storage coefficient the traíras aquifer system is related to the traíras group rocks and is a fractured heterogeneous and anisotropic aquifer it can be cold or thermal unconfined or confined and is controlled by extensional fracture zones this system can be subdivided into psammitic subsystem and pelitic subsystem the psammitic subsystem is controlled by the faults and fractures which control the aquifer recharge and discharge this system presents high hydraulic conductivity high transmissivity and variable storage coefficient in confined conditions this system presents a high potentiometric hydraulic head due to the high altitude of its recharge area the pelitic system is a confining layer due to low hydraulic conductivity and transmissivity compared to the psammitic system its low fracture density results in a barrier to descending and arising water flow this aquifer may contain hot springs from the psammitic subsystem rising from fractures that intersect all stratigraphy and make it possible to mix hot and cold waters the temperatures of the waters obtained in thermal springs are controlled by the depth of circulation and the mixtures of upstream flowing waters and cold local flowing waters the paranoá aquifer system in the area is limited by the basal rocks of the unit represented by the ribeirão são miguel conglomerate followed upwards by quartzite formations it is also considered a fractured aquifer and it has high hydraulic conductivity and low storage coefficient 3 material and methods 3 1 continuous monitoring and sampling twelve field trips were undertaken in the region with the objective of sampling in different seasons besides detailing the local geology geomorphology and soil type descriptions eight field campaigns were conducted for water sampling in 2018 and 2019 during which twelve specific sites were monitored all samples were collected from hot springs located at different stratigraphic levels of the araí traíras and paranoá groups samples mv1 mv2 and sj1 are representative of the ribeirão são miguel formation of the paranoá group and the samples toc1 pg1 ps3 ch3 ch1 ma1 ba1 ed1 and jq1 represent the rosario formation of the traíras group table 1 3 2 analytical methods for the present study 48 water samples have been analyzed including well samples sj01 and sj02 and springs pg01 ps03 toc01 mv01 mv02 ma01 ba01 ch01 ch03 jq01 and ed01 this dataset was investigated in terms of averages to each sampling site and by climatic season the ph temperature and ec data were measured in situ using field multimeters the metal concentrations in all extracts derived from different stages acid soluble reducible oxidizable and residual fraction were determined using icp oes 5100 agilent usa at the university of brasília geochemistry laboratory the fluoride chloride nitrate phosphate and sulfate anions were determined by ion chromatography ic alkalinity was determined using the titrimetric method of analysis with h2so4 0 084 mg l using a manual titrator the results presented in this work achieved less than 5 error in the ionic balance and are consistent with the error calculation performed by custodio and llamas 1983 3 3 groundwater age tracers in order to obtain isotopic analyses groundwater samples were collected from 3 springs and one well with 80 m of depth in april 2019 oxygen 18 18o and deuterium 2h have been analyzed by mass spectrometry at the beta laboratory with analytical errors of 0 2 and 0 8 respectively tritium ³h has been measured at the laboratory of the brazilian nuclear technology development center by counting β decay in a liquid scintillation counter the electrolytic enrichment in two stages was carried out before the measurement this allowed decreasing the detection limit to 0 03 tu all groundwater dating methods have limitations and due to the complexity of groundwater processes two age tracers with different transport mechanisms should be applied to find age solutions tritium 3h with 12 3 years half lifetime and radiocarbon 14c with 5 730 years half life are the commonly used radiogenic isotopes in hydrogeological studies mook 1980 geyh and ploethner 1995 while 3h levels are evaluated in the molecular constitution of water 14c determinations were made on dissolved species co2 water samples for stable isotopes analysis of water were collected in order to establish water balance conditions in groundwater samples are reported in the δ notation in per mil relative to vienna standard mean ocean water v smow and after normalization on the smow slap scale the samples were analyzed for δ18o and δ2h using established methods gonfiantini 1986 3 3 1 tritium to complement the isotopic study of the collected samples the analysis of tritium using the liquid scintillation spectrometry method with electrolyte enrichment and detection limit of 0 2 tritium units ut was analyzed at the laboratory of the nuclear technology development center the results in ut units of tritium were applied as a tool to identify if the recharge of the geothermal fluids is a modern or ancient process morgenstern et al 2010 kitaoka 1990 ansari et al 2017 the presence of ³h in groundwater can be applied in evaluating the mixing of different reservoirs and to trace the contribution of modern recharge to the geothermal reservoir morgenstern and daughney 2012 keesari et al 2019a given the absence of long term data and standard curves for the southern hemisphere it was opted for the qualitative approach rather than quantitative as proposed by clark and fritz 1997 for continental regions 3 3 2 radiocarbon the samples for radiocarbon dating were sent to the beta laboratory located in the state of florida united states of america the method used was accelerator mass spectrometry ams the ams measurement is done on graphite produced by hydrogen reduction of the co2 sample over a cobalt catalyst the co2 is obtained from the combustion of the sample at 800 c under a 100 oxygen atmosphere the co2 is first dried with methanol dry ice then collected in liquid nitrogen for the subsequent graphitization reaction the analytical result in percent modern carbon pmc is obtained by measuring sample 14c 13c relative to the 14c 13c in oxalic acid ii nist 4990c in one of beta s laboratory multiple in house particle accelerators using snics ion source depending on the time elapsed since groundwater infiltrates through the aquifers the 14c activity decreases which makes it possible to infer the groundwater time residence however direct estimation of groundwater age based on measured 14c data can be changed by several geochemical processes as the dissolution of dead carbon or contamination with carbonates present in the aquifer therefore groundwater raw ages need to be corrected according to aquifer conditions to arrive at the most reliable values there are several models for 14c age correction and the most suitable model needs to be selected according to the aquifer conditions in the present case six models were applied and their estimates are discussed considering prevailing the geological setup of each spring and well analyzed the use of 14c method is admitted for water dating between 1000 and 30 000 years geyh and ploethner 1995 over the past 50 years an extensive literature of investigations and applications of radiocarbon in hydrological systems has followed many advances in collection and analysis of 14c have also followed and now 14c content is almost routinely determined on carbon samples as small as 1 mg by using accelerator mass spectrometry ams the software applied to correction models for each sample was the diagrammes version 6 59 which calculates and compares the equations obtained by the models proposed by tamers 1967 pearson 1965 mook 1980 fontes and garnier 1979 evans 1979 eichinger 1983 and iaea 1983 the results are given in table 5 3 3 3 o and h stable isotopes the basis of environmental isotope geochemistry is the comparison of results from mass spectrometer analysis with a reference as the smow craig 1961 or vsmow iaea 1983 standards vsmow has been accepted as an international reference for δ18o and δ2h usually the δ18o and δ2h are plotted in a binary graph and the groundwater samples data are compared directly so that the main processes acting in the isotopic signal can be interpreted among the main processes there are evaporation silicate hydration clay dehydration geothermal exchange and mixing gonfiantini 1986 geyh 2001 the stable isotope evaluations consist of comparing the current precipitation data and the groundwater data to be evaluated considering the dimensional and temporal aspects inherent to the process silva 2016 when groundwater data do not resemble local precipitation data it is interpreted as not local recharge as some factors may change the isotopic signal of water before during and after recharge lousada and campos 2011 4 results 4 1 physicochemical properties of groundwater from the study area the physicochemical data are shown in table 2 in the study area geothermal springs have surface discharge temperatures in the range from 27 c to 42 c sample toc01 is the highest temperature sample while the sample ch3 represents the lowest geothermal temperature water was considered thermal when the temperature is above 27 c according to the brazilian water classification brazil 1945 the average temperature obtained in non thermal waters in the region is 23 c electrical conductivity ec shows values ranging from 9 to 241 μs cm ph and tds vary among the samples table 2 the alkalinity varies from 4 1 to 215 03 mg l 4 2 isotopic properties of water resources radiocarbon 14c age calculations were based on the assumption that the initial activity of the water was 100 of modern co2 activity 100 pmc the total dissolved inorganic carbon has two main sources carbon derived from the soil zone and dead carbon derived from solid carbonate in the soil and the reservoir matrix the initial activity a14 is derived from a combination of the two sources and it is defined as the 14c content after all chemical and isotopic processes have taken place and before any decay gallagher et al 2000 fontes 1992 the corresponding values obtained by the ams method are in table 3 along with the values obtained for oxygen and hydrogen isotopes in order to obtain the best value of a14 the use of correction models is required table 4 lists the detailed description and limitations of each method constrained by fontes 1992 for the correction of the gross radiocarbon values the models proposed by tamers 1967 pearson 1965 mook 1980 fontes and garnier 1979 evans 1979 eichinger 1983 and iaea 1983 were applied the results are given in table 5 soil δ13c can be estimated by considering the type of vegetation in the study area and it is highly related to the region soil type and climate given that the most abundant vegetation type is the cerrado strictu sensu a type of savanna the δ13c values range from 14 to 24 neufeldt 2006 with an average value of about 20 seven models were applied in the present research table 4 and the results are discussed in a comparative examination of their relative merits since the ca and mg content of the samples are usually lower than 10 mg l only the toc1 sample contains the content high enough to require the use of the proposed models due to the high co2 loss to the atmosphere however for comparison purposes the models were applied to the toc1 sj1 and mv2 samples due to its negative age it was not able to apply the models to the ch3 sample 5 discussions 5 1 interpretation of hydrochemical facies and water sources the series of results obtained consistently demonstrate the presence of three geochemically distinct hydrochemical groups based on ph temperature major ions composition total dissolved solids content stable and radiogenic isotopic data three hydrochemical facies were determined and the distinction between them is a consequence of local geology and distance from the recharge area given that the springs farthest from the recharge area present higher tds due to the pathway time 5 2 isotopic properties of water resources 5 2 1 tritium ³h according to hurst 2003 waters with 0 20 0 8 tu correspond to recharge before 1952 0 8 4 tu indicates a mix of recent water and pre 1952 recharge and 5 15tu points out to recharge from the last 5 10 years morgenstern et al 2010 affirm that atmospheric nuclear weapons tests tritium was mostly released in the northern hemisphere and only about 5 of it mixed via the stratospheric circulation into the southern hemisphere which means that low values as 0 8 tu already indicates mixing of the younger reservoir and the older reservoir in south america as such the ³h values ranging from 0 68 0 13 tu ch3 sample to 0 94 0 17 tu sj1 sample can be considered a general indicator of minimum age and mixing between younger recharge and some component of older waters for the ch3 sample the small 3h amount is sufficient to estimate younger water mixing given that for south american groundwater small quantities are already indicative of mixing in contrast the values of toc1 and mv2 samples the values did not reach the minimum detection value of the equipment 0 20 tu values below 0 8 found in the toc1 and mv2 samples indicate that there is no mixing between the deep thermal reservoir and recent recharge from the latest 6 decades the sample sj1 0 94 0 17 tu presents a small contribution of recent waters probably for being intercepted by a well of 80 m of depth where there might be mixing with local flow 5 2 2 radiocarbon there is close agreement between age estimates using models ages from pearson et al 1965 eichinger 1983 evans et al 1979 and fontes and garnier 1979 while the iaea 1983 and mook 1980 models ages yielded results marginally older on the other hand the pearson model produced relative lower age values corrections our results indicate that tamers 1967 mook 1980 and international atomic energy agency iaea 1983 models gave anomalous ages due to their inability to correct solid phase isotopic exchange despite differing approaches to model derivation the pearson et al 1965 fontes and garnier 1979 evans et al 1979 and eichinger et al 1983 models produced results that were in agreement for all water samples the ch3 sample resulted in a negative age indicating the presence of 14c derived from external sources which suggests that there was contamination during sampling it is important to notice that green algae were observed in the sampling site 5 2 3 oxygen and hydrogen isotopes fig 5 shows the δ2h versus δ18o graph of samples ch3 group 1 mv2 group 2 toc1 group 3 and sj1 deep well since there is no rainfall isotope data in the study region the meteoric line of brasilia was chosen whose equation is δ2h 9 14 δ18o 15 03 santos 2018 and presents meteorological data very similar to the study region due to its proximity the stable isotope analyses from the characteristic sample of each of the three groups yielded the following results 10 69 δ18o 8 74 and 71 58 δ2h 52 51 the relationship between the δ2h and δ18o values is shown in fig 5 where the local meteoric water line lmwl δ2h 9 14 δ18o 15 03 santos 2018 and the global meteoric water line gmwl δ2h 8 δ18o 10 craig 1961 are also illustrated samples collected in the study region presents light isotope enrichment when compared to the local pluviometry equation and are located above the local meteorological curve the samples then show δ2h enrichment and δ18o depletion the values obtained are lower than the local mean values of atmospheric water which means that the groundwater analyzed suffered processes capable of modifying the original isotopic signal suggesting that samples may fall on a mixing line between modern water and older late recharge with a depleted isotopic composition surface waters from the ch3 and sj1 fall on or very close to the gmwl which indicates different water sources or different reservoirs mixing fig 5 5 3 3 conceptual model the occurrence of water with anomalous temperature in the study area is due exclusively to geothermic grade associated with the flow model since there are no thermal anomalies of magmatic origin in the region the understanding of groundwater flow behavior hydrogeological flow regimes were determined including analyses of recharge and discharge areas positions control and influence of the fractured system the confining condition hydrothermalism characteristics and hydrochemistry signatures hubbert 1940 analyzed the parameters that run groundwater flow and concluded that the hydraulic gradient is responsible for controlling the velocity and flow direction in a homogeneous reservoir the same can be considered for fractured reservoirs which in addition to the hydraulic gradient fracture directions and interconnections also play an important role in the study area the topography is the main flow control which determines the recharge area to be the highly fractured quartzite of the rio preto formation at the chapada dos veadeiros national park northwest of the hot springs reaching 1200 m of altitude fig 6 the distance from the discharge area to the recharge area the groundwater chemistry the 14c and ³h ages in addition to the stable isotopes signature define that the heating processes are due to the geothermal gradient with absence or little influence of recent recharge since the influence of geothermal gradient flow implies greater flow depths the anomalous temperatures increase as it moves away from the recharge the presence of a kilometric statherian fault são joaquim fault and its damage zone which places rocks with different metamorphic degrees and therefore different rheology cause a rapid rise of the flow which emerges in in the valley with temperatures above the atmospheric region average buoyancy due to heating through deep circulation can influence the upward flow however it is not the main process woods 2014 volpi et al 2018 this regime presents little influence of meteoric waters consequently presenting values of ³h content less than 0 5 tu or below the detection limit also samples are generally more mineralized presenting larger amounts of total dissolved solids tds as it moves away from the recharge area and consequently are exposed to longer periods of water rock interaction fig 7 the flow paths are guided by the fracture system therefore the wells that intercept anisotropies linked to the deeper thermal reservoir present higher temperatures which is the case of the sj1 sample on the other hand wells that intercept fractures that receive exclusively recent water flow do not present anomalous temperatures wells that intersect fractures linked to the thermal reservoir but at a shallower depth will also have low temperature water the 0 9 ut result indicates that the well represented by the sample sj intercepted fractures linked to the thermal and the cold reservoirs the deep fault system is responsible for the heating of the waters observed in the present study in this case it is considered that the cold infiltrating water should reach more than 1000 m deep fig 8 the heating generated by the geothermal gradient tends to increase proportionally to the distance from the recharge area considering that the greater the distance the greater the depth reached fig 8 resulting in temperatures up to 42 c and high tds for the water samples the proposed flow model fig 8 is supported by contrasting physiochemical data table 2 for the different groups group 3 average temperatures of 38 c and tds of about 125 mg l for the more distant area from de recharge plateau group 2 samples tds of 45 mg l and temperatures varying from 28 to 34 c and average temperatures of 27 c and low tds for group 1 samples table 2 6 conclusions ³h data indicate that there is no influence from recent recharge with no mixing between the thermal reservoir and the cold reservoir samples mv2 and toc1 from groups 2 and 3 respectively the result of 0 9 tu for ³h indicates a mixture of two different reservoirs sample sj1 from the deep tubular well the value of 0 64 tu for tritium indicates mixture of the thermal reservoir and cold reservoir sample ch3 group 1 the possibility of external contamination is not excluded analyses of radiocarbon were analyzed in years and demonstrate a raw age of 9 270 which corrected by the iaea model resulted in an age of 7877 sample toc 1 group 3 raw age of 2280 was corrected by the pearson model resulting in 2281 years sample mv2 group 2 raw age of 1470 was corrected by pearson resulting in an age of 1352 sample sj1 deep well sample ch3 group 1 presented negative age suggesting contamination from external carbon likely from the algae observed in the water pool the radioisotope ages determined in this study refer to the time elapsed between recharge circulation in the reservoir and the point where the sample was collected however in these cases the age must include the time of water stagnancy in the deeper portions of the reservoir the ages obtained are directly related to the distance of the sample from the recharge area where the oldest samples from group 3 are located in the most distal portion of the recharge area in contrast to group 1 which are younger and located closer to the recharge area the results obtained so far enable identification of the flow patterns the recharge and the hydrochemical behavior of the groundwater in the araí traíras and paranoá reservoirs as well as to contribute to the isotopic study of the groundwater in this region however the present study still allows the development of research in greater detail in order to contribute to the knowledge of the area geophysical techniques are indispensable to better characterize the anisotropies in addition hydrochemical monitoring is recommended including analysis of parameters that complement the water characterization including turbidity organic components biochemical oxygen demand bod dissolved oxygen od and in parallel the study of surface waters maintained by the thermal springs author statement

associated health risks for this purpose groundwater samples n 36 were collected from the mirpur district 3 towns jatlan mirpur and dadyal pakistan the concentration of 222rn in groundwater samples was measured by the rad7 durridge company usa results showed that the average 222rn concentrations in groundwater were 5 99 1 41 5 39 0 89 and 13 6 3 33 bq l of jatlan dadyal and mirpur respectively these results revealed that mean concentrations of 222rn were found within the maximum threshold limits mcl 11 1 bq l of the united states environmental protection agency usepa however that of mirpur surpassed these limits the concentrations of 222rn in mirpur district were evaluated for the annual effective doses ewtotal results revealed that mean ewtotal values of the three studied sites in mirpur district were found lower than the threshold limit 100 μsv a except 6 of sampling sites in the mirpur higher ewtotal values than the who threshold limit in the mirpur could pose threat to human health the estimated lifetime cancer risk showed higher values along with the mirpur of the study area therefore this study recommends that water in the mirpur area should be aerated or heated before consumption to avoid 222rn impact on human health graphical abstract image 1 keywords radon spatial distribution ingestion inhalation risk assessment 1 introduction radon 222 rn is a ubiquitous noble gas contaminant present in water soil and rocks 222 rn originates in the earth s crust due to the natural decay of radium whereas radium itself has been produced by the disintegration of radioactive elements such as uranium or thorium found commonly in trace amounts in the soils and rocks of the earth s crust and ocean interaction bem et al 2014 wen et al 2014 sharma et al 2020 abojassim 2020

great threats to human health in various region of the world weng et al 2021 wu et al 2014 and kadhim and almayyali 2014 stated that when 222rn mixed water is used either for drinking or domestic purposes it is released and ingested or inhaled by humans similarly akram et al 2005 marques et al 2004 and binesh et al 2010 observed that the ingestion and inhalation of 222 rn through various pathways could result in serious health risks in human communities a study report published by usepa 1999 states that 89 of death occur due to lung cancer caused by inhalation of 222 rn and 11 are attributed to stomach cancer caused by its ingestion there are higher chances of chromosomal aberrations in the workers whose exposure to 222 rn is very high bersimbaev and bulgakova 2015 zhuo et al 2001 reported the impacts of malignant tumors in the gastrointestinal and respiratory tract are highest in china because of 222 rn exposure recently 222rn concentration and associate health risks have

pakistan geologically mirpur district is characterized by siwaliks rocks which are enriched with radioactive minerals and their decaying products cerveny et al 1988 these siwaliks rocks could be a possible source of 222 rn contamination in groundwater so far 222rn concentration and associated risk for the groundwater of mirpur district have not been carried out therefore the present study was aimed to investigate the 222rn concentration in groundwater of mirpur district pakistan furthermore the 222rn concentration was evaluated for potential risks assessment of various age groups for their geospatial distributions pattern 2 geological characteristics geologically mirpur district is located in the southernmost part of hazara kashmir syntaxis sub himalayas pakistan which is an antiformal and highly deformed structure baig 1991 the major fault in the study area is the jhelum fault which is a left lateral strike slip fault it truncates the northwest and southeast trending himalayan structures pervez 2016 the siwalik group is the geologically the oldest mountain range extending east west over the himalayas particularly in the southern part this group is comprised of neogene rocks which were accumulated and deposited during the himalayan orogeny it contains mostly sediments of clastic origin and has alternating beds of sandstone and argillaceous material it is further divided into four lithostratigraphic units of rocks i e chingi formation nagri formation dhok pathan formation and soan formation shah 2009 the study area is characterized by the exposed formations of siwaliks s group rocks mirpur conglomerate of pleistocene age and quaternary alluvium deposits pervez 2016 mirpur conglomerates are flood or channels fill deposits and their grains are loosely packed within the argillaceous matrix the alluvium deposits are less compact and contain rounded to subrounded gravel sand silt and clay siwaliks group mainly consists of tourmaline garnet zircon kyanite quartz epidote and staurolite parkash et al 1980 cerveny et al 1988 reported that siwaliks rocks are enriched with radioactive minerals and their decaying products the hydrogeology and climate condition of the area could support 222rn contamination in groundwater the climatic condition of mirpur district is between arid to semi arid with seasonal variations in precipitation and temperature having latitudes and longitudes of 32 33 n and 73 74 e as shown in fig 1 the extreme variation in temperature is between april and october with the mean temperature higher than 31 c in the winter season the mean temperature falls to 12 c in december and january with annual precipitation of approximately 836 mm the maximum rainfall occurs in july and august and ranges between 77 mm and 85 mm the main drainage in the mirpur area is jhelum and poonch rivers many seasonal nalla join the tributaries of the mainstream which recharge and join the river mangla water reservoirs built on jhelum and poonch rivers are the major source of recharge groundwater table in the area niaz et al 2017 3 material and methods 3 1 sampling procedure total 36 water samples from mirpur district including jatlan n 12 mirpur n 17 and dadyal n 7 were collected during spring season in march 15 25 2021 as shown in fig 1 sampling locations were randomly selected with the interval of 5 7 km area sampling locations were noted by the global positioning system gps garmin etrex 10 samples were taken from wells boreholes and tap water in a container to get the samples for analysis the source of water was operated for 5 10 min before collection the sample so that no contamination was mixed with sampling water filled the prewashed with nitric acid hno3 15 250 ml glass bottle specifically designed for 222rn measurement each bottle was filled in such a way that no air was trapped and then attach with the rad7 durridge company usa machine for the determination of 222rn concentration 3 2 water analyses the 222rn concentration in samples was examined on spot because of its high decay rate and leakage from a bottle the 222rn value in water was determined with rad7 durridge company usa using the h2o technique the rad7 h2o technique uses standard and pre set protocols and conversion coefficients the process of water analyses using the auto wat 250 protocol was completed in 30 min lee and kim 2006 after 30 min the rad7 gives the concentration of 222rn duggal et al 2020 el taher 2012 the rad7 machine was set with internal humidity of single digit 9 and had high accuracy in the determination of 222rn in the range of 4 400 bq l cinelli et al 2015 the quality control and reliability of measurement methods and results were verified using known samples of radium activity at 4 40 and 100 bq l following the rad7 manufacturer s calibration methods 3 3 evaluation of annual effective dose the presence of 222rn in water can lead to health problems for inhabitants in two different ways a inhalation and b ingestion through inhalation 222rn enters in lungs by breathing air while ingestion is the process of entering 222rn into the stomach by intake of water the yearly mean effective doses of 222rn ingestion ewing and inhalation ewinh through water consumption was found by the equation adapted from unscear 2000 1 ewing crnw cw edc where ewing is the mean effective doses of 222rn ingestion msv y or μsv y crnw and cw is 222rn concentration in water bq l and weighted estimation of water utilization 3 5 nsv bq respectively and edc is the coefficient for ingestion of effective dose the daily water intake by infants children and adults is 0 6 0 8 and 1 3 l ezzulddin and mansour 2020 nasir and shah 2012 a ewinh msv y or μsv y was calculated as adapted unscear 2000 2 ewinh crn f o r dcf where crn is the 222rn concentration bq l f is the equilibrium factor among 222rn and its decay products 0 4 o is the average indoor occupancy time per head 7000 h a the ratio of 222rn in the air to that in water 10 4 and dcf is the dose conversion factor for 222rn exposure 9 nsv bq h m3 ezzulddin and mansour 2020 khattak et al 2011 the total annual effective 222rn dose can be found by the following equation 3 ewtotal ewing ewinh where ewtotal is the total effective dose of 222rn the excess lifetime cancer risk elcr of 222rn was calculated by adapting the equation of icrp 2007 4 elcr h dl rf where h is the mean effective dose dl is the average duration of life 70 years and rf is the fatal cancer risk per sievert 5 5 10 2 sv 3 4 statistical analyses the rates of ingestion for the infants children and adults as well as inhalation were ascertained which were plotted in the sigma plot software 12 5 systate inc and interpolation inverse distance weightage of arc gis software ver 10 4 were used for geospatial analysis for groundwater 222rn concentration and ewtotal of studied age group were used 4 results and discussion in mirpur district the average 222rn concentrations in groundwater and annual effective dose have been assessed for its three towns i e jatlan dadyal and mirpur 4 1 radon concentration the average concentrations of 222rn in groundwater were found to be 5 99 1 41 13 6 3 33 and 5 39 0 90 bq l for jatlan mirpur and dadyal towns respectively table 1 fig 2 a these results revealed that the mean concentration of 222rn in the water of the jatlan and dadyal was found lower than the maximum contaminant limit mcl suggested by the usepa 1999 which is 11 1 bq l however the average 222rn concentration in water collected from the mirpur area surpasses the mcl set by the usepa 222rn concentration in mirpur town was found to be 11 1 bq l higher than the mcl limit set by usepa this abnormally higher value 222rn concentration can be attributed to the adjacent jhelum fault in the vicinity along which an earthquake has occurred moreover one possible reason for the higher 222rn concentration in water of the present study compared to muhammad et al 2020 is most probably because at that time earthquake occurred and stresses were released while now stresses may be building up causing fracturing in the bedrock and providing the pathway to 222rn gas to move and mix up with groundwater another possible reason for higher 222rn values in the mirpur town compared to jatlan and dadyal could be its location near the radiation source muhammad et al 2020 similarly the highest value 51 7 bq l of 222rn concentration found in the study area was recorded from the household bore well at tarapa town mirpur the spatial distribution of 222rn concentrations in groundwater had surpassed 24 sampling area within the mirpur district as shown in fig 2b a higher concentration of 222rn has been observed in the surroundings of mirpur town results of present study were compared to previous studies of groundwater in pakistan and as well as other countries of the world table 2 the comparison showed that 222rn concentration in groundwater of the study area was higher than those reported for penang malaysia salih 2021 makkah saudi arabia aljaloud and elbatouti 2021 whereas it is lower than agbabu nigeria faweya et al 2021 certain local and regional factors like soil texture climate mineralogy and bedrock geology lead to these variations of the 222rn concentration in groundwater of different areas alonso et al 2019 kaur et al 2019 results of the present study were found consistent with the previous study performed by muhammad et al 2020 after the earthquake of september 24 2019 hit in the azad jammu and kashmir a higher concentration of 222rn than the threshold set by usepa could be risky to local community cothern 2014 martins et al 2019 therefore the concentration of 222rn in groundwater was used for the lifetime exposure risks via inhalation and ingestion pathways nazir et al 2021 rani et al 2021 4 2 annual mean effective dose the annual mean effective doses of 222rn in groundwater due to inhalation and ingestion were calculated for different age groups infants children and adults and summarized table 1 fig 3 abc the ewing values were for infants 20 8 5 11 9 18 2 15 and 8 26 1 37 μsv a children 7 94 1 95 3 50 0 82 and 3 15 0 52 μsv a and adults 6 44 1 58 2 84 0 67 and 2 56 0 42 μsv a in the mirpur jatlan and dadyal respectively table 1 the ewinh values for were 34 3 8 4 15 1 3 54 and 13 6 2 26 μsv a in mirpur jatlan and dadyal respectively similarly the ewtotal values were for infants 55 1 13 5 24 3 5 7 and 21 9 3 63 μsv a children 42 2 10 4 18 6 4 36 and 16 7 2 78 μsv a and adults 40 7 9 98 17 9 4 21 and 16 1 2 68 μsv a in the mirpur jatlan and dadyal respectively table 1 results revealed higher doses for infants compared to adults in the study area and prone to be at risk the higher risk of infants in the study area through 222rn consumption in groundwater could be attributed to their higher sensitivity among the exposure pathways the potential risk through inhalation was higher than that of ingestion higher risk through inhalation pathway was observed in support of a previous study reported by ullah et al 2022 for gilgit baltistan and chitral cities in northern pakistan among the studied towns the mirpur showed a higher risk to exposed human population compared to other sites the spatial distribution analyses of ewtotal revealed that higher values along with the mirpur town as shown in fig 4 abc the higher risk of mirpur could be due to a maximum concentration of 222rn in groundwater annual effective doses of the present study were found higher than a previous in peshawar table 3 reported by khattak et al 2011 and much lower than that of northern pakistan ullah et al 2022 for exposure risk the recommended limit of annual effective dose is 100 μsv a or 0 1 msv a by the world health organization who the mean annual effective doses of the study area were found within the who threshold except for 6 of groundwater samples collected in mirpur town as shown in fig 4abc these higher mean annual effective doses could cause various kinds of stomach problem lungs cancer and stomach cancer as well in humans several previous studies reported health issues such as stomach cancer and gastrointestinal problems with an intake of a higher level of 222rn kendall and smith 2002 zhuo et al 2001 and lung cancer ruano ravina et al 2017 kendall and smith 2002 observed that 222rn contamination in water or air was mainly inhaled through the lungs and lead to cancer 4 3 excess lifetime cancer risk excess lifetime cancer risk elcr shows the probability of cancer risk higher than either natural or background risk due to lifetime exposure to a carcinogen agent freni 1987 ibikunle et al 2018 the average elcr was found at 0 04 10 3 0 09 10 3 and 0 04 10 3 for jatlan mirpur and dadyal respectively as shown in fig 5 results showed higher elcr values for mirpur compared to the two locations of the study area results of this study were compared usepa threshold limit 0 1 10 3 and found lower than permissible level except for 9 of groundwater samples collected in the mirpur town average elcr values of the mirpur were found very close to the usepa threshold and could possibly pose a cancer risk in the exposed population in near future the elcr of the present study was found higher than those reported through exposure in vietnam vu et al 2020 and lower than that in iran sherafat et al 2019 5 conclusion this study revealed that the concentrations of 222rn in groundwater of mirpur towns were found higher than the other two i e jatlan and dadyal of the mirpur district moreover 222rn concentration in groundwater of mirpur area was observed higher than suggested mcl of the usepa in 24 of sampling sites in the study area a higher concentration of 222rn in groundwater resulted in higher values of mean annual effective doses along with mirpur town the mean annual effective doses had surpassed the who permissible limit for 6 of sampling sites through water consumption in the local population higher mean annual effective doses through 222rn consumption were observed for infants compared to other age groups the elcr values of mirpur town were also found higher than the jatlan and dadyal the water of jatlan and dadyal was found safe for drinking and utilization for other purposes and pose no significant risk of 222rn related hazards however it is advisable that mirpur town and surroundings should be boiled prior to use because it will be helpful for reducing the health risk due to 222rn in drinking water authors

purposes it is released and ingested or inhaled by humans similarly akram et al 2005 marques et al 2004 and binesh et al 2010 observed that the ingestion and inhalation of 222 rn through various pathways could result in serious health risks in human communities a study report published by usepa 1999 states that 89 of death occur due to lung cancer caused by inhalation of 222 rn and 11 are attributed to stomach cancer caused by its ingestion there are higher chances of chromosomal aberrations in the workers whose exposure to 222 rn is very high bersimbaev and bulgakova 2015 zhuo et al 2001 reported the impacts of malignant tumors in the gastrointestinal and respiratory tract are highest in china because of 222 rn exposure recently 222rn concentration and associate health risks have been focused in various countries of the world austria gruber et al 2009 poland bem et al 2014 india krishan et al 2015 ravikumar and somashekar 2014 malaysia salih 2021 ahmad et al 2015 and nigeria faweya et al 2021 however limited information about 222rn concentration and associated risks are available from quetta ahmad et al 2020 kulachi nasir and shah 2012 bannu shakoor et al 2021 cities of pakistan geologically mirpur district is characterized by siwaliks rocks which are enriched with radioactive minerals and their decaying products cerveny et al 1988 these siwaliks rocks could be a possible source of 222 rn contamination in groundwater so far 222rn concentration and associated risk for the groundwater of mirpur district have not been carried out therefore the present study was aimed to investigate the 222rn concentration in groundwater of mirpur district pakistan furthermore the 222rn concentration was evaluated for potential risks assessment of various age groups for their geospatial distributions pattern 2 geological characteristics geologically mirpur district is located in the southernmost part of hazara kashmir syntaxis sub himalayas pakistan which is an antiformal and highly deformed structure baig 1991 the major fault in the study area is the jhelum fault which is a left lateral strike slip fault it truncates the northwest and southeast trending himalayan structures pervez 2016 the siwalik group is the geologically the oldest mountain range extending east west over the himalayas particularly in the southern part this group is comprised of neogene rocks which were accumulated and deposited during the himalayan orogeny it contains mostly sediments of clastic origin and has alternating beds of sandstone and argillaceous material it is further divided into four lithostratigraphic units of rocks i e chingi formation nagri formation dhok pathan formation and soan formation shah 2009 the study area is characterized by the exposed formations of siwaliks s group rocks mirpur conglomerate of pleistocene age and quaternary alluvium deposits pervez 2016 mirpur conglomerates are flood or channels fill deposits and their grains are loosely packed within the argillaceous matrix the alluvium deposits are less compact and contain rounded to subrounded gravel sand silt and clay siwaliks group mainly consists of tourmaline garnet zircon kyanite quartz epidote and staurolite parkash et al 1980 cerveny et al 1988 reported that siwaliks rocks are enriched with radioactive minerals and their decaying products the hydrogeology and climate condition of the area could support 222rn contamination in groundwater the climatic condition of mirpur district is between arid to semi arid with seasonal variations in precipitation and temperature having latitudes and longitudes of 32 33 n and 73 74 e as shown in fig 1 the extreme variation in temperature is between april and october with the mean temperature higher than 31 c in the winter season the mean temperature falls to 12 c in december and january with annual precipitation of approximately 836 mm the maximum rainfall occurs in july and august and ranges between 77 mm and 85 mm the main drainage in the mirpur area is jhelum and poonch rivers many seasonal nalla join the tributaries of the mainstream which recharge and join the river mangla water reservoirs built on jhelum and poonch rivers are the major source of recharge groundwater table in the area niaz et al 2017 3 material and methods 3 1 sampling procedure total 36 water samples from mirpur district including jatlan n 12 mirpur n 17 and dadyal n 7 were collected during spring season in march 15 25 2021 as shown in fig 1 sampling locations were randomly selected with the interval of 5 7 km area sampling locations were noted by the global positioning system gps garmin etrex 10 samples were taken from wells boreholes and tap water in a container to get the samples for analysis the source of water was operated for 5 10 min before collection the sample so that no contamination was mixed with sampling water filled the prewashed with nitric acid hno3 15 250 ml glass bottle specifically designed for 222rn measurement each bottle was filled in such a way that no air was trapped and then attach with the rad7 durridge company usa machine for the determination of 222rn concentration 3 2 water analyses the 222rn concentration in samples was examined on spot because of its high decay rate and leakage from a bottle the 222rn value in water was determined with rad7 durridge company usa using the h2o technique the rad7 h2o technique uses standard and pre set protocols and conversion coefficients the process of water analyses using the auto wat 250 protocol was completed in 30 min lee and kim 2006 after 30 min the rad7 gives the concentration of 222rn duggal et al 2020 el taher 2012 the rad7 machine was set with internal humidity of single digit 9 and had high accuracy in the determination of 222rn in the range of 4 400 bq l cinelli et al 2015 the quality control and reliability of measurement methods and results were verified using known samples of radium activity at 4 40 and 100 bq l following the rad7 manufacturer s calibration methods 3 3 evaluation of annual effective dose the presence of 222rn in water can lead to health problems for inhabitants in two different ways a inhalation and b ingestion through inhalation 222rn enters in lungs by breathing air while ingestion is the process of entering 222rn into the stomach by intake of water the yearly mean effective doses of 222rn ingestion ewing and inhalation ewinh through water consumption was found by the equation adapted from unscear 2000 1 ewing crnw cw edc where ewing is the mean effective doses of 222rn ingestion msv y or μsv y crnw and cw is 222rn concentration in water bq l and weighted estimation of water utilization 3 5 nsv bq respectively and edc is the coefficient for ingestion of effective dose the daily water intake by infants children and adults is 0 6 0 8 and 1 3 l ezzulddin and mansour 2020 nasir and shah 2012 a ewinh msv y or μsv y was calculated as adapted unscear 2000 2 ewinh crn f o r dcf where crn is the 222rn concentration bq l f is the equilibrium factor among 222rn and its decay products 0 4 o is the average indoor occupancy time per head 7000 h a the ratio of 222rn in the air to that in water 10 4 and dcf is the dose conversion factor for 222rn exposure 9 nsv bq h m3 ezzulddin and mansour 2020 khattak et al 2011 the total annual effective 222rn dose can be found by the following equation 3 ewtotal ewing ewinh where ewtotal is the total effective dose of 222rn the excess lifetime cancer risk elcr of 222rn was calculated by adapting the equation of icrp 2007 4 elcr h dl rf where h is the mean effective dose dl is the average duration of life 70 years and rf is the fatal cancer risk per sievert 5 5 10 2 sv 3 4 statistical analyses the rates of ingestion for the infants children and adults as well as inhalation were ascertained which were plotted in the sigma plot software 12 5 systate inc and interpolation inverse distance weightage of arc gis software ver 10 4 were used for geospatial analysis for groundwater 222rn concentration and ewtotal of studied age group were used 4 results and discussion in mirpur district the average 222rn concentrations in groundwater and annual effective dose have been assessed for its three towns i e jatlan dadyal and mirpur 4 1 radon concentration the average concentrations of 222rn in groundwater were found to be 5 99 1 41 13 6 3 33 and 5 39 0 90 bq l for jatlan mirpur and dadyal towns respectively table 1 fig 2 a these results revealed that the mean concentration of 222rn in the water of the jatlan and dadyal was found lower than the maximum contaminant limit mcl suggested by the usepa 1999 which is 11 1 bq l however the average 222rn concentration in water collected from the mirpur area surpasses the mcl set by the usepa 222rn concentration in mirpur town was found to be 11 1 bq l higher than the mcl limit set by usepa this abnormally higher value 222rn concentration can be attributed to the adjacent jhelum fault in the vicinity along which an earthquake has occurred moreover one possible reason for the higher 222rn concentration in water of the present study compared to muhammad et al 2020 is most probably because at that time earthquake occurred and stresses were released while now stresses may be building up causing fracturing in the bedrock and providing the pathway to 222rn gas to move and mix up with groundwater another possible reason for higher 222rn values in the mirpur town compared to jatlan and dadyal could be its location near the radiation source muhammad et al 2020 similarly the highest value 51 7 bq l of 222rn concentration found in the study area was recorded from the household bore well at tarapa town mirpur the spatial distribution of 222rn concentrations in groundwater had surpassed 24 sampling area within the mirpur district as shown in fig 2b a higher concentration of 222rn has been observed in the surroundings of mirpur town results of present study were compared to previous studies of groundwater in pakistan and as well as other countries of the world table 2 the comparison showed that 222rn concentration in groundwater of the study area was higher than those reported for penang malaysia salih 2021 makkah saudi arabia aljaloud and elbatouti 2021 whereas it is lower than agbabu nigeria faweya et al 2021 certain local and regional factors like soil texture climate mineralogy and bedrock geology lead to these variations of the 222rn concentration in groundwater of different areas alonso et al 2019 kaur et al 2019 results of the present study were found consistent with the previous study performed by muhammad et al 2020 after the earthquake of september 24 2019 hit in the azad jammu and kashmir a higher concentration of 222rn than the threshold set by usepa could be risky to local community cothern 2014 martins et al 2019 therefore the concentration of 222rn in groundwater was used for the lifetime exposure risks via inhalation and ingestion pathways nazir et al 2021 rani et al 2021 4 2 annual mean effective dose the annual mean effective doses of 222rn in groundwater due to inhalation and ingestion were calculated for different age groups infants children and adults and summarized table 1 fig 3 abc the ewing values were for infants 20 8 5 11 9 18 2 15 and 8 26 1 37 μsv a children 7 94 1 95 3 50 0 82 and 3 15 0 52 μsv a and adults 6 44 1 58 2 84 0 67 and 2 56 0 42 μsv a in the mirpur jatlan and dadyal respectively table 1 the ewinh values for were 34 3 8 4 15 1 3 54 and 13 6 2 26 μsv a in mirpur jatlan and dadyal respectively similarly the ewtotal values were for infants 55 1 13 5 24 3 5 7 and 21 9 3 63 μsv a children 42 2 10 4 18 6 4 36 and 16 7 2 78 μsv a and adults 40 7 9 98 17 9 4 21 and 16 1 2 68 μsv a in the mirpur jatlan and dadyal respectively table 1 results revealed higher doses for infants compared to adults in the study area and prone to be at risk the higher risk of infants in the study area through 222rn consumption in groundwater could be attributed to their higher sensitivity among the exposure pathways the potential risk through inhalation was higher than that of ingestion higher risk through inhalation pathway was observed in support of a previous study reported by ullah et al 2022 for gilgit baltistan and chitral cities in northern pakistan among the studied towns the mirpur showed a higher risk to exposed human population compared to other sites the spatial distribution analyses of ewtotal revealed that higher values along with the mirpur town as shown in fig 4 abc the higher risk of mirpur could be due to a maximum concentration of 222rn in groundwater annual effective doses of the present study were found higher than a previous in peshawar table 3 reported by khattak et al 2011 and much lower than that of northern pakistan ullah et al 2022 for exposure risk the recommended limit of annual effective dose is 100 μsv a or 0 1 msv a by the world health organization who the mean annual effective doses of the study area were found within the who threshold except for 6 of groundwater samples collected in mirpur town as shown in fig 4abc these higher mean annual effective doses could cause various kinds of stomach problem lungs cancer and stomach cancer as well in humans several previous studies reported health issues such as stomach cancer and gastrointestinal problems with an intake of a higher level of 222rn kendall and smith 2002 zhuo et al 2001 and lung cancer ruano ravina et al 2017 kendall and smith 2002 observed that 222rn contamination in water or air was mainly inhaled through the lungs and lead to cancer 4 3 excess lifetime cancer risk excess lifetime cancer risk elcr shows the probability of cancer risk higher than either natural or background risk due to lifetime exposure to a carcinogen agent freni 1987 ibikunle et al 2018 the average elcr was found at 0 04 10 3 0 09 10 3 and 0 04 10 3 for jatlan mirpur and dadyal respectively as shown in fig 5 results showed higher elcr values for mirpur compared to the two locations of the study area results of this study were compared usepa threshold limit 0 1 10 3 and found lower than permissible level except for 9 of groundwater samples collected in the mirpur town average elcr values of the mirpur were found very close to the usepa threshold and could possibly pose a cancer risk in the exposed population in near future the elcr of the present study was found higher than those reported through exposure in vietnam vu et al 2020 and lower than that in iran sherafat et al 2019 5 conclusion this study revealed that the concentrations of 222rn in groundwater of mirpur towns were found higher than the other two i e jatlan and dadyal of the mirpur district moreover 222rn concentration in groundwater of mirpur area was observed higher than suggested mcl of the usepa in 24 of sampling sites in the study area a higher concentration of 222rn in groundwater resulted in higher values of mean annual effective doses along with mirpur town the mean annual effective doses had surpassed the who permissible limit for 6 of sampling sites through water consumption in the local population higher mean annual effective doses through 222rn consumption were observed for infants compared to other age groups the elcr values of mirpur town were also found higher than the jatlan and dadyal the water of jatlan and dadyal was found safe for drinking and utilization for other purposes and pose no significant risk of 222rn related hazards however it is advisable that mirpur town and surroundings should be boiled prior to use because it will be helpful for reducing the health risk due to 222rn in drinking water authors

11833,the sustainable use and management of groundwater can benefit from improvements to both qualitative and quantitative groundwater vulnerability methods for a variety of hydrogeologic systems vulnerability methods in karst aquifers rely on key factors assigned different weights according to their estimated influence on groundwater resilience to contamination because of the duality of infiltration and flow in karst aquifers the assessment of vulnerability may be best validated by a process based approach involving a selection of key parameters and their coefficients in this study an integrated validated numerical groundwater model of a karst catchment area lebanon is used to evaluate the impact of model parameters on recharge and spring discharge and identify important parameters that control the intrinsic system vulnerability the model sensitivity is evaluated using an automatic calibration tool for local sensitivity analysis in addition to a variance based local sensitivity assessment of model output time series to various model parameters for two consecutive years 2016 2017 the influence of each parameter was normalized to estimate standardized weights for each of the process based key controlling parameters findings indicate greatest model sensitivity to 1 soil moisture content 2 fast infiltration through dolines simulated using a bypass function 3 climatic parameters precipitation melting temperature and degree day coefficient and 4 aquifer hydraulic properties conduit matrix which have been assigned weights according to their impacts on spring hydrographs and recession other parameters play less important roles based on the results this method proposes to reevaluate the weighting coefficients of key vulnerability factors in the conventional methods based on a numerical model for the proper delineation of protection zones and the establishment of water protection guidelines the conclusions and methods from this study can be upscaled to different karst systems and climatic settings and can assist decision makers toward sustainable groundwater development and protection policies based on scientific evidence graphical abstract image 1 keywords karst integrated numerical model quantitative vulnerability sensitivity analysis 1 introduction groundwater has been under stress due to climate change and increasing anthropogenic stresses green et al 2011 famiglietti 2014 leading to groundwater quality degradation various management methods have been proposed to ensure sustainable preservation of groundwater quality and quantity at the source through the implementation of protection guidelines and assessment of groundwater resilience to contamination ducci and lasagna 2019 the term vulnerability was first introduced by margat 1968 to refer to the extent to which aquifers can be exposed to contamination foster 1987 vias et al 2006 the vulnerability concept is often represented by the simplified origin pathway target scheme goldscheider 2002 neukum et al 2008 that defines the sensitivity of an environment to contaminants from the point of infiltration throughout the unsaturated zone and saturated zone until they reach the groundwater target vulnerability mapping and qualitative approaches have been the most common tools to assess vulnerability and are usually referred to by acronyms such as drastic sintacs pi epik cop and god among others aller et al 1987 civita and de maio 1997 doerfliger et al 1999 foster 1987 vias et al 2006 goldscheider et al 2000 these methods account for the spatial variability of groundwater vulnerability but they rely on weighted surface and subsurface parameters to define the distributed sensibility of an aquifer system or a specific target to contamination dedewanou et al 2015 these mapping methods have been implemented as science supported evidence in land use decision making and water resources management bonfanti et al 2016 as they can provide insights into the groundwater resilience based on aquifer surface and subsurface characterization however the evaluation of the key vulnerability parameters along with their weighting factors is highly subjective according to each method panagopoulos et al 2006 gurdak 2014 moreover maps of protection zones have discrepancies between the delineated vulnerability classes among different vulnerability methods polemio et al 2009 and can lead to errors in the delineation of vulnerability zones and land use management e g land expropriation and re allocations for protection areas karst aquifers are challenging to characterize because of their dynamic complexity heterogeneity and the duality of infiltration and flow regimes bakalowicz 2005 goldscheider 2005 butscher and huggenberger 2008 vulnerability assessment of karst aquifers must account for both concentrated and diffuse recharge as well as the significant heterogeneity of hydraulic properties and geometries in the subsurface doerfliger et al 1999 the combination of all these parameters makes a straightforward assessment of vulnerability in a dynamic karst system challenging butscher and huggenberger 2008 on the one hand high velocities in karst allow for a rapid flushing of conservative contaminants while longer transit times in the matrix enhance the effectiveness of in situ attenuation processes e g bacterial biodegradation and thus allow more time for appropriate groundwater management to address pollution at the target perrin et al 2003 on the other hand processes like dispersion and diffusion will influence peak concentrations and the duration of contaminant breakthrough thus requiring longer groundwater remediation or restoration activities at the target doummar et al 2018a spring responses to snowmelt or precipitation events as characterized by the magnitude and timing of discharge are the output signal of a karst system and are highly variable with time depending upon the input signal and prevailing transport and flow conditions therefore spring responses and their temporal variability cannot be neglected in vulnerability assessments of karst systems butscher and huggenberger 2009 proposed a quantitative method to assess vulnerability based on a reservoir modeling approach calibrated based on karst spring discharge existing quantitative intrinsic vulnerability models e g reservoir models fail to account for the spatial variability and heterogeneity of the karst system additionally the assessment of vulnerability is closely related to physical processes taking place in all the karst compartments doummar et al 2012a b therefore processes such as type of recharge and flow along with storage properties play a major role in shaping the output signal discharge at a spring kovács and perrochet 2008 mudarra and hartmannandreo 2019 furthermore groundwater and karst systems in particular are highly vulnerable to climate change conditions including the variation of snow cover and temperature doummar et al 2018b dubois et al 2020 hartmann et al 2012 therefore there is a need to incorporate climatic parameters in the assessment of groundwater vulnerability andreo et al 2008 the selection of the type and number of parameters in a groundwater vulnerability assessment depends on the type of model and the complexity of the governing processes and the scale of investigation hartmann et al 2020 the estimation and interpolation of model parameters are inevitable because physically based parameters cannot be collectively measured for the whole simulated catchment area hartmann et al 2013 while a model with a limited number of parameters may oversimplify the complexity of the distribution and the process a large number of parameters increases the uncertainty of the model and limits model uniqueness doummar et al 2018a hartmann et al 2013 accordingly many sensitivity analysis methods have been developed to tackle this problem vrugt et al 2003 2005 hill and tiedeman 2007 abebe et al 2010 aster et al 2013 moreau et al 2013 sen and stoffa 2013 sensitivity analysis besides its role in model calibration can identify parameters of lower importance in model output that can be neglected to simplify additional analysis song et al 2015 for hydrological models the ranking and weighting of parameters according to their significance can help identify the main processes or compartments that impact recharge discharge and thus vulnerability wang et al 2012 additionally climatic parameters which are seldom included in vulnerability methods should be accounted for to optimize the understanding of groundwater resilience especially in highly impacted mediterranean and semi arid regions lefebvre et al 2019 dubois et al 2020 in this work an integrated numerical model was assembled for a karst system in a semi arid region governed by snowmelt doummar et al 2018b then model parameters were identified and varied within set physical ranges to determine the ones that play an important role in intrinsic vulnerability according to the most common vulnerability mapping methods in order to estimate the impact of these key vulnerability parameters on the model output with a focus on discharge and recharge a detailed local sensitivity analysis was performed using autocal mike she analysis tool additionally the impact of these parameters is further highlighted with a variance based statistical analysis of model output time series based on both automatic and time series statistical analysis the parameters are finally ranked according to their impact on model output and selected objective functions based on a calibrated numerical model the results of this study highlight the impact of the parameters considered in a qualitative vulnerability method and allow refining weighting coefficients 2 study area the catchment area of el assal spring which covers about 13 km2 is located at altitudes varying between 1 600 and 2 100 m above sea level asl in kfardebbiane area in mount lebanon fig 1 the study area is characterized with a semi arid mediterranean climatic zone with an average annual precipitation of 1 370 mm an average maximum temperature of 27 54 c and an average minimum temperature of 5 73 c the land cover of the catchment area consistent of sporadic shrubs exposed fractured limestone and loamy soils the aquifer system supplies villages of the kesrouane district downstream of the spring with about 24 000 m3 of water per day the geology of the catchment area is mainly composed of pale gray thinly bedded limestone and dolostones of albian and cenomanian age dubertret 1955 the catchment is characterized by a plateau covered with dolines also called sinkholes estimated density of 19 dolines km2 which enable relatively fast infiltration of snowmelt and rain fig 1 the mapped dolines contain non discernible small scale swallets 20 50 cm in diameter buried below rock debris located on the doline flank as indicated by infiltration and flushing tests two types of infiltration can occur within the dolines 1 fast infiltration of direct precipitation october december snowmelt or ponded water through the swallet and 2 diffuse infiltration through the soil in the doline the thickness of the soil in the mapped dolines may exceed 5 m according to some representative auger excavations therefore we assumed a uniform soil thickness of 5 m in all of the dolines limited karstification has occurred along small fissures in thinly bedded limestone and dolostone where no large conduits or caves are discernible consequently this type of karst can be simulated using an equivalent porous medium doummar et al 2018b the spring discharge ranges from 0 3 m3 s during recession to 2 m3 s during high flow periods after snowmelt based on high resolution monitoring 2014 ongoing doummar et al 2018b tracer experiments conducted in dolines on the catchment area revealed transit times from 2 to 14 days over distances of 3 km depending on the flow regime doummar et al 2018b the range of velocities 270 1 540 m d is typical of karst systems ford and williams 2007 3 methods 3 1 integrated flow model a spatially distributed transient integrated groundwater flow model was constructed using mike she dhi 2017 doummar et al 2018b the conceptual model was set based on the methodology adopted in doummar et al 2012 and 2018b table 1 the model geometry and parameterization were based on surface and subsurface characterization of the catchment area the model was first calibrated based on available hydrographs 2010 2013 then recalibrated and validated based on daily spring discharge measurements high resolution collected data 2014 2018 with a nash sutcliffe coefficient e of 0 77 and an root mean square error rmse of 0 218 m3 s the 32 parameters that define flow processes in the compartments of a karst aquifer atmosphere unsaturated zone and saturated zone were incorporated in the model physical parameters such as matrix hydraulic conductivity and soil parameters were inferred from in situ measurements pumping test and soil permeability assessment respectively while other empirical parameters were defined by calibration within literature values doummar et al 2012a b the calibration was performed manually and using scenario runs autocal in mike she until a best fit was defined based on the optimization of a set of objective functions rmse and e the highly conductive layers in the saturated zone were assigned to dry valleys doummar et al 2012a b xanke et al 2016 additionally solutional weathering along fault planes which is the case in the mapped highly conductive lens is the main reason for higher flow in a mature karst system waltham 2002 as a result these locations are expected to have higher conductivities compared to other parts of the aquifer and were mapped as lenses a bypass function was assigned at the location of the dolines and used to channel the precipitation water directly to the saturated zone the bypass as explained in doummar et al 2018b is controlled by three parameters a fraction of total water and two thresholds of soil saturation to define the soil moisture at which 1 a limited amount of bypass occurs and 2 no bypass occurs especially during low flow periods the saturated zone was simulated using darcy s law in an equivalent porous medium with low conductivity matrix drained by a high conductivity lens based on the calibrated model daily time step of el assal spring doummar et al 2018b fig 2 a sensitivity analysis was performed to quantify the impact of key vulnerability parameters on model results the methodology consisted of two main steps 1 a sensitivity analysis using the autocal sensitivity option in mike she to yield a ranking of the model parameters according to their impacts on model results 2 a detailed sensitivity analysis to quantify the impact of parameters on model outputs such as discharge yearly recharge and infiltration 3 a synthesis of sensitivity analysis results to highlight and rank the most important parameters influencing recharge and thus vulnerability and their effect on the shape of the spring hydrograph in high and low flow periods 3 2 parameter selection criteria commonly used parameters from qualitative vulnerability assessment methods were evaluated and compared to the integrated flow model parameters table 1 presents a comprehensive list of the most commonly used vulnerability assessment methods for karst aquifers and their corresponding parameters that represent various hydrological compartments each method prioritizes some hydraulic and spatial parameters over others for instance the cop method is the only method that considers precipitation in the groundwater vulnerability assessment whereas geomorphology and land use are addressed as sensitive factors in the epik method only additionally many unsaturated and saturated zone parameters included in these vulnerability mapping methods table 1 are further assessed soil and aquifer hydraulic parameters using a sensitivity analysis of model output discharge the sensitivity analysis option in autocal was applied for the initial screening of the local sensitivity of the most important parameters during model calibration and validation autocal uses a calibrated model run as the basis of parameter variation within a provided range the result highlights the importance of each selected parameter using the local sensitivity analysis method that works only within the given range and set of parameters the sensitivity of the model to key vulnerability parameters is estimated using finite difference approximation according to equation 1 dhi 2017 autocal estimates the sensitivity coefficients according to three algorithms depending on the user s preference δθi is the perturbation fraction of the initial parameter or parameter range equations 2 and 3 the perturbation factor can be calculated as follows depending on the choice of parameter perturbation 1 s i f θ i 2 δ θ i f c θ i 3 δ θ i f c θ i u p p e r θ i l o w e r where s i is the sensitivity of the model to parameter f is the output measure θi is the model parameter fc is the fraction of the parameter interval θi upper and θi lower are the specified limits of the parameter the central difference approximation algorithm equation 4 featured with the highest accuracy among the other algorithms sui 2018 was applied for the sensitivity analysis within the context of this work sensitivity analysis is initially performed by autocal by comparing the simulated and calibrated time series to calculate the rmse the user defined objective function weighted sum of squares is then applied to aggregate the error estimated in the initial step and rank different varied parameters after error generalization using the objective function 4 s i f θ 1 θ 2 θ i δ θ i θ n f θ 1 θ 2 θ i δ θ i θ n 2 δ θ i the most important parameters involved in the qualitative assessment of the intrinsic vulnerability of aquifers epik cop etc were employed for the sensitivity analysis using autocal table 2 3 3 statistical sensitivity analysis 3 3 1 sensitivity analysis using performance measures multiple simulations were performed with subsequent variations of one model parameter at a time selected depending on the sensitivity analysis applied using autocal the most important parameters were varied within plausible ranges table 2 to test their weighted influence on groundwater susceptibility and to define the degree to which model output is sensitive to the selected parameters the analysis was done on two hydrological years for model output used previously for validation while the model was calibrated for the years 2013 2018 doummar et al 2018b calibrated model time series output infiltration through the unsaturated zone uz recharge to the saturated zone sz and spring discharge q was used as a reference for statistical analysis the main aim of the statistical objective functions is to assess the local sensitivity of the model output to certain parameter variations qualitatively the model sensitivity was assessed relative to the objective functions presented in table 3 along with their impact on groundwater vulnerability and model performance the statistical objective functions test the model sensitivity to parameter variations rmse r2 and nash sutcliffe e have been widely applied for hydrological model assessment legates and mccabe 1999 gupta et al 2009 these parameters evaluate the correlation variability and bias of the simulated model outputs versus the observed data the kling gupta coefficient kge is used here as an additional statistical objective function to help understand the overall model performance by compiling all the objectives from the other statistical functions correlation variability and bias gupta et al 2009 kling et al 2012 applied kge for hydrological model performance evaluation in the danube basin results showed that kge succeeded in meeting its main objectives correlation variability and bias with simple assessment representation model output associated with vulnerability consists of spring discharge maximum minimum and mean and recession coefficient α spring discharge is the resultant force vector of all of the subsurface and surface hydrological processes due to the high maturity of the karst conduits the fast and high response of the spring discharge leads to rapid contaminant transport that results in a high susceptibility to contamination leibundgut et al 1998 on the other hand the mean and minimum spring discharge rates are representative of the mean water volumes available throughout the hydrological year for the dilution of contaminants butscher and huggenberger 2008 for instance a high recession coefficient implies that the aquifer water storage in summer is rather limited the latter results in unsustainable water quantities throughout the hydrological year escolero et al 2002 and in a lower capacity for dilution of any type of point source pollution during the recession period 3 3 2 variance based sensitivity assessment to assess the local sensitivity of the key vulnerability parameters tested using the autocal tool several statistical sensitivity assessment methods were applied statistical functions for the sensitivity analysis along with their ranking criteria and relationship to groundwater vulnerability are presented in table 3 the analysis was performed mainly on the hydraulic parameters of the unsaturated and saturated zones the ratio of the variance of the physical parameters as assigned based on literature to that of the variance of model output data was estimated song et al 2015 as per table 4 model output time series data were summed total volume and residuals or averaged mean discharge to simplify the calculations as a result the model has a specific sensitivity approximation for each of the varied parameters accordingly a score is assigned to each of the evaluated parameters relative to the maximum and minimum sensitivity values three local sensitivity measures related to the variance of model output and parameter variation were adopted to validate the used methodology as presented in table 4 the ranking of model parameters according to the local sensitivity analysis can be used as the basis of the newly developed vulnerability method with weights that are unique for each evaluated system in addition to their implication for model performance the evaluated parameters are highly related to groundwater vulnerability indirectly through discharge for instance measures related to total discharged volume from the system and mean spring discharge are interconnected with the available volume in the system for contaminant dilution and sustainable availability of groundwater flow throughout the hydrological year respectively as mentioned earlier the function related to the sum of residual error of spring discharge estimates the spring discharge variations to a mean value as a response to parameter variation in addition to its indication of model performance loague and corwin 1998 3 3 3 assessment of the spatial distribution of parameters the general assessment of the groundwater recharge volumes was assessed for model cells corresponding to the different slopes and geomorphological features spatially distributed within the catchment area the categories considered for model output extraction are dolines and rock outcrops exposed rocks and slope steepness can affect surface water infiltration into groundwater thus affecting the rate of contaminant transport to groundwater abdullah et al 2015 ghazavi and ebrahimi 2015 however it is worth noting that there are limitations in capturing the effect of the distribution of the dolines their exact dimensions and the location of the point source infiltration on model output due to the coarse resolution of the used model the sensitivity analysis was performed on the extreme levels of slope steepness very gentle to very steep and exposed lithology soil to bare rock the slope and exposed surface material combinations are as follows 1 very steep slope 35 and bare rock fractured limestone 2 very steep slope 35 and doline clayey soil 3 very gentle slope 0 5 and bare rock fractured limestone 4 very gentle slope 0 5 and doline clayey soil 4 results and discussion 4 1 autocal results and analysis table 5 summarizes the autocal sensitivity analysis results and parameter ranking aggregated sensitivity coefficients were normalized with respect to the maximum coefficient to a range between 0 and 1 for comparison purposes additionally the sensitivity coefficient is proportional to the impact of each parameter results are specific to this numerical integrated model used in the simulation of flow in the el assal catchment and do not account for the complexities in karst systems that are often difficult to address ghasemizadeh et al 2016 parameters are ranked according to a local sensitivity coefficient fig 3 and classified according to four sensitivity categories table 5 unsaturated zone hydraulic parameters include soil saturated moisture content θs van genuchten water retention curve empirical parameters αv and nsoil and bypass of infiltrated fraction of net rainfall to the saturated zone byp apart from αv the values of the highest sensitivity coefficient sc are high for these parameters 1 0 0 14 0 74 and 0 95 respectively these results are consistent with the soil being the first receptor of surface contaminants because soil hydraulics and thickness are the main factors that control the infiltration and transport processes of contaminants to groundwater bazimenyera and zhonghua 2008 prasad et al 2011 muhammad et al 2015 bypass is inferred below the mapped dolines and is indicative of point source infiltration mostly of snowmelt moreover the horizontal hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer has a high impact on the model sensitivity table 5 fig 3 and is also categorized as an important parameter climatic parameters specifically temperature and precipitation affect the recharge trends of groundwater inducing an impact on groundwater vulnerability moeck et al 2020 stuart et al 2011 parameters related to temperature degree day coefficient d and melting temperature mt were categorized in the moderate to low sensitivity class sc 0 01 0 03 table 5 the hydraulic conductivity of the highly conductive lens was categorized as medium sensitivity sc 0 06 0 09 table 5 because it enhances flow and the movement of contaminants through the highly conductive zone lens only after infiltration finally factors related to the vegetation cover and epikarst empirical parameters are the least important or negligible in the model output table 5 fig 3 a validation of these results can be performed on areas of different land use and land cover characteristics where vegetation parameters may yield a greater impact on model results moreover since the modeled aquifer is an unconfined karst system specific storage of the aquifer ssa is not expected to have any impact on the groundwater dynamics in the aquifer the vertical components of the aquifer and lens hydraulic conductivity are usually 10 fold less than the horizontal hydraulic conductivity components this explains the local sensitivity analysis results that the vertical hydraulic conductivity has negligible influence on the model table 5 similarly the model was not sensitive to variations in soil hydraulic properties that influence the activation of the bypass function according to the soil saturation nobyp and bypθ table 4 because the main factor that controls water flow through the soil is the bypass fraction of total precipitation byp generally autocal sensitivity outcomes table 4 fig 3 are consistent with the results of doummar et al 2012a b that were observed for the karst catchment area of a spring in the swabian alb under different climatic and karstification conditions concurring results between the two studies and classifying parameters as per model compartments have shown that model output was most sensitive to parameters related to the unsaturated zone followed by those related to the aquifer and then to the highly conductive lens along with the climate 4 2 time series statistical analysis results based on the outcomes of the sensitivity analysis performed with autocal additional manual statistical evaluations were conducted on the most important parameters a general screening of the impact of the selected parameters was performed using different statistical performance measures presented in table 3 the effects on groundwater vulnerability were inferred upon the extraction of additional preliminary statistical evaluation variance based statistical methods were also applied table 4 to assess and validate the local sensitivity of the model parameters additionally the impacts of climatic parameters slope and geomorphological factors on groundwater vulnerability within the catchment area were assessed 4 2 1 preliminary statistical assessment fig 4 summarizes the statistical and model outputs results for year 1 2015 2016 to provide an example of the impact of parameter variation on model output and performance measures which are listed in table 3 the parameters selected for individual analysis were dependent mainly on the autocal results and were selected from the different sensitivity categories high to low these parameters and corresponding sensitivity categories are aquifer specific yield sya none bypass fraction from the unsaturated zone byp high hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer kxa high and the highly conductive zone kxc medium and soil saturated moisture content θs high table 4 soil hydraulic parameters were not varied individually rather the effect of soil was tested by applying multi parameter variations e g θs αv nsoil reflective of a physically viable soil type sand loamy sand etc to maintain an actual physical based approach the calibrated model results were used as a benchmark for the statistical analysis to determine the impact of parameter variation on model output i e recharge and discharge and indirectly on groundwater vulnerability the model was sensitive to variations in all parameters except for the aquifer specific yield fig 4 the rmse based on specific yield variations was 0 11 m3 s while the average rmse of all other model parameters variation was 0 7 m3 s moreover kge which takes into consideration correlation bias and variability indicates that soil thickness and the hydraulic conductivity of the lens and aquifer are the parameters with the highest impact on the model fig 4 varying the soil thickness b and kxc lens parameters individually resulted in a decreased kge fig 4 with respect to the actual calibrated values autocal sensitivity analysis was performed for the horizontal and vertical components of hydraulic conductivity separately while the analysis using the manually applied statistical methods accounted for simultaneous variations in both directions thus yielding discrepencies in the ranking of this parameter kxc similar to kxc and soil thickness kxa aquifer alterations decreased the kge index value but to a limited extent in particular decreasing kxa to a threshold value of 10 6 m s reduces kge while a further decrease in kxa causes kge to converge to a value of 1 consequently decreasing the impact on the model additionally a comparison between the calibrated model spring discharge signal and spring discharge outcomes upon parameter variations is presented in fig 5 as shown parameters with great effect on model sensitivity such as kxc induce a great shift of the spring discharge curve from the calibrated curve whereas parameters with less impact on model performance sya table 5 have a much smaller influence on the model outcome fig 5 spring discharge minimum mean and maximum total discharge volume and recession coefficients resulting from parameter variations are used to assess the impact of model parameters on groundwater vulnerability these three parameters are all linked to the rate of depletion of the groundwater system and sustainable groundwater availability throughout the year as mentioned earlier byp is the only parameter that had a limited effect on annual spring discharge yet it influenced greatly the temporal availability of fast flowrates table 6 summarizes the relationship between the spatial variation of parameters and groundwater vulnerability 4 2 2 variance based methods assessment this method was based on the variance of the parameter variations and the model outcomes spring discharge volume the sum of residuals and mean spring discharge rate the analysis was performed for year 1 2015 2016 and year 2 2016 2017 for results validation table 7 presents the variance methods indices for the eight varied parameters along with rankings for years 1 and 2 respectively the estimated variance based sensitivity coefficients are inversely proportional to model sensitivity to the varied parameters the ranking was based on the average sensitivity index calculated from the three variance based objective functions most of the sensitivity results coincide with autocal outcomes soil saturated moisture content and precipitation have the highest impact on model performance according to both autocal and variance analysis hydraulic conductivities of the aquifer and the lens outweigh the model sensitivity towards byp in the variance analysis this inconsistency is attributed to the horizontal and vertical compartments of the hydraulic conductivity being varied simultaneously in the variance analysis whereas autocal variations were applied separately for each conductivity component besides byp temperature and other soil hydraulics related parameters are the next most important parameters according to the variance analysis other findings are as follows the saturated moisture content θs variations with respect to the calibrated parameter value have a larger impact on groundwater vulnerability if increased and θs induced an impact on model simulation results whether decreased or increased in the statistical assessment θs is not considered as an independent parameter but belongs to the class of soils and is ranked 2nd after precipitation soil thickness is inversely proportional to the index of groundwater vulnerability and is ranked 7th among the tested parameters higher hydraulic conductivity values of the highly conductive zone and the aquifer increase the index of groundwater vulnerability both are ranked between 1st and 4th among the influential parameters bypass flow appears to highly influence model results and is ranked 6th thus indicating the importance of fast infiltration via the dolines in karst vulnerability 4 2 3 climatic impact on groundwater vulnerability sensitivity analysis for different climatic parameters was accomplished for the same calibrated model which yielded results that are consistent with doummar et al 2018b and the sensitivity rankings presented in table 7 these two studies demonstrated that precipitation and temperature are essential parameters to address during vulnerability assessment due to their effect on the spring discharge and response along with the total recharged volume especially in a snow governed catchment for instance decreasing or increasing precipitation can impact groundwater vulnerability by altering the volume available for dilution additionally the temperature can incur a lag time for the hydrograph recession by varying the snow storage volume and delaying snowmelt as a result the yearly climatic fluctuation suggests the introduction of a new concept of yearly temporal vulnerability to be accounted for by annual groundwater management practices depending on the seasonal climatic parameters additionally such a methodology allows the groundwater managers or decision makers to understand the spring response quality and quantity and to forecast future scarcity and the need for alternative resources 4 2 4 geomorphology and slope impact on groundwater vulnerability the assessment of the impact of geomorphological and slope features on vulnerability is consistent with theoretical concepts fig 6 presents the groundwater recharge trend versus the slope and geomorphological variations steep slopes are characterized by less infiltration than gentle slopes and exposed rocks facilitate infiltration dolines are characterized by the presence of a soil layer that delays and decreases groundwater recharge by diffuse infiltration in comparison with exposed bedrock that has a direct hydraulic connection with the aquifer conversely the well established karstic system beneath flat dolines results in rapid bypass recharge as presented in fig 6 the bypass percentage of groundwater recharge within flat doline areas is around 26 greater than all the other geomorphologic features while steep dolines are characterized by low bypass infiltration flow consequently karst aquifers in areas with gentle slopes are more prone to contamination ghazavi and ebrahimi 2015 moreover the presence of surface karstic features specifically dolines allows the differentiation between the bypass flow infiltration within the dolines and unsaturated diffuse flow within the soil matrix somaratne 2014 it should be emphasized that the approach taken here yields general results because of the coarseness of the mesh and digital elevation model used in the slope assessment this same methodology may be applied for a finer mesh using a more advanced unsaturated zone module to unravel the dynamics of doline infiltration and the effects of soil and slope on these vulnerable point source infiltration features the tracer experiments show a variability of transit times from identical dolines depending on the flow dynamics in the system snowmelt low flow or high flow with rain indicating the importance of the assessment of vulnerability in transient models butscher and huggenberger 2009 4 2 5 model based parameters ranking compared to qualitative methods coefficients and their implications discrepancies in ranking of the parameters based on the sensitivity analyses used in this study and the weights attributed to these parameters in the most common qualitative assessment methods indicate the need for a physically based reevaluation of the weighting coefficients in qualitative methods the variance based sensitivity indicates that the hydraulic conductivity is an important factor but the local sensitivity indicates kxc of the highly conductive lens is less important than soil parameters it can be argued that the variance based method highlights the temporal variation of the model output while the local sensitivity implies the influence of the parameter on a lumped model output volumetric discharge the cop method weighting of factors that affect vulnerability was consistent with the results of the variance based methods in ranking the soil hydraulic parameters as the most impactful on the other hand the epik method weighted the karstic features and their subsurface maturity as the most important parameters followed by the soil layer then the geomorphological features climatic conditions in particular temperature and precipitation have an important impact on recharge quantities and rate as indicated in the variance based sensitivity analysis the cop method exclusively included precipitation quantities and intensity as an additional factor related to climate any development or update of a vulnerability assessment method must include temperature as a climatic factor due to its impact on recharge trends doummar et al 2018b more broadly the qualitative vulnerability approach may have policy and land use planning implications for protected areas the groundwater modeling approach for vulnerability assessment and its capability of evaluation at a micro scale may accurately indicate less vulnerable areas within the investigated zone 5 conclusions this work presents a methodology for the assessment of the sensitivity of spring flow rate to key parameters in an integrated karst flow model these parameters can be quantified in a vulnerability mapping approach and assigned a rank and weight rather than attributing lumped classes to key vulnerability parameters e g soil lithology epikarst the local automatic sensitivity analysis applied to key vulnerability factors resulted in a ranking of parameters according to the model sensitivity to their variations generally this ranking from most to least impactful is as follows 1 soil hydraulic factors influencing diffuse infiltration notably soil saturated moisture content and van genuchten parameters and the component of fast infiltration beneath dolines percentage of byp 2 aquifer hydraulic parameters especially for a highly conductive lens and 3 climatic factors temperature and precipitation geomorphological and topographical parameters also have a significant impact on groundwater vulnerability by influencing total groundwater recharge quantities while vegetation cover has a negligible impact on the model performance the impact of crop parameters should be further assessed in models representing catchment areas with high land use land cover diversity this study shows that a distributed model can be a useful tool for groundwater vulnerability assessment in karst terrains if catchment data are sufficient to conduct flow simulations the modeling approach can support qualitative methods such as epik and cop in assessing groundwater resilience since a transient distributed model addresses the variability of flow and indirectly vulnerability in time and space because of inherent temporal variability in climatic conditions the temporal vulnerability can only be reasonably understood and forecast using a groundwater flow model by refining the vulnerability classes modeling allows for an optimal classification of protected areas and reduces areas for expropriation or restricted land use notwithstanding the validation of the results using three different statistical methods for two hydrological years limitations remain such as the evaluation of the global sensitivity of the groundwater model to the parameters this can be performed by varying the key vulnerability factors simultaneously and assessing the model performance under combinations of parameter variations which may require intensive computing capabilities additionally the results from this study are only valid for karstic catchments with similar prevailing conditions i e snow governed semi arid catchments with comparable topography and extent of karst development the general approach taken here using a calibrated and validated integrated numerical model to simulate flow in a system with simplified structural and stratigraphical complexity should be applied in other karst terrains within different climatic zones such archetypes for vulnerability assessment based on numerical models can help in the qualitative

11833,the sustainable use and management of groundwater can benefit from improvements to both qualitative and quantitative groundwater vulnerability methods for a variety of hydrogeologic systems vulnerability methods in karst aquifers rely on key factors assigned different weights according to their estimated influence on groundwater resilience to contamination because of the duality of infiltration and flow in karst aquifers the assessment of vulnerability may be best validated by a process based approach involving a selection of key parameters and their coefficients in this study an integrated validated numerical groundwater model of a karst catchment area lebanon is used to evaluate the impact of model parameters on recharge and spring discharge and identify important parameters that control the intrinsic system vulnerability the model sensitivity is evaluated using an automatic calibration tool for local sensitivity analysis in addition to a variance based local sensitivity assessment of model output time series to various model parameters for two consecutive years 2016 2017 the influence of each parameter was normalized to estimate standardized weights for each of the process based key controlling parameters findings indicate greatest model sensitivity to 1 soil moisture content 2 fast infiltration through dolines simulated using a bypass function 3 climatic parameters precipitation melting temperature and degree day coefficient and 4 aquifer hydraulic properties conduit matrix which have been assigned weights according to their impacts on spring hydrographs and recession other parameters play less important roles based on the results this method proposes to reevaluate the weighting coefficients of key vulnerability factors in the conventional methods based on a numerical model for the proper delineation of protection zones and the establishment of water protection guidelines the conclusions and methods from this study can be upscaled to different karst systems and climatic settings and can assist decision makers toward sustainable groundwater development and protection policies based on scientific evidence graphical abstract image 1 keywords karst integrated numerical model quantitative vulnerability sensitivity analysis 1 introduction groundwater has been under stress due to climate change and increasing anthropogenic stresses green et al 2011 famiglietti 2014 leading to groundwater quality degradation various management methods have been proposed to ensure sustainable preservation of groundwater quality and quantity at the source through the implementation of protection guidelines and assessment of groundwater resilience to contamination ducci and lasagna 2019 the term vulnerability was first introduced by margat 1968 to refer to the extent to which aquifers can be exposed to contamination foster 1987 vias et al 2006 the vulnerability concept is often represented by the simplified origin pathway target scheme goldscheider 2002 neukum et al 2008 that defines the sensitivity of an environment to contaminants from the point of infiltration throughout the unsaturated zone and saturated zone until they reach the groundwater target vulnerability mapping and qualitative approaches have been the most common tools to assess vulnerability and are usually referred to by acronyms such as drastic sintacs pi epik cop and god among others aller et al 1987 civita and de maio 1997 doerfliger et al 1999 foster 1987 vias et al 2006 goldscheider et al 2000 these methods account for the spatial variability of groundwater vulnerability but they rely on weighted surface and subsurface parameters to define the distributed sensibility of an aquifer system or a specific target to contamination dedewanou et al 2015 these mapping methods have been implemented as science supported evidence in land use decision making and water resources management bonfanti et al 2016 as they can provide insights into the groundwater resilience based on aquifer surface and subsurface characterization however the evaluation of the key vulnerability parameters along with their weighting factors is highly subjective according to each method panagopoulos et al 2006 gurdak 2014 moreover maps of protection zones have discrepancies between the delineated vulnerability classes among different vulnerability methods polemio et al 2009 and can lead to errors in the delineation of vulnerability zones and land use management e g land expropriation and re allocations for protection areas karst aquifers are challenging to characterize because of their dynamic complexity heterogeneity and the duality of infiltration and flow regimes bakalowicz 2005 goldscheider 2005 butscher and huggenberger 2008 vulnerability assessment of karst aquifers must account for both concentrated and diffuse recharge as well as the significant heterogeneity of hydraulic properties and geometries in the subsurface doerfliger et al 1999 the combination of all these parameters makes a straightforward assessment of vulnerability in a dynamic karst system challenging butscher and huggenberger 2008 on the one hand high velocities in karst allow for a rapid flushing of conservative contaminants while longer transit times in the matrix enhance the effectiveness of in situ attenuation processes e g bacterial biodegradation and thus allow more time for appropriate groundwater management to address pollution at the target perrin et al 2003 on the other hand processes like dispersion and diffusion will influence peak concentrations and the duration of contaminant breakthrough thus requiring longer groundwater remediation or restoration activities at the target doummar et al 2018a spring responses to snowmelt or precipitation events as characterized by the magnitude and timing of discharge are the output signal of a karst system and are highly variable with time depending upon the input signal and prevailing transport and flow conditions therefore spring responses and their temporal variability cannot be neglected in vulnerability assessments of karst systems butscher and huggenberger 2009 proposed a quantitative method to assess vulnerability based on a reservoir modeling approach calibrated based on karst spring discharge existing quantitative intrinsic vulnerability models e g reservoir models fail to account for the spatial variability and heterogeneity of the karst system additionally the assessment of vulnerability is closely related to physical processes taking place in all the karst compartments doummar et al 2012a b therefore processes such as type of recharge and flow along with storage properties play a major role in shaping the output signal discharge at a spring kovács and perrochet 2008 mudarra and hartmannandreo 2019 furthermore groundwater and karst systems in particular are highly vulnerable to climate change conditions including the variation of snow cover and temperature doummar et al 2018b dubois et al 2020 hartmann et al 2012 therefore there is a need to incorporate climatic parameters in the assessment of groundwater vulnerability andreo et al 2008 the selection of the type and number of parameters in a groundwater vulnerability assessment depends on the type of model and the complexity of the governing processes and the scale of investigation hartmann et al 2020 the estimation and interpolation of model parameters are inevitable because physically based parameters cannot be collectively measured for the whole simulated catchment area hartmann et al 2013 while a model with a limited number of parameters may oversimplify the complexity of the distribution and the process a large number of parameters increases the uncertainty of the model and limits model uniqueness doummar et al 2018a hartmann et al 2013 accordingly many sensitivity analysis methods have been developed to tackle this problem vrugt et al 2003 2005 hill and tiedeman 2007 abebe et al 2010 aster et al 2013 moreau et al 2013 sen and stoffa 2013 sensitivity analysis besides its role in model calibration can identify parameters of lower importance in model output that can be neglected to simplify additional analysis song et al 2015 for hydrological models the ranking and weighting of parameters according to their significance can help identify the main processes or compartments that impact recharge discharge and thus vulnerability wang et al 2012 additionally climatic parameters which are seldom included in vulnerability methods should be accounted for to optimize the understanding of groundwater resilience especially in highly impacted mediterranean and semi arid regions lefebvre et al 2019 dubois et al 2020 in this work an integrated numerical model was assembled for a karst system in a semi arid region governed by snowmelt doummar et al 2018b then model parameters were identified and varied within set physical ranges to determine the ones that play an important role in intrinsic vulnerability according to the most common vulnerability mapping methods in order to estimate the impact of these key vulnerability parameters on the model output with a focus on discharge and recharge a detailed local sensitivity analysis was performed using autocal mike she analysis tool additionally the impact of these parameters is further highlighted with a variance based statistical analysis of model output time series based on both automatic and time series statistical analysis the parameters are finally ranked according to their impact on model output and selected objective functions based on a calibrated numerical model the results of this study highlight the impact of the parameters considered in a qualitative vulnerability method and allow refining weighting coefficients 2 study area the catchment area of el assal spring which covers about 13 km2 is located at altitudes varying between 1 600 and 2 100 m above sea level asl in kfardebbiane area in mount lebanon fig 1 the study area is characterized with a semi arid mediterranean climatic zone with an average annual precipitation of 1 370 mm an average maximum temperature of 27 54 c and an average minimum temperature of 5 73 c the land cover of the catchment area consistent of sporadic shrubs exposed fractured limestone and loamy soils the aquifer system supplies villages of the kesrouane district downstream of the spring with about 24 000 m3 of water per day the geology of the catchment area is mainly composed of pale gray thinly bedded limestone and dolostones of albian and cenomanian age dubertret 1955 the catchment is characterized by a plateau covered with dolines also called sinkholes estimated density of 19 dolines km2 which enable relatively fast infiltration of snowmelt and rain fig 1 the mapped dolines contain non discernible small scale swallets 20 50 cm in diameter buried below rock debris located on the doline flank as indicated by infiltration and flushing tests two types of infiltration can occur within the dolines 1 fast infiltration of direct precipitation october december snowmelt or ponded water through the swallet and 2 diffuse infiltration through the soil in the doline the thickness of the soil in the mapped dolines may exceed 5 m according to some representative auger excavations therefore we assumed a uniform soil thickness of 5 m in all of the dolines limited karstification has occurred along small fissures in thinly bedded limestone and dolostone where no large conduits or caves are discernible consequently this type of karst can be simulated using an equivalent porous medium doummar et al 2018b the spring discharge ranges from 0 3 m3 s during recession to 2 m3 s during high flow periods after snowmelt based on high resolution monitoring 2014 ongoing doummar et al 2018b tracer experiments conducted in dolines on the catchment area revealed transit times from 2 to 14 days over distances of 3 km depending on the flow regime doummar et al 2018b the range of velocities 270 1 540 m d is typical of karst systems ford and williams 2007 3 methods 3 1 integrated flow model a spatially distributed transient integrated groundwater flow model was constructed using mike she dhi 2017 doummar et al 2018b the conceptual model was set based on the methodology adopted in doummar et al 2012 and 2018b table 1 the model geometry and parameterization were based on surface and subsurface characterization of the catchment area the model was first calibrated based on available hydrographs 2010 2013 then recalibrated and validated based on daily spring discharge measurements high resolution collected data 2014 2018 with a nash sutcliffe coefficient e of 0 77 and an root mean square error rmse of 0 218 m3 s the 32 parameters that define flow processes in the compartments of a karst aquifer atmosphere unsaturated zone and saturated zone were incorporated in the model physical parameters such as matrix hydraulic conductivity and soil parameters were inferred from in situ measurements pumping test and soil permeability assessment respectively while other empirical parameters were defined by calibration within literature values doummar et al 2012a b the calibration was performed manually and using scenario runs autocal in mike she until a best fit was defined based on the optimization of a set of objective functions rmse and e the highly conductive layers in the saturated zone were assigned to dry valleys doummar et al 2012a b xanke et al 2016 additionally solutional weathering along fault planes which is the case in the mapped highly conductive lens is the main reason for higher flow in a mature karst system waltham 2002 as a result these locations are expected to have higher conductivities compared to other parts of the aquifer and were mapped as lenses a bypass function was assigned at the location of the dolines and used to channel the precipitation water directly to the saturated zone the bypass as explained in doummar et al 2018b is controlled by three parameters a fraction of total water and two thresholds of soil saturation to define the soil moisture at which 1 a limited amount of bypass occurs and 2 no bypass occurs especially during low flow periods the saturated zone was simulated using darcy s law in an equivalent porous medium with low conductivity matrix drained by a high conductivity lens based on the calibrated model daily time step of el assal spring doummar et al 2018b fig 2 a sensitivity analysis was performed to quantify the impact of key vulnerability parameters on model results the methodology consisted of two main steps 1 a sensitivity analysis using the autocal sensitivity option in mike she to yield a ranking of the model parameters according to their impacts on model results 2 a detailed sensitivity analysis to quantify the impact of parameters on model outputs such as discharge yearly recharge and infiltration 3 a synthesis of sensitivity analysis results to highlight and rank the most important parameters influencing recharge and thus vulnerability and their effect on the shape of the spring hydrograph in high and low flow periods 3 2 parameter selection criteria commonly used parameters from qualitative vulnerability assessment methods were evaluated and compared to the integrated flow model parameters table 1 presents a comprehensive list of the most commonly used vulnerability assessment methods for karst aquifers and their corresponding parameters that represent various hydrological compartments each method prioritizes some hydraulic and spatial parameters over others for instance the cop method is the only method that considers precipitation in the groundwater vulnerability assessment whereas geomorphology and land use are addressed as sensitive factors in the epik method only additionally many unsaturated and saturated zone parameters included in these vulnerability mapping methods table 1 are further assessed soil and aquifer hydraulic parameters using a sensitivity analysis of model output discharge the sensitivity analysis option in autocal was applied for the initial screening of the local sensitivity of the most important parameters during model calibration and validation autocal uses a calibrated model run as the basis of parameter variation within a provided range the result highlights the importance of each selected parameter using the local sensitivity analysis method that works only within the given range and set of parameters the sensitivity of the model to key vulnerability parameters is estimated using finite difference approximation according to equation 1 dhi 2017 autocal estimates the sensitivity coefficients according to three algorithms depending on the user s preference δθi is the perturbation fraction of the initial parameter or parameter range equations 2 and 3 the perturbation factor can be calculated as follows depending on the choice of parameter perturbation 1 s i f θ i 2 δ θ i f c θ i 3 δ θ i f c θ i u p p e r θ i l o w e r where s i is the sensitivity of the model to parameter f is the output measure θi is the model parameter fc is the fraction of the parameter interval θi upper and θi lower are the specified limits of the parameter the central difference approximation algorithm equation 4 featured with the highest accuracy among the other algorithms sui 2018 was applied for the sensitivity analysis within the context of this work sensitivity analysis is initially performed by autocal by comparing the simulated and calibrated time series to calculate the rmse the user defined objective function weighted sum of squares is then applied to aggregate the error estimated in the initial step and rank different varied parameters after error generalization using the objective function 4 s i f θ 1 θ 2 θ i δ θ i θ n f θ 1 θ 2 θ i δ θ i θ n 2 δ θ i the most important parameters involved in the qualitative assessment of the intrinsic vulnerability of aquifers epik cop etc were employed for the sensitivity analysis using autocal table 2 3 3 statistical sensitivity analysis 3 3 1 sensitivity analysis using performance measures multiple simulations were performed with subsequent variations of one model parameter at a time selected depending on the sensitivity analysis applied using autocal the most important parameters were varied within plausible ranges table 2 to test their weighted influence on groundwater susceptibility and to define the degree to which model output is sensitive to the selected parameters the analysis was done on two hydrological years for model output used previously for validation while the model was calibrated for the years 2013 2018 doummar et al 2018b calibrated model time series output infiltration through the unsaturated zone uz recharge to the saturated zone sz and spring discharge q was used as a reference for statistical analysis the main aim of the statistical objective functions is to assess the local sensitivity of the model output to certain parameter variations qualitatively the model sensitivity was assessed relative to the objective functions presented in table 3 along with their impact on groundwater vulnerability and model performance the statistical objective functions test the model sensitivity to parameter variations rmse r2 and nash sutcliffe e have been widely applied for hydrological model assessment legates and mccabe 1999 gupta et al 2009 these parameters evaluate the correlation variability and bias of the simulated model outputs versus the observed data the kling gupta coefficient kge is used here as an additional statistical objective function to help understand the overall model performance by compiling all the objectives from the other statistical functions correlation variability and bias gupta et al 2009 kling et al 2012 applied kge for hydrological model performance evaluation in the danube basin results showed that kge succeeded in meeting its main objectives correlation variability and bias with simple assessment representation model output associated with vulnerability consists of spring discharge maximum minimum and mean and recession coefficient α spring discharge is the resultant force vector of all of the subsurface and surface hydrological processes due to the high maturity of the karst conduits the fast and high response of the spring discharge leads to rapid contaminant transport that results in a high susceptibility to contamination leibundgut et al 1998 on the other hand the mean and minimum spring discharge rates are representative of the mean water volumes available throughout the hydrological year for the dilution of contaminants butscher and huggenberger 2008 for instance a high recession coefficient implies that the aquifer water storage in summer is rather limited the latter results in unsustainable water quantities throughout the hydrological year escolero et al 2002 and in a lower capacity for dilution of any type of point source pollution during the recession period 3 3 2 variance based sensitivity assessment to assess the local sensitivity of the key vulnerability parameters tested using the autocal tool several statistical sensitivity assessment methods were applied statistical functions for the sensitivity analysis along with their ranking criteria and relationship to groundwater vulnerability are presented in table 3 the analysis was performed mainly on the hydraulic parameters of the unsaturated and saturated zones the ratio of the variance of the physical parameters as assigned based on literature to that of the variance of model output data was estimated song et al 2015 as per table 4 model output time series data were summed total volume and residuals or averaged mean discharge to simplify the calculations as a result the model has a specific sensitivity approximation for each of the varied parameters accordingly a score is assigned to each of the evaluated parameters relative to the maximum and minimum sensitivity values three local sensitivity measures related to the variance of model output and parameter variation were adopted to validate the used methodology as presented in table 4 the ranking of model parameters according to the local sensitivity analysis can be used as the basis of the newly developed vulnerability method with weights that are unique for each evaluated system in addition to their implication for model performance the evaluated parameters are highly related to groundwater vulnerability indirectly through discharge for instance measures related to total discharged volume from the system and mean spring discharge are interconnected with the available volume in the system for contaminant dilution and sustainable availability of groundwater flow throughout the hydrological year respectively as mentioned earlier the function related to the sum of residual error of spring discharge estimates the spring discharge variations to a mean value as a response to parameter variation in addition to its indication of model performance loague and corwin 1998 3 3 3 assessment of the spatial distribution of parameters the general assessment of the groundwater recharge volumes was assessed for model cells corresponding to the different slopes and geomorphological features spatially distributed within the catchment area the categories considered for model output extraction are dolines and rock outcrops exposed rocks and slope steepness can affect surface water infiltration into groundwater thus affecting the rate of contaminant transport to groundwater abdullah et al 2015 ghazavi and ebrahimi 2015 however it is worth noting that there are limitations in capturing the effect of the distribution of the dolines their exact dimensions and the location of the point source infiltration on model output due to the coarse resolution of the used model the sensitivity analysis was performed on the extreme levels of slope steepness very gentle to very steep and exposed lithology soil to bare rock the slope and exposed surface material combinations are as follows 1 very steep slope 35 and bare rock fractured limestone 2 very steep slope 35 and doline clayey soil 3 very gentle slope 0 5 and bare rock fractured limestone 4 very gentle slope 0 5 and doline clayey soil 4 results and discussion 4 1 autocal results and analysis table 5 summarizes the autocal sensitivity analysis results and parameter ranking aggregated sensitivity coefficients were normalized with respect to the maximum coefficient to a range between 0 and 1 for comparison purposes additionally the sensitivity coefficient is proportional to the impact of each parameter results are specific to this numerical integrated model used in the simulation of flow in the el assal catchment and do not account for the complexities in karst systems that are often difficult to address ghasemizadeh et al 2016 parameters are ranked according to a local sensitivity coefficient fig 3 and classified according to four sensitivity categories table 5 unsaturated zone hydraulic parameters include soil saturated moisture content θs van genuchten water retention curve empirical parameters αv and nsoil and bypass of infiltrated fraction of net rainfall to the saturated zone byp apart from αv the values of the highest sensitivity coefficient sc are high for these parameters 1 0 0 14 0 74 and 0 95 respectively these results are consistent with the soil being the first receptor of surface contaminants because soil hydraulics and thickness are the main factors that control the infiltration and transport processes of contaminants to groundwater bazimenyera and zhonghua 2008 prasad et al 2011 muhammad et al 2015 bypass is inferred below the mapped dolines and is indicative of point source infiltration mostly of snowmelt moreover the horizontal hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer has a high impact on the model sensitivity table 5 fig 3 and is also categorized as an important parameter climatic parameters specifically temperature and precipitation affect the recharge trends of groundwater inducing an impact on groundwater vulnerability moeck et al 2020 stuart et al 2011 parameters related to temperature degree day coefficient d and melting temperature mt were categorized in the moderate to low sensitivity class sc 0 01 0 03 table 5 the hydraulic conductivity of the highly conductive lens was categorized as medium sensitivity sc 0 06 0 09 table 5 because it enhances flow and the movement of contaminants through the highly conductive zone lens only after infiltration finally factors related to the vegetation cover and epikarst empirical parameters are the least important or negligible in the model output table 5 fig 3 a validation of these results can be performed on areas of different land use and land cover characteristics where vegetation parameters may yield a greater impact on model results moreover since the modeled aquifer is an unconfined karst system specific storage of the aquifer ssa is not expected to have any impact on the groundwater dynamics in the aquifer the vertical components of the aquifer and lens hydraulic conductivity are usually 10 fold less than the horizontal hydraulic conductivity components this explains the local sensitivity analysis results that the vertical hydraulic conductivity has negligible influence on the model table 5 similarly the model was not sensitive to variations in soil hydraulic properties that influence the activation of the bypass function according to the soil saturation nobyp and bypθ table 4 because the main factor that controls water flow through the soil is the bypass fraction of total precipitation byp generally autocal sensitivity outcomes table 4 fig 3 are consistent with the results of doummar et al 2012a b that were observed for the karst catchment area of a spring in the swabian alb under different climatic and karstification conditions concurring results between the two studies and classifying parameters as per model compartments have shown that model output was most sensitive to parameters related to the unsaturated zone followed by those related to the aquifer and then to the highly conductive lens along with the climate 4 2 time series statistical analysis results based on the outcomes of the sensitivity analysis performed with autocal additional manual statistical evaluations were conducted on the most important parameters a general screening of the impact of the selected parameters was performed using different statistical performance measures presented in table 3 the effects on groundwater vulnerability were inferred upon the extraction of additional preliminary statistical evaluation variance based statistical methods were also applied table 4 to assess and validate the local sensitivity of the model parameters additionally the impacts of climatic parameters slope and geomorphological factors on groundwater vulnerability within the catchment area were assessed 4 2 1 preliminary statistical assessment fig 4 summarizes the statistical and model outputs results for year 1 2015 2016 to provide an example of the impact of parameter variation on model output and performance measures which are listed in table 3 the parameters selected for individual analysis were dependent mainly on the autocal results and were selected from the different sensitivity categories high to low these parameters and corresponding sensitivity categories are aquifer specific yield sya none bypass fraction from the unsaturated zone byp high hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer kxa high and the highly conductive zone kxc medium and soil saturated moisture content θs high table 4 soil hydraulic parameters were not varied individually rather the effect of soil was tested by applying multi parameter variations e g θs αv nsoil reflective of a physically viable soil type sand loamy sand etc to maintain an actual physical based approach the calibrated model results were used as a benchmark for the statistical analysis to determine the impact of parameter variation on model output i e recharge and discharge and indirectly on groundwater vulnerability the model was sensitive to variations in all parameters except for the aquifer specific yield fig 4 the rmse based on specific yield variations was 0 11 m3 s while the average rmse of all other model parameters variation was 0 7 m3 s moreover kge which takes into consideration correlation bias and variability indicates that soil thickness and the hydraulic conductivity of the lens and aquifer are the parameters with the highest impact on the model fig 4 varying the soil thickness b and kxc lens parameters individually resulted in a decreased kge fig 4 with respect to the actual calibrated values autocal sensitivity analysis was performed for the horizontal and vertical components of hydraulic conductivity separately while the analysis using the manually applied statistical methods accounted for simultaneous variations in both directions thus yielding discrepencies in the ranking of this parameter kxc similar to kxc and soil thickness kxa aquifer alterations decreased the kge index value but to a limited extent in particular decreasing kxa to a threshold value of 10 6 m s reduces kge while a further decrease in kxa causes kge to converge to a value of 1 consequently decreasing the impact on the model additionally a comparison between the calibrated model spring discharge signal and spring discharge outcomes upon parameter variations is presented in fig 5 as shown parameters with great effect on model sensitivity such as kxc induce a great shift of the spring discharge curve from the calibrated curve whereas parameters with less impact on model performance sya table 5 have a much smaller influence on the model outcome fig 5 spring discharge minimum mean and maximum total discharge volume and recession coefficients resulting from parameter variations are used to assess the impact of model parameters on groundwater vulnerability these three parameters are all linked to the rate of depletion of the groundwater system and sustainable groundwater availability throughout the year as mentioned earlier byp is the only parameter that had a limited effect on annual spring discharge yet it influenced greatly the temporal availability of fast flowrates table 6 summarizes the relationship between the spatial variation of parameters and groundwater vulnerability 4 2 2 variance based methods assessment this method was based on the variance of the parameter variations and the model outcomes spring discharge volume the sum of residuals and mean spring discharge rate the analysis was performed for year 1 2015 2016 and year 2 2016 2017 for results validation table 7 presents the variance methods indices for the eight varied parameters along with rankings for years 1 and 2 respectively the estimated variance based sensitivity coefficients are inversely proportional to model sensitivity to the varied parameters the ranking was based on the average sensitivity index calculated from the three variance based objective functions most of the sensitivity results coincide with autocal outcomes soil saturated moisture content and precipitation have the highest impact on model performance according to both autocal and variance analysis hydraulic conductivities of the aquifer and the lens outweigh the model sensitivity towards byp in the variance analysis this inconsistency is attributed to the horizontal and vertical compartments of the hydraulic conductivity being varied simultaneously in the variance analysis whereas autocal variations were applied separately for each conductivity component besides byp temperature and other soil hydraulics related parameters are the next most important parameters according to the variance analysis other findings are as follows the saturated moisture content θs variations with respect to the calibrated parameter value have a larger impact on groundwater vulnerability if increased and θs induced an impact on model simulation results whether decreased or increased in the statistical assessment θs is not considered as an independent parameter but belongs to the class of soils and is ranked 2nd after precipitation soil thickness is inversely proportional to the index of groundwater vulnerability and is ranked 7th among the tested parameters higher hydraulic conductivity values of the highly conductive zone and the aquifer increase the index of groundwater vulnerability both are ranked between 1st and 4th among the influential parameters bypass flow appears to highly influence model results and is ranked 6th thus indicating the importance of fast infiltration via the dolines in karst vulnerability 4 2 3 climatic impact on groundwater vulnerability sensitivity analysis for different climatic parameters was accomplished for the same calibrated model which yielded results that are consistent with doummar et al 2018b and the sensitivity rankings presented in table 7 these two studies demonstrated that precipitation and temperature are essential parameters to address during vulnerability assessment due to their effect on the spring discharge and response along with the total recharged volume especially in a snow governed catchment for instance decreasing or increasing precipitation can impact groundwater vulnerability by altering the volume available for dilution additionally the temperature can incur a lag time for the hydrograph recession by varying the snow storage volume and delaying snowmelt as a result the yearly climatic fluctuation suggests the introduction of a new concept of yearly temporal vulnerability to be accounted for by annual groundwater management practices depending on the seasonal climatic parameters additionally such a methodology allows the groundwater managers or decision makers to understand the spring response quality and quantity and to forecast future scarcity and the need for alternative resources 4 2 4 geomorphology and slope impact on groundwater vulnerability the assessment of the impact of geomorphological and slope features on vulnerability is consistent with theoretical concepts fig 6 presents the groundwater recharge trend versus the slope and geomorphological variations steep slopes are characterized by less infiltration than gentle slopes and exposed rocks facilitate infiltration dolines are characterized by the presence of a soil layer that delays and decreases groundwater recharge by diffuse infiltration in comparison with exposed bedrock that has a direct hydraulic connection with the aquifer conversely the well established karstic system beneath flat dolines results in rapid bypass recharge as presented in fig 6 the bypass percentage of groundwater recharge within flat doline areas is around 26 greater than all the other geomorphologic features while steep dolines are characterized by low bypass infiltration flow consequently karst aquifers in areas with gentle slopes are more prone to contamination ghazavi and ebrahimi 2015 moreover the presence of surface karstic features specifically dolines allows the differentiation between the bypass flow infiltration within the dolines and unsaturated diffuse flow within the soil matrix somaratne 2014 it should be emphasized that the approach taken here yields general results because of the coarseness of the mesh and digital elevation model used in the slope assessment this same methodology may be applied for a finer mesh using a more advanced unsaturated zone module to unravel the dynamics of doline infiltration and the effects of soil and slope on these vulnerable point source infiltration features the tracer experiments show a variability of transit times from identical dolines depending on the flow dynamics in the system snowmelt low flow or high flow with rain indicating the importance of the assessment of vulnerability in transient models butscher and huggenberger 2009 4 2 5 model based parameters ranking compared to qualitative methods coefficients and their implications discrepancies in ranking of the parameters based on the sensitivity analyses used in this study and the weights attributed to these parameters in the most common qualitative assessment methods indicate the need for a physically based reevaluation of the weighting coefficients in qualitative methods the variance based sensitivity indicates that the hydraulic conductivity is an important factor but the local sensitivity indicates kxc of the highly conductive lens is less important than soil parameters it can be argued that the variance based method highlights the temporal variation of the model output while the local sensitivity implies the influence of the parameter on a lumped model output volumetric discharge the cop method weighting of factors that affect vulnerability was consistent with the results of the variance based methods in ranking the soil hydraulic parameters as the most impactful on the other hand the epik method weighted the karstic features and their subsurface maturity as the most important parameters followed by the soil layer then the geomorphological features climatic conditions in particular temperature and precipitation have an important impact on recharge quantities and rate as indicated in the variance based sensitivity analysis the cop method exclusively included precipitation quantities and intensity as an additional factor related to climate any development or update of a vulnerability assessment method must include temperature as a climatic factor due to its impact on recharge trends doummar et al 2018b more broadly the qualitative vulnerability approach may have policy and land use planning implications for protected areas the groundwater modeling approach for vulnerability assessment and its capability of evaluation at a micro scale may accurately indicate less vulnerable areas within the investigated zone 5 conclusions this work presents a methodology for the assessment of the sensitivity of spring flow rate to key parameters in an integrated karst flow model these parameters can be quantified in a vulnerability mapping approach and assigned a rank and weight rather than attributing lumped classes to key vulnerability parameters e g soil lithology epikarst the local automatic sensitivity analysis applied to key vulnerability factors resulted in a ranking of parameters according to the model sensitivity to their variations generally this ranking from most to least impactful is as follows 1 soil hydraulic factors influencing diffuse infiltration notably soil saturated moisture content and van genuchten parameters and the component of fast infiltration beneath dolines percentage of byp 2 aquifer hydraulic parameters especially for a highly conductive lens and 3 climatic factors temperature and precipitation geomorphological and topographical parameters also have a significant impact on groundwater vulnerability by influencing total groundwater recharge quantities while vegetation cover has a negligible impact on the model performance the impact of crop parameters should be further assessed in models representing catchment areas with high land use land cover diversity this study shows that a distributed model can be a useful tool for groundwater vulnerability assessment in karst terrains if catchment data are sufficient to conduct flow simulations the modeling approach can support qualitative methods such as epik and cop in assessing groundwater resilience since a transient distributed model addresses the variability of flow and indirectly vulnerability in time and space because of inherent temporal variability in climatic conditions the temporal vulnerability can only be reasonably understood and forecast using a groundwater flow model by refining the vulnerability classes modeling allows for an optimal classification of protected areas and reduces areas for expropriation or restricted land use notwithstanding the validation of the results using three different statistical methods for two hydrological years limitations remain such as the evaluation of the global sensitivity of the groundwater model to the parameters this can be performed by varying the key vulnerability factors simultaneously and assessing the model performance under combinations of parameter variations which may require intensive computing capabilities additionally the results from this study are only valid for karstic catchments with similar prevailing conditions i e snow governed semi arid catchments with comparable topography and extent of karst development the general approach taken here using a calibrated and validated integrated numerical model to simulate flow in a system with simplified structural and stratigraphical complexity should be applied in other karst terrains within different climatic zones such archetypes for vulnerability assessment based on numerical models can help in the qualitative

11834,identifying groundwater potential zones using scientific and modern techniques is crucial in effective and sustainable groundwater management and planning in this paper two multi criteria decision making mcdm approaches analytical hierarchy process ahp and multi influencing factor analysis mif have been used to demarcate the prospective groundwater regions in bankura district eleven contextually significant regulating factors were selected and after a careful literature review of their influencing ability weights have been assigned in both the model environment further these two sets of weighted factors were integrated separately in the gis platform to get the final groundwater potential zonation map which are represented through five potentiality classes very low low medium high and very high both the output maps are then normalized and it has been found that about 25 of the total district area has low to very low potentiality whereas 37 of the total area in ahp and 32

district graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater mapping mcdm ahp mif bankura district 1 introduction water is one of the necessities for sustenance in the earth s biosphere no one can survive without drinking water because it is the most crucial element in the biotic metabolism process although about 71 percent of the total earth surface is covered by water only 3 percent of it is fresh and merely 1 percent is useable agrawal et al 2021 young 2021 in this 1 percent of available useable freshwater some amounts are stored in sub surface aquifers 1 1 the present study area is come under the indo gangetic alluvial aquifer system researcher have argued that though traditionally the whole indo gangetic aquifer marked as a homogeneous and permiable but in reality there are several typologies bonsor et al 2017 macdonald et al 2016 bankura is one of such region of diversity it has a wide range of hydrogeological characteristics that differ from the planes the underlining area has been separated into three parts based on geology and groundwater occurrence i archean crystalline rocks cover the western section with lesser permiability ii laterite and pleistocene era older alluvium formations in the middle sector with moderate permiability ii recent alluvium formations in the eastern sector with higher permiability phed 2018 and we call it groundwater shekhar and pandey 2015 this precious groundwater as a resource is important not only for the survival of biotic life but also for human livelihood generations such as agricultural and industrial operations agarwal et al 2013 typically groundwater is a renewable resource and is naturally restored through infiltration and percolation of surface water das 2019 however it is rapidly dwindling due to massive extraction and rising demand in the never ending journey of modernization and growth with intensification of agriculture groundwater irrigation based multiple cropping demand from a growing population large scale constructions and so on chaudhry et al 2019 das et al 2019 sutradhar et al 2021 according to the central groundwater board of india roughly 17 of groundwater blocks are overexploited while the other 5 and 14 are in critical and semi critical phases the groundwater estimation committee gec 2015 in their report mentioned that 90 percent of rural and half of the urban population in india rely on groundwater for household uses and 60 percent of the agricultural irrigation 2 2 in 1950 51 the indian government had given a high priority on the creation of command areas under canals as a result the canal system contributed more than 40 of total irrigation water in 1950 51 however presently the area irrigated by canals has been reduced to 23 on the other hand in 1950 51 wells and tube wells accounted for 29 percent of total irrigated area now they account for more than 60 percent of total irrigated land narayanamoorthy 2010 which became one of the significant matters of concern among other sources of irrigation in india tank irrigation has 3 share in total irrigated area jain et al 2019 shah et al 2009 in india is constituted by groundwater cwc 2006 jain et al 2019 shah et al 2009 as a result the rapid drying up of shallow aquifers and water shortages has become an increasingly severe issue especially in the arid semi arid drought prone regions das et al 2019 nag and das 2017 therefore to properly organize the water use dynamics towards a sustainable future it is crucial to identify the potential groundwater zones particularly in semi arid and arid regions anbazhagan and jothibasu 2016 hutti and nijagunappa 2011 in this context previous researchers have used the most plausible test drilling and stratigraphy analysis methods but these traditional methods are very much labor intensive time consuming and costly chowdhury et al 2008 das et al 2019 sutradhar et al 2021 however the recent satellite based remote sensing rs technology coupled with geographical information

apart from groundwater mapping the rs gis method is also utilized in mapping the artificial recharge zones kar et al 2020 singh et al 2013 bankura has a long history of groundwater scarcity several months of no rainfall combined with inadequate soil moisture retention capacity geological formation faulty agricultural practices and increasing population pressure have resulted in a situation where the gap between demand and availability of water is widening pradhan and chowdhury 2019 therefore strict water management practices are required to effectively bridge the gap and assure water supply during prolonged dry times modeling the groundwater potential zones is the first step towards efficient management planning thus to free the people from the curse of water scarcity and to spatially locate and examine the nature of the water scarcity problem in drought prone bankura district of west bengal the present study attempted to model the groundwater prospects zones with two different well established multi criteria decision making approaches viz ahp and mif further it also identified which among these two models is most suitable for the study region particularly the research tried to examine how different groundwater recharge and storage control interdependent factors 3 3 the factors were selected based on extensive literature review arkoprovo et al 2013 aykut 2021 dar et al

eastern indian state of west bengal parallel 22 38ʹn and 23 38ʹn and meridian 86 36ʹe and 87 47ʹe define its boundaries administratively the district is bounded by bardhhaman hoogly purulia and west medinipur in the north and north east south east west and south respectively fig 1 in comparison to other regions of west bengal the district is semi arid in nature although it receives an average of 1400 mm of rain per annum rainfall is restricted only in the monsoonal month fig 2 thus despite receiving enough annual rainfall the region is concerned about a groundwater deficit during the summer semester mandal et al 2021 apart from the climatic variability the hydro geological status of the bankura district is significantly controlled by the district s diversified geological configuration phed 2018 by location bankura is the connecting ground of the chotanagpur plateau and gangetic plain the western half of it is consists of a granite gneissic complex of the archean era which is characterized by low infiltration capacity as a result the western part is drier than its eastern counterpart phed 2018 the west bengal pollution control board wbpcb 2009 demarcated the western part as a frequent severe to the extreme drought prone region as mentioned by central ground water board the groundwater occurrences in bankura district are as under 1 unconfined conditions in weathered

methodology flowchart for the present study separately some vital methodology used in this study needs to be explained 2 3 1 applied methodology to calculate net recharge the rif rainfall infiltration factor technique was used to compute the net recharge of the test region siva prasad and venkateswara rao 2018 the calculation of net recharge can be done using the following mathematical formula n e

rainfed in nature maximum as well as continuous rainfall can be seen only for four months of the monsoon season fig 2 thus the average monsoonal rainfall is considered as a groundwater recharge factor to calculate the net recharge for the present study region 2 3 2 land use land cover accuracy estimation in this article the confusion matrix or comparison matrix technique has been utilized to

pioneered the ahp method to standardize the assigned weights for the influencing factors in military resources allocation thereafter it is universally acknowledged as a well structured and easy to understand decision making approach sutradhar et al 2021 also it is widely used as a well proven and intuitive tool in site selection and potential zone determination das and gupta 2021 das and scaringi 2021 pathak et al 2021 in this method decisions can be made based on judgments hierarchical structure and appropriate perception about all the dominant influencing factors of the final decision saaty 1980 1994 the mif on the other hand is a worldwide accepted decision making approach to define prospective groundwater areas of any region in the mif approach the weightage computation considers the interrelationships between various regulating elements stronger the interrelationship greater the assignment of weightage these two models are very much useful for comparison since they are both weighted in nature the ahp model is constructed using the weights offered by several researchers the weights of the mif method on the other hand are entirely dependent on the interrelationships of the many influencing layers the present study is one such example of mcdm multi criteria decision making where different factors were integrated to arrive at the ultimate decision i e mapping the groundwater potentiality therefore the simple integration of different influencing layers is not a good practice for a genuine result because each factor has a different influence on any outcome however the weightage based integration techniques are beneficial thus in this study the widely used ahp and mif methods have been utilized to achieve the final output map the assignment of weights of different influencing factors in both the techniques are completely based on rigorous literature reviews arkoprovo et al 2013 aykut 2021 dar et al 2020 das and gupta 2021 das and mukhopadhyay 2020 das et al 2017 2019 magesh et al 2012 mahala 2021 pathak et al 2021 pinto et al 2017 rajasekhar et al 2019 specifically the interdependences of different selected factors were understood and assessed with the help of literature for the same kind of geographical region arkoprovo et al 2013 das et al 2017 magesh et al 2012 mahala 2021 2 3 4 assignment of weights through ahp technique in this study the entire procedure for ahp weightage assignment was done using saaty s approach saaty 1980 at the first step the pairwise comparison matrix was created based on saaty s 1 9 scale table 2 where 1 means equal influence and 9 means the highly significant influence of one factor relative to the other factors then the normalized pairwise matrix has been prepared from the pairwise matrix information using the following mathematical formula 5 n r c i r c σ i c where nrc normalized value of each cell of the matrix irc individual weightage according to saaty scale of the cell σ i c total weightage of the corresponding column of that cell from the normalized matrix table 3 the normalized weights have been extracted using the bellow mention formula 6 n w σ n r c n where nw normalized weights for each factor σ n r c sum of the normalized value of that row of the matrix n numbers of considered factors the calculation of consistency ratio is very important in the ahp methodology it gives the accuracy or the correctness of the given weightage adiat et al 2013 pathak et al 2021 the estimation of consistency ratio was done using the formula below 7 c o n s i s t a n c y r a t i o c i r i where ci the consistency index calculated in next paragraph and ri random ratio index 8 c i λ m a x n n 1 where λ m a x highest eigenvalue of the normalized matrix n number of thematic layers therefore putting the values in the formula we get c i 12 263460 11 11 1 0 126346 and c o n s i s t a n c y r a t i o 0 126346 1 52 0 083 given the random index ri value for 11 influencing factors is 1 52 saaty 1980 the calculated cr value is 0 08 which is less than 1 0 which means the assignment of weights is acceptable pathak et al 2021 sutradhar et al 2021 the present study has taken into consideration the influence of all sub class of each thematic layer that is why after finding out the normalized weightage for each layer the calculation of class weights for each subclass needs to be done in the process of assigning class weights the highest impactful class has been assigned the layer factor weightage as the class weight further for the assignment of class weight for second impactful third impactful and so on the following methodology has been applied 9 f o r t h e h i g h e s t i m p a c t f u l s u b c l a s s s c w l w where scw highest impactful class weight lw layer weight 10 f o r t h e s e c o n d h i g h e r i m p a c t f u l s u b c l a s s s c w 2 s c w l w n where scw 2 second impactful sub class scw highest impactful sub class lw layer weight and n total no of sub class following the same pattern the class weights of each subclass of all influencing factors have been allocated and presented in table 4 further the class weights are normalized using the normalization formula 5 2 3 5 assignment of weights through mif technique in multi influencing factors mif method the assignment of weightage is based on the interdependence or influencing ability between the factors the influencing ability was decided on the basis of a rigorous literature review table 5 shows the interaction or influencing ability matrix based on the interdependence matrix the weightage for each factor was given if a factor has a significant influencing ability effect then weightage 1 has been assigned similarly for the minor influencing factor 0 5 weightage has been given thereafter by adding all the major and minor effects to other interdependent factors the total weightage for one factor thematic layer has been computed finally with the help of the following formula the score for each factor has been introduced 11 introduced score x y x y 100 where x sum of significant effect weightage y sum of minor effect weightage therefore with the help of the above methodology the introduced score weight for each thematic layer has been calculated table 6 further the calculation of class weights for each subclass of each thematic layer has been made using the same methodology which has been used in the case of class weights calculation in the ahp technique 2 3 6 integration of layers the whole integration process of influential factors for mapping the potential groundwater areas can be discussed by the following steps step 1 collection of information and thematic layer generation of all considered parameters viz geology aquifer thickness soil texture drainage density net recharge lineament density elevation slope lulc swi and ndvi detailed information about each acquired thematic layer has been indicated in the latter part of this paper step 2 categorization has been made for all the generated thematic maps layers using several sub classes and then the sub class weight cw for each sub class of each layer has been assigned assignment of sub class weights and layer weights were done using two already mentioned methods viz ahp and mif based on importance influencing capability and interdependence step 3 in this step thematic feature class layers have been converted into raster format using polygon to raster tool in conversion toolset of arcgis 10 5 software then those rasters are reclassified using the reclassify tool from the spatial analyst to construct an attribute table where the weightage for each pixel was placed step 4 at the final step the calculator was applied to sum up all the reclassified rasters having different grid rates weights to arrive at the final result the mentioned tool is a crucial and critical spatial analysis technique in arcgis 10 5 software that can combine multiple raster images the command for the integration of 11 thematic layers in the raster calculator is as under lookup geology tif cw lookup drainage density tif cw lookup soil texture tif cw lookup lineament density tif cw lookup aquifer thickness tif cw lookup net recharge tif cw lookup elevation tif cw lookup slope tif cw lookup lulc tif cw lookup ndvi tif cw lookup swi tif cw cw assigned feature weight for each pixel both the output overlay rasters ahp and mif were then classified into five potentiality classes from very low to very high potentiality using natural breaking and normalized equal interval algorithm 2 3 7 model validation the receiver operating characteristic roc curve was applied at the end of the present research to validate the final output i e the groundwater potential zonation map this method is well established universally used by different researchers to analyze and illustrate the correctness of any logit model das and gupta 2021 das and mukhopadhyay 2020 ghosh et al 2021 pathak et al 2021 pradhan 2013 it basically depicts the performance of a binary classification model by plotting two parameters actual and predicted ibm spss v26 software has been used for this operation there are two components in the y and x axis 2 3 7 1 true positive rate sensitivity it is the probability that an actual positive will test positive 12 t r u e p o s i t i v e r a t e t p t p f n where tp the positive which are actually true fn negative but actually true 2 3 7 2 false positive rate 1 specificity it s the proportion of negative events that are mistakenly classified as positive false positives compared to the total number of negative events 13 f a l s e p o s i t i v e r a t e f p f p t p where fp positive which are actually false tn true actual negative the auc area under curve is the two dimensional representation of the area beneath the whole roc curve from 0 0 to 1 1 it gives the accuracy of the binary logit classification model the auc output value is a number that ranges from 0 0 to 1 0 where 0 0 auc means 100 percent inaccuracy of the logit model in contrast 1 0 auc defined 100 percent accurate predictions in the present article the roc curve is applied to depict the agreement between the actual yield information and the expected potentiality information in the output maps models 32 validation points have been randomly selected the actual groundwater yield lpm information for those locations was collected from groundwater prospects maps developed by the hydrological unit of the national remote sensing centre nrsc after that the collected data for 32 validation points were classified into five groups viz very high high medium low and very low after consulting with local hydrologists now for validating the groundwater potential zone map of both ahp and mif models the following steps have been followed a in the first step of the validation process the agreements between predicted values and the originally collected yield information for the same points were checked if predicted results can explain the actual value then there is an agreement or incident b by taking the agreements as incident points and disagreements as non incident points binary 1 and 0 codes have been assigned and the roc curve has been plotted with respect to the actual real value independent variable for both the model finally the validity has been measured through auc estimation 3 analysis and results 3 1 influencing thematic layers in order to obtain a thorough grasp of the integration process this section contains a complete description of each thematic layer the geology of bankura is characterized broadly in five lithological units 1 granite and gneissic crystalline complex of the archean era which gripped maximum portion of the western segment of bankura district covering blocks of bankura i and ii chhatna g ghati indpur and parts of khatra hirbandh saltora and mejia groundwater here occurs under unconfined conditions and the prospective aquifers might be made up of two units weathered residuum and underlying fractured hard rock 2 gondwana sandstone and shale occupy the northwestern parts of the district covering portions of saltora and mejia blocks as small patches hydrologically this group is not a good mediator for water and has been given a lower weightage 3 deep alluvium of the quaternary period covering the south eastern and eastern blocks viz bishnupur sonamukhi kotulpur indus joypur and patrasayer in this geological formation groundwater exists both confined situations in deeper aquifers behind a blanket layer of clay particles and the unconfined situation in the case of shallow aquifers the region has vast scope for increasing groundwater recharge therefore the highest rating has been given 4 the fragmented tract of laterites and quaternary alluvium which is underlain by basement rock at a shallow depth of 40 50 m the formation is speeded over simlapal sarenga onda taldangra and some parts of barjora bishnupur and raipur blocks here groundwater occurs under unconfined conditions because of its porous nature it has been assigned a good weightage 5 metamorphic quartzite mica schist in southwestern part occupying ranibandh parts of raipur khatra and hirbandh blocks the metamorphosis does not enable enough water to percolate that is why these individuals have been given the lowest weights fig 4 a shows the spatial pattern of the different geological formations of the bankura district the older alluvium of the quaternary period has covered the maximum i e 46 percent of the study area followed by the gneissic complex which occupies about 27 percent of the total area of bankura district table 4 the drainage density refers to the drainage length in a particular unit of area in a river catchment strahler 1952 the type and structure of rocks as well as soil qualities and slope gradient of a region substantially influence the drainage density manap et al 2013 however the infiltration of surface water is reduced when drainage density is higher due to increased run off das and mukhopadhyay 2020 magesh et al 2012 thus it can be said that the higher the drainage density the lower the groundwater prospect das 2021 patra et al 2018 sutradhar et al 2021 the drainage network of the bankura district is majorly governed by four major rivers viz damodar dwarakeswar silabati and kangsabati these four rivers flow parallel with each other from the west to the south eastern direction the obtained drainage density value has been categorized into three sub classes it has been found from the map fig 4b that the central most part of the test area has maximum drainage density because of greater river flow accumulation which covers 7 percent of the total district area while the periphery region which covers about 34 percent of the total study area has a lesser density lineaments are structural features that are linear or curved and have a significant role in controlling the groundwater occurrences and movements das et al 2018 prasad et al 2008 in the hard rock dominated area like the western section of the bankura district groundwater availability depends on secondary porosity and permeability via lines such as joints fractures and lineament acharya 2013 the surface run off is used to infiltrate to groundwater region through lineaments therefore regions with a good number of lineaments have a greater infiltration rate increasing the storing capacity of groundwater the lineament density map fig 4c was created with the help of the line density technique from the spatial analyst toolset from the map it can be identified that the rocky southwestern terrain has a good number of lineaments and most of the rivers are flowing through the fracture zone in contrast 54 percent of the total area comes under the lowest lineament density group the soil texture significantly impacts infiltration capacity because it directly affects the porosity and permeability biswas and mukherjee 1994 because of this porosity and permeability fine textured soil has a lower infiltration capacity than coarse grained soil avtar et al 2010 in the study area the soil texture varies from gravelly loamy to fine very fine fig 4d the gravelly loamy texture is majorly found in the riverbank regions while maximum parts of the district are covered by fine loamy texture followed by fine texture as a result a significant portion of the study area has a lower infiltration rate from the soil texture map the occupying area for each soil texture has been calculated almost 54 percent is covered by above mentioned fine loamy and fine texture soil on the other hand about 17 percent of the area is occupied by gravelly loam to loamy group table 4 which is permeable in nature according to the influential capacity of different soil textures the class weights have been assigned an underground layer of water bearing porous rock rock fractures or unconsolidated materials viz gravel sand or silt is known as an aquifer simply aquifers are saturated bellow surface areas that provide a commercially viable amount of water for a well or spring if the water bearing porous layer is substantially thick the corresponding surface area has better groundwater security several studies shekhar and pandey 2015 sutradhar et al 2021 found that the aquifer thickness layer directly correlates with groundwater prosperity and potentiality the aquifer thickness map for bankura district has been extracted from the india wris portal and categorized into four subclasses fig 4e it has been found that 65 percent of the area of bankura district comes under the 1m 10m thickness range while about 25 percent of the area is coming under the 18m 30m and above thickness range majorly covering the eastern alluvium zone water that infiltrates from the surface travels through the unsaturated zone and crosses the water table to reach the groundwater system is referred to as recharge it is a sub process in the hydrological cycle the amount of net recharge is highly influenced by continuous and heavy precipitation in this research as we are talking about the groundwater and its potentiality the influence of rainfall can be specifically undertaken by taking into account the spatial net recharge characteristics the net recharge of any area depends on the geology because different geological formation has different infiltration capacity mondal et al 2019 in the current research we have considered rif rainfall infiltration method for net recharge mapping details in the methodology section the calculated values are further divided into four sub classes viz 60 60 70 70 80 and 110 and the map showing more than half of the whole territory of bankura district has a recharge of more than 110 mm fig 4f the slope is the measure of steepness or the degree of inclination of a feature in respect to the horizontal plane it has significant control in the infiltration of water to the water table if a region has a steep slope it slope made the run off faster after precipitation as a result the infiltration and percolation of water are unable to process therefore the slope is very important in groundwater potentiality measurement aykut 2021 rahman et al 2012 the general slope of the bankura district varies from 0 to 40 fig 4g and the western part has a higher amount of slope than the eastern half the prepared map shows five different slope groups and about 44 percent of the total study region have a slope less than 2 in contrast 14 percent area has greater than 3 5 degree slope the bankura district is the convergence zone of granite gneissic chota nagpur plateau and depositional older alluvial gangetic plain thus elevation becomes the major influencing factor of groundwater occurrence because infiltration will be more prevalent on the plains owing to sluggish surface run off or stagnation of water sutradhar et al 2021 in this present era of remote sensing and information technology the height of any point in this earth can be measured through satellite height from msl srtm digital elevation model is a widely accepted approach in determining elevation the elevation of the current concern area varies from 12 to 255 m above mean sea level msl fig 4h the prepared digital elevation model dem has been classified into five elevation groups the notable information from the dem map is that the elevation is lowest in the easternmost blocks and gradually increases towards the southwestern part of the study region lulc land use and land cover directly influences the development and storage of groundwater resources jhariya et al 2016 land use refers to how people utilize the land whereas the term cover means the physical features of the land such as forest river etc in another way lulc is a broad term that describes the categorization of mankind s activities and physical components on the landscape across time using recognized statistical and scientific techniques of analysis of relevant source databases these different lulc categories act differently in the recharge capacity and storage of groundwater like the waterbodies has a better infiltration potentiality than the built up area the present study area i e bankura district has been classified into six different classes from sentinel 2 10m resolution natural color composite fig 4i the classification was done in supervised manner each of the six broad classes has a different impact on water infiltration and percolation accordingly the weightage has been assigned table 4 depicts the areal coverage for each land use class the correctness of delineated classified lulc classes has been measured by the kappa coefficient methodology at the first step a figure of 320 training samples was identified for the six different classes then the correctness of these samples was verified by using real time sentinel image taking time google earth pro and field visit in some cases finally the confusion matrix was generated based on the information collected from field verification and google earth the further calculation for accuracy estimation has already been mentioned in the methodology section it has been found that 284 samples of total 320 samples were correctly classified table 7 the kappa coefficient value is 0 864 at 0 000 significant level that means the classified map correctly categorized 86 percent of ground reality apart from the kappa coefficient the overall user and producer accuracy were also estimated from the confusion matrix table 7 the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi is the ratio between nir reflectivity red reflectivity and nir red it is the often used index among remote sensing experts this algorithm was developed by a nasa scientist named compton tucker in the year 1977 the core idea of ndvi is based on the fact that in contrast to most non plant objects leaves reflect a lot of the near infrared light due to its backside s spongy layers however the spongy layer collapses when the plant is dry and the leaves reflect minimal nir light but the same amount is emitted in red wavelength as a result integration of these two can assist distinguish plants from non plants vegetation cover and soil water availability are closely retaliated to each other a good vegetation zone means there is a good chance for a healthy aquifer in the bankura district the ndvi value varies from 0 35 to 0 74 and the northeastern blocks like bishnupur joypur indus kotulpur patrasayer have the higher ndvi in respect of total area fig 4j in contrast 36 percent of the total area has low 0 23 ndvi the region with surface water bodies indicates good groundwater potentiality because the water bodies are considered to be a good source of groundwater recharge kumar et al 2011 these are the places where surface water flow gathered become stagnant and the water gets its time to infiltrate through the subsurface mediums zhu et al 2019 therefore to map the surface and soil water availability of the research region we retrieved the sentinel water index swi from sentinel 2 satellite image different researchers employed the ndwi normalized difference water index for the same purpose fadhillah et al 2021 however the swi index outperforms the ndwi index in terms of distinguishing urban areas silt salt and ice from water bodies its extraction accuracy is more excellent than the ndwi index and it is capable of accurately extracting water rather than pseudo water zones du et al 2016 jiang et al 2020 using the raster calculator tool the swi may be determined using the formula below s w i v n i r b a n d 5 s w i r b a n d 11 v n i r b a n d 5 s w i r b a n d 11 the calculated swi value for bankura district ranges from 0 72 to 0 74 the highest swi has been found in indus sonamukhi patrasayer and some parts of kotulpur and bishnupur blocks whereas almost 80 percent of the total study area has a low i e 0 72 0 20 swi value fig 4k 3 2 demarcation of areas having ground water potentiality in the present research our ultimate goal was to demarcate the potential groundwater areas zones and to identify the best fitted model for the semi arid bankura district this section highlights the final integration process and output maps of the demarcated potential groundwater areas after completion of the class weights calculation for each and every subclass of individual thematic layers using both methods two different groundwater potential zonation maps one using ahp and another using mif technique have been prepared the preparation of the maps was based on weightage sum overlay methodology which we have performed using the raster calculator tool in the arcgis environment the procedure for conversion of the thematic layer into raster image assignment of class weights and integration of all the reclassified after assignment of weights raster have already been discussed in the methodology section after the integration based on the natural breaking technique the output raster has been classified the natural breaking technique is one of the widely used techniques in the classification of raster das and gupta 2021 figs 5a and 6 a represented the final classified output maps generated using the natural breaking algorithm in ahp and mif model environment notability the classified maps from both the approaches i e ahp and mif are showing more or less the same kind of spatial pattern of groundwater potentiality the southwestern part covering blocks ranibandh some part of raipur khatra indpur and hirbandh has found the lowest potentiality of groundwater in both the maps at the same time there is a similarity to some extent for both maps in modeling all the western bordered blocks of the study district which is covered by primarily low potential zones with some scattered moderate groundwater potential areas for the eastern alluvium zone which is mainly occupied by older and newer fluvial deposits of the quaternary era both the modeled maps depicted high to very high groundwater prospects administratively the blocks namely kotulpur indus patrasayer joypur are found to have the highest groundwater storage in respect to the total study region however for the centrally situated areas like the total onda block the southern part of barjora sonamukhi these two models are projecting quite variation in results although both the classified maps based on natural breaking are depicting a significant difference the comparison is always acceptable when it is done through normalization of scale therefore the pixel groundwater potential values were further normalized on a scale of 0 1 and classified using the equal interval technique from the normalized map based on the ahp technique fig 5b it has been found that 3 percent and 21 percent of the whole territory of the bankura district come under the very low and low groundwater potential class in contrast 23 and 16 percent of the total study area have respectively high and very high groundwater potentiality rest has a moderate type of groundwater potentiality on the other hand in the case of the mif technique based normalized model fig 6b about 6 and 21 percent of the total bankura district have very low and low groundwater potentiality whereas 27 and 14 percentage areas are occupied by high and very high potential groundwater zone at the same time almost 32 percent of the total area has the moderate potentiality of having storage of groundwater 3 3 validation of ahp and mif based groundwater potential zonation when a researcher tried to model something by analyzing different correlational and influencing factors validation becomes the most crucial part of his her study because we all know a model must be a miniature of ground reality therefore without proper validation the model has no importance the roc curve is basically used in the estimation of the accuracy of any binary classification model in the present validation process our two binary dependent variables are agreed incident 1 or disagree non incident 0 which is the result of the accurate explaining ability of the predicted results if predicted results are able to explain the actual value then the dependent variable will be 1 in respect to the actual real value independent variable for the roc curve calculation in both the cases i e ahp and mif the considered classifier value was 0 5 two roc curves one for normalized ahp based output map and another for normalized mif based groundwater potential zonation map have been represented in fig 7 and the agreement and disagreement statistics are depicted in table 8 in the case of ahp fig 7a the calculated auc area under curve is 0 767 and it is a reasonably good value in accuracy estimation in other words the ahp based groundwater potential zonation model can explain 76 7 percent of the actual situation contrary to this in the case of roc graph fig 7b the calculated auc value is 0 879 this means 87 9 percent of the actual groundwater situation is depicted in the mif based groundwater potential zonation model in the mathematical sense the auc values from 0 6 to 0 75 are considered inferior thus the auc value is relatively poor in the ahp based model thus mif model is far better in efficiently and accurately explaining the actual reality for groundwater potentiality of bankura district 4 conclusion india is a country where unregulated demand from a large number of populations has created huge pressure on precious and scarce resources like groundwater in order to maintain the livelihood of this huge population it is high time to do proper planning for sustainable groundwater usage before the advent of rs and gis there was a scarce of handy easily available and appropriate techniques for assessing the scarcity and potentiality of groundwater in any region however with the introduction of remote sensing and gis technology locating groundwater occurrences and its prospect area delineation has become a quick and cost effective operation through geoinformatics the integration of different spatial information of groundwater regulating factors like geology topography human interference etc can give a marvelous map depicting the groundwater scarce and prospects areas the present study is an example of efficient usage of remote sensing and gis environment coupled with proper validation process for sound findings in potential groundwater area identification of bankura district the identification or demarcation of groundwater potential zones revealed that the southwestern part of the study area has more scarcity compared to other places in comparison the northeastern part is highly enriched with groundwater broadly the whole western part and some of the central segments of the bankura district have the low potentiality of groundwater mainly because of the geological structure soil texture and topography however it can be stated that this region will suffer a severe groundwater crisis in the near future at the same time the northeastern and eastern alluvium zone is also vulnerable to groundwater shortage it is mainly because of the excessive exploitation of groundwater for irrigation in the agricultural field despite having good potentiality this will drastically lower the water level in this area thus to maintain the agricultural yield and sustainable groundwater development simultaneously the alternatives of borewell irrigation need to be encouraged however we can conclude that suitable planning for usage is required for the total study region the study also made an attempt to identify the best representative weightage based model for the bankura district among the two well established decision making approaches i e ahp and mif although both the normalized output maps depict the more or less same pattern of groundwater potentiality for bankura district from the validation process it is noticed that the mif based model has greater accuracy compared to the ahp model the auc estimation of the roc curve shows mif has the capability to explain 87 9 percent of the real groundwater situation of bankura district in contrast ahp has a relatively poor auc value 0 767 this means the mif model is best fitted and it is recommended for accurately demarcating the potential groundwater zones of bankura district availability of data and material the sources of all

11834,identifying groundwater potential zones using scientific and modern techniques is crucial in effective and sustainable groundwater management and planning in this paper two multi criteria decision making mcdm approaches analytical hierarchy process ahp and multi influencing factor analysis mif have been used to demarcate the prospective groundwater regions in bankura district eleven contextually significant regulating factors were selected and after a careful literature review of their influencing ability weights have been assigned in both the model environment further these two sets of weighted factors were integrated separately in the gis platform to get the final groundwater potential zonation map which are represented through five potentiality classes very low low medium high and very high both the output maps are then normalized and it has been found that about 25 of the total district area has low to very low potentiality whereas 37 of the total area in ahp and 32 of the total area in mif based normalized map shows medium potentiality finally the receiver operating curve roc and area under curve auc technique have been used to check the reliability of the two applied models and their suitability for the study region the comparison is showing that the mif method auc 0 879 is better reliable and more suitable than the ahp auc 0 767 specifically for bankura district graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater mapping mcdm ahp mif bankura district 1 introduction water is one of the necessities for sustenance in the earth s biosphere no one can survive without drinking water because it is the most crucial element in the biotic metabolism process although about 71 percent of the total earth surface is covered by water only 3 percent of it is fresh and merely 1 percent is useable agrawal et al 2021 young 2021 in this 1 percent of available useable freshwater some amounts are stored in sub surface aquifers 1 1 the present study area is come under the indo gangetic alluvial aquifer system researcher have argued that though traditionally the whole indo gangetic aquifer marked as a homogeneous and permiable but in reality there are several typologies bonsor et al 2017 macdonald et al 2016 bankura is one of such region of diversity it has a wide range of hydrogeological characteristics that differ from the planes the underlining area has been separated into three parts based on geology and groundwater occurrence i archean crystalline rocks cover the western section with lesser permiability ii laterite and pleistocene era older alluvium formations in the middle sector with moderate permiability ii recent alluvium formations in the eastern sector with higher permiability phed 2018 and we call it groundwater shekhar and pandey 2015 this precious groundwater as a resource is important not only for the survival of biotic life but also for human livelihood generations such as agricultural and industrial operations agarwal et al 2013 typically groundwater is a renewable resource and is naturally restored through infiltration and percolation of surface water das 2019 however it is rapidly dwindling due to massive extraction and rising demand in the never ending journey of modernization and growth with intensification of agriculture groundwater irrigation based multiple cropping demand from a growing population large scale constructions and so on chaudhry et al 2019 das et al 2019 sutradhar et al 2021 according to the central groundwater board of india roughly 17 of groundwater blocks are overexploited while the other 5 and 14 are in critical and semi critical phases the groundwater estimation committee gec 2015 in their report mentioned that 90 percent of rural and half of the urban population in india rely on groundwater for household uses and 60 percent of the agricultural irrigation 2 2 in 1950 51 the indian government had given a high priority on the creation of command areas under canals as a result the canal system contributed more than 40 of total irrigation water in 1950 51 however presently the area irrigated by canals has been reduced to 23 on the other hand in 1950 51 wells and tube wells accounted for 29 percent of total irrigated area now they account for more than 60 percent of total irrigated land narayanamoorthy 2010 which became one of the significant matters of concern among other sources of irrigation in india tank irrigation has 3 share in total irrigated area jain et al 2019 shah et al 2009 in india is constituted by groundwater cwc 2006 jain et al 2019 shah et al 2009 as a result the rapid drying up of shallow aquifers and water shortages has become an increasingly severe issue especially in the arid semi arid drought prone regions das et al 2019 nag and das 2017 therefore to properly organize the water use dynamics towards a sustainable future it is crucial to identify the potential groundwater zones particularly in semi arid and arid regions anbazhagan and jothibasu 2016 hutti and nijagunappa 2011 in this context previous researchers have used the most plausible test drilling and stratigraphy analysis methods but these traditional methods are very much labor intensive time consuming and costly chowdhury et al 2008 das et al 2019 sutradhar et al 2021 however the recent satellite based remote sensing rs technology coupled with geographical information system gis can be a very useful and suitable tool for this purpose because it can manage large scale geographical spectral and temporal data in a timely manner for any accessible and inaccessible region das and mukhopadhyay 2020 das et al 2019 jha et al 2007 nag and das 2017 sutradhar et al 2021 several studies have effectively used rs gis techniques to simulate groundwater potential zones by integrating groundwater regulating elements such as geological formation topographical forms climatic conditions pattern and intensity of land uses land covers soil characteristics and so on arabameri

apart from groundwater mapping the rs gis method is also utilized in mapping the artificial recharge zones kar et al 2020 singh et al 2013 bankura has a long history of groundwater scarcity several months of no rainfall combined with inadequate soil moisture retention capacity geological formation faulty agricultural practices and increasing population pressure have resulted in a situation where the gap between demand and availability of water is widening pradhan and chowdhury 2019 therefore strict water management practices are required to effectively bridge the gap and assure water supply during prolonged dry times modeling the groundwater potential zones is the first step towards efficient management planning thus to free the people from the curse of water scarcity and to spatially locate and examine the nature of the water scarcity problem in drought prone bankura district of west bengal the present study attempted to model the groundwater prospects zones with two different well established multi criteria decision making approaches viz ahp and mif further it also identified which among these two models is most suitable for the study region particularly the research tried to examine how different groundwater recharge and storage control interdependent factors 3 3 the factors were selected based on extensive literature review arkoprovo et al 2013 aykut 2021 dar et al

geological formation lineament density aquifer thickness soil texture net recharge drainage density slope lulc land use and land cover ground elevation normalized difference vegetation index ndvi sentinel water index swi affects the storage and movement of groundwater and ultimately the groundwater potentiality of the study area the output of this study will significantly aid policymakers economists and government planners in efficient and appropriate groundwater planning 2 material sources and methods 2 1 demarcation of the study area bankura is one of the western districts of the eastern indian state of west bengal parallel 22 38ʹn and 23 38ʹn and meridian 86 36ʹe and 87 47ʹe define its boundaries administratively the district is bounded by bardhhaman hoogly purulia and west medinipur in the north and north east south east west and south respectively fig 1 in comparison to other regions of west bengal the district is semi arid in nature although it receives an average of 1400 mm of rain per annum rainfall is restricted only in the monsoonal month fig 2 thus despite receiving enough annual rainfall the region is concerned about a groundwater deficit during the summer semester mandal et al 2021 apart from the climatic variability the hydro geological status of the bankura district is significantly controlled by the district s diversified geological configuration phed 2018 by location bankura is the connecting ground of the chotanagpur plateau and gangetic plain the western half of it is consists of a granite gneissic complex of the archean era which is characterized by low infiltration capacity as a result the western part is drier than its eastern counterpart phed 2018 the west bengal pollution control board wbpcb 2009 demarcated the western part as a frequent severe to the extreme drought prone region as mentioned by central ground water board the groundwater occurrences in bankura district are as under 1 unconfined conditions in weathered residuum portion down to around 15m bgl with a maximum depth of up to 25m bgl and 2 semi confined to confined conditions in the fractured zones in the depth of 30m to maximum 60m bgl 2 2 material sources conventional information about different selected indicators like geological map soil texture map lineament structure aquifer thickness drainage density net recharge and a variety of remotely sensed data such as land use land cover lulc elevation slope normalized differential vegetation index ndvi and sentinel water index swi was gathered from different sources table 1 the geological pattern map of bankura district has been generated using the geological survey of india gsi published 1 250 000 district resource map spatial soil texture information was obtained from the natural resources data management system nrdms of bankura district and to make soil texture feature class digitization was performed in arcgis software the drainage lines were scanned using the research area s topographical sheets further a 10 10 sq km grid was created and finally the drainage density layer has been produced using the idw tool in the arcgis environment the lineament structure has been digitized and extracted from srtm dem collected from usgs earth explorer https earth explorer usgs gov after that with the help of the line density technique from spatial analyst tools in arcgis 10 5 environment the lineament density layer has been prepared the aquifer thickness information has been scanned and organized from the india wris web gis portal https indiawris gov in wris the spatial pattern of net recharge has been calculated from the rainfall information available in nasa power access https power larc nasa gov infiltration factor from groundwater estimation committee report gec 2015 and spatial coverage of geological layers a detailed explanation of the net recharge zonation method is presented in the methodology section elevation and slope maps were created using srtm dem data from the usgs united states geological survey earth explorer https earth explorer usgs gov the slope map was generated with the slope tool in the surface toolbox the lulc land use and land cover information for the bankura district is extracted from sentinel 2 natural color band composite with the help of the maximum likelihood technique for supervised classification in the arcgis environment the kappa coefficient accuracy estimation was used to verify the accuracy of the categorized land use land cover map detail explanation is in the methodology section by using the raster calculator of arcgis 10 5 the ndvi normalized difference vegetation index and swi sentinel water index layers were framed from sentinel 2 10m 10m near infrared band band 8 and red band 4 band and sentinel 2 20m 20m visible near infrared reflection band 5 and short wave infrared reflection band 11 bands respectively at the very end the actual yield lpm data of 32 validation points has been collected and manipulated from nrsc isro designed thematic groundwater prospect map which is available at the wbphed official map portal https maps wbphed gov in 2 3 methods applied fig 3 is depicting the total methodology flowchart for the present study separately some vital methodology used in this study needs to be explained 2 3 1 applied methodology to calculate net recharge the rif rainfall infiltration factor technique was used to compute the net recharge of the test region siva prasad and venkateswara rao 2018 the calculation of net recharge can be done using the following mathematical formula n e t g r o u n d w a t e r r e c h a r g e n g r g e o g r a p h i c a l a r e a n o r m a l p r e c i p i t a t i o n r a i n f a l l i n f i l t r a t i o n f a c t o r the study area is monsoonal rainfed in nature maximum as well as continuous rainfall can be seen only for four months of the monsoon season fig 2 thus the average monsoonal rainfall is considered as a groundwater recharge factor to calculate the net recharge for the present study region 2 3 2 land use land cover accuracy estimation in this article the confusion matrix or comparison matrix technique has been utilized to evaluate the accuracy of generated lulc land use land cover classes the confusion matrix basically explains the ground reality as well as the actual correctness of the forecast pixel information cui and shi 2012 myint et al 2008 talukdar et al 2020 zhou et al 2017 simply with this method several pixels of classified images are compared with the actual corresponding ground through field verification three types of accuracy can be estimated by the comparison matrix 2 3 2 1 overall accuracy 1 oa d n where oa overall accuracy d the total no of authentic pixels n total no of pixels taken

in kth row along with the confusion matrix in order to extract the exact correctness of the produced lulc land use land cover map the kappa coefficient k ˆ methodology was also applied the kappa coefficient is one of the widely adopted methodologies in accuracy estimation deng et al 2019 he et al 2011 rwanga and ndambuki 2017 the value of the kappa coefficient varies between 0 and 1 the value

pioneered the ahp method to standardize the assigned weights for the influencing factors in military resources allocation thereafter it is universally acknowledged as a well structured and easy to understand decision making approach sutradhar et al 2021 also it is widely used as a well proven and intuitive tool in site selection and potential zone determination das and gupta 2021 das and scaringi 2021 pathak et al 2021 in this method decisions can be made based on judgments hierarchical structure and appropriate perception about all the dominant influencing factors of the final decision saaty 1980 1994 the mif on the other hand is a worldwide accepted decision making approach to define prospective groundwater areas of any region in the mif approach the weightage computation considers the interrelationships between various regulating elements stronger the interrelationship greater the assignment of weightage these two models are very much useful for comparison since they are both weighted in nature the ahp model is constructed using the weights offered by several researchers the weights of the mif method on the other hand are entirely dependent on the interrelationships of the many influencing layers the present study is one such example of mcdm multi criteria decision making where different factors were integrated to arrive at the ultimate decision i e mapping the groundwater potentiality therefore the simple integration of different influencing layers is not a good practice for a genuine result because each factor has a different influence on any outcome however the weightage based integration techniques are beneficial thus in this study the widely used ahp and mif methods have been utilized to achieve the final output map the assignment of weights of different influencing factors in both the techniques are completely based on rigorous literature reviews arkoprovo et al 2013 aykut 2021 dar et al 2020 das and gupta 2021 das and mukhopadhyay 2020 das et al 2017 2019 magesh et al 2012 mahala 2021 pathak et al 2021 pinto et al 2017 rajasekhar et al 2019 specifically the interdependences of different selected factors were understood and assessed with the help of literature for the same kind of geographical region arkoprovo et al 2013 das et al 2017 magesh et al 2012 mahala 2021 2 3 4 assignment of weights through ahp technique in this study the entire procedure for ahp weightage assignment was done using saaty s approach saaty 1980 at the first step the pairwise comparison matrix was created based on saaty s 1 9 scale table 2 where 1 means equal influence and 9 means the highly significant influence of one factor relative to the other factors then the normalized pairwise matrix has been prepared from the pairwise matrix information using the following mathematical formula 5 n r c i r c σ i c where nrc normalized value of each cell of the matrix irc individual weightage according to saaty scale of the cell σ i c total weightage of the corresponding column of that cell from the normalized matrix table 3 the normalized weights have been extracted using the bellow mention formula 6 n w σ n r c n where nw normalized weights for each factor σ n r c sum of the normalized value of that row of the matrix n numbers of considered factors the calculation of consistency ratio is very important in the ahp methodology it gives the accuracy or the correctness of the given weightage adiat et al 2013 pathak et al 2021 the estimation of consistency ratio was done using the formula below 7 c o n s i s t a n c y r a t i o c i r i where ci the consistency index calculated in next paragraph and ri random ratio index 8 c i λ m a x n n 1 where λ m a x highest eigenvalue of the normalized matrix n number of thematic layers therefore putting the values in the formula we get c i 12 263460 11 11 1 0 126346 and c o n s i s t a n c y r a t i o 0 126346 1 52 0 083 given the random index ri value for 11 influencing factors is 1 52 saaty 1980 the calculated cr value is 0 08 which is less than 1 0 which means the assignment of weights is acceptable pathak et al 2021 sutradhar et al 2021 the present study has taken into consideration the influence of all sub class of each thematic layer that is why after finding out the normalized weightage for each layer the calculation of class weights for each subclass needs to be done in the process of assigning class weights the highest impactful class has been assigned the layer factor weightage as the class weight further for the assignment of class weight for second impactful third impactful and so on the following methodology has been applied 9 f o r t h e h i g h e s t i m p a c t f u l s u b c l a s s s c w l w where scw highest impactful class weight lw layer weight 10 f o r t h e s e c o n d h i g h e r i m p a c t f u l s u b c l a s s s c w 2 s c w l w n where scw 2 second impactful sub class scw highest impactful sub class lw layer weight and n total no of sub class following the same pattern the class weights of each subclass of all influencing factors have been allocated and presented in table 4 further the class weights are normalized using the normalization formula 5 2 3 5 assignment of weights through mif technique in multi influencing factors mif method the assignment of weightage is based on the interdependence or influencing ability between the factors the influencing ability was decided on the basis of a rigorous literature review table 5 shows the interaction or influencing ability matrix based on the interdependence matrix the weightage for each factor was given if a factor has a significant influencing ability effect then weightage 1 has been assigned similarly for the minor influencing factor 0 5 weightage has been given thereafter by adding all the major and minor effects to other interdependent factors the total weightage for one factor thematic layer has been computed finally with the help of the following formula the score for each factor has been introduced 11 introduced score x y x y 100 where x sum of significant effect weightage y sum of minor effect weightage therefore with the help of the above methodology the introduced score weight for each thematic layer has been calculated table 6 further the calculation of class weights for each subclass of each thematic layer has been made using the same methodology which has been used in the case of class weights calculation in the ahp technique 2 3 6 integration of layers the whole integration process of influential factors for mapping the potential groundwater areas can be discussed by the following steps step 1 collection of information and thematic layer generation of all considered parameters viz geology aquifer thickness soil texture drainage density net recharge lineament density elevation slope lulc swi and ndvi detailed information about each acquired thematic layer has been indicated in the latter part of this paper step 2 categorization has been made for all the generated thematic maps layers using several sub classes and then the sub class weight cw for each sub class of each layer has been assigned assignment of sub class weights and layer weights were done using two already mentioned methods viz ahp and mif based on importance influencing capability and interdependence step 3 in this step thematic feature class layers have been converted into raster format using polygon to raster tool in conversion toolset of arcgis 10 5 software then those rasters are reclassified using the reclassify tool from the spatial analyst to construct an attribute table where the weightage for each pixel was placed step 4 at the final step the calculator was applied to sum up all the reclassified rasters having different grid rates weights to arrive at the final result the mentioned tool is a crucial and critical spatial analysis technique in arcgis 10 5 software that can combine multiple raster images the command for the integration of 11 thematic layers in the raster calculator is as under lookup geology tif cw lookup drainage density tif cw lookup soil texture tif cw lookup lineament density tif cw lookup aquifer thickness tif cw lookup net recharge tif cw lookup elevation tif cw lookup slope tif cw lookup lulc tif cw lookup ndvi tif cw lookup swi tif cw cw assigned feature weight for each pixel both the output overlay rasters ahp and mif were then classified into five potentiality classes from very low to very high potentiality using natural breaking and normalized equal interval algorithm 2 3 7 model validation the receiver operating characteristic roc curve was applied at the end of the present research to validate the final output i e the groundwater potential zonation map this method is well established universally used by different researchers to analyze and illustrate the correctness of any logit model das and gupta 2021 das and mukhopadhyay 2020 ghosh et al 2021 pathak et al 2021 pradhan 2013 it basically depicts the performance of a binary classification model by plotting two parameters actual and predicted ibm spss v26 software has been used for this operation there are two components in the y and x axis 2 3 7 1 true positive rate sensitivity it is the probability that an actual positive will test positive 12 t r u e p o s i t i v e r a t e t p t p f n where tp the positive which are actually true fn negative but actually true 2 3 7 2 false positive rate 1 specificity it s the proportion of negative events that are mistakenly classified as positive false positives compared to the total number of negative events 13 f a l s e p o s i t i v e r a t e f p f p t p where fp positive which are actually false tn true actual negative the auc area under curve is the two dimensional representation of the area beneath the whole roc curve from 0 0 to 1 1 it gives the accuracy of the binary logit classification model the auc output value is a number that ranges from 0 0 to 1 0 where 0 0 auc means 100 percent inaccuracy of the logit model in contrast 1 0 auc defined 100 percent accurate predictions in the present article the roc curve is applied to depict the agreement between the actual yield information and the expected potentiality information in the output maps models 32 validation points have been randomly selected the actual groundwater yield lpm information for those locations was collected from groundwater prospects maps developed by the hydrological unit of the national remote sensing centre nrsc after that the collected data for 32 validation points were classified into five groups viz very high high medium low and very low after consulting with local hydrologists now for validating the groundwater potential zone map of both ahp and mif models the following steps have been followed a in the first step of the validation process the agreements between predicted values and the originally collected yield information for the same points were checked if predicted results can explain the actual value then there is an agreement or incident b by taking the agreements as incident points and disagreements as non incident points binary 1 and 0 codes have been assigned and the roc curve has been plotted with respect to the actual real value independent variable for both the model finally the validity has been measured through auc estimation 3 analysis and results 3 1 influencing thematic layers in order to obtain a thorough grasp of the integration process this section contains a complete description of each thematic layer the geology of bankura is characterized broadly in five lithological units 1 granite and gneissic crystalline complex of the archean era which gripped maximum portion of the western segment of bankura district covering blocks of bankura i and ii chhatna g ghati indpur and parts of khatra hirbandh saltora and mejia groundwater here occurs under unconfined conditions and the prospective aquifers might be made up of two units weathered residuum and underlying fractured hard rock 2 gondwana sandstone and shale occupy the northwestern parts of the district covering portions of saltora and mejia blocks as small patches hydrologically this group is not a good mediator for water and has been given a lower weightage 3 deep alluvium of the quaternary period covering the south eastern and eastern blocks viz bishnupur sonamukhi kotulpur indus joypur and patrasayer in this geological formation groundwater exists both confined situations in deeper aquifers behind a blanket layer of clay particles and the unconfined situation in the case of shallow aquifers the region has vast scope for increasing groundwater recharge therefore the highest rating has been given 4 the fragmented tract of laterites and quaternary alluvium which is underlain by basement rock at a shallow depth of 40 50 m the formation is speeded over simlapal sarenga onda taldangra and some parts of barjora bishnupur and raipur blocks here groundwater occurs under unconfined conditions because of its porous nature it has been assigned a good weightage 5 metamorphic quartzite mica schist in southwestern part occupying ranibandh parts of raipur khatra and hirbandh blocks the metamorphosis does not enable enough water to percolate that is why these individuals have been given the lowest weights fig 4 a shows the spatial pattern of the different geological formations of the bankura district the older alluvium of the quaternary period has covered the maximum i e 46 percent of the study area followed by the gneissic complex which occupies about 27 percent of the total area of bankura district table 4 the drainage density refers to the drainage length in a particular unit of area in a river catchment strahler 1952 the type and structure of rocks as well as soil qualities and slope gradient of a region substantially influence the drainage density manap et al 2013 however the infiltration of surface water is reduced when drainage density is higher due to increased run off das and mukhopadhyay 2020 magesh et al 2012 thus it can be said that the higher the drainage density the lower the groundwater prospect das 2021 patra et al 2018 sutradhar et al 2021 the drainage network of the bankura district is majorly governed by four major rivers viz damodar dwarakeswar silabati and kangsabati these four rivers flow parallel with each other from the west to the south eastern direction the obtained drainage density value has been categorized into three sub classes it has been found from the map fig 4b that the central most part of the test area has maximum drainage density because of greater river flow accumulation which covers 7 percent of the total district area while the periphery region which covers about 34 percent of the total study area has a lesser density lineaments are structural features that are linear or curved and have a significant role in controlling the groundwater occurrences and movements das et al 2018 prasad et al 2008 in the hard rock dominated area like the western section of the bankura district groundwater availability depends on secondary porosity and permeability via lines such as joints fractures and lineament acharya 2013 the surface run off is used to infiltrate to groundwater region through lineaments therefore regions with a good number of lineaments have a greater infiltration rate increasing the storing capacity of groundwater the lineament density map fig 4c was created with the help of the line density technique from the spatial analyst toolset from the map it can be identified that the rocky southwestern terrain has a good number of lineaments and most of the rivers are flowing through the fracture zone in contrast 54 percent of the total area comes under the lowest lineament density group the soil texture significantly impacts infiltration capacity because it directly affects the porosity and permeability biswas and mukherjee 1994 because of this porosity and permeability fine textured soil has a lower infiltration capacity than coarse grained soil avtar et al 2010 in the study area the soil texture varies from gravelly loamy to fine very fine fig 4d the gravelly loamy texture is majorly found in the riverbank regions while maximum parts of the district are covered by fine loamy texture followed by fine texture as a result a significant portion of the study area has a lower infiltration rate from the soil texture map the occupying area for each soil texture has been calculated almost 54 percent is covered by above mentioned fine loamy and fine texture soil on the other hand about 17 percent of the area is occupied by gravelly loam to loamy group table 4 which is permeable in nature according to the influential capacity of different soil textures the class weights have been assigned an underground layer of water bearing porous rock rock fractures or unconsolidated materials viz gravel sand or silt is known as an aquifer simply aquifers are saturated bellow surface areas that provide a commercially viable amount of water for a well or spring if the water bearing porous layer is substantially thick the corresponding surface area has better groundwater security several studies shekhar and pandey 2015 sutradhar et al 2021 found that the aquifer thickness layer directly correlates with groundwater prosperity and potentiality the aquifer thickness map for bankura district has been extracted from the india wris portal and categorized into four subclasses fig 4e it has been found that 65 percent of the area of bankura district comes under the 1m 10m thickness range while about 25 percent of the area is coming under the 18m 30m and above thickness range majorly covering the eastern alluvium zone water that infiltrates from the surface travels through the unsaturated zone and crosses the water table to reach the groundwater system is referred to as recharge it is a sub process in the hydrological cycle the amount of net recharge is highly influenced by continuous and heavy precipitation in this research as we are talking about the groundwater and its potentiality the influence of rainfall can be specifically undertaken by taking into account the spatial net recharge characteristics the net recharge of any area depends on the geology because different geological formation has different infiltration capacity mondal et al 2019 in the current research we have considered rif rainfall infiltration method for net recharge mapping details in the methodology section the calculated values are further divided into four sub classes viz 60 60 70 70 80 and 110 and the map showing more than half of the whole territory of bankura district has a recharge of more than 110 mm fig 4f the slope is the measure of steepness or the degree of inclination of a feature in respect to the horizontal plane it has significant control in the infiltration of water to the water table if a region has a steep slope it slope made the run off faster after precipitation as a result the infiltration and percolation of water are unable to process therefore the slope is very important in groundwater potentiality measurement aykut 2021 rahman et al 2012 the general slope of the bankura district varies from 0 to 40 fig 4g and the western part has a higher amount of slope than the eastern half the prepared map shows five different slope groups and about 44 percent of the total study region have a slope less than 2 in contrast 14 percent area has greater than 3 5 degree slope the bankura district is the convergence zone of granite gneissic chota nagpur plateau and depositional older alluvial gangetic plain thus elevation becomes the major influencing factor of groundwater occurrence because infiltration will be more prevalent on the plains owing to sluggish surface run off or stagnation of water sutradhar et al 2021 in this present era of remote sensing and information technology the height of any point in this earth can be measured through satellite height from msl srtm digital elevation model is a widely accepted approach in determining elevation the elevation of the current concern area varies from 12 to 255 m above mean sea level msl fig 4h the prepared digital elevation model dem has been classified into five elevation groups the notable information from the dem map is that the elevation is lowest in the easternmost blocks and gradually increases towards the southwestern part of the study region lulc land use and land cover directly influences the development and storage of groundwater resources jhariya et al 2016 land use refers to how people utilize the land whereas the term cover means the physical features of the land such as forest river etc in another way lulc is a broad term that describes the categorization of mankind s activities and physical components on the landscape across time using recognized statistical and scientific techniques of analysis of relevant source databases these different lulc categories act differently in the recharge capacity and storage of groundwater like the waterbodies has a better infiltration potentiality than the built up area the present study area i e bankura district has been classified into six different classes from sentinel 2 10m resolution natural color composite fig 4i the classification was done in supervised manner each of the six broad classes has a different impact on water infiltration and percolation accordingly the weightage has been assigned table 4 depicts the areal coverage for each land use class the correctness of delineated classified lulc classes has been measured by the kappa coefficient methodology at the first step a figure of 320 training samples was identified for the six different classes then the correctness of these samples was verified by using real time sentinel image taking time google earth pro and field visit in some cases finally the confusion matrix was generated based on the information collected from field verification and google earth the further calculation for accuracy estimation has already been mentioned in the methodology section it has been found that 284 samples of total 320 samples were correctly classified table 7 the kappa coefficient value is 0 864 at 0 000 significant level that means the classified map correctly categorized 86 percent of ground reality apart from the kappa coefficient the overall user and producer accuracy were also estimated from the confusion matrix table 7 the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi is the ratio between nir reflectivity red reflectivity and nir red it is the often used index among remote sensing experts this algorithm was developed by a nasa scientist named compton tucker in the year 1977 the core idea of ndvi is based on the fact that in contrast to most non plant objects leaves reflect a lot of the near infrared light due to its backside s spongy layers however the spongy layer collapses when the plant is dry and the leaves reflect minimal nir light but the same amount is emitted in red wavelength as a result integration of these two can assist distinguish plants from non plants vegetation cover and soil water availability are closely retaliated to each other a good vegetation zone means there is a good chance for a healthy aquifer in the bankura district the ndvi value varies from 0 35 to 0 74 and the northeastern blocks like bishnupur joypur indus kotulpur patrasayer have the higher ndvi in respect of total area fig 4j in contrast 36 percent of the total area has low 0 23 ndvi the region with surface water bodies indicates good groundwater potentiality because the water bodies are considered to be a good source of groundwater recharge kumar et al 2011 these are the places where surface water flow gathered become stagnant and the water gets its time to infiltrate through the subsurface mediums zhu et al 2019 therefore to map the surface and soil water availability of the research region we retrieved the sentinel water index swi from sentinel 2 satellite image different researchers employed the ndwi normalized difference water index for the same purpose fadhillah et al 2021 however the swi index outperforms the ndwi index in terms of distinguishing urban areas silt salt and ice from water bodies its extraction accuracy is more excellent than the ndwi index and it is capable of accurately extracting water rather than pseudo water zones du et al 2016 jiang et al 2020 using the raster calculator tool the swi may be determined using the formula below s w i v n i r b a n d 5 s w i r b a n d 11 v n i r b a n d 5 s w i r b a n d 11 the calculated swi value for bankura district ranges from 0 72 to 0 74 the highest swi has been found in indus sonamukhi patrasayer and some parts of kotulpur and bishnupur blocks whereas almost 80 percent of the total study area has a low i e 0 72 0 20 swi value fig 4k 3 2 demarcation of areas having ground water potentiality in the present research our ultimate goal was to demarcate the potential groundwater areas zones and to identify the best fitted model for the semi arid bankura district this section highlights the final integration process and output maps of the demarcated potential groundwater areas after completion of the class weights calculation for each and every subclass of individual thematic layers using both methods two different groundwater potential zonation maps one using ahp and another using mif technique have been prepared the preparation of the maps was based on weightage sum overlay methodology which we have performed using the raster calculator tool in the arcgis environment the procedure for conversion of the thematic layer into raster image assignment of class weights and integration of all the reclassified after assignment of weights raster have already been discussed in the methodology section after the integration based on the natural breaking technique the output raster has been classified the natural breaking technique is one of the widely used techniques in the classification of raster das and gupta 2021 figs 5a and 6 a represented the final classified output maps generated using the natural breaking algorithm in ahp and mif model environment notability the classified maps from both the approaches i e ahp and mif are showing more or less the same kind of spatial pattern of groundwater potentiality the southwestern part covering blocks ranibandh some part of raipur khatra indpur and hirbandh has found the lowest potentiality of groundwater in both the maps at the same time there is a similarity to some extent for both maps in modeling all the western bordered blocks of the study district which is covered by primarily low potential zones with some scattered moderate groundwater potential areas for the eastern alluvium zone which is mainly occupied by older and newer fluvial deposits of the quaternary era both the modeled maps depicted high to very high groundwater prospects administratively the blocks namely kotulpur indus patrasayer joypur are found to have the highest groundwater storage in respect to the total study region however for the centrally situated areas like the total onda block the southern part of barjora sonamukhi these two models are projecting quite variation in results although both the classified maps based on natural breaking are depicting a significant difference the comparison is always acceptable when it is done through normalization of scale therefore the pixel groundwater potential values were further normalized on a scale of 0 1 and classified using the equal interval technique from the normalized map based on the ahp technique fig 5b it has been found that 3 percent and 21 percent of the whole territory of the bankura district come under the very low and low groundwater potential class in contrast 23 and 16 percent of the total study area have respectively high and very high groundwater potentiality rest has a moderate type of groundwater potentiality on the other hand in the case of the mif technique based normalized model fig 6b about 6 and 21 percent of the total bankura district have very low and low groundwater potentiality whereas 27 and 14 percentage areas are occupied by high and very high potential groundwater zone at the same time almost 32 percent of the total area has the moderate potentiality of having storage of groundwater 3 3 validation of ahp and mif based groundwater potential zonation when a researcher tried to model something by analyzing different correlational and influencing factors validation becomes the most crucial part of his her study because we all know a model must be a miniature of ground reality therefore without proper validation the model has no importance the roc curve is basically used in the estimation of the accuracy of any binary classification model in the present validation process our two binary dependent variables are agreed incident 1 or disagree non incident 0 which is the result of the accurate explaining ability of the predicted results if predicted results are able to explain the actual value then the dependent variable will be 1 in respect to the actual real value independent variable for the roc curve calculation in both the cases i e ahp and mif the considered classifier value was 0 5 two roc curves one for normalized ahp based output map and another for normalized mif based groundwater potential zonation map have been represented in fig 7 and the agreement and disagreement statistics are depicted in table 8 in the case of ahp fig 7a the calculated auc area under curve is 0 767 and it is a reasonably good value in accuracy estimation in other words the ahp based groundwater potential zonation model can explain 76 7 percent of the actual situation contrary to this in the case of roc graph fig 7b the calculated auc value is 0 879 this means 87 9 percent of the actual groundwater situation is depicted in the mif based groundwater potential zonation model in the mathematical sense the auc values from 0 6 to 0 75 are considered inferior thus the auc value is relatively poor in the ahp based model thus mif model is far better in efficiently and accurately explaining the actual reality for groundwater potentiality of bankura district 4 conclusion india is a country where unregulated demand from a large number of populations has created huge pressure on precious and scarce resources like groundwater in order to maintain the livelihood of this huge population it is high time to do proper planning for sustainable groundwater usage before the advent of rs and gis there was a scarce of handy easily available and appropriate techniques for assessing the scarcity and potentiality of groundwater in any region however with the introduction of remote sensing and gis technology locating groundwater occurrences and its prospect area delineation has become a quick and cost effective operation through geoinformatics the integration of different spatial information of groundwater regulating factors like geology topography human interference etc can give a marvelous map depicting the groundwater scarce and prospects areas the present study is an example of efficient usage of remote sensing and gis environment coupled with proper validation process for sound findings in potential groundwater area identification of bankura district the identification or demarcation of groundwater potential zones revealed that the southwestern part of the study area has more scarcity compared to other places in comparison the northeastern part is highly enriched with groundwater broadly the whole western part and some of the central segments of the bankura district have the low potentiality of groundwater mainly because of the geological structure soil texture and topography however it can be stated that this region will suffer a severe groundwater crisis in the near future at the same time the northeastern and eastern alluvium zone is also vulnerable to groundwater shortage it is mainly because of the excessive exploitation of groundwater for irrigation in the agricultural field despite having good potentiality this will drastically lower the water level in this area thus to maintain the agricultural yield and sustainable groundwater development simultaneously the alternatives of borewell irrigation need to be encouraged however we can conclude that suitable planning for usage is required for the total study region the study also made an attempt to identify the best representative weightage based model for the bankura district among the two well established decision making approaches i e ahp and mif although both the normalized output maps depict the more or less same pattern of groundwater potentiality for bankura district from the validation process it is noticed that the mif based model has greater accuracy compared to the ahp model the auc estimation of the roc curve shows mif has the capability to explain 87 9 percent of the real groundwater situation of bankura district in contrast ahp has a relatively poor auc value 0 767 this means the mif model is best fitted and it is recommended for accurately demarcating the potential groundwater zones of bankura district availability of data and material the sources of all
