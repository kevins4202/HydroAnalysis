24015,objectively determining the level of ecosystem model complexity necessary to achieve meaningful representations of biogeochemical cycles at different spatial and temporal scales is an outstanding issue in marine ecosystem modeling as part of the development of a three dimensional 3d regional ocean modelling system roms application for the northwest north atlantic ocean we compare model results from three alternative ecosystem model versions in which ecological complexity was increased in a step wise fashion in order to ensure an objective comparison the models were optimized to replicate observations of satellite surface chlorophyll and in situ chlorophyll and nitrate profiles to overcome the high computational cost of optimizing 3d models we use a surrogate based optimization method that is an ensemble of one dimensional 1d models is used as a proxy of the ecosystem model behavior in the 3d setting the 1d models were configured at locations where in situ profiles are available a total of 17 optimization experiments aim to evaluate different aspects of the comparison between the ecosystem models we show that for all ecosystem model versions the optimized model performance degrades when the optimization includes all observed variables at all locations instead of individual locations only moreover the choice of parameters to be optimized can significantly affect the behavior of the optimized models and is most noticeable when multiple phytoplankton and zooplankton groups are included additionally evaluation of spatial patterns in optimal parameter values at individual locations allows us to assess geographical model portability in general an optimized complex model can achieve lower model data misfits against assimilated data than simple models but is also more prone to generating unintended trophic relations the more complex model also had decreased performance when applied to locations different than those used for calibration i e portability experiments which is discussed in the context of the design of the cost function and selection of parameters to optimize keywords plankton ocean model model complexity optimization north atlantic 1 introduction since the emergence of numerical marine ecology models have diversified from describing simple prey predator relationships e g riley 1965 to representing multiple plankton functional groups and chemical variables with dependencies on the characteristics of the physical environment e g dutkiewicz et al 2015 kishi et al 2007 there is an ongoing discussion about the most appropriate level of ecosystem complexity model structure and parameterizations of functional relationships both simple and complex models have advantages and disadvantages for instance the use of simple models under idealized conditions has proven to be valuable in identifying and understanding underlying mechanisms of the marine ecosystem functioning e g evans and parslow 1985 fasham et al 1990 kuhn et al 2015 however it is frequently argued that more realistic representations of the plankton community composition and the interrelationships of marine food webs are required to improve forecasting capabilities in regional and global models e g le quéré et al 2005 regardless of their complexity marine biogeochemical models depend on many parameters that describe biological and chemical rates of change such as growth mortality and degradation rates including maximum rates and half saturation concentrations in nutrient uptake and predation formulations as models are developed for specific regions or periods their parameters are typically calibrated to fit observations for those specific conditions this may lead to overfitting a loss of model forecasting skill and of portability to different geographic locations see friedrichs et al 2007 in general the number of parameters increases with the number of state variables in a model denman 2003 thus complex models are at a higher risk of overfitting moreover most of these parameters are poorly known and wide value ranges are reported in the literature studies using systematic calibration methods known as parameter optimization have shown that typically available observational sets are often not sufficient to determine more than a few of these parameters fennel et al 2001 friedrichs et al 2007 ward et al 2010 kwon and primeau 2006 parameter values may also change depending on the plankton community composition and thus it is possible that models need to consider parameter variations with geography losa et al 2004 or time mattern et al 2012 following the principle of parsimony the simplest model able to fit the observations should be favored over more complex ones failure of a model to replicate observations suggests that the model structure may be missing key components of the system s behavior conversely the ability of a model to replicate a given set of observations does not unequivocally mean that all processes are properly represented when models differ not only in their level of ecological complexity but also in the degree to which they were calibrated and in the model pathways that were affected during calibration it is tenuous to argue that differences in model performance are due to structural complexity friedrichs et al 2007 kriest et al 2010 to better discern the effects of increased ecosystem complexity from differences in a model s response due to its parameter values it is necessary to calibrate the model versions to comparable levels of performance and through comparable pathways of mass flux e g xiao and friedrichs 2014a galbraith et al 2015 kriest 2017 during the 90s the calibration of marine ecosystem models to a specific study region was predominantly subjective arhonditsis and brett 2004 this approach is inefficient increases the risk of overlooking structural inadequacies in the models and is complicated by the number of parameters in play and their co dependencies in recent decades this problem has been increasingly addressed with the use of parameter optimization techniques fennel et al 2001 kwon and primeau 2006 2008 friedrichs et al 2007 bagniewski et al 2011 schartau et al 2017 kriest et al 2017 parameter optimization provides a more objective framework for comparing models with different degrees of trophic complexity but optimization experiments require a large number of model runs and thus their direct application to computationally expensive 3d models is difficult an alternative which we choose here is to perform the optimization using a simplified faster model that replicates the results of the computationally more expensive 3d model the computationally efficient model is referred to as a model surrogate or emulator the surrogate can be a statistical model a coarser resolution model or a reduced order model that allows one to perform a large number of simulations required for parameter sensitivity analyses and model calibration different techniques for the construction of statistical emulators of 3d biogeochemical models have been tested in recent years hooten et al 2011 leeds et al 2012 mattern et al 2012 other tested approaches include reduced temporal resolution prießet al 2013a b and reduced physical dimensionality hemmings and challenor 2012 hemmings et al 2015 our methodology resembles the latter reduced dimensionality studies in that our model surrogate is a mechanistic emulator constructed with an ensemble of 1d models located at points where in situ chlorophyll a and nitrate profiles are available the surrogate 1d models and the target model 3d model share the same ecosystem model therefore in comparison with statistical and reduced process resolution surrogates the reduced dimensionality approach provides insight into the ecosystem responses most affected by the physical dynamics features that are well replicated in 1d are likely controlled by the ecosystem model itself structure equations and parameter values whereas biases between 1d and 3d are a consequence of the simplified physical framework in this manuscript we focus on the methodology used to bring models with different ecological structures to a comparable level of calibration by analyzing results from several optimization experiments our study region is the northwest north atlantic continental shelf which involves areas with contrasting oceanographic conditions our overarching goal is to better understand the variability of phytoplankton and primary production in the region while addressing the unresolved question of how much ecological complexity is needed to represent it we specifically aim to answer 1 does the ecosystem model structure and or its dependency on temperature affect the surrogate based optimization performance and 2 how does the number of observed variables compared the number of parameters optimized and the location the model is optimized for affect each model optimization aside from gaining insight about the answers to these questions we demonstrate that the surrogate approach is effective as a calibration tool despite its simplicity an in depth comparison of chlorophyll and primary production patterns obtained by the 3d ocean model after the optimization will be explored in a subsequent study 2 study area our model domain covers the continental shelf and adjacent open ocean waters of the northwest north atlantic ocean including the newfoundland shelf the grand banks the gulf of st lawrence the scotian shelf and the gulf of maine fig 1 the region is at the confluence of the two major north atlantic current systems the equatorward flowing labrador current and the northeast flowing gulf stream and is influenced by their adjoining shelf and slope water currents loder et al 1998 this leads to complicated dynamics including both cold and warm sub regions originating from the north atlantic subpolar and subtropical gyres townsend et al 2004 3 model descriptions 3 1 physical configuration we use the 3d physical framework of the regional ocean modeling system roms version 3 5 http myroms org haidvogel et al 2008 the model is nested within the regional ocean ice model of the northwest north atlantic of urrego blanco and sheng 2012 the physical model implementation and detailed sensitivity analyses and validation of the simulated physical variables of this model are described in brennan et al 2016 the physical model has also been shown to realistically reproduce the distinct pathways of water mass movements in the domain rutherford and fennel 2018 similar to the biogeochemical application by bianucci et al 2015 ocean temperature and salinity are weakly nudged time scale of 140 days to climatological fields from geshelin et al 1999 3 2 ecosystem models we compare three nitrogen based ecosystem model versions which are shown schematically in fig 2 and referred to as m1 m2 and m3 in increasing order of complexity m1 has previously been used in the mid atlantic bight a region south of our model domain fennel et al 2006 m3 is based on the north pacific ecosystem model for understanding regional oceanography nemuro structure kishi et al 2007 this model was chosen because an optimized version of nemuro has been shown to outperform simple models in the california current area mattern et al 2017 m2 represents an intermediate step between m1 and m3 m1 and m2 have 7 compartments tracking nitrate ammonium phytoplankton chlorophyll zooplankton and two detritus size classes in m1 only phytoplankton growth depends on temperature eppley 1972 in m2 we introduced temperature dependency in other biological rates i e phytoplankton mortality zooplankton grazing excretion and mortality in m3 we further increased ecological complexity by adding plankton functional groups m3 has 11 compartments that include 2 nutrient and 2 detritus pools similar to m1 and m2 2 phytoplankton groups representing small and large phytoplankton and 3 zooplankton groups small large and predatory zooplankton while the trophic structure of m3 i e the interactions among planktonic groups is based on nemuro it utilizes the same functional forms as our m1 and m2 model versions e g holling iii grazing as in fennel et al 2006 instead of the ivlev equation used in nemuro for sake of better comparability in summary the three model versions we compare introduce additional ecological complexity in a step wise fashion in this way we aim to tease apart the effects of increasing the dependency of the system on environmental factors such as temperature and increasing the trophic complexity itself the equations for the three model versions are included in appendix i boundary and initial conditions for no3 are based on a monthly climatology constructed using in situ observations see section 4 1 and world ocean atlas monthly averages garcia et al 2010 initial and boundary conditions for all other biological variables are set to 0 1 mmol n m 3 as in fennel et al 2006 2008 these variables adjust on short time scales days hence the system has no memory of the initial values after a short spin up phase a phytoplankton to chlorophyll ratio of 0 76 mmol n mg chl 1 is assumed for the chlorophyll initial and boundary conditions bianucci et al 2015 3 3 surrogate model we apply a simple 1d framework to the 22 locations presented on fig 1 which are referred to as the 1d models from now on in general the 1d models solve a vertical diffusion term k d 2 c z 2 using the crank nicolson scheme where k d is the diffusivity z is depth and c refers to the biological state variables the vertical resolution is 5 m and the vertical grid is divided into two distinct layers with respect to mixing a turbulent surface mixed layer layer 1 and a quiescent layer below layer 2 the interface between both layers is determined by the time varying mixed layer depth which is estimated using a criterion for the maximum density gradient for this purpose the density field is obtained from a base run of the 3d model in 1d a high diffusivity is assigned to all grid cells above the prescribed mixed layer depth ensuring complete mixing within the mixed layer on a time scale of 1 day with a minimum diffusivity of 100 m2 d 1 imposed k d 1 max mld 2 d 1 100 1 2 1 0 3 m2 s 1 a lower diffusivity k d 2 k d 1 10 2 is assigned to all grid cells below the mixed layer depth this 1d framework has been previously used lagman et al 2014 kuhn et al 2015 the 1d models also require shortwave radiation and temperature as inputs the shortwave radiation is the same as in the 3d model and comes from the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf global atmospheric reanalysis era interim dee et al 2011 temperature is taken from the 3d model base simulation as 1d models do not include horizontal advection no3 below the mixed layer depth is nudged to the 3d results from the 3d base simulation with a nudging time scale of 60 days this nudging scheme avoids direct impacts on the photic surface layers where it is assumed that biological activity has the strongest effect on nitrate since we focus on temporal changes in concentrations within the upper mixed layer we disregard the possible but presumably small effects of a few parameters on reshaping the vertical distribution of nitrate in the photic surface layers therefore there is no conflict between the nudging treatment and the optimization i e deep nitrate does not change with changes in the parameter values on the timescales considered here total depth in the 1d models is equal to the depth in the 3d model or truncated at 50 m below their maximum mixed layer depth whichever is shallower this treatment further reduces the surrogate computational time without affecting its performance conditions for year 1999 are repeated at the beginning of the 1d model run as a model spin up acronyms geographical coordinates depths mean temperature chlorophyll a and nitrate values for each location are presented in table 1 despite its simplicity the mechanistic emulator replicates the results of the full 3d model well for all three biogeochemical models in fig 3 we use 2d histograms to compare 5 day averages of surface chlorophyll simulated by the 3d roms and the 1d models configured with the initial parameter guess the target model roms and surrogate surface chlorophyll results are significantly correlated p 0 01 with correlation coefficients of 0 77 0 84 and 0 60 for m1 m2 and m3 respectively nevertheless the surrogate of m3 is challenged to replicate low chlorophyll values and tends to overestimate them differences in chlorophyll 1d minus 3d before the optimization are shown for two locations bon 49 21 n 51 48 w location 4 and hal 43 46 n 62 43 w location 11 in fig 4 all model versions exhibit discrepancies at the beginning and end of the mixed layer shoaling period biases in the position of the deep chlorophyll maximum occur during summer stratification with the 1d models predicting a shallower position than the 3d model 4 optimization procedure and sensitivity analysis the optimization is implemented using an evolutionary algorithm and applied for 3 years january 1999 december 2001 the evolutionary algorithm simulates a process of natural selection by imposing a survival of the fittest strategy houck et al 1995 on a population composed of different parameter sets which represent individuals within the population evolution takes place through random recombinations and mutations of the parameter sets a priori estimates of the minimum and maximum values have to be specified for each parameter to avoid obtaining unrealistic values table 2 details of the evolutionary algorithm used here are described in kuhn et al 2015 we optimized subsets of the complete parameter sets required by each model version table 3 which were selected based on the sensitivity analysis described in section 4 2 4 1 observational datasets for calibration satellite and in situ observations were used to calibrate the models surface chlorophyll satellite observations come from the sea viewing wide field of view sensor seawifs 8 day averages with 9 km resolution in situ observations were obtained from the atlantic zone monitoring program azmp http www meds sdmm dfo mpo gc ca isdm gdsi azmp pmza index eng html which performs biannual monitoring along the 13 transect lines shown in fig 1 the azmp dataset includes quality controlled ctd measurements of temperature and salinity mitchell et al 2002 from which density was calculated using the gibbs seawater teos 10 oceanographic toolbox bottle measurements used in this study include in situ chlorophyll a and nitrate as these are variables with direct counterparts in the model the standardized chlorophyll a analysis method is turner fluorometry and the nitrate analysis is colorimetric on a technicon autoanalyzer ii aa ii segmented flow analyzer mitchell et al 2002 satellite observations were first validated against the in situ chlorophyll a observations from the top 3 m by identifying all matching records between 1997 and 2010 i e the duration of the seawifs record this matchup analysis was implemented by first searching all in situ observations available within every 8 day window of the satellite record then matching satellite records were averaged within a 0 1 degree radius of their corresponding in situ measurement using vertical averages over the top 3 meters increased the number of match ups and did not significantly affect the regression compared to using only the top 1 meter table i supplement i additionally the same matchup analysis was performed using globcolour http hermes acri fr a combined modis and seawifs product and non standard azmp measurements of in situ hplc high performance liquid chromatography chlorophyll a the results of these analyses reveal the same patterns of satellite performance as the seawifs vs standard measurements supplement i the comparison shows systematic biases at certain locations with the most pronounced bias at locations inside the gulf of st lawrence bias correction is an essential step when merging in situ and satellite data sets e g smith et al 2008 therefore based on the relationship between in situ chlorophyll and satellite chlorophyll see supplement i we defined the bias between satellite chlorophyll and in situ chlorophyll at locations inside the gulf of st lawrence as a function of satellite chlorophyll concentration fig 5a to correct this bias satellite time series inside the gulf of st lawrence were debiased by subtracting e g o s l 0 01 0 19 x 1 42 where x is the log transform seawifs satellite observation and e g o s l is the bias fig 5a in order to provide observed counterparts to both small and large phytoplankton groups in m3 we estimated the chlorophyll a fractions from small and large phytoplankton in the satellite observations using the empirical relationships of hirata et al 2011 this study provides a set of equations and coefficients to estimate the chlorophyll concentration of various phytoplankton size classes and functional groups based on a global classification of hplc pigment data into phytoplankton size classes here we specifically used their equation to estimate the fraction of chlorophyll corresponding to microphytoplankton ψ 1 ψ ψ 0 exp ψ 1 x ψ 2 1 where x is the log transform seawifs satellite observation and the coefficient values are ψ 0 0 9117 ψ 1 0 27330 and ψ 2 0 4003 we regard this fraction of chlorophyll as an observational counterpart of our large phytoplankton chlorophyll component the remaining fraction nano and picophytoplankton is considered the counterpart of small phytoplankton chlorophyll fig 5b since hirata et al s 2011 relationship was designed with seawifs observations we cannot apply the same formula to in situ measurements with any confidence 4 2 sensitivity analysis in order to identify the most sensitive parameters and reduce the parameter space to be searched during optimization the 1d models were rerun after perturbing each parameter one at a time a reduced parameter space is desirable because parameters that are insensitive to the observations used in the optimization cannot be estimated the sensitivity of the models to each of their parameter values is estimated as 2 q y p i 1 m j 1 n y t e s t y b a s e y b a s e which is the sum of the normalized absolute differences in the model state variables y between the results of a base simulation y b a s e and a test simulation y t e s t where n is the total number of values compared q is calculated by varying each parameter p in m 5 different tests the tests change each of the base simulation parameter values presented in table 2 to the minimum 25 50 75 and maximum values of their corresponding ranges also shown in table 2 these minimum and maximum parameter values are based on the literature and also imposed in the optimization algorithm as bounds to avoid unrealistic values kuhn et al 2015 ward et al 2010 this sensitivity analysis is thus independent from the observations we consider this is important because the observations do not provide vertical structure information with sufficient frequency most in situ profiles are around the spring bloom missing important aspects of the variability that could affect the parameter sensitivity results this sensitivity analysis also provides information about the model sensitivity across all variables which is valuable for comparison against other studies nevertheless the ranking of parameters used for selecting the parameters to be optimized considers only the variables that have an observational counterpart i e only chlorophyll and nitrate results of this sensitivity analysis are shown in fig 6 each stacked bar shows the contribution of all model variables to the total sensitivity in order to select the parameters most sensitive to the available observations the parameters were ranked with respect to the chlorophyll and nitrate contributions to q in models m1 and m2 equivalent parameters have similar rankings the 3 most sensitive parameters are the maximum phytoplankton growth μ 0 the mortality m p m p 0 and the coagulation rate τ the initial slope of the p i curve of photosynthesis α and grazing rate g m a x g0 have different ranks in m1 and m2 but are among the six most sensitive parameters in addition to being important for the estimation of chlorophyll this subset of parameters also has a significant effect on zooplankton and detritus m1 and m2 are also sensitive to the zooplankton base metabolic rate l b m l b m 0 and the remineralization of small detritus r s d however these parameters dominantly affect zooplankton and detritus which are not part of the observation data used in the optimization in m3 parameters related to small phytoplankton are more sensitive than those related to large phytoplankton e g the most sensitive parameter is the reference maximum growth rate of small phytoplankton μ 0 p s there are some similarities in parameter ranking with the rankings of m1 and m2 e g the small phytoplankton mortality rate μ 0 p s the grazing rate of small zooplankton on small phytoplankton g 0 z s p s and the coagulation rate τ are among the most sensitive the most sensitive parameters of m3 are similar to those reported for nemuro yoshie et al 2007 in general the most sensitive parameters appear similar among biogeochemical models in a parameter sensitivity analysis of 12 different biogeochemical models friedrichs et al 2007 that the maximum phytoplankton growth rate and the remineralization rate frequently appear among the most sensitive parameters the parameter rankings in fig 6 guide the selection of parameters to be optimized as detailed in the next section and in table 3 4 3 optimization experiments we performed five optimization experiments e1 to e5 for all three models and two additional experiments only for m3 e4b and e5b each optimization experiment e utilizes a different cost function j e depending on its objective the different objectives of the experiments consider the number of variables included in the optimization the number of locations evaluated and the number of parameters optimized table 3 we define r v as the weighted root mean square difference between the simulated y ˆ and observed y values 3 r v w v 2 n n 1 n y ˆ l n y l n 2 where the subscript v stands for the three observational data types in this study satellite chlorophyll r c h l 1 in situ chlorophyll r c h l 2 and in situ nitrate r n o 3 n is the number of observed values and the weight w v ϕ v σ v of each variable at each location is inversly proportional to the standard deviation of its observations evans 2003 a high weight was assigned to satellite chlorophyll by setting the weight coefficients ϕ v 3 for satellite chlorophyll and ϕ v 1 for the other two data types the higher weight of satellite chlorophyll was determined during preliminary tests and was necessary due to the pronounced seasonal cycle in the region resulting in a large standard deviation in surface chlorophyll values if no additional weight was used satellite chlorophyll became downweighted with respect to in situ chlorophyll profiles the profiles could not fully capture chlorophyll temporal variability due to their significantly lower frequency in the case of m3 r c h l 1 was modified to compare both the small and large phytoplankton chlorophyll fractions against corresponding satellite derived fractions estimated using the hirata et al 2011 algorithm see section 4 1 experiments e1 and e2 are joint optimizations that assimilate chlorophyll data from all locations shown by the orange dots in fig 1 these experiments use cost functions j 1 and j 2 respectively 4 j 1 p 1 l l 1 l 1 ω l r c h l 1 5 j 2 p 1 l l 1 l 1 ω l r c h l 1 r c h l 2 where p refers to parameter vector and l 22 is the total number of 1d model locations l the location weighting factor ω l 1 l v 1 v y v 2 σ v 2 uses the mean y and standard deviation σ of the observed variables v to avoid biasing the cost towards locations with lower variability schartau and oschlies 2003a friedrichs et al 2007 experiment e3 eq 7 corresponds to single site optimizations i e the optimization algorithm runs independently for each 1d model location note that the location specific weight is not needed in this cost function 6 j 3 p l r c h l 1 r c h l 2 r n o 3 the results of e3 were used to assess spatial patterns in the optimized parameters in a principal component analysis this analysis assesses the similarities between parameter sets optimized for different locations and identifies the parameters that are mainly driving such similarities we also compared the portability see friedrichs et al 2007 of our three model versions by optimizing the model at one single location and then transferring these optimal parameters to the other stations experiment e4 is a joint optimization where all 22 locations are included 7 j 4 p 1 l l 1 l 1 ω l r c h l 1 r c h l 2 r n o 3 comparison between the results of e3 and e4 allows us to evaluate the compromise required when fitting all observed variables at all locations using one common set of parameters section 5 2 comparing results of e1 e2 and e4 aims to evaluate differences between single data type and multiple data types optimizations all experiments from e1 to e4 aimed to optimize the 6 most sensitive parameters in m1 or their equivalents in m2 and m3 in the case of m1 and m2 the 6 most sensitive parameters are either the same or equivalent fig 6 in the case of m3 equivalent parameters may be one or more for example the m3 equivalents of the phytoplankton reference growth rate μ 0 used in the single phytoplankton models m1 and m2 are both the small and large phytoplankton reference growth rates μ 0ps and μ 0pl due to lack of observational constraints for zooplankton only the most sensitive of the grazing rates is optimized g 0 z s p s keeping the ratio to the other six grazing rates constant notice that there are only three different estimates of the maximum grazing parameters that are assigned to seven parameters therefore in essence only three parameters to specify the grazing rates on m3 experiments e4b e5 and e5b also use the cost function j 4 they evaluate optimizations for all compared variables at all compared locations modifying only the number and selection of parameters table 3 in experiment e5 we optimized only the top 3 most sensitive parameters of m1 and m2 or their equivalents in m3 thus the comparison between e4 and e5 evaluates how the number of optimized parameters affects the results section 5 3 in preliminary tests optimizing more than 6 parameters in m1 or m2 did not result in significant improvements by optimizing equivalent parameters we aim to ensure an objective comparison between models for instance it has been theorized and shown that different models can produce similar fits to observations despite portraying different dynamics friedrichs et al 2007 quine 1975 however due to this parameter selection procedure the number of optimized parameters in experiments e1 to e5 is higher for m3 than for m1 and m2 it could be argued that a better performance of m3 may be a consequence of more degrees of freedom in order to address this issue the additional experiments e4b and e5b which were performed only for m3 replicate experiments e4 and e5 but using the same number of optimized parameters as for m1 and m2 i e the 6 and 3 most sensitive parameters respectively in all cases parameters not included in the optimization subsets are kept fixed at their initial guess value table 2 as the cost function is different for each experiment and thus non comparable we use j 4 as the function to evaluate differences between optimized models f p j 4 this function compares all observational data types and all locations 5 results we compare the results of the optimization experiments described in table 3 using the cost function j 4 p eq 7 of each model version in 1d fig 7 3d simulations were performed only with parameters obtained in experiment e4 and their corresponding costs are also shown additionally the optimized set of parameters obtained for e4 is presented in table 4 as a reference overall model m3 presents lower costs than m1 and m2 in experiments e1 to e4 as well as in experiment e5b however in experiments e5 and e4b model m3 presents large model data differences with respect to satellite chlorophyll we describe and discuss these results in more detail in the following sections 5 1 single vs multiple observed variables comparison of experiments e1 e2 and e4 illustrates the effects of optimizing the models against satellite chlorophyll alone e1 versus including information about the vertical structure of chlorophyll e2 and nitrate e4 the inclusion of in situ chlorophyll profiles in the optimization e2 eq 6 degrades the performance of m1 with respect to satellite chlorophyll but has no significant effect on the performance of m2 and m3 the inclusion of both chlorophyll and nitrate profiles e4 results in lower model costs with respect to nitrate but higher costs with respect to both satellite and in situ chlorophyll fig 8a shows the optimized results of e4 in comparison to surface chlorophyll in situ surface chlorophyll exhibits large ranges between october and january whereas satellite chlorophyll appears less variable with relative constant low values these months have the largest number of gaps in the satellite records fig 8b 5 2 single vs multiple locations in experiment e3 optimized parameters were found for each location individually using eq 7 allowing different optimal parameters for the different locations makes it easier to fit the individual patterns of variability and thus a lower total cost is achieved the results of experiment e3 are used to analyze whether spatial patterns in the biological parameters emerge section 5 2 1 and to evaluate model portability from one location to another section 5 2 2 5 2 1 spatial patterns in parameters the analysis of the parameters optimized for individual locations may reveal spatial patterns with dominance of specific plankton groups in different areas a principal component analysis was performed on the optimal parameter sets obtained for each model version fig 9 in all model versions the variability among locations is dominated by differences in the zooplankton grazing rates pc1 and phytoplankton growth rates pc2 clearly defined clusters of locations are not identified by the analysis however some locations consistently arrange themselves along pc2 in all model versions that is some locations are consistently characterized by either high or low grazing rates spatial patterns in the grazing rates are however difficult to discern 5 2 2 model portability model portability experiments were performed in the 1d environment by iteratively applying the optimized parameters from one location optimized model to the rest of them test models results are summarized in fig 10 where the cost of the test models is normalized by the corresponding optimized model cost m2 has the largest percentage of test models with cost equal to or lower than the optimized model m1 23 3 m2 32 9 m3 17 4 the highest percentage of tests with cost larger than the optimized run occur in m3 m1 76 7 m2 67 1 m3 82 6 however m1 presented the highest percentage of tests with cost larger than twice the optimized run m1 32 3 m2 25 5 m3 26 7 according to these results m2 can be considered the most portable of the three model versions whereas m3 appears as the least portable in particular for m3 it appears that model solutions optimized at open ocean sites perform poorly when transferred to shallower shelf areas oppositely when parameters are optimized at the shallow shelf areas and then transferred to the deeper open ocean sites the models do not perform as bad behavior is more symmetric for m2 fig 11 shows an example of the portability experiments for two locations with contrasting oceanographic conditions location 4 bon 49 21 n 51 48 w in the labrador sea and location 11 hal 43 46 n 62 43 w in the scotian shelf the satellite observations at the bon location have a distinct spring bloom peak which is well replicated by m2 using either parameters optimized for this location fig 11a or for the hal location fig 11c however m3 can only replicate the annual peak when using the locally optimized set of parameters the magnitude of the spring bloom at the hal location is lower than at bon the peak occurs earlier in the year and other peaks of equal magnitude can occur at different times of the year due to this more irregular variability both models are challenged to replicate the hal location even when using locally optimized parameters when locally optimized both models appear calibrated to appropriately capturing the timing of maximum surface chlorophyll concentrations such that large discrepancies with observations occur when the fall bloom is larger than the spring bloom as in 1999 locally optimized m2 favors maximum concentrations and produces lower than observed summer to fall concentrations in contrast m3 favors average concentrations better capturing summer to fall concentrations but underestimating the spring bloom maxima the hal test run of m2 maintains the spring bloom peak timing but overall increases concentrations with emphasis on the fall m3 generates a well defined spring bloom of shorter duration 5 3 number of optimized parameters experiments e4 e5 e4b and e5b aim to evaluate the effect of increasing or decreasing the number of optimized parameters on the optimization success the cost metric results fig 7 show that optimizing 3 versus 6 parameters does not significantly affect the cost function value of m1 and m2 this is consistent with the results from the parameter sensitivity analysis where the top 3 most sensitive parameters in m1 and m2 present a dominant effect on the model results in comparison with the rest of parameters fig 6a b in contrast m3 was more evenly sensitive to all parameters fig 6c and thus the number and choice of parameters to include in the optimization significantly affects the model results for example in experiment e4 a total of 10 parameters were optimized for m3 those included sensitive parameters for all of the phytoplankton and zooplankton groups while the subset of 6 parameters optimized in e4b only included one of the large phytoplankton parameters α pl the optimization results of e4b successfully replicate the average small phytoplankton background concentrations however they fail to replicate the blooming of the large phytoplankton group during which the biomass of large phytoplankton exceeds temporarily that of small phytoplankton fig 12 calibrating the initial slope of the p i curve of photosynthesis of large phytoplankton was insufficient to obtain a realistically high proliferation of large phytoplankton in spring this illustrates that in addition to an appropriate response to light differentiation between the responses to nutrient availability is fundamental in multi species models e g gleaners vs opportunists the cost of m3 in experiments e5 5 optimized parameters and e5b 3 optimized parameters is within the range of those for m1 and m2 but the parameters obtained by these experiments generate unintended trophic dynamics where some functional groups become extinct in the model the diagrams in fig 12b summarize these emergent structures in e4b predatory zooplankton z p disappear due to a combination of low prey biomass and low grazing rates as large phytoplankton was not properly replicated large zooplankton growth became inhibited by low prey densities and both low large phytoplankton and low large zooplankton biomass affected predatory zooplankton in e5 grazing rates were not part of the optimized parameters and did not scale with increasing phytoplankton growth rates this resulted in the functional extinction of small zooplankton while the optimization attempted to match zooplankton losses by increasing mortalities and coagulation rates the negligible biomass of small zooplankton cascaded to the total extinction of large and predatory zooplankton in experiment e5b m3 essentially becomes a p z model similar to m1 and m2 due to the extinction of large and predatory zooplankton and the low concentrations of large phytoplankton 5 4 fluxes the choice of parameters of m3 in experiments e1 to e5 was intended to optimize comparable fluxes among all model versions nonetheless differences in the resulting gross fluxes between variables are present between the 7 variable models and the 11 variable model fig 13 shows vertically integrated zooplankton grazing phytoplankton growth new and regenerated production mortality and coagulation fluxes obtained for the models using parameters from e4 differences in the new production fluxes are negligible between m1 and m2 but m1 presents a slightly higher annual peak in the regenerated production and grazing the effect of temperature dependency on the phytoplankton mortality rates is noticeable during fall and winter where m2 has lower rates than m1 in contrast to m1 and m2 m3 has more defined peaks in new production and more extended periods with high regenerated production grazing by small zooplankton is lowest in m3 peaks in grazing by large and predatory zooplankton exceed the grazing rates in m1 and m2 by approximately 2 mmol m 2 d 1 on average mortality of large phytoplankton is twice the phytoplankton mortality flux in m1 and m2 during spring and summer but the same as m2 during winter the coagulation flux of large phytoplankton is negligible 6 discussion 6 1 surrogates and surrogate based optimization simplified models allow us to avoid the computational expense of 3d models when performing sensitivity tests and calibrations here a simplified 1d physical framework was shown to replicate key aspects of the results of a 3d regional application at selected locations using three different ecosystem model versions figs 3 4 after optimization the model data misfit was reduced in both 1d and performed similarly well in 3d applications supplement ii fig 7 similar types of site based or test bed calibrations of marine ecosystem models using 1d models have previously been shown to improve the predictive skill of 3d models kane et al 2011 mcdonald et al 2012 oschlies and schartau 2005 in many cases the 1d models are built to represent averaged conditions at a climatological scale or over a relatively large spatial area dadou et al 2004 losa et al 2004 matear 1995 schartau and oschlies 2003b this is intended to reduce the effects of phase biases that result from noise in both the observations and models and of the inability of models to replicate as much variability as is displayed in the observations hemmings et al 2015 leeds et al 2012 schartau and oschlies 2003a we did not use climatological or spatial averaging that is surrogate target and model data comparisons were done on a site by site and date by date basis although this can be considered more challenging the surrogates were able to capture between 36 and 70 of the variance in surface chlorophyll estimates of the 3d model sample fig 3 the surrogate based optimization was successful in improving the performance of the three ecosystem model versions supplement ii fig 7 however there are some systematic differences between 1d and 3d models in terms of the position of the deep chlorophyll maxima in summer overall the deep chlorophyll maxima are shallower in the 1d models than in the 3d model fig 4 probably a consequence of our simplified two layer vertical structure of turbulence in 1d similar discrepancies in the position and extend of the deep chlorophyll maximum have been previously noted in 1d models doney et al 1996 fasham et al 1993 including 1d calibration studies schartau and oschlies 2003b in the latter the vertical diffusivities in the 1d model were directly taken from the target model this suggests that biases in the deep chlorophyll maxima may be inherent to 1d models and are not entirely due to the specific oversimplification of the diffusive component applied here the mechanistic surrogate approach also allowed us to identify features in the variables of interest that are likely dominated by the biological module from those controlled by the physics in our case the timing of the peak of the spring bloom was overall well captured by the 1d models figs 8 11 this indicates that this phytoplankton phenological characteristic is well constrained by the observations used during the optimization and sensitive to the choice of parameters optimized 6 2 deciding on a complexity level a number of previous attempts to assess the most appropriate level of ecosystem complexity in models have been inconclusive e g matear 1995 dadou et al 2004 while others argue that there is a humpback relationship between model complexity and performance with intermediate complexity models presenting advantages over both simple and more complex models fulton et al 2003 raick et al 2006 xiao and friedrichs 2014a when models do not have comparable equations and are not optimized differences in their performance are likely related to the parameter selection and functional equations rather than the model structure itself e g sailley et al 2013 in a model assessment study by kriest et al 2010 it was demonstrated that increasing complexity of unoptimized models does not necessarily improve model performance another recent model skill assessment by kwiatkowski et al 2014 found no evidence that biological complexity could consistently improve all aspects of model performance in reproducing observed global scale bulk properties of ocean biogeochemistry the simple models performed better in terms of global spatial pattern correlations of pco2 dissolved inorganic carbon and alkalinity but complex models better captured the monthly and annual variance of dic and correlation coefficients of chlorophyll and primary production kwiatkowski et al 2014 insufficient observational data may make it difficult to justify the use of more complex models over the commonly used nutrient phytoplankton zooplankton detritus npzd model e g matear 1995 bagniewski et al 2011 for example in bagniewski et al 2011 none of the model variants compared could be rejected based on their misfit against constraining observations however they generated significantly different estimates of the unconstrained export carbon fluxes it has also been shown that systematically removing some of the unconstrained aspects of an ecosystem model does not significantly increase the minimum value of the cost metric ward et al 2013 in our results the more complex 11 compartment model m3 is able to generate the lowest model data misfits in all optimization experiments where the intended model structure is preserved similarly a previous comprehensive comparison of 12 individually optimized marine ecosystem models by friedrichs et al 2007 showed that models with multiple phytoplankton groups outperformed the single phytoplankton group models in our results m3 particularly exhibits reduced differences against the observed chlorophyll and nitrate vertical distributions the simpler 7 compartment model structures have a higher cost but are also able to capture the averaged seasonal variations in surface chlorophyll therefore if the objective of a modeling study is to characterize an averaged seasonality in surface chlorophyll a simple model may suffice this is supported by previous optimization studies using npzd models and observational climatologies from the north atlantic that have been able to significantly reduce model data differences kuhn et al 2015 schartau and oschlies 2003a even simpler biological models that do not include explicit representation of phytoplankton and zooplankton have been parameterized and optimized to represent global biogeochemical properties as well as complex models galbraith et al 2015 kriest 2017 in these examples the most complex models analyzed were successfully downscaled by carefully parameterizing all processes omitted in the simplified reduced model galbraith et al 2015 kriest et al 2017 complex models have an obvious utility in the study of specific plankton traits e g kuhn et al 2018 trophic interactions e g d alelio et al 2016 species distribution and diversity e g barton et al 2010 and other complex ecological processes according to our results complex models may also be better able to capture vertical distributions however when applied to a different location than the one it was calibrated for our model with multiple phytoplankton groups tended to maintain chlorophyll magnitude characteristics from its original location one aspect affecting the portability of the multiple phytoplankton model was the use of satellite derived fractionated surface chlorophyll to compare against the simulated chlorophyll of small and large phytoplankton groups the particular satellite fractionation method we used is mainly based on chlorophyll concentrations such that low chlorophyll is interpreted as a dominance of small phytoplankton and high chlorophyll is interpreted a predominant bloom of large phytoplankton if the model was calibrated for a location with low chlorophyll the parameters selected for large phytoplankton may not be adequate for locations with high chlorophyll non overlapping ranges of small and large phytoplankton growth parameters could be configured in the optimization algorithm to correct this problem these results are consistent with geographical portability experiments performed using 1d models for 4 locations in the mid atlantic bight south of our study area xiao and friedrichs 2014b xiao and friedrichs 2014b used a cost function that included satellite derived size fractionated chlorophyll and satellite derived poc in almost all cases when parameters fitted to one location were tested in the other locations the cost increased significantly xiao and friedrichs 2014b nevertheless the use of size fractionated chlorophyll was beneficial and reduced cost when optimizing all locations simultaneously xiao and friedrichs 2014b we also note that when optimizing models with multiple phytoplankton groups the value of a cost function based on total chlorophyll could be misleading some phytoplankton groups may become extinct during the optimization process thus altering the intended model structure here we decided to use an estimate of size fractionated surface chlorophyll the independent constraining of small and large phytoplankton may affect the portability of the more complex model when calibrated for individual locations figs 10 11 as it tends to benefit one phytoplankton group over the other depending on the chlorophyll abundance patterns of the specific locations lower predictive ability in complex models has been posited to occur when the model becomes over fitted to noise in the data friedrichs et al 2006 we show that this indeed can happen when a model with multiple phytoplankton groups becomes too specific to its training data set therefore to benefit from the higher performance of a site based calibrated complex model such calibration requires including samples from all biogeographical provinces to be simulated a similar conclusion was reached by xiao and friedrichs 2014b they found that successful optimization results for 1d models of the mid atlantic bight could be found using size fractionated chlorophyll and particulate organic carbon as long as data from multiple sites was assimilated even so intermediate complexity models performed the best both against assimilated and unassimilated data xiao and friedrichs 2014a in their analysis both the simplest and most complex models typically obtained optimized parameters that were good approximations to the observations at optimized locations were unrealistic parameters and non portable to other locations similarly m2 which had 7 compartments and temperature dependent biological rates showed the highest number of locations that could be replicated well with parameters optimized for a different location fig 10 this suggests that temperature dependency in the biological rates plays a role in model portability hence improving mechanistic interactions rather than introducing unconstrained diversity should be preferred to improve the global applicability of an ecosystem model temperature dependent grazing and mortality rates have been previously noted to improve the performance of global models behrenfeld et al 2013 and this clearly also applies to dynamically complicated regions like the northwest north atlantic finally it is important to note that the performance of m3 could significantly degrade depending on the choice of parameters to be optimized as biological parameter values have the ability to effectively modify the intended trophic interactions in a model cropp and norbury 2009 sailley et al 2013 in our optimization experiments these unintended behaviors included the functional extinctions i e biomass too low to affect model results and total extinctions of plankton groups similar extinctions occur when a local minimum solution is found e g schartau et al 2001 or when no scaling weights are assigned to different locations in the cost function as the optimization becomes biased towards locations with higher biomass and generates extinct functional groups at the locations with lower biomass e g schartau and oschlies 2003a to correct the extinctions schartau et al 2001 introduced zooplankton observations to the cost function without success in finding an optimal parameter solution that replicated the observations well a different case was presented by kriest 2017 where using a wide range for zooplankton parameter values resulted in a solution where zooplankton was almost extinct this undesired behavior was corrected by restricting the range of zooplankton parameters also resulting in a better fit to nutrient and oxygen and more realistic concentrations and fluxes overall kriest 2017 in the absence of parameter boundaries ward et al 2010 obtained optimized parameters with unrealistic negative grazing rates indicative of extinct zooplankton due to the non linear nature of ecosystem models the extinction of one component can have unforeseen however logical consequences for example cropp and norbury 2009 showed that removing the predator of a given prey does not only allow such prey population to increase but can also lead to the extinction of competing prey and their predators and ultimately generate the simulated system s collapse 6 3 limitations and uncertainties the main uncertainty in the use of mechanistic surrogate based calibrations with 1d models is in neglecting horizontal advection fluxes we neglected horizontal advection as is typically done in 1d models assuming that horizontal divergence terms are small relative to the biological sources and sinks this allowed us to have an estimate of how much a 3d application of an oceanographically complex region the northwest north atlantic can be improved with the use of reduced order models several 1d models have been previously used to study locations within or close to our study area being successful at replicating key aspects of biogeochemical variability tian et al 2003 2004 ji et al 2006 song et al 2010 2011 xiao and friedrichs 2014a b in particular based on a cross validation analysis of the results of optimized parameters for 1d models of the mid atlantic bights xiao and friedrichs 2014a were optimistic about the potential use of these parameters in a 3d application for the us eastern continental shelf nonetheless neglecting horizontal advection may impact the surrogate performance hemmings et al 2015 explicitly examined the effect of introducing the horizontal advective flux in a mechanistic emulator composed of 1d models representing the ocean conditions of twelve sites located every 5 degrees latitude along 20 w in the north atlantic their results showed that the addition of horizontal fluxes improved the correlation coefficient between 1d and 3d surface chlorophyll the addition of horizontal advective fluxes in the surrogates is only recommended if the velocities of the target 3d model are accurate otherwise the optimized biological parameters may tend to compensate biases introduced by an erroneous physical forcing in our study some effects of neglecting advective fluxes are compensated by nudging deep nitrate in the surrogates in other approaches like in hemmings et al 2015 the uncertainties of the emulator are evaluated and then used for the cost function in addition to the uncertainties due to unresolved advection there are two main issues with the use of optimized simulations for comparing ecosystem model with different complexities 1 the cost function and 2 the parameters to be optimized the cost function is not an entirely objective measure its design can affect the outcome of the optimizations as we discussed in section 6 2 similarly evans 2003 exemplified that weighting and variable scaling factors applied in the cost function can generate parameters sufficiently different to affect the estimates of biogeochemical fluxes the design of the cost function can also be used to partially compensate the absence of horizontal transport through the addition of correction terms to biological variables losa et al 2004 hemmings and challenor 2012 prießet al 2013a correction terms can also account for other systematic or random errors in the surrogate however as suggested in section 4 1 the more the 1d model is forced to behave like the 3d model the less useful it becomes in identifying the sources of deficiencies in either the physical or the biological components of the model a consideration in the use of correction terms is that the distribution of errors in the 1d and 3d models may vary during the optimization hemmings et al 2015 if correction terms are used a statistical error term may be more robust than a parameter dependent error term hemmings et al 2015 another issue of importance in the design of the optimization cost function is the selection of weights to balance the contributions of different variables and or locations in optimizations with multiple observational data types optimal parameters become a compromise between different biogeochemical conditions and sources of data hence the optimization results are quite sensitive to the scaling approach the lack of any explicit treatment of biases and the weighing scheme used in our cost function are consistent with previous studies e g friedrichs et al 2007 ward et al 2010 however we emphasize the importance of correcting biases between observational data sets of the same simulated variable as we did in the case of surface chlorophyll the use of fractionated chlorophyll to compare against the small and large phytoplankton groups in the design of the cost function influenced the results of our portability experiments this approach was also used by xiao and friedrichs 2014a for optimization experiments in the mid atlantic bight we can expect that advancements in our understanding of how complex ecosystem models behave can be made with the use of other empirical sources of information for the optimization of unconstrained variables for example zooplankton abundances from continuous plankton recorder measurements cannot be directly compared to model results but could provide estimates of seasonal variability lewis et al 2006 that can be scaled to the corresponding simulated zooplankton groups this might be particularly useful since phytoplankton losses are among the least constrained parameters even for simple npzd models e g fennel et al 2001 bagniewski et al 2011 the selection of parameters to optimize is at some level subjective as well and can have a dramatic effect as we have shown here we supported our decision of the target parameters with a sensitivity analysis where the model response to variations in the parameter values withing their corresponding range was tested systematically parameters were ranked according to how much they affected chlorophyll and nitrate i e the same variables available in the observations poorly constrained parameters can be set to arbitrary values during the optimization without significantly affecting the model cost ward et al 2010 or otherwise tend to hit their a priori distribution limits e g schartau and oschlies 2003a when unconstrained parameters are fixed to their a priori estimates the level of previous tuning to the original model domain can skew the results of geographical portability experiments ward et al 2010 in our results models benefit from optimizing a higher number of sensitive parameters e4 vs e5 fig 12 if the number of optimized parameters is further increased and the set contains unconstrained parameters the ability of such optimized complex models to simulate unassimilated observations becomes reduced friedrichs et al 2006 2007 our results thus support that the selection of parameters should be done with consideration of the optimal number of parameters that can be constrained by the observational data 7 conclusions parameter optimization methods offer a systematic approach to reduce subjective model tuning and quantitatively compare ecosystem models with different complexities however optimization is not an entirely objective methodology with a unique solution we have illustrated that in addition to the uncertainties of the physical environment conclusions about the accuracy and portability of a model can differ depending on decisions about the design of the cost function the selection of parameters to be optimized and the level of preliminary calibration of each model due to the limitations of applying parameter optimization in 3d coupled physical biogeochemical models 1d surrogates represent an efficient alternative for the exploration of the parameter space and for geographical portability experiments in an extensive application of this concept we configured ensembles of 1d models to behave as their regional 3d model application counterparts and used them to compare the performance of three ecosystem model versions processes unresolved by the 1d physical models and the level of ecosystem model complexity did affect the accuracy of the surrogates however successful surrogate based model calibrations were possible and generated similar model data misfits when applied in the 1d and 3d environments when an appropriate set of parameters was optimized the model with multiple phytoplankton and zooplankton groups was better able to replicate assimilated observations than the single phytoplankton and zooplankton models nonetheless the simpler models were also able to replicate the observed averaged seasonal variations in surface chlorophyll well these results are consistent with previous studies and suggest that more complex trophic structures in models can better capture the observed temporal variability and spatial distribution of biogeochemical variables at multiple locations in an additional analysis geographical portability experiments provided an indication of how each model structure behaves with respect to unassimilated information in this case the most complex model was found to be the least portable as the parameters optimized at some locations tended to favor either small or large phytoplankton this result is consistent with other studies and with early theoretical notions about the expected behavior of complex models we note that conclusions drawn from portability experiments comparing optimized models with different complexities are strongly affected by the prior degree of calibration of models the number of parameters optimized and the parameter boundaries in the optimization moreover when we varied the selection of optimization parameters in the complex model it was prone to unsatisfactory results and unintended model behaviors attempting to optimize an improper selection of parameters resulted in the extinction of certain plankton groups thus modifying the intended structure of trophic relationships in the model hence we highlight that a guided selection of the parameters to be optimized is necessary especially when as in our case little or no prior model tuning has been performed we also highlight that in order to benefit from the improved ecosystem representation that a complex model provides such model needs to be trained with observations from diverse geographical locations research is required on efficient sampling methodologies to calibrate global surrogates allowing us to determine the number of locations that would be sufficient and ensuring that the most representative locations are being selected finally we also observed an improvement in our simplest model version when all biological fluxes were configured to depend on temperature therefore we can conclude that improving the mechanistic relationships rather than adding unconstrained diversity can lead to more robust globally applicable models here we base this statement on the results of the model including temperature dependency but the same argument may apply to the use of allometric or otherwise scaled and parameterized models as well as to the combined use of temperature and parameterized dependencies a subsequent study will analyze how these optimized model versions perform when applied to the 3d

24015,objectively determining the level of ecosystem model complexity necessary to achieve meaningful representations of biogeochemical cycles at different spatial and temporal scales is an outstanding issue in marine ecosystem modeling as part of the development of a three dimensional 3d regional ocean modelling system roms application for the northwest north atlantic ocean we compare model results from three alternative ecosystem model versions in which ecological complexity was increased in a step wise fashion in order to ensure an objective comparison the models were optimized to replicate observations of satellite surface chlorophyll and in situ chlorophyll and nitrate profiles to overcome the high computational cost of optimizing 3d models we use a surrogate based optimization method that is an ensemble of one dimensional 1d models is used as a proxy of the ecosystem model behavior in the 3d setting the 1d models were configured at locations where in situ profiles are available a total of 17 optimization experiments aim to evaluate different aspects of the comparison between the ecosystem models we show that for all ecosystem model versions the optimized model performance degrades when the optimization includes all observed variables at all locations instead of individual locations only moreover the choice of parameters to be optimized can significantly affect the behavior of the optimized models and is most noticeable when multiple phytoplankton and zooplankton groups are included additionally evaluation of spatial patterns in optimal parameter values at individual locations allows us to assess geographical model portability in general an optimized complex model can achieve lower model data misfits against assimilated data than simple models but is also more prone to generating unintended trophic relations the more complex model also had decreased performance when applied to locations different than those used for calibration i e portability experiments which is discussed in the context of the design of the cost function and selection of parameters to optimize keywords plankton ocean model model complexity optimization north atlantic 1 introduction since the emergence of numerical marine ecology models have diversified from describing simple prey predator relationships e g riley 1965 to representing multiple plankton functional groups and chemical variables with dependencies on the characteristics of the physical environment e g dutkiewicz et al 2015 kishi et al 2007 there is an ongoing discussion about the most appropriate level of ecosystem complexity model structure and parameterizations of functional relationships both simple and complex models have advantages and disadvantages for instance the use of simple models under idealized conditions has proven to be valuable in identifying and understanding underlying mechanisms of the marine ecosystem functioning e g evans and parslow 1985 fasham et al 1990 kuhn et al 2015 however it is frequently argued that more realistic representations of the plankton community composition and the interrelationships of marine food webs are required to improve forecasting capabilities in regional and global models e g le quéré et al 2005 regardless of their complexity marine biogeochemical models depend on many parameters that describe biological and chemical rates of change such as growth mortality and degradation rates including maximum rates and half saturation concentrations in nutrient uptake and predation formulations as models are developed for specific regions or periods their parameters are typically calibrated to fit observations for those specific conditions this may lead to overfitting a loss of model forecasting skill and of portability to different geographic locations see friedrichs et al 2007 in general the number of parameters increases with the number of state variables in a model denman 2003 thus complex models are at a higher risk of overfitting moreover most of these parameters are poorly known and wide value ranges are reported in the literature studies using systematic calibration methods known as parameter optimization have shown that typically available observational sets are often not sufficient to determine more than a few of these parameters fennel et al 2001 friedrichs et al 2007 ward et al 2010 kwon and primeau 2006 parameter values may also change depending on the plankton community composition and thus it is possible that models need to consider parameter variations with geography losa et al 2004 or time mattern et al 2012 following the principle of parsimony the simplest model able to fit the observations should be favored over more complex ones failure of a model to replicate observations suggests that the model structure may be missing key components of the system s behavior conversely the ability of a model to replicate a given set of observations does not unequivocally mean that all processes are properly represented when models differ not only in their level of ecological complexity but also in the degree to which they were calibrated and in the model pathways that were affected during calibration it is tenuous to argue that differences in model performance are due to structural complexity friedrichs et al 2007 kriest et al 2010 to better discern the effects of increased ecosystem complexity from differences in a model s response due to its parameter values it is necessary to calibrate the model versions to comparable levels of performance and through comparable pathways of mass flux e g xiao and friedrichs 2014a galbraith et al 2015 kriest 2017 during the 90s the calibration of marine ecosystem models to a specific study region was predominantly subjective arhonditsis and brett 2004 this approach is inefficient increases the risk of overlooking structural inadequacies in the models and is complicated by the number of parameters in play and their co dependencies in recent decades this problem has been increasingly addressed with the use of parameter optimization techniques fennel et al 2001 kwon and primeau 2006 2008 friedrichs et al 2007 bagniewski et al 2011 schartau et al 2017 kriest et al 2017 parameter optimization provides a more objective framework for comparing models with different degrees of trophic complexity but optimization experiments require a large number of model runs and thus their direct application to computationally expensive 3d models is difficult an alternative which we choose here is to perform the optimization using a simplified faster model that replicates the results of the computationally more expensive 3d model the computationally efficient model is referred to as a model surrogate or emulator the surrogate can be a statistical model a coarser resolution model or a reduced order model that allows one to perform a large number of simulations required for parameter sensitivity analyses and model calibration different techniques for the construction of statistical emulators of 3d biogeochemical models have been tested in recent years hooten et al 2011 leeds et al 2012 mattern et al 2012 other tested approaches include reduced temporal resolution prießet al 2013a b and reduced physical dimensionality hemmings and challenor 2012 hemmings et al 2015 our methodology resembles the latter reduced dimensionality studies in that our model surrogate is a mechanistic emulator constructed with an ensemble of 1d models located at points where in situ chlorophyll a and nitrate profiles are available the surrogate 1d models and the target model 3d model share the same ecosystem model therefore in comparison with statistical and reduced process resolution surrogates the reduced dimensionality approach provides insight into the ecosystem responses most affected by the physical dynamics features that are well replicated in 1d are likely controlled by the ecosystem model itself structure equations and parameter values whereas biases between 1d and 3d are a consequence of the simplified physical framework in this manuscript we focus on the methodology used to bring models with different ecological structures to a comparable level of calibration by analyzing results from several optimization experiments our study region is the northwest north atlantic continental shelf which involves areas with contrasting oceanographic conditions our overarching goal is to better understand the variability of phytoplankton and primary production in the region while addressing the unresolved question of how much ecological complexity is needed to represent it we specifically aim to answer 1 does the ecosystem model structure and or its dependency on temperature affect the surrogate based optimization performance and 2 how does the number of observed variables compared the number of parameters optimized and the location the model is optimized for affect each model optimization aside from gaining insight about the answers to these questions we demonstrate that the surrogate approach is effective as a calibration tool despite its simplicity an in depth comparison of chlorophyll and primary production patterns obtained by the 3d ocean model after the optimization will be explored in a subsequent study 2 study area our model domain covers the continental shelf and adjacent open ocean waters of the northwest north atlantic ocean including the newfoundland shelf the grand banks the gulf of st lawrence the scotian shelf and the gulf of maine fig 1 the region is at the confluence of the two major north atlantic current systems the equatorward flowing labrador current and the northeast flowing gulf stream and is influenced by their adjoining shelf and slope water currents loder et al 1998 this leads to complicated dynamics including both cold and warm sub regions originating from the north atlantic subpolar and subtropical gyres townsend et al 2004 3 model descriptions 3 1 physical configuration we use the 3d physical framework of the regional ocean modeling system roms version 3 5 http myroms org haidvogel et al 2008 the model is nested within the regional ocean ice model of the northwest north atlantic of urrego blanco and sheng 2012 the physical model implementation and detailed sensitivity analyses and validation of the simulated physical variables of this model are described in brennan et al 2016 the physical model has also been shown to realistically reproduce the distinct pathways of water mass movements in the domain rutherford and fennel 2018 similar to the biogeochemical application by bianucci et al 2015 ocean temperature and salinity are weakly nudged time scale of 140 days to climatological fields from geshelin et al 1999 3 2 ecosystem models we compare three nitrogen based ecosystem model versions which are shown schematically in fig 2 and referred to as m1 m2 and m3 in increasing order of complexity m1 has previously been used in the mid atlantic bight a region south of our model domain fennel et al 2006 m3 is based on the north pacific ecosystem model for understanding regional oceanography nemuro structure kishi et al 2007 this model was chosen because an optimized version of nemuro has been shown to outperform simple models in the california current area mattern et al 2017 m2 represents an intermediate step between m1 and m3 m1 and m2 have 7 compartments tracking nitrate ammonium phytoplankton chlorophyll zooplankton and two detritus size classes in m1 only phytoplankton growth depends on temperature eppley 1972 in m2 we introduced temperature dependency in other biological rates i e phytoplankton mortality zooplankton grazing excretion and mortality in m3 we further increased ecological complexity by adding plankton functional groups m3 has 11 compartments that include 2 nutrient and 2 detritus pools similar to m1 and m2 2 phytoplankton groups representing small and large phytoplankton and 3 zooplankton groups small large and predatory zooplankton while the trophic structure of m3 i e the interactions among planktonic groups is based on nemuro it utilizes the same functional forms as our m1 and m2 model versions e g holling iii grazing as in fennel et al 2006 instead of the ivlev equation used in nemuro for sake of better comparability in summary the three model versions we compare introduce additional ecological complexity in a step wise fashion in this way we aim to tease apart the effects of increasing the dependency of the system on environmental factors such as temperature and increasing the trophic complexity itself the equations for the three model versions are included in appendix i boundary and initial conditions for no3 are based on a monthly climatology constructed using in situ observations see section 4 1 and world ocean atlas monthly averages garcia et al 2010 initial and boundary conditions for all other biological variables are set to 0 1 mmol n m 3 as in fennel et al 2006 2008 these variables adjust on short time scales days hence the system has no memory of the initial values after a short spin up phase a phytoplankton to chlorophyll ratio of 0 76 mmol n mg chl 1 is assumed for the chlorophyll initial and boundary conditions bianucci et al 2015 3 3 surrogate model we apply a simple 1d framework to the 22 locations presented on fig 1 which are referred to as the 1d models from now on in general the 1d models solve a vertical diffusion term k d 2 c z 2 using the crank nicolson scheme where k d is the diffusivity z is depth and c refers to the biological state variables the vertical resolution is 5 m and the vertical grid is divided into two distinct layers with respect to mixing a turbulent surface mixed layer layer 1 and a quiescent layer below layer 2 the interface between both layers is determined by the time varying mixed layer depth which is estimated using a criterion for the maximum density gradient for this purpose the density field is obtained from a base run of the 3d model in 1d a high diffusivity is assigned to all grid cells above the prescribed mixed layer depth ensuring complete mixing within the mixed layer on a time scale of 1 day with a minimum diffusivity of 100 m2 d 1 imposed k d 1 max mld 2 d 1 100 1 2 1 0 3 m2 s 1 a lower diffusivity k d 2 k d 1 10 2 is assigned to all grid cells below the mixed layer depth this 1d framework has been previously used lagman et al 2014 kuhn et al 2015 the 1d models also require shortwave radiation and temperature as inputs the shortwave radiation is the same as in the 3d model and comes from the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf global atmospheric reanalysis era interim dee et al 2011 temperature is taken from the 3d model base simulation as 1d models do not include horizontal advection no3 below the mixed layer depth is nudged to the 3d results from the 3d base simulation with a nudging time scale of 60 days this nudging scheme avoids direct impacts on the photic surface layers where it is assumed that biological activity has the strongest effect on nitrate since we focus on temporal changes in concentrations within the upper mixed layer we disregard the possible but presumably small effects of a few parameters on reshaping the vertical distribution of nitrate in the photic surface layers therefore there is no conflict between the nudging treatment and the optimization i e deep nitrate does not change with changes in the parameter values on the timescales considered here total depth in the 1d models is equal to the depth in the 3d model or truncated at 50 m below their maximum mixed layer depth whichever is shallower this treatment further reduces the surrogate computational time without affecting its performance conditions for year 1999 are repeated at the beginning of the 1d model run as a model spin up acronyms geographical coordinates depths mean temperature chlorophyll a and nitrate values for each location are presented in table 1 despite its simplicity the mechanistic emulator replicates the results of the full 3d model well for all three biogeochemical models in fig 3 we use 2d histograms to compare 5 day averages of surface chlorophyll simulated by the 3d roms and the 1d models configured with the initial parameter guess the target model roms and surrogate surface chlorophyll results are significantly correlated p 0 01 with correlation coefficients of 0 77 0 84 and 0 60 for m1 m2 and m3 respectively nevertheless the surrogate of m3 is challenged to replicate low chlorophyll values and tends to overestimate them differences in chlorophyll 1d minus 3d before the optimization are shown

biases in the position of the deep chlorophyll maximum occur during summer stratification with the 1d models predicting a shallower position than the 3d model 4 optimization procedure and sensitivity analysis the optimization is implemented using an evolutionary algorithm and applied for 3 years january 1999 december 2001 the evolutionary algorithm simulates a process of natural selection by imposing a survival of the fittest strategy houck et al 1995 on a population composed of different parameter sets which represent individuals within the population evolution takes place through random recombinations and mutations of the parameter sets a priori estimates of the minimum and maximum values have to be specified for each parameter to avoid obtaining unrealistic values table 2 details of the evolutionary algorithm used here are described in kuhn et al 2015 we optimized subsets of the complete parameter sets required by each model version table 3 which were selected based on the sensitivity analysis described in section 4 2 4 1 observational datasets for calibration satellite and in situ observations were used to calibrate the models surface chlorophyll satellite observations come from the sea viewing wide field of view sensor seawifs 8 day averages with 9 km resolution in situ observations were obtained from the atlantic zone monitoring program azmp http www meds sdmm dfo mpo gc ca isdm gdsi azmp pmza index eng html which performs biannual monitoring along the 13 transect lines shown in fig 1 the azmp dataset includes quality controlled ctd measurements of temperature and salinity mitchell et al 2002 from which density was calculated using the gibbs seawater teos 10 oceanographic toolbox bottle measurements used in this study include in situ chlorophyll a and nitrate as these are variables with direct counterparts in the model the standardized chlorophyll a analysis method is turner fluorometry and the nitrate analysis is colorimetric on a technicon autoanalyzer ii aa ii segmented flow analyzer mitchell et al 2002 satellite observations were first validated against the in situ chlorophyll a observations from the top 3 m by identifying all matching records between 1997 and 2010 i e the duration of the seawifs record this matchup analysis was implemented by first searching all in situ observations available within every 8 day window of the satellite record then matching satellite records were averaged within a 0 1 degree radius of their corresponding in situ measurement using vertical averages over the top 3 meters increased the number of match ups and did not significantly affect the regression compared to using only the top 1 meter table i supplement i additionally the same matchup analysis was performed using globcolour http hermes acri fr a combined modis and seawifs product and non standard azmp measurements of in situ hplc high performance liquid chromatography chlorophyll a the results of these analyses reveal the same patterns of satellite performance as the seawifs vs standard measurements supplement i the comparison shows systematic biases at certain locations with the most pronounced bias at locations inside the gulf of st lawrence bias correction is an essential step when merging in situ and satellite data sets e g smith et al 2008 therefore based on the relationship between in situ chlorophyll and satellite chlorophyll see supplement i we defined the bias between satellite chlorophyll and in situ chlorophyll at locations inside the gulf of st lawrence as a function of satellite chlorophyll concentration fig 5a to correct this bias satellite time series inside the gulf of st lawrence were debiased by subtracting e g o s l 0 01 0 19 x 1 42 where x is the log transform seawifs satellite observation and e g o s l is the bias fig 5a in order to provide observed counterparts to both small and large phytoplankton groups in m3 we estimated the chlorophyll a fractions from small and large phytoplankton in the satellite observations using the empirical relationships of hirata et al 2011 this study provides a set of equations and coefficients to estimate the chlorophyll concentration of various phytoplankton size classes and functional groups based on a global classification of hplc pigment data into phytoplankton size classes here we specifically used their equation to estimate the fraction of chlorophyll corresponding to microphytoplankton ψ 1 ψ ψ 0 exp ψ 1 x ψ 2 1 where x is the log transform seawifs satellite observation and the coefficient values are ψ 0 0 9117 ψ 1 0 27330 and ψ 2 0 4003 we regard this fraction of chlorophyll as an observational counterpart of our large phytoplankton chlorophyll component the remaining fraction nano and picophytoplankton is considered the counterpart of small phytoplankton chlorophyll fig 5b since hirata et al s 2011 relationship was designed with seawifs observations we cannot apply the same formula to in situ measurements with any confidence 4 2 sensitivity analysis in order to identify the most sensitive parameters and reduce the parameter space to be searched during optimization the 1d models were rerun after perturbing each parameter one at a time a reduced parameter space is desirable because parameters that are insensitive to the observations used in the optimization cannot be estimated the sensitivity of the models to each of their parameter values is estimated as 2 q y p i 1 m j 1 n y t e s t y b a s e y b a s e which is the sum of the normalized absolute differences in the model state variables y between the results of a base simulation y b a s e and a test simulation y t e s t where n is the total number of values compared q is calculated by varying each parameter p in m 5 different tests the tests change each of the base simulation parameter values presented in table 2 to the minimum 25 50 75 and maximum values of their corresponding ranges also shown in table 2 these minimum and maximum parameter values are based on the literature and also imposed in the optimization algorithm as bounds to avoid unrealistic values kuhn et al 2015 ward et al 2010 this sensitivity analysis is thus independent from the observations we consider this is important because the observations do not provide vertical structure information with sufficient frequency most in situ profiles are around the spring bloom missing important aspects of the variability that could affect the parameter sensitivity results this sensitivity analysis also provides information about the model sensitivity across all variables which is valuable for comparison against other studies nevertheless the ranking of parameters used for selecting the parameters to be optimized considers only the variables that have an observational counterpart i e only chlorophyll and nitrate results of this sensitivity analysis are shown in fig 6 each stacked bar shows the contribution of all model variables to the total sensitivity in order to select the parameters most sensitive to the available observations the parameters were ranked with respect to the chlorophyll and nitrate contributions to q in models m1 and m2 equivalent parameters have similar rankings the 3 most sensitive parameters are the maximum phytoplankton growth μ 0 the mortality m p m p 0 and the coagulation rate τ the initial slope of the p i curve of photosynthesis α and grazing rate g m a x g0 have different ranks in m1 and m2 but are among the six most sensitive parameters in addition to being important for the estimation of chlorophyll this subset of parameters also has a significant effect on zooplankton and detritus m1 and m2 are also sensitive to the zooplankton base metabolic rate l b m l b m 0 and the remineralization of small detritus r s d however these parameters dominantly affect zooplankton and detritus which are not part of the observation data used in the optimization in m3 parameters related to small phytoplankton are more sensitive than those related to large phytoplankton e g the most sensitive parameter is the reference maximum growth rate of small phytoplankton μ 0 p s there are some similarities in parameter ranking with the rankings of m1 and m2 e g the small phytoplankton mortality rate μ 0 p s the grazing rate of small zooplankton on small phytoplankton g 0 z s p s and the coagulation rate τ are among the most sensitive the most sensitive parameters of m3 are similar to those reported for nemuro yoshie et al 2007 in general the most sensitive parameters appear similar among biogeochemical models in a parameter sensitivity analysis of 12 different biogeochemical models friedrichs et al 2007 that the maximum phytoplankton growth rate and the remineralization rate frequently appear among the most sensitive parameters the parameter rankings in fig 6 guide the selection of parameters to be optimized as detailed in the next section and in table 3 4 3 optimization experiments we performed five optimization experiments e1 to e5 for all three models and two additional experiments only for m3 e4b and e5b each optimization experiment e utilizes a different cost function j e depending on its objective the different objectives of the experiments consider the number of variables included in the optimization the number of locations evaluated and the number of parameters optimized table 3 we define r v as the weighted root mean square difference between the simulated y ˆ and observed y values 3 r v w v 2 n n 1 n y ˆ l n y l n 2 where the subscript v stands for the three observational data types in this study satellite chlorophyll r c h l 1 in situ chlorophyll r c h l 2 and in situ nitrate r n o 3 n is the number of observed values and the weight w v ϕ v σ v of each variable at each location is inversly proportional to the standard deviation of its observations evans 2003 a high weight was assigned to satellite chlorophyll by setting the weight coefficients ϕ v 3 for satellite chlorophyll and ϕ v 1 for the other two data types the higher weight of satellite chlorophyll was determined during preliminary tests and was necessary due to the pronounced seasonal cycle in the region resulting in a large standard deviation in surface chlorophyll values if no additional weight was used satellite chlorophyll became downweighted with respect to in situ chlorophyll profiles the profiles could not fully capture chlorophyll temporal variability due to their significantly lower frequency in the case of m3 r c h l 1 was modified to compare both the small and large phytoplankton chlorophyll fractions against corresponding satellite derived fractions estimated using the hirata et al 2011 algorithm see section 4 1 experiments e1 and e2 are joint optimizations that assimilate chlorophyll data from all locations shown by the orange dots in fig 1 these experiments use cost functions j 1 and j 2 respectively 4 j 1 p 1 l l 1 l 1 ω l r c h l 1 5 j 2 p 1 l l 1 l 1 ω l r c h l 1 r c h l 2 where p refers to parameter vector and l 22 is the total number of 1d model locations l the location weighting factor ω l 1 l v 1 v y v 2 σ v 2 uses the mean y and standard deviation σ of the observed variables v to avoid biasing the cost towards locations with lower variability schartau and oschlies 2003a friedrichs et al 2007 experiment e3 eq 7 corresponds to single site optimizations i e the optimization algorithm runs independently for each 1d model location note that the location specific weight is not needed in this cost function 6 j 3 p l r c h l 1 r c h l 2 r n o 3 the results of e3 were used to assess spatial patterns in the optimized parameters in a principal component analysis this analysis assesses the similarities between parameter sets optimized for different locations and identifies the parameters that are mainly driving such similarities we also compared the portability see friedrichs et al 2007 of our three model versions by optimizing the model at one single location and then transferring these optimal parameters to the other stations experiment e4 is a joint optimization where all 22 locations are included 7 j 4 p 1 l l 1 l 1 ω l r c h l 1 r c h l 2 r n o 3 comparison between the results of e3 and e4 allows us to evaluate the compromise required when fitting all observed variables at all locations using one common set of parameters section 5 2 comparing results of e1 e2 and e4 aims to evaluate differences between single data type and multiple data types optimizations all experiments from e1 to e4 aimed to optimize the 6 most sensitive parameters in m1 or their equivalents in m2 and m3 in the case of m1 and m2 the 6 most sensitive parameters are either the same or equivalent fig 6 in the case of m3 equivalent parameters may be one or more for example the m3 equivalents of the phytoplankton reference growth rate μ 0 used in the single phytoplankton models m1 and m2 are both the small and large phytoplankton reference growth rates μ 0ps and μ 0pl due to lack of observational constraints for zooplankton only the most sensitive of the grazing rates is optimized g 0 z s p s keeping the ratio to the other six grazing rates constant notice that there are only three different estimates of the maximum grazing parameters that are assigned to seven parameters therefore in essence only three parameters to specify the grazing rates on m3 experiments e4b e5 and e5b also use the cost function j 4 they evaluate optimizations for all compared variables at all compared locations modifying only the number and selection of parameters table 3 in experiment e5 we optimized only the top 3 most sensitive parameters of m1 and m2 or their equivalents in m3 thus the comparison between e4 and e5 evaluates how the number of optimized parameters affects the results section 5 3 in preliminary tests optimizing more than 6 parameters in m1 or m2 did not result in significant improvements by optimizing equivalent parameters we aim to ensure an objective comparison between models for instance it has been theorized and shown that different models can produce similar fits to observations despite portraying different dynamics friedrichs et al 2007 quine 1975 however due to this parameter selection procedure the number of optimized parameters in experiments e1 to e5 is higher for m3 than for m1 and m2 it could be argued that a better performance of m3 may be a consequence of more degrees of freedom in order to address this issue the additional experiments e4b and e5b which were performed only for m3 replicate experiments e4 and e5 but using the same number of optimized parameters as for m1 and m2 i e the 6 and 3 most sensitive parameters respectively in all cases parameters not included in the optimization subsets are kept fixed at their initial guess value table 2 as the cost function is different for each experiment and thus non comparable we use j 4 as the function to evaluate differences between optimized models f p j 4 this function compares all observational data types and all locations 5 results we compare the results of the optimization experiments described in table 3 using the cost function j 4 p eq 7 of each model version in 1d fig 7 3d simulations were performed only with parameters obtained in experiment e4 and their corresponding costs are also shown additionally the optimized set of parameters obtained for e4 is presented in table 4 as a reference overall model m3 presents lower costs than m1 and m2 in experiments e1 to e4 as well as in experiment e5b however in experiments e5 and e4b model m3 presents large model data differences with respect to satellite chlorophyll we describe and discuss these results in more detail in the following sections 5 1 single vs multiple observed variables comparison of experiments e1 e2 and e4 illustrates the effects of optimizing the models against satellite chlorophyll alone e1 versus including information about the vertical structure of chlorophyll e2 and nitrate e4 the inclusion of in situ chlorophyll profiles in the optimization e2 eq 6 degrades the performance of m1 with respect to satellite chlorophyll but has no significant effect on the performance of m2 and m3 the inclusion of both chlorophyll and nitrate profiles e4 results in lower model costs with respect to nitrate but higher costs with respect to both satellite and in situ chlorophyll fig 8a shows the optimized results of e4 in comparison to surface chlorophyll in situ surface chlorophyll exhibits large ranges between october and january whereas satellite chlorophyll appears less variable with relative constant low values these months have the largest number of gaps in the satellite records fig 8b 5 2 single vs multiple locations in experiment e3 optimized parameters were found for each location individually using eq 7 allowing different optimal parameters for the different locations makes it easier to fit the individual patterns of variability and thus a lower total cost is achieved the results of experiment e3 are used to analyze whether spatial patterns in the biological parameters emerge section 5 2 1 and to evaluate model portability from one location to another section 5 2 2 5 2 1 spatial patterns in parameters the analysis of the parameters optimized for individual locations may reveal spatial patterns with dominance of specific plankton groups in different areas a principal component analysis was performed on the optimal parameter sets obtained for each model version fig 9 in all model versions the variability among locations is dominated by differences in the zooplankton grazing rates pc1 and phytoplankton growth rates pc2 clearly defined clusters of locations are not identified by the analysis however some locations consistently arrange themselves along pc2 in all model versions that is some locations are consistently characterized by either high or low grazing rates spatial patterns in the grazing rates are however difficult to discern 5 2 2 model portability model portability experiments were performed in the 1d environment by iteratively applying the optimized parameters from one location optimized model to the rest of them test models results are summarized in fig 10 where the cost of the test models is normalized by the corresponding optimized model cost m2 has the largest percentage of test models with cost equal to or lower than the optimized model m1 23 3 m2 32 9 m3 17 4 the highest percentage of tests with cost larger than the optimized run occur in m3 m1 76 7 m2 67 1 m3 82 6 however m1 presented the highest percentage of tests with cost larger than twice the optimized run m1 32 3 m2 25 5 m3 26 7 according to these results m2 can be considered the most portable of the three model versions whereas m3 appears as the least portable in particular for m3 it appears that model solutions optimized at open ocean sites perform poorly when transferred to shallower shelf areas oppositely when parameters are optimized at the shallow shelf areas and then transferred to the deeper open ocean sites the models do not perform as bad behavior is more symmetric for m2 fig 11 shows an example of the portability experiments for two locations with contrasting oceanographic conditions location 4 bon 49 21 n 51 48 w in the labrador sea and location 11 hal 43 46 n 62 43 w in the scotian shelf the satellite observations at the bon location have a distinct spring bloom peak which is well replicated by m2 using either parameters optimized for this location fig 11a or for the hal location fig 11c however m3 can only replicate the annual peak when using the locally optimized set of parameters the magnitude of the spring bloom at the hal location is lower than at bon the peak occurs earlier in the year and other peaks of equal magnitude can occur at different times of the year due to this more irregular variability both models are challenged to replicate the hal location even when using locally optimized parameters when locally optimized both models appear calibrated to appropriately capturing the timing of maximum surface chlorophyll concentrations such that large discrepancies with observations occur when the fall bloom is larger than the spring bloom as in 1999 locally optimized m2 favors maximum concentrations and produces lower than observed summer to fall concentrations in contrast m3 favors average concentrations better capturing summer to fall concentrations but underestimating the spring bloom maxima the hal test run of m2 maintains the spring bloom peak timing but overall increases concentrations with emphasis on the fall m3 generates a well defined spring bloom of shorter duration 5 3 number of optimized parameters experiments e4 e5 e4b and e5b aim to evaluate the effect of increasing or decreasing the number of optimized parameters on the optimization success the cost metric results fig 7 show that optimizing 3 versus 6 parameters does not significantly affect the cost function value of m1 and m2 this is consistent with the results from the parameter sensitivity analysis where the top 3 most sensitive parameters in m1 and m2 present a dominant effect on the model results in comparison with the rest of parameters fig 6a b in contrast m3 was more evenly sensitive to all parameters fig 6c and thus the number and choice of parameters to include in the optimization significantly affects the model results for example in experiment e4 a total of 10 parameters were optimized for m3 those included sensitive parameters for all of the phytoplankton and zooplankton groups while the subset of 6 parameters optimized in e4b only included one of the large phytoplankton parameters α pl the optimization results of e4b successfully replicate the average small phytoplankton background concentrations however they fail to replicate the blooming of the large phytoplankton group during which the biomass of large phytoplankton exceeds temporarily that of small phytoplankton fig 12 calibrating the initial slope of the p i curve of photosynthesis of large phytoplankton was insufficient to obtain a realistically high proliferation of large phytoplankton in spring this illustrates that in addition to an appropriate response to light differentiation between the responses to nutrient availability is fundamental in multi species models e g gleaners vs opportunists the cost of m3 in experiments e5 5 optimized parameters and e5b 3 optimized parameters is within the range of those for m1 and m2 but the parameters obtained by these experiments generate unintended trophic dynamics where some functional groups become extinct in the model the diagrams in fig 12b summarize these emergent structures in e4b predatory zooplankton z p disappear due to a combination of low prey biomass and low grazing rates as large phytoplankton was not properly replicated large zooplankton growth became inhibited by low prey densities and both low large phytoplankton and low large zooplankton biomass affected predatory zooplankton in e5 grazing rates were not part of the optimized parameters and did not scale with increasing phytoplankton growth rates this resulted in the functional extinction of small zooplankton while the optimization attempted to match zooplankton losses by increasing mortalities and coagulation rates the negligible biomass of small zooplankton cascaded to the total extinction of large and predatory zooplankton in experiment e5b m3 essentially becomes a p z model similar to m1 and m2 due to the extinction of large and predatory zooplankton and the low concentrations of large phytoplankton 5 4 fluxes the choice of parameters of m3 in experiments e1 to e5 was intended to optimize comparable fluxes among all model versions nonetheless differences in the resulting gross fluxes between variables are present between the 7 variable models and the 11 variable model fig 13 shows vertically integrated zooplankton grazing phytoplankton growth new and regenerated production mortality and coagulation fluxes obtained for the models using parameters from e4 differences in the new production fluxes are negligible between m1 and m2 but m1 presents a slightly higher annual peak in the regenerated production and grazing the effect of temperature dependency on the phytoplankton mortality rates is noticeable during fall and winter where m2 has lower rates than m1 in contrast to m1 and m2 m3 has more defined peaks in new production and more extended periods with high regenerated production grazing by small zooplankton is lowest in m3 peaks in grazing by large and predatory zooplankton exceed the grazing rates in m1 and m2 by approximately 2 mmol m 2 d 1 on average mortality of large phytoplankton is twice the phytoplankton mortality flux in m1 and m2 during spring and summer but the same as m2 during winter the coagulation flux of large phytoplankton is negligible 6 discussion 6 1 surrogates and surrogate based optimization simplified models allow us to avoid the computational expense of 3d models when performing sensitivity tests and calibrations here a simplified 1d physical framework was shown to replicate key aspects of the results of a 3d regional application at selected locations using three different ecosystem model versions figs 3 4 after optimization the model data misfit was reduced in both 1d and performed similarly well in 3d applications supplement ii fig 7 similar types of site based or test bed calibrations of marine ecosystem models using 1d models have previously been shown to improve the predictive skill of 3d models kane et al 2011 mcdonald et al 2012 oschlies and schartau 2005 in many cases the 1d models are built to represent averaged conditions at a climatological scale or over a relatively large spatial area dadou et al 2004 losa et al 2004 matear 1995 schartau and oschlies 2003b this is intended to reduce the effects of phase biases that result from noise in both the observations and models and of the inability of models to replicate as much variability as is displayed in the observations hemmings et al 2015 leeds et al 2012 schartau and oschlies 2003a we did not use climatological or spatial averaging that is surrogate target and model data comparisons were done on a site by site and date by date basis although this can be considered more challenging the surrogates were able to capture between 36 and 70 of the variance in surface chlorophyll estimates of the 3d model sample fig 3 the surrogate based optimization was successful in improving the performance of the three ecosystem model versions supplement ii fig 7 however there are some systematic differences between 1d and 3d models in terms of the position of the deep chlorophyll maxima in summer overall the deep chlorophyll maxima are shallower in the 1d models than in the 3d model fig 4 probably a consequence of our simplified two layer vertical structure of turbulence in 1d similar discrepancies in the position and extend of the deep chlorophyll maximum have been previously noted in 1d models doney et al 1996 fasham et al 1993 including 1d calibration studies schartau and oschlies 2003b in the latter the vertical diffusivities in the 1d model were directly taken from the target model this suggests that biases in the deep chlorophyll maxima may be inherent to 1d models and are not entirely due to the specific oversimplification of the diffusive component applied here the mechanistic surrogate approach also allowed us to identify features in the variables of interest that are likely dominated by the biological module from those controlled by the physics in our case the timing of the peak of the spring bloom was overall well captured by the 1d models figs 8 11 this indicates that this phytoplankton phenological characteristic is well constrained by the observations used during the optimization and sensitive to the choice of parameters optimized 6 2 deciding on a complexity level a number of previous attempts to assess the most appropriate level of ecosystem complexity in models have been inconclusive e g matear 1995 dadou et al 2004 while others argue that there is a humpback relationship between model complexity and performance with intermediate complexity models presenting advantages over both simple and more complex models fulton et al 2003 raick et al 2006 xiao and friedrichs 2014a when models do not have comparable equations and are not optimized differences in their performance are likely related to the parameter selection and functional equations rather than the model structure itself e g sailley et al 2013 in a model assessment study by kriest et al 2010 it was demonstrated that increasing complexity of unoptimized models does not necessarily improve model performance another recent model skill assessment by kwiatkowski et al 2014 found no evidence that biological complexity could consistently improve all aspects of model performance in reproducing observed global scale bulk properties of ocean biogeochemistry the simple models performed better in terms of global spatial pattern correlations of pco2 dissolved inorganic carbon and alkalinity but complex models better captured the monthly and annual variance of dic and correlation coefficients of chlorophyll and primary production kwiatkowski et al 2014 insufficient observational data may make it difficult to justify the use of more complex models over the commonly used nutrient phytoplankton zooplankton detritus npzd model e g matear 1995 bagniewski et al 2011 for example in bagniewski et al 2011 none of the model variants compared could be rejected based on their misfit against constraining observations however they generated significantly different estimates of the unconstrained export carbon fluxes it has also been shown that systematically removing some of the unconstrained aspects of an ecosystem model does not significantly increase the minimum value of the cost metric ward et al 2013 in our results the more complex 11 compartment model m3 is able to generate the lowest model data misfits in all optimization experiments where the intended model structure is preserved similarly a previous comprehensive comparison of 12 individually optimized marine ecosystem models by friedrichs et al 2007 showed that models with multiple phytoplankton groups outperformed the single phytoplankton group models in our results m3 particularly exhibits reduced differences against the observed chlorophyll and nitrate vertical distributions the simpler 7 compartment model structures have a higher cost but are also able to capture the averaged seasonal variations in surface chlorophyll therefore if the objective of a modeling study is to characterize an averaged seasonality in surface chlorophyll a simple model may suffice this is supported by previous optimization studies using npzd models and observational climatologies from the north atlantic that have been able to significantly reduce model data differences kuhn et al 2015 schartau and oschlies 2003a even simpler biological models that do not include explicit representation of phytoplankton and zooplankton have been parameterized and optimized to represent global biogeochemical properties as well as complex models galbraith et al 2015 kriest 2017 in these examples the most complex models analyzed were successfully downscaled by carefully parameterizing all processes omitted in the simplified reduced model galbraith et al 2015 kriest et al 2017 complex models have an obvious utility in the study of specific plankton traits e g kuhn et al 2018 trophic interactions e g d alelio et al 2016 species distribution and diversity e g barton et al 2010 and other complex ecological processes according to our results complex models may also be better able to capture vertical distributions however when applied to a different location than the one it was calibrated for our model with multiple phytoplankton groups tended to maintain chlorophyll magnitude characteristics from its original location one aspect affecting the portability of the multiple phytoplankton model was the use of satellite derived fractionated surface chlorophyll to compare against the simulated chlorophyll of small and large phytoplankton groups the particular satellite fractionation method we used is mainly based on chlorophyll concentrations such that low chlorophyll is interpreted as a dominance of small phytoplankton and high chlorophyll is interpreted a predominant bloom of large phytoplankton if the model was calibrated for a location with low chlorophyll the parameters selected for large phytoplankton may not be adequate for locations with high chlorophyll non overlapping ranges of small and large phytoplankton growth parameters could be configured in the optimization algorithm to correct this problem these results are consistent with geographical portability experiments performed using 1d models for 4 locations in the mid atlantic bight south of our study area xiao and friedrichs 2014b xiao and friedrichs 2014b used a cost function that included satellite derived size fractionated chlorophyll and satellite derived poc in almost all cases when parameters fitted to one location were tested in the other locations the cost increased significantly xiao and friedrichs 2014b nevertheless the use of size fractionated chlorophyll was beneficial and reduced cost when optimizing all locations simultaneously xiao and friedrichs 2014b we also note that when optimizing models with multiple phytoplankton groups the value of a cost function based on total chlorophyll could be misleading some phytoplankton groups may become extinct during the optimization process thus altering the intended model structure here we decided to use an estimate of size fractionated surface chlorophyll the independent constraining of small and large phytoplankton may affect the portability of the more complex model when calibrated for individual locations figs 10 11 as it tends to benefit one phytoplankton group over the other depending on the chlorophyll abundance patterns of the specific locations lower predictive ability in complex models has been posited to occur when the model becomes over fitted to noise in the data friedrichs et al 2006 we show that this indeed can happen when a model with multiple phytoplankton groups becomes too specific to its training data set therefore to benefit from the higher performance of a site based calibrated complex model such calibration requires including samples from all biogeographical provinces to be simulated a similar conclusion was reached by xiao and friedrichs 2014b they found that successful optimization results for 1d models of the mid atlantic bight could be found using size fractionated chlorophyll and particulate organic carbon as long as data from multiple sites was assimilated even so intermediate complexity models performed the best both against assimilated and unassimilated data xiao and friedrichs 2014a in their analysis both the simplest and most complex models typically obtained optimized parameters that were good approximations to the observations at optimized locations were unrealistic parameters and non portable to other locations similarly m2 which had 7 compartments and temperature dependent biological rates showed the highest number of locations that could be replicated well with parameters optimized for a different location fig 10 this suggests that temperature dependency in the biological rates plays a role in model portability hence improving mechanistic interactions rather than introducing unconstrained diversity should be preferred to improve the global applicability of an ecosystem model temperature dependent grazing and mortality rates have been previously noted to improve the performance of global models behrenfeld et al 2013 and this clearly also applies to dynamically complicated regions like the northwest north atlantic finally it is important to note that the performance of m3 could significantly degrade depending on the choice of parameters to be optimized as biological parameter values have the ability to effectively modify the intended trophic interactions in a model cropp and norbury 2009 sailley et al 2013 in our optimization experiments these unintended behaviors included the functional extinctions i e biomass too low to affect model results and total extinctions of plankton groups similar extinctions occur when a local minimum solution is found e g schartau et al 2001 or when no scaling weights are assigned to different locations in the cost function as the optimization becomes biased towards locations with higher biomass and generates extinct functional groups at the locations with lower biomass e g schartau and oschlies 2003a to correct the extinctions schartau et al 2001 introduced zooplankton observations to the cost function without success in finding an optimal parameter solution that replicated the observations well a different case was presented by kriest 2017 where using a wide range for zooplankton parameter values resulted in a solution where zooplankton was almost extinct this undesired behavior was corrected by restricting the range of zooplankton parameters also resulting in a better fit to nutrient and oxygen and more realistic concentrations and fluxes overall kriest 2017 in the absence of parameter boundaries ward et al 2010 obtained optimized parameters with unrealistic negative grazing rates indicative of extinct zooplankton due to the non linear nature of ecosystem models the extinction of one component can have unforeseen however logical consequences for example cropp and norbury 2009 showed that removing the predator of a given prey does not only allow such prey population to increase but can also lead to the extinction of competing prey and their predators and ultimately generate the simulated system s collapse 6 3 limitations and uncertainties the main uncertainty in the use of mechanistic surrogate based calibrations with 1d models is in neglecting horizontal advection fluxes we neglected horizontal advection as is typically done in 1d models assuming that horizontal divergence terms are small relative to the biological sources and sinks this allowed us to have an estimate of how much a 3d application of an oceanographically complex region the northwest north atlantic can be improved with the use of reduced order models several 1d models have been previously used to study locations within or close to our study area being successful at replicating key aspects of biogeochemical variability tian et al 2003 2004 ji et al 2006 song et al 2010 2011 xiao and friedrichs 2014a b in particular based on a cross validation analysis of the results of optimized parameters for 1d models of the mid atlantic bights xiao and friedrichs 2014a were optimistic about the potential use of these parameters in a 3d application for the us eastern continental shelf nonetheless neglecting horizontal advection may impact the surrogate performance hemmings et al 2015 explicitly examined the effect of introducing the horizontal advective flux in a mechanistic emulator composed of 1d models representing the ocean conditions of twelve sites located every 5 degrees latitude along 20 w in the north atlantic their results showed that the addition of horizontal fluxes improved the correlation coefficient between 1d and 3d surface chlorophyll the addition of horizontal advective fluxes in the surrogates is only recommended if the velocities of the target 3d model are accurate otherwise the optimized biological parameters may tend to compensate biases introduced by an erroneous physical forcing in our study some effects of neglecting advective fluxes are compensated by nudging deep nitrate in the surrogates in other approaches like in hemmings et al 2015 the uncertainties of the emulator are evaluated and then used for the cost function in addition to the uncertainties due to unresolved advection there are two main issues with the use of optimized simulations for comparing ecosystem model with different complexities 1 the cost function and 2 the parameters to be optimized the cost function is not an entirely objective measure its design can affect the outcome of the optimizations as we discussed in section 6 2 similarly evans 2003 exemplified that weighting and variable scaling factors applied in the cost function can generate parameters sufficiently different to affect the estimates of biogeochemical fluxes the design of the cost function can also be used to partially compensate the absence of horizontal transport through the addition of correction terms to biological variables losa et al 2004 hemmings and challenor 2012 prießet al 2013a correction terms can also account for other systematic or random errors in the surrogate however as suggested in section 4 1 the more the 1d model is forced to behave like the 3d model the less useful it becomes in identifying the sources of deficiencies in either the physical or the biological components of the model a consideration in the use of correction terms is that the distribution of errors in the 1d and 3d models may vary during the optimization hemmings et al 2015 if correction terms are used a statistical error term may be more robust than a parameter dependent error term hemmings et al 2015 another issue of importance in the design of the optimization cost function is the selection of weights to balance the contributions of different variables and or locations in optimizations with multiple observational data types optimal parameters become a compromise between different biogeochemical conditions and sources of data hence the optimization results are quite sensitive to the scaling approach the lack of any explicit treatment of biases and the weighing scheme used in our cost function are consistent with previous studies e g friedrichs et al 2007 ward et al 2010 however we emphasize the importance of correcting biases between observational data sets of the same simulated variable as we did in the case of surface chlorophyll the use of fractionated chlorophyll to compare against the small and large phytoplankton groups in the design of the cost function influenced the results of our portability experiments this approach was also used by xiao and friedrichs 2014a for optimization experiments in the mid atlantic bight we can expect that advancements in our understanding of how complex ecosystem models behave can be made with the use of other empirical sources of information for the optimization of unconstrained variables for example zooplankton abundances from continuous plankton recorder measurements cannot be directly compared to model results but could provide estimates of seasonal variability lewis et al 2006 that can be scaled to the corresponding simulated zooplankton groups this might be particularly useful since phytoplankton losses are among the least constrained parameters even for simple npzd models e g fennel et al 2001 bagniewski et al 2011 the selection of parameters to optimize is at some level subjective as well and can have a dramatic effect as we have shown here we supported our decision of the target parameters with a sensitivity analysis where the model response to variations in the parameter values withing their corresponding range was tested systematically parameters were ranked according to how much they affected chlorophyll and nitrate i e the same variables available in the observations poorly constrained parameters can be set to arbitrary values during the optimization without significantly affecting the model cost ward et al 2010 or otherwise tend to hit their a priori distribution limits e g schartau and oschlies 2003a when unconstrained parameters are fixed to their a priori estimates the level of previous tuning to the original model domain can skew the results of geographical portability experiments ward et al 2010 in our results models benefit from optimizing a higher number of sensitive parameters e4 vs e5 fig 12 if the number of optimized parameters is further increased and the set contains unconstrained parameters the ability of such optimized complex models to simulate unassimilated observations becomes reduced friedrichs et al 2006 2007 our results thus support that the selection of parameters should be done with consideration of the optimal number of parameters that can be constrained by the observational data 7 conclusions parameter optimization methods offer a systematic approach to reduce subjective model tuning and quantitatively compare ecosystem models with different complexities however optimization is not an entirely objective methodology with a unique solution we have illustrated that in addition to the uncertainties of the physical environment conclusions about the accuracy and portability of a model can differ depending on decisions about the design of the cost function the selection of parameters to be optimized and the level of preliminary calibration of each model due to the limitations of applying parameter optimization in 3d coupled physical biogeochemical models 1d surrogates represent an efficient alternative for the exploration of the parameter space and for geographical portability experiments in an extensive application of this concept we configured ensembles of 1d models to behave as their regional 3d model application counterparts and used them to compare the performance of three ecosystem model versions processes unresolved by the 1d physical models and the level of ecosystem model complexity did affect the accuracy of the surrogates however successful surrogate based model calibrations were possible and generated similar model data misfits when applied in the 1d and 3d environments when an appropriate set of parameters was optimized the model with multiple phytoplankton and zooplankton groups was better able to replicate assimilated observations than the single phytoplankton and zooplankton models nonetheless the simpler models were also able to replicate the observed averaged seasonal variations in surface chlorophyll well these results are consistent with previous studies and suggest that more complex trophic structures in models can better capture the observed temporal variability and spatial distribution of biogeochemical variables at multiple locations in an additional analysis geographical portability experiments provided an indication of how each model structure behaves with respect to unassimilated information in this case the most complex model was found to be the least portable as the parameters optimized at some locations tended to favor either small or large phytoplankton this result is consistent with other studies and with early theoretical notions about the expected behavior of complex models we note that conclusions drawn from portability experiments comparing optimized models with different complexities are strongly affected by the prior degree of calibration of models the number of parameters optimized and the parameter boundaries in the optimization moreover when we varied the selection of optimization parameters in the complex model it was prone to unsatisfactory results and unintended model behaviors attempting to optimize an improper selection of parameters resulted in the extinction of certain plankton groups thus modifying the intended structure of trophic relationships in the model hence we highlight that a guided selection of the parameters to be optimized is necessary especially when as in our case little or no prior model tuning has been performed we also highlight that in order to benefit from the improved ecosystem representation that a complex model provides such model needs to be trained with observations from diverse geographical locations research is required on efficient sampling methodologies to calibrate global surrogates allowing us to determine the number of locations that would be sufficient and ensuring that the most representative locations are being selected finally we also observed an improvement in our simplest model version when all biological fluxes were configured to depend on temperature therefore we can conclude that improving the mechanistic relationships rather than adding unconstrained diversity can lead to more robust globally applicable models here we base this statement on the results of the model including temperature dependency but the same argument may apply to the use of allometric or otherwise scaled and parameterized models as well as to the combined use of temperature and parameterized dependencies a subsequent study will analyze how these optimized model versions perform when applied to the 3d

24016,el niño southern oscillation enso is recognized as one of the potentially predictable drivers of california current system ccs variability in this study we analyze a 67 year coarse resolution 1 simulation using the ocean model cesm pop2 bec forced by ncep ncar reanalysis winds to develop a model composite of the physical biological response of the ccs during enso events the model results are

100m vertically averaged nitrate and oxygen at 200m depth exhibit large scale coherent relationships between physics and the ecosystem including reduced nutrient and plankton concentrations during el niño and increased nutrient and plankton concentrations during la niña however the anomalous model response in temperature chlorophyll and zooplankton is generally much weaker than observed and includes a 1 2 month delay compared to observations we also highlight the asymmetry in the model ccs response where composite model la niña events are stronger and more significant than model el niño events which is a feature previously identified in observations of ccs sst as well as in tropical pacific niño 4 sst where atmospheric teleconnections associated with enso are forced these physical biological composites provide a view of some of the limitations to the potentially predictable impacts of enso teleconnections on the ccs within the modeling framework of cesm pop2 bec keywords enso california current system composite physical biological interactions 1 introduction the california current system ccs is among the most biologically productive oceanic regions of the world e g hickey 1998 checkley and barth 2009 miller et al 2015 the configuration of the wind patterns along this eastern boundary upwelling system ebus favors the existence of a large upwelling region that extends from northern baja california mexico to oregon and washington on the u s west coast e g bakun et al 2015 this phenomenon establishes the environment as a highly productive region that is subject to local variability some of which is imprinted by atmospheric and oceanic teleconnections from remote changes in the equatorial pacific one of the main physical drivers of ccs interannual variability is the el niño southern oscillation enso producing changes in sea surface temperature sst upwelling lateral advection of water masses pycnocline depth surface heat flux freshwater flux eddy kinetic energy and other fields all these variables are known to be forcing agents for ecological conditions and biogeochemical content that affect the state of the ecosystem on enso time scales e g schwing et al 2005 there are two main mechanisms by which enso drives change in the ccs the first local atmospheric variability due to atmospheric teleconnections is related to the intensification of the aleutian low and associated weakening of the north pacific high that enhances poleward flow of warm air along the northeastern pacific niebauer 1988 jacox et al 2015 and suppresses upwelling favorable winds along california coast the second mechanism oceanic variability due to remotely driven waves is related to the equatorial kelvin like waves in the tropical ocean excited by the westerly winds and coupled ocean atmosphere feedbacks during el niño mcphaden et al 1998 these waves propagate eastward across the equatorial pacific and then poleward after colliding with the coast of south america chávez and coauthors 2002 they are also potentially generated along the central american and baja california coasts by subtropical wind fields altered by the tropical ocean conditions the remotely driven wave mechanism also deepens the thermocline and suppresses upwelling of nutrient rich waters both in the equatorial region and along the north american west coast e g frischknecht et al 2015 the combination of local atmospheric and remote oceanic variability imprinted by enso in the ccs plays an important role in understanding the ccs response during these events enso is known to have predictable components some of which may significantly impact the ccs and therefore be exploitable for practical predictions e g jacox et al 2017 while the effects of el niño over land in the u s are well documented gershunov and barnett 1998 mcphaden et al 1998 wang et al 2012 its effects over the ocean are less understood particularly because of limited observations the ccs is unique because it is one of the most extensively sampled ocean regions e g bograd and lynn 2002 crawford et al 2017 with the california cooperative oceanic fisheries investigations calcofi providing hydrographic in situ data since the late 1950s along with various satellite measurements covering the area since the late 1970s there are many studies that address the ecological effects of particular el niño events over the ccs e g bograd and lynn 2001 chávez and coauthors 2002 jacox et al 2016 ohman 2018 using the limited observations that indicate reduction of nutrient and plankton concentrations during warm conditions and vice versa for cold events however because of the sparseness of the data in both space and time there is limited understanding of how consistently these warm and cold enso events impact both the physical and biological state of this region e g di lorenzo and miller 2017 summarize the results of a recent workshop on this topic coupled physical and biogeochemical models represent an important tool for addressing oceanic variability and provide an alternative and complementary approach to using only direct observations for the study of marine ecosystems e g curchitser et al 2013 frischknecht et al 2015 2017 turi et al 2018 analyzing the effects of enso on the ccs over the entire observational record in conjunction with model simulations may help to quantify how consistently the enso events impact the physical and biological system this can also shed light on how well model forecasts of enso variability might be trusted for developing useful outlooks for ecosystem resource management in this study we analyze a 67 year long physical biogeochemical simulation driven by observed surface forcing using the oceanic component of the community earth system model cesm to study the changes associated with el niño and la niña over the ccs we first characterize the model s anomalous ccs enso response as a whole and then develop monthly mean el niño and la niña composites cf turi et al 2018 for various physical and biogeochemical variables after comparing the results with available observations we identify the limitations that can be expected in both the physical and biological regional response to enso events given observed atmospheric forcing and a coarse resolution ocean model although the resolution of this model is coarse it simultaneously includes the effects of physics low trophic level ecology and biogeochemistry which together provide a large scale synergistic perspective on the response compared to what can be assessed with simpler biological models or with observations alone this model analysis approach allows us to better illustrate the limited predictability of the physical biological behavior of the ccs during enso events e

compared over a single point at la jolla ca using observations from the shore stations program http scripps ucsd edu programs shorestations shore stations data during three different el niño events the skewness of enso over the ccs is analyzed qualitatively using probability density functions pdf of ssta derived from the modeled fields over the whole period 1949 2015 and ssta from the hadisst for the same years observed chlorophyll data was obtained from the sea viewing wide field of view sensor seawifs level 3 standard mapped image smi with a monthly temporal resolution and 9 2 km resolution o reilly et al 2000 we used chlorophyll from 1998 to 2010 to compare with the model response for that same period the model chlorophyll fields were averaged down to a depth of 25 m as a proxy to compare with satellite surface chlorophyll concentration that measures over the local oceanic optical depth 2 3 methods the hindcast simulation covers the time period january 1949 to december 2015 to focus on enso related time scales we eliminated the strong signals in the ccs associated with decadal and longer including trends variability from the model fields and the observations we used a lanczos high pass filter with a cutoff frequency of 10 years following turi et al 2018 which successfully removed the low frequency energy in each variable for both model and observations all

as those when ssta 1 0 c where the anomalies persist during both the fall son and winter djf seasons the resulting el niño years included in the 12 month composite are 1951 1952 1957 1958 1963 1964 1965 1966 1968 1969 1972 1973 1982 1983 1986 1987 1987 1988 1991 1992 1994 1995 1997 1998 2002 2003 and 2009 2010 the resulting years for the la niña composite are 1949 1950 1955 1956 1970 1971 1971

validation of sst fields was made via empirical orthogonal function eof analysis of the ssta over the ccs eof1 from the model including all months together and its associated principal component pc1 were compared to the first observed mode from hadisst and correlated with monthly values of noaa s climate prediction center cpc oceanic niño index oni for the composite results presented below a total chlorophyll estimate mg m 3 was calculated as the sum of all three phytoplankton groups averaged over the top 100 m of the water column to include any potential subsurface chlorophyll maximum the same method was applied for zooplankton carbon biomass in mmol m 3 nutrient composites are represented by nitrate concentrations mmol m 3 averaged between 25 m and 100 m depth corresponding to the strong vertical gradient in the nitracline we also compute composite dissolved oxygen concentration mmol m 3 at a single depth of 200 m the analysis was made over the ccs region extending from 21 n to 48 n and from the coast to 132 w anomalies were calculated by subtracting the 12 month climatology from the entire record after high pass filtering the 14 el niño and 15 la niña years as indicated by the ssta were used to build the composite anomalies for sst pycnocline depth using the σ 26 isopycnal surface as a proxy vertically averaged zooplankton biomass vertically averaged chlorophyll concentrations vertically averaged no3 and o2 at 200 m depth which represent key indicators of both physical drivers and ecosystem state the composites were tested for significance via bootstrap analysis as follows a hundred composites were randomly computed for each variable and then compared to the composites of el niño and la niña obtained from the model only those anomalies greater than 2 standard deviations 2 σ of the random distribution are considered to be statistically significant at above the 95 level 3 results 3 1 model validation with sst as a broad scale depiction of the overall interannual response of the ccs to the prescribed forcing fig 1 shows the first mode eof1 of the ssta over ccs calculated from the whole record of the model left panel and hadisst right panel with a 65 6 and a 63 6 of variance explained respectively eof1 in the model dominates the coastal region from southern baja california to oregon showing the coherency between these two regions but extends further offshore than in observations eof1 from hadisst dominates over central and south baja california and it is coherent along baja california and the california coast both in model and observations the first mode of ssta resembles the well known pattern developed during warming related to el niño along the ccs the principal components pc1 associated with the first modes are shown in fig 2 top and middle the pc1 of the model ssta is well correlated 0 94 with pc1 from hadisst and they are both moderately correlated with the cpc oni fig 2 bottom with coefficients of 0 5 hadisst and 0 43 model indicating their relevance as the local imprint of enso teleconnections from the tropics another broad perspective on the performance of the model in representing interannual ccs variability is the monthly ssta c averaged over the ccs region for both the model and observations fig 3 top the correlation between these time series is 0 93 and the rmse is 0 24 indicating a good agreement in both the timing and magnitude of the variability when averaged over the whole region however the model produces a somewhat weaker local response than observed when compared over a single point which will become more apparent in subsequent analyses for example fig 3 bottom also shows the monthly ssta from the model and from the shore stations program at la jolla scripps pier station three of the strongest registered el niño events are shown 1972 1973 1982 1983 and 1997 1998 each one showing the year before and the year after the wintertime peak djf of el niño to compare the development and demise of these major events the model only captures part of the variability of the el niño events in the ccs as indicated by the correlations of 0 70 0 68 0 78 respectively the magnitude of the anomalies is also underestimated for these three major events at this location the coarse model resolution possible errors in surface forcing and errors in model physical formulations limit the model performance in these pointwise evaluations 3 2 lagged correlations of the ccs with enso in order to obtain a broad brush view of the ccs response to enso in the cesm pop2 bec simulation we computed the correlation of the oni in the tropical pacific with the physical biological fields in the ccs at various lags zero to 9 months rather than showing all the lagged correlation results fig 4 shows only the model s 3 month lagged correlation response between observed oni and the pop2 bec fields including all months for ssta pycnocline depth and biogeochemistry over the ccs the 3 month lag was chosen because it is able to simultaneously capture key aspects of both the well developed physical response after the winter peak of the atmospheric teleconnection forcing and the still developing biological response in early spring the results reveal the anticipated basic structure of warming thermocline deepening and decreased nutrient and plankton concentrations along the coast during el niño events e g schwing et al 2005 as expected from previous studies e g alexander et al 2002 turi et al 2018 the maximum correlations of the oni with the ccs response tend to occur at lags of several months ssta exhibits greatest lagged correlations over southern baja california and oregon and weaker ones along the california coast consistent with the coherency shown by eof1 of the model sst the pycnocline depth correlations are more confined to the coastal regions than those for sst which extend further offshore correlations of the biogeochemistry average nitrate concentration from 25 m 100 m and oxygen at 200 m depth are closely related to those shown by the anomalies of the pycnocline depth correlations of 0 m 100 m vertically averaged chlorophyll and zooplankton are highest over southern baja california but still significant up to the central california region the chlorophyll and zooplankton responses shown in detail below expand northward and increase in magnitude later in spring and summer but fail to cover the coast of northern california and oregon where significant enso coherent anomalies are typically observed e g thomas et al 2009 2012 the reasons for this discrepancy are not obvious but may be due to a combination of the errors in the physical circulation as well as to the oversimplified ecosystem formulation 3 3 a composite physical biological enso in the ccs we next examine the response of the whole ccs during enso events using spatially explicit composite anomalies of sst pycnocline depth 0 m 100 m vertically averaged chlorophyll 0 m 100 m vertically averaged zooplankton biomass 25 m 100 m vertically averaged nitrate and oxygen at 200 m depth typically warm cold anomalies related to el niño la niña peak during the winter djf after developing during the previous fall son for sake of simplicity we show only the months in which the enso related sst anomalies are typically the largest each of the field map composite anomalies of sst shows september through december of the pre peak year and january through april of the following year corresponding to the peak and post peak of the event the pycnocline chlorophyll zooplankton biomass no3 and dissolved o2 composite anomalies are shown for january through august of the post peak year because biological variables exhibit their largest enso related signals after the spring bloom 3 3 1 sst and pycnocline depth anomalies the ssta over the ccs fig 5 show the evolution of the model composite el niño during its development in the fall and maturation in the winter the surface of the ocean starts warming during the fall son of the year previous to the peak of the event top panel but anomalies do not become statistically significant until they reach maximum warmer values during fma of the post peak year only in these months is the warming related to el niño significant in the northern california current region in the southern california bight significance levels are only above 1 standard deviation from the bootstrap analysis above 67 but below 95 not shown as expected from the eof and correlation analyses warming also occurs along baja california although it does not reach our level of significance the cool sst that develops far offshore is the eastern extent of the cold central pacific sst that develops during el niño due to the strengthened aleutian low and is associated with the spatial pattern of the pacific decadal oscillation e g newman et al 2016 the evolution of the model composite ssta during la niña fig 6 shows the beginning of the cold phase in late fall of the pre peak year top panel with intense cold anomalies off baja california sur negative anomalies exhibit the coldest temperatures during jfm as shown in the lower panel of fig 6 post peak year note how the sst anomalies related to la niña are significant above 2 standard deviations over broad regions offshore and along the coast in most of the region even during the fall preceding the peak of the cold event in contrast to the el niño model composite la niña develops earlier more strongly and over broader areas than el niño indicating that the response of the ccs is asymmetric e g fiedler and mantua 2017 this asymmetry will be more extensively explored in later sections the composite evolution of observed ssta during el niño and la niña events is shown in figs 7 and 8 respectively composite anomalies from the hadisst record generally show similar spatial patterns to those in the model for both warm and cold events the magnitudes and consequent significance of the anomalies are generally much higher in the observations however especially along the coast of baja california during the peak of warm events in djf we note that the observed composite anomalies also reveal more intense and more significant anomalies during la niña events compared to el niño with the winter after the la niña peak exhibiting a significant cooling of the whole ccs fig 8 this asymmetry is consistent with what was found for the model composite in figs 5 6 the pycnocline depth composite over the ccs was calculated using the σ 26 isopycnal surface as a proxy e g di lorenzo et al 2005 kim and miller 2007 it is typically located between 180 m and 250 m in the model while in nature the depth is often shallower roughly 50 m to 200 m depths e g rudnick et al 2017 as anticipated from the correlation analysis the composite el niño anomalies for the post peak year fig 9 show a deepening of the pycnocline that starts developing during january and february along the coast peaks during the spring and persists into the summer season during la niña fig 10 the reverse occurs in the composite as a significantly shallower thermocline starts developing off the coast of baja california during february and the anomalies intensify during the spring and the summer the ccs pycnocline depth response to enso is mainly confined to the coastal region and at early stages is only significant at southern latitudes in the regions adjacent to the coast this is consistent with what is observed in other studies that also report a latitudinal dependence in the response of the pycnocline jacox et al 2015 frischknecht et al 2015 as well as in other variables such as sea surface height and average temperature of the upper 100 m crawford 2017 a deeper pycnocline is expected over the ccs during el niño due to the southerly wind anomalies acting to suppress upwelling as well as from remotely driven coastally trapped kelvin like waves chávez and messié 2009 jacox et al 2015 frischknecht et al 2015 however the coarse resolution model cannot properly resolve this kelvin like wave propagation effect so that even though the model exhibits deeper shallower values associated with el niño la niña the response can be muted with respect to the observed variability e g hsieh 1983 comparing our results to the data assimilated ocean analysis study of jacox et al 2015 indicates that the enso forced pycnocline response in cesm pop2 is lagged by 1 to 2 months depending on the latitude along the california coast the anomalies of the pycnocline depth reach their peak during the spring march april in the southern ccs and after this season over northern locations jacox et al 2015 also report that the timing of the enso forced minimum depth of the pycnocline depends on latitude but that it varies from march april off central california to june july off the oregon coast the mismatch with the data assimilated product is likely due to the coarse resolution which cannot resolve the upwelling that occurs on the rossby deformation radius scale that ranges from 20 km in the northern ccs coast to 40 km along the southern baja california coast e g chelton et al 1998 these local coastal effects thereby become diluted into broader areas adjacent to the coast where other large scale processes of surface heating advection and open ocean upwelling can interact with that coastally driven response 3 3 2 chlorophyll turning our attention to a biological variable fig 11 shows the composite anomalies of the 0 m 100 m vertically averaged chlorophyll including all 3 phytoplankton groups from january to august of the post peak year of el niño the structures seen in chlorophyll are less organized than for the physical variables as anticipated from the 3 month lagged correlation with the tropical pacific oni fig 4 negative chlorophyll anomalies with small amplitudes of 1 3 of the typical seasonal mean values along the baja california coast are the most consistent feature throughout the post peak composite they turn significantly negative during april off both baja and central ccs and then persist into the summer extending further north through july and august this response is coherent with the timing of the anomalies of the model pycnocline depth and with its latitudinal dependence while pycnocline anomalies show a delay with what is typically observed chlorophyll anomalies occur within the time frame observed by previous studies e g thomas et al 2012 kilpatrick et al 2018 anomalous patches of relatively high chlorophyll are shown at the oregon coast and off shore during january through march but they are not significant and are likely due to errors in the interpolation of the wind forcing near the coastal boundary or errors in the model fig 12 shows the analogous evolution of the composite chlorophyll anomalies during la niña late spring april may and summer months during the post peak year of the composite are dominated by the positive anomalies of chlorophyll 1 3 of typical seasonal mean values showing that the model captures the enhancement of the climatological spring bloom mcgowan et al 2003 kim et al 2009 thomas et al 2012 goebel et al 2010 the composite response of the ccs chlorophyll during la niña is also coherent with the variability of the pycnocline depth and offshore ssta and also shows a latitudinal differentiation negative chlorophyll anomalies prevail off the oregon and washington coasts throughout this post peak period a result that is opposite to what observed although not significant e g fig 7a of thomas et al 2012 indicating potential errors in the model or forcing fields since chlorophyll is computed in the model as a nonlinear relationship involving the three phytoplankton components and other variables e g moore et al 2002 we computed composites of the biomass of diatoms diazotrophs and small phytoplankton separately to determine if any of them behaved more coherently in their response to enso variations both the diatoms and the small phytoplankton exhibited the same basic features seen in the chlorophyll composites the diazotrophs in contrast had very small biomass compared to the other two phytoplankton and were limited spatially to offshore regions in the southern ccs domain therefore the chlorophyll composites give an accurate depiction of the model s ability to represent the large scale coherent phytoplankton biomass response to enso related variations to further explore the model s ability to represent chlorophyll compared to nature the ccs was divided into two sub regions and compared to surface chlorophyll of satellite observations from seawifs two boxes were selected southern ccs is located between 32 38 n and northern ccs between 38 47 n both with an approximate extension of 400 km from the coast the model was averaged down to a depth of 25 m for comparison with the observations that sample an optical depth climatological values of chlorophyll from the period of 1998 2010 are shown in the left panels of fig 13 the model severely underestimates the mean values as indicated by the different y axes scales this is consistent with the analysis of moore et al 2004 their fig 3 who showed very weak mean springtime chlorophyll in the ccs region for bec compared to other areas where the model compared better with satellite observations both the climatological values and the anomalies are one order of magnitude smaller than in observations the seasonal timing of the modeled mean chlorophyll is generally consistent with the observations in the northern part of ccs both peak during wintertime djf and early spring ma and consistently decrease during summertime jja the modeled variability in the southern ccs shows some differences compared to the observed timing particularly during the summer months jja where the modeled values drop down but the observed chlorophyll persists from winter through august surface chlorophyll anomalies from the model in the ccs are in poor agreement with the satellite surface observations over the 1998 2010 time period as indicated by the small and insignificant correlations in both the north and south ccs regions when including all months i e for el niño la niña and neutral conditions together this is in contrast to the composites that reveal coherent signals although very small associated with the warm and cold enso events 3 3 3 nutrients and dissolved oxygen the model composite evolution of no3 anomalies during el niño is shown in fig 14 in contrast with the chlorophyll response that shows marked differences with latitude nitrate concentrations seem to respond uniformly along the ccs during the spring when negative anomalies associated with el niño reach their maximum in the model this variability is very coherent with the timing shown by the anomalies of the pycnocline depth as would be expected from the results of the correlation analysis depleted nutrient concentrations during el niño are consistent with the typically downwelling favorable anomalous wind fields e g jacox et al 2017 consequent deepening of the pycnocline and muted upwelling of source waters the opposite situation occurs during la niña fig 15 when intensified upwelling favors higher no3 that starts to show as early as february in the southern ccs and peaks during the spring over the whole ccs both el niño and la niña composites show anomalies that persist through the summer consistent with chlorophyll anomalies the magnitude of these nitrate anomalies 0 5 mmol m 3 is rather small compared to typical mean values of 20 mmol m 3 but this is to be expected for monthly mean anomalies because of the rapid response time days of phytoplankton in the euphotic zone that results in an equilibrated balance between vertical nutrient flux uptake by phytoplankton and grazing by zooplankton composite dissolved oxygen concentrations at 200 m show patterns similar to the nutrient composites during el niño events the pycnocline is depressed which then acts to push down the oxygen minimum zone in the areas adjacent to the coast resulting in relatively higher dissolved o2 at 200 m fig 16 the opposite situation occurs during la niña events fig 17 when upwelling of isopycnal surfaces shifts the level of minimum oxygen to shallower depths and dissolved o2 is depleted 3 5 mmol m 3 relative to normal conditions 50 mmol m 3 at 200 m the model composites also reveal oxygen anomalies of reversed sign off the coast of washington although they tend to lack statistical significance our results are consistent with those shown by turi et al 2018 where their composites of oxygen at 100 m reveal an increase in dissolved o2 during warm events the response shown by their results is also confined to a coastal band that extends 200 km offshore while most of the deeper ocean shows little response to el niño we emphasize that the composite variability of dissolved oxygen and nutrients represented by the model is limited by the coarse resolution to include only large scale processes and parameterized eddy mixing effects this results in a relatively simple link between the large scale changes imprinted by the enso and the direct effects on nutrients and o2 that are mainly determined by changes in the thermocline depth unresolved mesoscale and submesoscale processes that contribute to lateral and vertical mixing can also play a different and very important role in altering these patterns e g gruber et al 2011 di lorenzo et al 2013 jacox et al 2015 frischknecht et al 2018 which should be explored in additional work 3 3 4 zooplankton fig 18 represents the composite evolution of the post peak year of el niño for the zooplankton group in the model the response resembles the one shown by the chlorophyll anomalies see fig 11 with negative values that are well developed by summer jja but are weaker in winter and early spring the modeled zooplankton also exhibits a stronger and more significant response during la niña fig 19 compared to the composite el niño and positive blooms begin off the coast of baja california during jan feb persisting through the spring and extending further north in the ccs in the summer the magnitude of the zooplankton anomalies coherent with enso in the model is a few percent of the mean background state while some previous studies have shown a rather direct link between enso conditions and zooplankton e g bograd and lynn 2001 fisher et al 2015 one recent study on samples from calcofi cruises suggests that changes in zooplankton community can only be related to el niño at the level of species and individual taxonomic groups although some taxa such as euphausiids and calanoid copepods showed a decline in biomass during el niños 1958 1959 1983 1992 1993 1998 2003 2010 and 2016 total mesozooplankton biomass does not vary consistently lilly and ohman 2018 the same study reports that some of the species of copepods and euphausiids actually decreased in biomass during la niña for years 1951 1956 1965 1989 1999 2000 and 2008 the zooplankton included in the model is a simplified formulation as an aggregate group that includes microzooplankton and mesozooplankton with no representation of a particular group the response of the ccs shown by the composite anomalies seems to be very well defined as negative values during el niño and positive during la niña with a strong correlation to model phytoplankton while observations indicate that zooplankton community is not consistently affected during warm versus cold enso events 4 discussion a physical biologicalocean model hindcast of the time period 1949 2015 was analyzed to establish its skill levels on interannual timescales when compared with available observations and to construct composite el niño and la niña events for the california current system we found that when averaging the model response over the entire ccs it well reproduces the ssta estimated from hadisst when considering smaller regional averages or individual points such as scripps pier the model exhibits less coherency with sst observations and tends to have a lower amplitude much of this disagreement can be ascribed to the coarse resolution 1 of the simulation but issues associated with errors in the surface forcing functions may also be involved for example the interpolation scheme for the winds incorporates winds over land for oceanic grid points adjacent to the coast which can adversely affect the coastal upwelling and offshore wind stress curl fields that provide the dominant forcing of the coastal ocean there are many approaches to identify the effects of enso over the ccs for instance one could treat each enso event individually as has been done previously in many case studies e g bograd and lynn 2001 frischknecht et al 2017 which corresponds to the extreme view that each enso event is totally different from other events due to differing tropical teleconnections or to random variability of the midlatitude weather systems e g deser et al 2018 capotondi et al 2019 but the composite approach is useful to provide a picture of the consistent types of responses that would be expected to be found for a typical event one could alternatively also separate the warm and cold events into finer grained samples e g associated with central pacific vs eastern pacific events e g ashok et al 2007 di lorenzo et al 2010 capotondi et al 2019 or perhaps using some other criterion to create even more groups of warmish or coldish events however as capotondi et al 2015 clearly state there is no strict bimodality evident in the enso distribution which may be more properly defined as a continuum among the many different ways to address the topic we chose a composite approach using 14 warm and 15 cold moderate to large events to give a general view of the ccs response in the cesm pop2 bec simulation the maps of model enso composite anomalies exhibit theirstrongest signals in the post peak winter and spring for sst and pycnocline depth and in the post peak winter through summer for chlorophyll zooplankton biomass no3 and dissolved o2 while sst responds relatively uniformly over the whole north south region of the ccs during model enso events the response of the pycnocline depth and the biogeochemistry shows a latitudinal dependence that was also noted in previous studies using observations and models chenillat et al 2012 jacox et al 2015 crawford et al 2017 oxygen at 200 m is controlled in the model mainly by the physical forcing associated with changes in upwelling and downwelling but we did not explore potential influences of horizontal ocean currents or changes in oxygen solubility the response of the enso composite pycnocline depth in the model is delayed by a period of 1 to 2 months compared to observations e g lynn and simpson 1987 collins et al 2003 jacox et al 2015 more recently crawford 2017 used a multivariate eof analysis of an ocean data assimilation product to show that peak anomalies of the pycnocline depth occur during february over the ccs which is 1 to 2 months earlier than we found here while further study is necessary to explain this delayed isopycnal response in pop2 bec we can speculate about some of the possible mechanisms that may lead to this delay the ocean component of the model is forced by observed winds from reanalysis clearly accounting for the local changes in the pycnocline depth induced by the variability of the local wind stress along the california coast yet the model coarse resolution will suppress e g hsieh 1983 the remotely forced variability of coastal trapped kelvin like waves propagating northward along the coast that affect the pycnocline e g frischknecht et al 2015 additionally the coarse resolution spreads the impact of nearshore wind stress over a broader area thereby reducing the strength of both coastal upwelling and wind stress curl forced upwelling along an eastern boundary song et al 2011 small et al 2015 these various effects may contribute to the delay in upwelling timing but additional work is required to identify the processes that can be improved in the model and should be addressed in future research the composite results for the model biological and chemical variables are dependent on the quality of the physical drivers even with the noted deficiencies of the physical state during enso events coherent signatures of the ecology and biogeochemistry appear in the model composites these variables tend to exhibit their most significant response in conjunction with the model s most consistent pycnocline response which tends to be post peak winter through summer for the enso events this important link between the pycnocline and the modeled ecological response should be further explored in future modeling studies that include much higher resolution in the regional ocean curchitser et al 2013 frischknecht et al 2015 2017 jacox et al 2015 the model composite ccs anomalies during el niño and la niña events reveal an asymmetry in that a stronger and more statistically significant la niña influence on ssta occurs compared to the el niño influence as previously discussed by fiedler and mantua 2017 for observations this asymmetry also occurs prominently in the vertically averaged chlorophyll and zooplankton composite anomalies but is less evident in the isopycnal nitrate and oxygen fields this cold event asymmetry in the ccs is somewhat unexpected since typically el niño events exhibit a stronger ssta in the eastern tropical pacific than la niña rodgers et al 2004 an and jin 2004 levine et al 2016 burgers and stephenson 1999 an aspect related to enso nonlinearities rodgers et al 2004 to further explore this asymmetry fig 20 shows the histograms of modeled left and observed right monthly mean ssta averaged along the coastal region of the ccs for months corresponding to neutral top el niño middle and la niña bottom events the distributions reveal the tendency of the model to produce weaker variability than observations for both neutral years and enso events for both model and observations the ssta events in the ccs that are associated with la niña cluster more consistently around negative values as also discussed by fiedler and mantua 2017 and seen in fig 5g of turi et al 2018 indicating the mean of the distribution shifting below zero in contrast both modeled and observed ccs ssta associated with el niño events although they include the most extreme warming conditions e g mcgowan et al 1998 are often cool or only very weakly warm and are more symmetrically distributed around zero anomaly this results in a mean model el niño composite response that is weaker and less significant than for model la niña events our observed composites from the hadisst also reveal that the asymmetric response favoring la niña is not an artifact of the model this asymmetry is also clearly evident in the ordination diagram of fiedler and mantua 2017 and the mean composite warm and cold events plotted in fig 5g of turi et al 2018 to further study the mechanism behind this asymmetric response we examined whether the asymmetry arises in the tropical pacific or is locally generated by the ccs winds fig 21 top shows histograms of the observed sst anomalies in the central tropical pacific niño 4 region where the teleconnections to the pna pattern are more likely to originate through changes in deep convection e g barsugli and sardeshmukh 2002 alexander et al 2002 the figure shows that the niño 4 sst anomalies for la niña are in fact more consistently cold than el niño conditions are consistently warm this tropical asymmetry has also been discussed in previous studies e g dommenget et al 2013 cai et al 2018 this result suggests that the teleconnections during la niña would more consistently drive cold conditions in the ccs than would el niño events drive warm conditions as found in our model response and in observations this view is further substantiated by inspecting the histograms of meridional winds averaged over the ccs shown in fig 21 bottom as anticipated from the observed tropical pacific niño 4 sst asymmetry the local winds are also more consistently upwelling favorable during la niña conditions and less consistently downwelling favorable during el niño conditions despite the model producing very weak chlorophyll values that are poorly correlated with the time limited monthly mean satellite surface observations the model shows some skill in reproducing the timing of the climatology and the model better represents seasonal chlorophyll variability in the northern region compared to the south in contrast the el niño and la niña composite vertically averaged chlorophyll response is more realistic in the southern parts of the ccs cf thomas et al 2012 composite zooplankton anomalies are essentially phase locked to the chlorophyll field upon which the zooplankton graze this linear relationship is not surprising since the model only has one zooplankton group encompassing both microzooplankton and mesozooplankton and so cannot represent the variety of populations in the ccs since the response of zooplankton to enso events varies by taxonomic group lilly and ohman 2018 increased complexity in the modeled zooplankton is necessary to better represent zooplankton response to enso in the ccs improvements to marine ecosystem formulations via explicit representation of coastal species e g van oostende et al 2018 as well as interannually varying nutrient inputs e g surface runoff in the northern ccs hickey and banas 2008 could significantly improve the biogeochemical model skill in a forced ocean simulation these types of model reformulations should be explored in future studies 5 conclusion we show the composite variability of key physical and biogeochemical variables in the california current system in the framework of the cesm pop2 bec model to develop a better understanding of the effects of enso on the oceanic ecosystem in that model the 67 year long coarse resolution ocean model simulation used for this study captures many of the expected main features related to enso events the physical and biogeochemical processes in the simulation provide a comprehensive depiction of behavior of the system that cannot be obtained from observations alone the simplicity of the composite approach makes it useful for determining the physical changes driven by enso and ascertaining how these changes affect the ecological and biogeochemical state of the model system the results also give a measure of the predictable nature of the model system to forcing by enso as the teleconnected response to remote enso events impacts the local oceanography of the ccs the fidelity of predictions is reduced not only by deficiencies in the model but by local unpredictable processes in both the physics and biology as well the coarse resolution model had significant errors in the physical response to forcing which then cascaded into errors in the forcing that is provided to the ecosystem model higher resolution physical biogeochemical models will help to alleviate some of the model errors but intrinsic variability in both physics and the ecosystem will further reduce the skill of linking enso variations to local physical biological response quantification of these types of skill limits is the long term goal of our research these physical

24016,el niño southern oscillation enso is recognized as one of the potentially predictable drivers of california current system ccs variability in this study we analyze a 67 year coarse resolution 1 simulation using the ocean model cesm pop2 bec forced by ncep ncar reanalysis winds to develop a model composite of the physical biological response of the ccs during enso events the model results are also compared with available observations the composite anomalies for sea surface temperature sst pycnocline depth 0m 100m vertically averaged chlorophyll 0m 100m vertically averaged zooplankton 25m 100m vertically averaged nitrate and oxygen at 200m depth exhibit large scale coherent relationships between physics and the ecosystem including reduced nutrient and plankton concentrations during el niño and increased nutrient and plankton concentrations during la niña however the anomalous model response in temperature chlorophyll and zooplankton is generally much weaker than observed and includes a 1 2 month delay compared to observations we also highlight the asymmetry in the model ccs response where composite model la niña events are stronger and more significant than model el niño events which is a feature previously identified in observations of ccs sst as well as in tropical pacific niño 4 sst where atmospheric teleconnections associated with enso are forced these physical biological composites provide a view of some of the limitations to the potentially predictable impacts of enso teleconnections on the ccs within the modeling framework of cesm pop2 bec keywords enso california current system composite physical biological interactions 1 introduction the california current system ccs is among the most biologically productive oceanic regions of the world e g hickey 1998 checkley and barth 2009 miller et al 2015 the configuration of the wind patterns along this eastern boundary upwelling system ebus favors the existence of a large upwelling region that extends from northern baja california mexico to oregon and washington on the u s west coast e g bakun et al 2015 this phenomenon establishes the environment as a highly productive region that is subject to local variability some of which is imprinted by atmospheric and oceanic teleconnections from remote changes in the equatorial pacific one of the main physical drivers of ccs interannual variability is the el niño southern oscillation enso producing changes in sea surface temperature sst upwelling lateral advection of water masses pycnocline depth surface heat flux freshwater flux eddy kinetic energy and other fields all these variables are known to be forcing agents for ecological conditions and biogeochemical content that affect the state of the ecosystem on enso time scales e g schwing et al 2005 there are two main mechanisms by which enso drives change in the ccs the first local atmospheric variability due to atmospheric teleconnections is related to the intensification of the aleutian low and associated weakening of the north pacific high that enhances poleward flow of warm air along the northeastern pacific niebauer 1988 jacox et al 2015 and suppresses upwelling favorable winds along california coast the second mechanism oceanic variability due to remotely driven waves is related to the equatorial kelvin like waves in the tropical ocean excited by the westerly winds and coupled ocean atmosphere feedbacks during el niño mcphaden et al 1998 these waves propagate eastward across the equatorial pacific and then poleward after colliding with the coast of south america chávez and coauthors 2002 they are also potentially generated along the central american and baja california coasts by subtropical wind fields altered by the tropical ocean conditions the remotely driven wave mechanism also deepens the thermocline and suppresses upwelling of nutrient rich waters both in the equatorial region and along the north american west coast e g frischknecht et al 2015 the combination of local atmospheric and remote oceanic variability imprinted by enso in the ccs plays an important role in understanding the ccs response during these events enso is known to have predictable components some of which may significantly impact the ccs and therefore be exploitable for practical predictions e g jacox et al 2017 while the effects of el niño over land in the u s are well documented gershunov and barnett 1998 mcphaden et al 1998 wang et al 2012 its effects over the ocean are less understood particularly because of limited observations the ccs is unique because it is one of the most extensively sampled ocean regions e g bograd and lynn 2002 crawford et al 2017 with the california cooperative oceanic fisheries investigations calcofi providing hydrographic in situ data since the late 1950s along with various satellite measurements covering the area since the late 1970s there are many studies that address the ecological effects of particular el niño events over the ccs e g bograd and lynn 2001 chávez and coauthors 2002 jacox et al 2016 ohman 2018 using the limited observations that indicate reduction of nutrient and plankton concentrations during warm conditions and vice versa for cold events however because of the sparseness of the data in both space and time there is limited understanding of how consistently these warm and cold enso events impact both the physical and biological state of this region e g di lorenzo and miller 2017 summarize the results of a recent workshop on this topic coupled physical and biogeochemical models represent an important tool for addressing oceanic variability and provide an alternative and complementary approach to using only direct observations for the study of marine ecosystems e g curchitser et al 2013 frischknecht et al 2015 2017 turi et al 2018 analyzing the effects of enso on the ccs over the entire observational record in conjunction with model simulations may help to quantify how consistently the enso events impact the physical and biological system this can also shed light on how well model forecasts of enso variability might be trusted for developing useful outlooks for ecosystem resource management in this study we analyze a 67 year long physical biogeochemical simulation driven by observed surface forcing using the oceanic component of the community earth system model cesm to study the changes associated with el niño and la niña over the ccs we first characterize the model s anomalous ccs enso response as a whole and then develop monthly mean el niño and la niña composites cf turi et al 2018 for various physical and biogeochemical variables after comparing the results with available observations we identify the limitations that can be expected in both the physical and biological regional response to enso events given observed atmospheric forcing and a coarse resolution ocean model although the resolution of this model is coarse it simultaneously includes the effects of physics low trophic level ecology and biogeochemistry which together provide a large scale synergistic perspective on the response compared to what can be assessed with simpler biological models or with observations alone this model analysis approach allows us to better illustrate the limited predictability of the physical biological behavior of the ccs during enso events e

proxy to compare with satellite surface chlorophyll concentration that measures over the local oceanic optical depth 2 3 methods the hindcast simulation covers the time period january 1949 to december

extends further offshore than in observations eof1 from hadisst dominates over central and south baja california and it is coherent along baja california and the california coast both in model and observations the first mode of ssta resembles the well known pattern developed during warming related to el niño along the ccs the principal components pc1 associated with the first modes are shown in fig 2 top and middle the pc1 of the model ssta is well correlated 0 94 with pc1 from hadisst and they are both moderately correlated with the cpc oni fig 2 bottom with coefficients of 0 5 hadisst and 0 43 model indicating their relevance as the local imprint of enso teleconnections from the tropics another broad perspective on the performance of the model in representing interannual ccs variability is the monthly ssta c averaged over the ccs region for both the model and observations fig 3 top the correlation between these time series is 0 93 and the rmse is 0 24 indicating a good agreement in both the timing and magnitude of the variability when averaged over the whole region however the model produces a somewhat weaker local response than observed when compared over a single point which will become more apparent in subsequent analyses for example fig 3 bottom also shows the monthly ssta from the model and from the shore stations program at la jolla scripps pier station three of the strongest registered el niño events are shown 1972 1973 1982 1983 and 1997 1998 each one showing the year before and the year after the wintertime peak djf of el niño to compare the development and demise of these major events the model only captures part of the variability of the el niño events in the ccs as indicated by the correlations of 0 70 0 68 0 78 respectively the magnitude of the anomalies is also underestimated for these three major events at this location the coarse model resolution possible errors in surface forcing and errors in model physical formulations limit the model performance in these pointwise evaluations 3 2 lagged correlations of the ccs with enso in order to obtain a broad brush view of the ccs response to enso in the cesm pop2 bec simulation we computed the correlation of the oni in the tropical pacific with the physical biological fields in the ccs at various lags zero to 9 months rather than showing all the lagged correlation results fig 4 shows only the model s 3 month lagged correlation response between observed oni and the pop2 bec fields including all months for ssta pycnocline depth and biogeochemistry over the ccs the 3 month lag was chosen because it is able to simultaneously capture key aspects of both the well developed physical response after the winter peak of the atmospheric teleconnection forcing and the still developing biological response in early spring the results reveal the anticipated basic structure of warming thermocline deepening and decreased nutrient and plankton concentrations along the coast during el niño events e g schwing et al 2005 as expected from previous studies e g alexander et al 2002 turi et al 2018 the maximum correlations of the oni with the ccs response tend to occur at lags of several months ssta exhibits greatest lagged correlations over southern baja california and oregon and weaker ones along the california coast consistent with the coherency shown by eof1 of the model sst the pycnocline depth correlations are more confined to the coastal regions than those for sst which extend further offshore correlations of the biogeochemistry average nitrate concentration from 25 m 100 m and oxygen at 200 m depth are closely related to those shown by the anomalies of the pycnocline depth correlations of 0 m 100 m vertically averaged chlorophyll and zooplankton are highest over southern baja california but still significant up to the central california region the chlorophyll and zooplankton responses shown in detail below expand northward and increase in magnitude later in spring and summer but fail to cover the coast of northern california and oregon where significant enso coherent anomalies are typically observed e g thomas et al 2009 2012 the reasons for this discrepancy are not obvious but may be due to a combination of the errors in the physical circulation as well as to the oversimplified ecosystem formulation 3 3 a composite physical biological enso in the ccs we next examine the response of the whole ccs during enso events using spatially explicit composite anomalies of sst pycnocline depth 0 m 100 m vertically averaged chlorophyll 0 m 100 m vertically averaged zooplankton biomass 25 m 100 m vertically averaged nitrate and oxygen at 200 m depth typically warm cold anomalies related to el niño la niña peak during the winter djf after developing during the previous fall son for sake of simplicity we show only the months in which the enso related sst anomalies are typically the largest each of the field map composite anomalies of sst shows september through december of the pre peak year and january through april of the following year corresponding to the peak and post peak of the event the pycnocline chlorophyll zooplankton biomass no3 and dissolved o2 composite anomalies are shown for january through august of the post peak year because biological variables exhibit their largest enso related signals after the spring bloom 3 3 1 sst and pycnocline depth anomalies the ssta over the ccs fig 5 show the evolution of the model composite el niño during its development in the fall and maturation in the winter the surface of the ocean starts warming during the fall son of the year previous to the peak of the event top panel but anomalies do not become statistically significant until they reach maximum warmer values during fma of the post peak year only in these months is the warming related to el niño significant in the northern california current region in the southern california bight significance levels are only above 1 standard deviation from the bootstrap analysis above 67 but below 95 not shown as expected from the eof and correlation analyses warming also occurs along baja california although it does not reach our level of significance the cool sst that develops far offshore is the eastern extent of the cold central pacific sst that develops during el niño due to the strengthened aleutian low and is associated with the spatial pattern of the pacific decadal oscillation e g newman et al 2016 the evolution of the model composite ssta during la niña fig 6 shows the beginning of the cold phase in late fall of the pre peak year top panel with intense cold anomalies off baja california sur negative anomalies exhibit the coldest temperatures during jfm as shown in the lower panel of fig 6 post peak year note how the sst anomalies related to la niña are significant above 2 standard deviations over broad regions offshore and along the coast in most of the region even during the fall preceding the peak of the cold event in contrast to the el niño model composite la niña develops earlier more strongly and over broader areas than el niño indicating that the response of the ccs is asymmetric e g fiedler and mantua 2017 this asymmetry will be more extensively explored in later sections the composite evolution of observed ssta during el niño and la niña events is shown in figs 7 and 8 respectively composite anomalies from the hadisst record generally show similar spatial patterns to those in the model for both warm and cold events the magnitudes and consequent significance of the anomalies are generally much higher in the observations however especially along the coast of baja california during the peak of warm events in djf we note that the observed composite anomalies also reveal more intense and more significant anomalies during la niña events compared to el niño with the winter after the la niña peak exhibiting a significant cooling of the whole ccs fig 8 this asymmetry is consistent with what was found for the model composite in figs 5 6 the pycnocline depth composite over the ccs was calculated using the σ 26 isopycnal surface as a proxy e g di lorenzo et al 2005 kim and miller 2007 it is typically located between 180 m and 250 m in the model while in nature the depth is often shallower roughly 50 m to 200 m depths e g rudnick et al 2017 as anticipated from the correlation analysis the composite el niño anomalies for the post peak year fig 9 show a deepening of the pycnocline that starts developing during january and february along the coast peaks during the spring and persists into the summer season during la niña fig 10 the reverse occurs in the composite as a significantly shallower thermocline starts developing off the coast of baja california during february and the anomalies intensify during the spring and the summer the ccs pycnocline depth response to enso is mainly confined to the coastal region and at early stages is only significant at southern latitudes in the regions adjacent to the coast this is consistent with what is observed in other studies that also report a latitudinal dependence in the response of the pycnocline jacox et al 2015 frischknecht et al 2015 as well as in other variables such as sea surface height and average temperature of the upper 100 m crawford 2017 a deeper pycnocline is expected over the ccs during el niño due to the southerly wind anomalies acting to suppress upwelling as well as from remotely driven coastally trapped kelvin like waves chávez and messié 2009 jacox et al 2015 frischknecht et al 2015 however the coarse resolution model cannot properly resolve this kelvin like wave propagation effect so that even though the model exhibits deeper shallower values associated with el niño la niña the response can be muted with respect to the observed variability e g hsieh 1983 comparing our results to the data assimilated ocean analysis study of jacox et al 2015 indicates that the enso forced pycnocline response in cesm pop2 is lagged by 1 to 2 months depending on the latitude along the california coast the anomalies of the pycnocline depth reach their peak during the spring march april in the southern ccs and after this season over northern locations jacox et al 2015 also report that the timing of the enso forced minimum depth of the pycnocline depends on latitude but that it varies from march april off central california to june july off the oregon coast the mismatch with the data assimilated product is likely due to the coarse resolution which cannot resolve the upwelling that occurs on the rossby deformation radius scale that ranges from 20 km in the northern ccs coast to 40 km along the southern baja california coast e g chelton et al 1998 these local coastal effects thereby become diluted into broader areas adjacent to the coast where other large scale processes of surface heating advection and open ocean upwelling can interact with that coastally driven response 3 3 2 chlorophyll turning our attention to a biological variable fig 11 shows the composite anomalies of the 0 m 100 m vertically averaged chlorophyll including all 3 phytoplankton groups from january to august of the post peak year of el niño the structures seen in chlorophyll are less organized than for the physical variables as anticipated from the 3 month lagged correlation with the tropical pacific oni fig 4 negative chlorophyll anomalies with small amplitudes of 1 3 of the typical seasonal mean values along the baja california coast are the most consistent feature throughout the post peak composite they turn significantly negative during april off both baja and central ccs and then persist into the summer extending further north through july and august this response is coherent with the timing of the anomalies of the model pycnocline depth and with its latitudinal dependence while pycnocline anomalies show a delay with what is typically observed chlorophyll anomalies occur within the time frame observed by previous studies e g thomas et al 2012 kilpatrick et al 2018 anomalous patches of relatively high chlorophyll are shown at the oregon coast and off shore during january through march but they are not significant and are likely due to errors in the interpolation of the wind forcing near the coastal boundary or errors in the model fig 12 shows the analogous evolution of the composite chlorophyll anomalies during la niña late spring april may and summer months during the post peak year of the composite are dominated by the positive anomalies of chlorophyll 1 3 of typical seasonal mean values showing that the model captures the enhancement of the climatological spring bloom mcgowan et al 2003 kim et al 2009 thomas et al 2012 goebel et al 2010 the composite response of the ccs chlorophyll during la niña is also coherent with the variability of the pycnocline depth and offshore ssta and also shows a latitudinal differentiation negative chlorophyll anomalies prevail off the oregon and washington coasts throughout this post peak period a result that is opposite to what observed although not significant e g fig 7a of thomas et al 2012 indicating potential errors in the model or forcing fields since chlorophyll is computed in the model as a nonlinear relationship involving the three phytoplankton components and other variables e g moore et al 2002 we computed composites of the biomass of diatoms diazotrophs and small phytoplankton separately to determine if any of them behaved more coherently in their response to enso variations both the diatoms and the small phytoplankton exhibited the same basic features seen in the chlorophyll composites the diazotrophs in contrast had very small biomass compared to the other two phytoplankton and were limited spatially to offshore regions in the southern ccs domain therefore the chlorophyll composites give an accurate depiction of the model s ability to represent the large scale coherent phytoplankton biomass response to enso related variations to further explore the model s ability to represent chlorophyll compared to nature the ccs was divided into two sub regions and compared to surface chlorophyll of satellite observations from seawifs two boxes were selected southern ccs is located between 32 38 n and northern ccs between 38 47 n both with an approximate extension of 400 km from the coast the model was averaged down to a depth of 25 m for comparison with the observations that sample an optical depth climatological values of chlorophyll from the period of 1998 2010 are shown in the left panels of fig 13 the model severely underestimates the mean values as indicated by the different y axes scales this is consistent with the analysis of moore et al 2004 their fig 3 who showed very weak mean springtime chlorophyll in the ccs region for bec compared to other areas where the model compared better with satellite observations both the climatological values and the anomalies are one order of magnitude smaller than in observations the seasonal timing of the modeled mean chlorophyll is generally consistent with the observations in the northern part of ccs both peak during wintertime djf and early spring ma and consistently decrease during summertime jja the modeled variability in the southern ccs shows some differences compared to the observed timing particularly during the summer months jja where the modeled values drop down but the observed chlorophyll persists from winter through august surface chlorophyll anomalies from the model in the ccs are in poor agreement with the satellite surface observations over the 1998 2010 time period as indicated by the small and insignificant correlations in both the north and south ccs regions when including all months i e for el niño la niña and neutral conditions together this is in contrast to the composites that reveal coherent signals although very small associated with the warm and cold enso events 3 3 3 nutrients and dissolved oxygen the model composite evolution of no3 anomalies during el niño is shown in fig 14 in contrast with the chlorophyll response that shows marked differences with latitude nitrate concentrations seem to respond uniformly along the ccs during the spring when negative anomalies associated with el niño reach their maximum in the model this variability is very coherent with the timing shown by the anomalies of the pycnocline depth as would be expected from the results of the correlation analysis depleted nutrient concentrations during el niño are consistent with the typically downwelling favorable anomalous wind fields e g jacox et al 2017 consequent deepening of the pycnocline and muted upwelling of source waters the opposite situation occurs during la niña fig 15 when intensified upwelling favors higher no3 that starts to show as early as february in the southern ccs and peaks during the spring over the whole ccs both el niño and la niña composites show anomalies that persist through the summer consistent with chlorophyll anomalies the magnitude of these nitrate anomalies 0 5 mmol m 3 is rather small compared to typical mean values of 20 mmol m 3 but this is to be expected for monthly mean anomalies because of the rapid response time days of phytoplankton in the euphotic zone that results in an equilibrated balance between vertical nutrient flux uptake by phytoplankton and grazing by zooplankton composite dissolved oxygen concentrations at 200 m show patterns similar to the nutrient composites during el niño events the pycnocline is depressed which then acts to push down the oxygen minimum zone in the areas adjacent to the coast resulting in relatively higher dissolved o2 at 200 m fig 16 the opposite situation occurs during la niña events fig 17 when upwelling of isopycnal surfaces shifts the level of minimum oxygen to shallower depths and dissolved o2 is depleted 3 5 mmol m 3 relative to normal conditions 50 mmol m 3 at 200 m the model composites also reveal oxygen anomalies of reversed sign off the coast of washington although they tend to lack statistical significance our results are consistent with those shown by turi et al 2018 where their composites of oxygen at 100 m reveal an increase in dissolved o2 during warm events the response shown by their results is also confined to a coastal band that extends 200 km offshore while most of the deeper ocean shows little response to el niño we emphasize that the composite variability of dissolved oxygen and nutrients represented by the model is limited by the coarse resolution to include only large scale processes and parameterized eddy mixing effects this results in a relatively simple link between the large scale changes imprinted by the enso and the direct effects on nutrients and o2 that are mainly determined by changes in the thermocline depth unresolved mesoscale and submesoscale processes that contribute to lateral and vertical mixing can also play a different and very important role in altering these patterns e g gruber et al 2011 di lorenzo et al 2013 jacox et al 2015 frischknecht et al 2018 which should be explored in additional work 3 3 4 zooplankton fig 18 represents the composite evolution of the post peak year of el niño for the zooplankton group in the model the response resembles the one shown by the chlorophyll anomalies see fig 11 with negative values that are well developed by summer jja but are weaker in winter and early spring the modeled zooplankton also exhibits a stronger and more significant response during la niña fig 19 compared to the composite el niño and positive blooms begin off the coast of baja california during jan feb persisting through the spring and extending further north in the ccs in the summer the magnitude of the zooplankton anomalies coherent with enso in the model is a few percent of the mean background state while some previous studies have shown a rather direct link between enso conditions and zooplankton e g bograd and lynn 2001 fisher et al 2015 one recent study on samples from calcofi cruises suggests that changes in zooplankton community can only be related to el niño at the level of species and individual taxonomic groups although some taxa such as euphausiids and calanoid copepods showed a decline in biomass during el niños 1958 1959 1983 1992 1993 1998 2003 2010 and 2016 total mesozooplankton biomass does not vary consistently lilly and ohman 2018 the same study reports that some of the species of copepods and euphausiids actually decreased in biomass during la niña for years 1951 1956 1965 1989 1999 2000 and 2008 the zooplankton included in the model is a simplified formulation as an aggregate group that includes microzooplankton and mesozooplankton with no representation of a particular group the response of the ccs shown by the composite anomalies seems to be very well defined as negative values during el niño and positive during la niña with a strong correlation to model phytoplankton while observations indicate that zooplankton community is not consistently affected during warm versus cold enso events 4 discussion a physical biologicalocean model hindcast of the time period 1949 2015 was analyzed to establish its skill levels on interannual timescales when compared with available observations and to construct composite el niño and la niña events for the california current system we found that when averaging the model response over the entire ccs it well reproduces the ssta estimated from hadisst when considering smaller regional averages or individual points such as scripps pier the model exhibits less coherency with sst observations and tends to have a lower amplitude much of this disagreement can be ascribed to the coarse resolution 1 of the simulation but issues associated with errors in the surface forcing functions may also be involved for example the interpolation scheme for the winds incorporates winds over land for oceanic grid points adjacent to the coast which can adversely affect the coastal upwelling and offshore wind stress curl fields that provide the dominant forcing of the coastal ocean there are many approaches to identify the effects of enso over the ccs for instance one could treat each enso event individually as has been done previously in many case studies e g bograd and lynn 2001 frischknecht et al 2017 which corresponds to the extreme view that each enso event is totally different from other events due to differing tropical teleconnections or to random variability of the midlatitude weather systems e g deser et al 2018 capotondi et al 2019 but the composite approach is useful to provide a picture of the consistent types of responses that would be expected to be found for a typical event one could alternatively also separate the warm and cold events into finer grained samples e g associated with central pacific vs eastern pacific events e g ashok et al 2007 di lorenzo et al 2010 capotondi et al 2019 or perhaps using some other criterion to create even more groups of warmish or coldish events however as capotondi et al 2015 clearly state there is no strict bimodality evident in the enso distribution which may be more properly defined as a continuum among the many different ways to address the topic we chose a composite approach using 14 warm and 15 cold moderate to large events to give a general view of the ccs response in the cesm pop2 bec simulation the maps of model enso composite anomalies exhibit theirstrongest signals in the post peak winter and spring for sst and pycnocline depth and in the post peak winter through summer for chlorophyll zooplankton biomass no3 and dissolved o2 while sst responds relatively uniformly over the whole north south region of the ccs during model enso events the response of the pycnocline depth and the biogeochemistry shows a latitudinal dependence that was also noted in previous studies using observations and models chenillat et al 2012 jacox et al 2015 crawford et al 2017 oxygen at 200 m is controlled in the model mainly by the physical forcing associated with changes in upwelling and downwelling but we did not explore potential influences of horizontal ocean currents or changes in oxygen solubility the response of the enso composite pycnocline depth in the model is delayed by a period of 1 to 2 months compared to observations e g lynn and simpson 1987 collins et al 2003 jacox et al 2015 more recently crawford 2017 used a multivariate eof analysis of an ocean data assimilation product to show that peak anomalies of the pycnocline depth occur during february over the ccs which is 1 to 2 months earlier than we found here while further study is necessary to explain this delayed isopycnal response in pop2 bec we can speculate about some of the possible mechanisms that may lead to this delay the ocean component of the model is forced by observed winds from reanalysis clearly accounting for the local changes in the pycnocline depth induced by the variability of the local wind stress along the california coast yet the model coarse resolution will suppress e g hsieh 1983 the remotely forced variability of coastal trapped kelvin like waves propagating northward along the coast that affect the pycnocline e g frischknecht et al 2015 additionally the coarse resolution spreads the impact of nearshore wind stress over a broader area thereby reducing the strength of both coastal upwelling and wind stress curl forced upwelling along an eastern boundary song et al 2011 small et al 2015 these various effects may contribute to the delay in upwelling timing but additional work is required to identify the processes that can be improved in the model and should be addressed in future research the composite results for the model biological and chemical variables are dependent on the quality of the physical drivers even with the noted deficiencies of the physical state during enso events coherent signatures of the ecology and biogeochemistry appear in the model composites these variables tend to exhibit their most significant response in conjunction with the model s most consistent pycnocline response which tends to be post peak winter through summer for the enso events this important link between the pycnocline and the modeled ecological response should be further explored in future modeling studies that include much higher resolution in the regional ocean curchitser et al 2013 frischknecht et al 2015 2017 jacox et al 2015 the model composite ccs anomalies during el niño and la niña events reveal an asymmetry in that a stronger and more statistically significant la niña influence on ssta occurs compared to the el niño influence as previously discussed by fiedler and mantua 2017 for observations this asymmetry also occurs prominently in the vertically averaged chlorophyll and zooplankton composite anomalies but is less evident in the isopycnal nitrate and oxygen fields this cold event asymmetry in the ccs is somewhat unexpected since typically el niño events exhibit a stronger ssta in the eastern tropical pacific than la niña rodgers et al 2004 an and jin 2004 levine et al 2016 burgers and stephenson 1999 an aspect related to enso nonlinearities rodgers et al 2004 to further explore this asymmetry fig 20 shows the histograms of modeled left and observed right monthly mean ssta averaged along the coastal region of the ccs for months corresponding to neutral top el niño middle and la niña bottom events the distributions reveal the tendency of the model to produce weaker variability than observations for both neutral years and enso events for both model and observations the ssta events in the ccs that are associated with la niña cluster more consistently around negative values as also discussed by fiedler and mantua 2017 and seen in fig 5g of turi et al 2018 indicating the mean of the distribution shifting below zero in contrast both modeled and observed ccs ssta associated with el niño events although they include the most extreme warming conditions e g mcgowan et al 1998 are often cool or only very weakly warm and are more symmetrically distributed around zero anomaly this results in a mean model el niño composite response that is weaker and less significant than for model la niña events our observed composites from the hadisst also reveal that the asymmetric response favoring la niña is not an artifact of the model this asymmetry is also clearly evident in the ordination diagram of fiedler and mantua 2017 and the mean composite warm and cold events plotted in fig 5g of turi et al 2018 to further study the mechanism behind this asymmetric response we examined whether the asymmetry arises in the tropical pacific or is locally generated by the ccs winds fig 21 top shows histograms of the observed sst anomalies in the central tropical pacific niño 4 region where the teleconnections to the pna pattern are more likely to originate through changes in deep convection e g barsugli and sardeshmukh 2002 alexander et al 2002 the figure shows that the niño 4 sst anomalies for la niña are in fact more consistently cold than el niño conditions are consistently warm this tropical asymmetry has also been discussed in previous studies e g dommenget et al 2013 cai et al 2018 this result suggests that the teleconnections during la niña would more consistently drive cold conditions in the ccs than would el niño events drive warm conditions as found in our model response and in observations this view is further substantiated by inspecting the histograms of meridional winds averaged over the ccs shown in fig 21 bottom as anticipated from the observed tropical pacific niño 4 sst asymmetry the local winds are also more consistently upwelling favorable during la niña conditions and less consistently downwelling favorable during el niño conditions despite the model producing very weak chlorophyll values that are poorly correlated with the time limited monthly mean satellite surface observations the model shows some skill in reproducing the timing of the climatology and the model better represents seasonal chlorophyll variability in the northern region compared to the south in contrast the el niño and la niña composite vertically averaged chlorophyll response is more realistic in the southern parts of the ccs cf thomas et al 2012 composite zooplankton anomalies are essentially phase locked to the chlorophyll field upon which the zooplankton graze this linear relationship is not surprising since the model only has one zooplankton group encompassing both microzooplankton and mesozooplankton and so cannot represent the variety of populations in the ccs since the response of zooplankton to enso events varies by taxonomic group lilly and ohman 2018 increased complexity in the modeled zooplankton is necessary to better represent zooplankton response to enso in the ccs improvements to marine ecosystem formulations via explicit representation of coastal species e g van oostende et al 2018 as well as interannually varying nutrient inputs e g surface runoff in the northern ccs hickey and banas 2008 could significantly improve the biogeochemical model skill in a forced ocean simulation these types of model reformulations should be explored in future studies 5 conclusion we show the composite variability of key physical and biogeochemical variables in the california current system in the framework of the cesm pop2 bec model to develop a better understanding of the effects of enso on the oceanic ecosystem in that model the 67 year long coarse resolution ocean model simulation used for this study captures many of the expected main features related to enso events the physical and biogeochemical processes in the simulation provide a comprehensive depiction of behavior of the system that cannot be obtained from observations alone the simplicity of the composite approach makes it useful for determining the physical changes driven by enso and ascertaining how these changes affect the ecological and biogeochemical state of the model system the results also give a measure of the predictable nature of the model system to forcing by enso as the teleconnected response to remote enso events impacts the local oceanography of the ccs the fidelity of predictions is reduced not only by deficiencies in the model but by local unpredictable processes in both the physics and biology as well the coarse resolution model had significant errors in the physical response to forcing which then cascaded into errors in the forcing that is provided to the ecosystem model higher resolution physical biogeochemical models will help to alleviate some of the model errors but intrinsic variability in both physics and the ecosystem will further reduce the skill of linking enso variations to local physical biological response quantification of these types of skill limits is the long term goal of our research these physical

24017,ciutadella menorca balearic islands spain is well known for the large amplitude seiches of about 10 5 min period registered in its long and narrow inlet especially during the warm season this phenomenon locally referred to as rissaga might reach extreme wave heights in the range 1 5 4 m with a recurrence of only a few years leading to damaging consequences in the port activities and moored vessels the provision of as accurate as possible predictions of the rissaga risk hours or days ahead appears as a crucial element in helping to mitigate these consequences we devise a chain of atmospheric and oceanic numerical simulation components aimed at capturing with low computational cost the key physical processes conducive to the vast majority of rissaga events i the genesis upstream from the balearic islands of high amplitude atmospheric gravity waves travelling in the sw ne direction these mesoscale waves are synthetically triggered using a 2d nonhydrostatic fully compressible model within a vertical environment provided by a representative sounding ii the oceanic response to the concomitant pressure fluctuations along the menorca channel in the form of long oceanic waves subject to proudman resonance these processes are simulated with a shallow water model applied over a 80 m depth channel iii shelf amplification which according to theory green s law accounts for a doubling of the wave amplitude for a depth jump from 80 to 5 m and iv harbour resonance within ciutadella inlet a crucial mechanism solved again with the shallow water equations over the idealized 5 m deep channel the prognostic system is successfully tested for the available set of 126 rissaga events and for a complementary set of 549 ordinary situations our approach discriminates fairly well non rissaga events from high amplitude oscillations and tends to correctly categorize the meteotsunamis among weak moderate or strong events we are now pursuing the real time application of the method in a probabilistic context 1 introduction and physical mechanisms meteotsunamis or atmospherically induced high frequency sea level variations oscillation periods in the range of minutes monserrat et al 2006 are known to have hit coasts all around the world especially in bays with high amplification factor or narrow harbours where the local seiches can more easily resonate with the external forcing and develop large amplitudes rabinovich 2009 wherever and whenever this phenomenon interacts with humans it will pose a hazard to our activities pattiaratchi and wijeratne 2015 destructive meteotsunamis i e with effects comparable to their seismic counterparts are certainly exceptional and seem to be the result of optimal combinations of atmospheric sources of appropriate in both amplitude and time scale sea level pressure fluctuations with resonant mechanisms unfolded during the oceanic phase of the episode as for most of extreme phenomena of natural origin it is the geographical context and notably in this case the topographies of the sea floor and coastal feature what determines the meteotsunami prone areas globally one of such places is the ciutadella harbour in menorca balearic islands spain right in the centre of the western mediterranean sea ramis and jansà 1983 rabinovich and monserrat 1998 during most active years ciutadella will experience several rissaga 1 1 risssaga is the local name for a meteotsunami in ciutadella the phenomenon is most common during the warm season may to september events of about 100 cm wave height crest to trough difference with oscillation periods close to 10 5 min this is the fundamental period of the seiche in a long narrow rectangular and semiclosed basin wilson 1972 with the characteristics of ciutadella harbour 1 1 km length 80 m width and 5 m depth see fig 1 in extreme cases on average every 5 10 years these oscillations can reach several metres like the event of 15 june 2006 with 400 cm wave height the most violent manifestation of a rissaga reported during the last decades jansà et al 2007 closely followed by the meteotsunami of 21 june 1984 350 cm in this sense ciutadella readily competes with other singular territories where this kind of extreme atmospherically induced ocean waves in the tsunami frequency band have also been reported e g nagasaki bay japan with its abiki phenomenon hibiya and kajiura 1982 and the vast geographically complex eastern adriatic coast of croatia historically impinged by several destructive meteotsunamis vilibić and šepić 2009 for a more general context of the problem see adams selin and johnson 2010 and pattiaratchi and wijeratne 2015 obviously the strong currents induced by even moderate oscillations of sea level within the ciutadella harbour become highly disruptive for the normal operations of the port in the most severe cases like the june 1984 and june 2006 events in only 5 min the state of the port switches between a dry bed near the closed end of the harbour and enormous water levels that flood contiguous areas and break moorings leaving the vessels adrift any step towards a better prediction of the rissaga phenomenon has the potential to help anticipating these effects hours or days in advance and thus the adoption of proportional measures of protection the fundamental processes leading to meteotsunami generation over the mediterranean and black sea regions were nicely illustrated by šepić et al 2015 the chain of atmospheric oceanic mechanisms see the well known fig 4 of that paper is certainly applicable to the majority of rissaga events first pressure fluctuations of enough entity a few hpa and short time periods several minutes are generated at sea level via the tropospheric ducting of internal gravity waves lindzen and tung 1976 monserrat and thorpe 1996 for the trapping and propagation of these waves without significant vertical energy loss and dissipation an upward transition in a highly sheared environment from a layer with large static stability even with a thermal inversion to steep mid tropospheric lapse rates becomes necessary in these circumstances an unstable atmospheric layer in terms of the richardson number ri 0 25 that might contain a critical steering level will overlie a stable layer ri 0 25 and the surface manifestation of the atmospheric gravity waves would take the form of noticeable pressure variations for the specific case of ciutadella the required basic current and strong unidirectional wind shear across the tropospheric column should be preferentially from the w sw direction as this is the orientation of the inlet fig 1 at synoptic scale all the previous conditions are linked to the presence of a relatively cold upper level trough to the west of the balearics simultaneous with or shortly preceded by a weak circulation from the southern sector at low levels that brings a surge of warm african air and a strong temperature inversion over the western mediterranean waters ramis and jansà 1983 in fact the surveillance of such synoptic pattern most frequent during the warm season forms the basis of an empirically based rissaga warning system currently operational at the national weather service of spain aemet the reliability of these warnings improves for the short term when clear signals of gravity wave activity can be confirmed on satellite images i e propagation of elongated southwesterly plumes of cloud bands aligned in the transverse direction although quantitative estimations of the possible rissaga generally remain elusive a real example of a perfect combination of atmospheric ingredients as observed by the regional sounding launched at palma de mallorca station 100 km upstream from menorca see fig 1 is shown in fig 2 for the june 1984 event rapid sea level atmospheric oscillations sometimes lasting several hours might include singular pressure jumps in response to more intense phases of gravity wave activity paxton and sobien 1998 or such pressure jumps are simply the consequence of other kinds of meteorological disturbances jansà et al 2007 e g the northeastward propagation of a mesoscale convective system mcs including small squall lines a crucial element for some of the largest sea level oscillations observed in ciutadella the role of mcs surface pressure anomalies as a trigger of meteotsunamis has been exhaustively documented in other places thanks to the continuous information provided by rich observing systems e g for the june 13th 2013 events along the us east coast wertman et al 2014 bailey et al 2014 to the point that an early warning of mcs generated tsunamis is revealed as a feasible task wherever a detailed monitoring of these anomalies is possible with the available data in our experience the occasional formation of a mcs during rissaga situations is just another symptom of the occurrence of greatly amplified gravity waves specifically for the abovementioned record breaking event of 15 june 2006 where the passage of a mcs with its characteristic pressure jump during the evening was crucial jansà et al 2007 atmospheric gravity waves and moderate sea level oscillations of around 100 cm had been observed all day long the air mass evolved from thermodynamic and kinematic profiles at the beginning of the day similar to those shown in fig 2 into an afternoon environment with greatly reduced convective inhibition and large cape aprox 2000 j kg for the parcels located right above the inversion soundings not shown thus allowing the gravity waves to release this convective energy equilibrium response to surface pressure variations of only a few hpa cannot directly explain large oscillations of the sea level inverted barometer principle would account for an equivalent of nothing more than few centimetres anomalously amplified harbour seiches at ciutadella are known to be mainly associated with the external forcing provided by long ocean waves travelling northeastward in the open sea between mallorca and menorca ramis and jansà 1983 marcos et al 2009 these waves with periods predominantly in the range of 5 50 min are driven by the atmospheric disturbance but in order to become effective they must gain enough amplitude when impinging on the mouth of the harbour the previous conceptual model by šepić et al 2015 emphasizes the proudman resonance proudman 1929 and shelf amplification due to shoaling green 1838 as the leading mechanisms for this crucial stage of the phenomenon proudman resonance is due to the matching of the long ocean waves speed 25 30 m s 1 for a depth of about 80 m between the islands and the propagation speed of the precursor atmospheric gravity wave shoaling effects for a depth transition from 80 m in the channel to 5 m of the harbour would mean doubling the wave amplitude according to green s law together both mechanisms could feasibly build ocean wave amplitudes of several tens of cm after the 50 km path separating the islands fig 1 and to practically 1 m in most extreme cases finally the last and most evident step of the šepić et al 2015 physical scheme for a rissaga generation is the harbour resonance due to matching of the frequency of incoming long ocean waves and harbour eigenperiods periods close to the fundamental mode of 10 5 min will generally be the most effective for generating rissagas in ciutadella under an optimal sequence of the outlined atmosphere ocean processes in terms of their attributes amplitudes frequencies and propagation speeds incoming ocean waves can be amplified more than 100 times before hitting ciutadella coast entailing a destructive meteotsunami in principle a modelling system suited for quantitative rissaga forecasts will need some type of formulation of the above generation mechanisms and their complex interactions for the ocean a simple shallow water model for instance may suffice to represent the dynamics and amplification of the long ocean waves provided the atmospheric coupling and resonant mechanisms are accounted for the inclusion of several kinds of resonances in semi idealized numerical frameworks is uncomplicated and has been exploited profusely in the literature in order to analyse the role of these processes in real systems e g with one of such models vennell 2010 investigates the resonance and trapping of topographic transient ocean waves by prescribing a moving atmospheric disturbance bubalo et al 2018 simulates chrystal and proudman resonances in a closed rectangular basin with two finite element and one finite difference ocean models and vilibić 2008 designs numerical modelling exercises with various sinusoidal air pressure disturbances to reproduce the proudman resonance on a shelf drawing illuminating conclusions about the genesis of destructive meteotsunami events regarding the atmospheric component of the modelling system realistic representations of internal gravity waves or other precursor atmospheric disturbances is more demanding but it is also practicable with a good investment in resolution and appropriate versions of the primitive nonlinear hydrodynamic equations e g stephan et al 2016 in this work we devise a pragmatic and computationally inexpensive numerical approach aimed at predicting the occurrence and magnitude of meteotsunamis in ciutadella harbour the idea is to retain exclusively the physical mechanisms pointed out by šepić et al 2015 and the consideration of contexts as simple as possible e g initialization with a single radiosounding and use of 2d geometries and flat bottom topography the method involves the application of the nonhydrostatic fully compressible equations for the atmospheric part and the adaptation of the shallow water equations to simulate the oceanic response we propose this strategy for the moment for a dry atmosphere as an effective and affordable method that avoids the application of full 3d high resolution atmosphere ocean coupled models where meteotsunami generation processes are supposed to emerge and combine naturally that is the case specifically of the sophisticated socib brifs rissaga forecasting system 2 2 see http www socib es index php seccion modelling facility rissagaforecast operational at the balearic islands the system was described and successfully tested for the june 2006 meteotsunami event by renault et al 2011 last years experience with brifs reveals its good skill to recognize rissaga situations but a clear tendency to underestimate the wave height a jansà personal communication the characteristics of our three step methodology are described in section 2 in first place we present the atmospheric component responsible for the generation and propagation of gravity waves 2 1 in second place the menorca channel submodel aimed at driving the long ocean waves and their possible amplification via proudman and shoaling processes 2 2 and finally the model application to ciutadella inlet in order to incorporate the harbour resonance mechanism 2 3 key features of the new construct will be illustrated with reference to the 21 june 1984 case study that is through the results obtained after feeding the technique with the environmental characteristics of the sounding of fig 2 in section 3 we summarize the statistical performance of the prognostic system based on its application to the available set of historical rissaga events and to a contrasting collection of non rissaga days section 3 1 section 3 2 outlines its skill when it comes to differentiating categories of practical interest finally section 4 will contain the main conclusions of the study and some hints for short and mid term research 2 methodology description 21 june 1984 case study 2 1 atmospheric component gravity wave generation the atmospheric model of our prognostic system uses one of the traditional equation sets that govern the dynamics of a nonhydrostatic fully compressible atmosphere see giraldo and restelly 2008 in two dimensions x z these equations are written as π t u π x w π z w π z r c v π π u x w z θ t u θ x w θ z w θ z u t u u x w u z c p θ θ π x w t u w x w w z c p θ θ π z g θ θ where besides the tendencies for the wind in the vertical plane u w predictive equations for exner pressure and potential temperature perturbations π θ appear these perturbations are defined with respect to a reference state indicated with overbars that depends on height only and is in hydrostatic balance in addition to the inviscid flow conditions that define the above form of the euler equations our simplified atmosphere is dry and adiabatic that is no other physical processes explicit or parameterized apart from basic hydro and thermo dynamics are formulated 3 3 truly speaking some amount of mixing of the prognostic fields is implicitly incorporated in the solution owing to the numerical formulation of the advective terms see text explicit diffusion terms or filters are not needed in our model to guarantee a good behaviour of the numerical solution note we also omit coriolis and curvature terms in summary all these possible influences are considered irrelevant or at least of second order for gravity wave driven rissaga events from the initial conditions the system of equations is integrated using a forward in time splitting method e g wicker and skamarock 1998 that is using two time levels and considering a large time step for the horizontal and vertical advection slow terms and a short time step for the other terms appearing on the right side of the equations the formulation of these latter fast terms uses standard second order finite difference spatial operators and in time applies a forward backward scheme mass equations are updated first then followed by wind equations that proceeds through an intermediate point of the short time interval according to a second order runge kutta rk2 cycle a thorough review of the concepts and benefits of these numerical strategies can be found in durran 2010 regarding the advection terms these are integrated over the large time step typically 6 10 times longer than previous δ t in the rectangular x z grid following a reconstruct evolve average rea philosophy inspired by the finite volume methods point of view see leveque 2002 specifically a rea algorithm with piecewise linear reconstruction is applied in the vertical direction and then in the horizontal dimensional splitting as follows i for each grid cell segment a linear profile of the field is reconstructed using the central grid point value and an adequate choice for the slope or gradient in that direction r step ii this profile evolves conservatively i e the segment is translated along the corresponding direction and possibly stretches shrinks by the action of the velocity components found at segment edges e step and iii the new grid point values resulting from the advection process are calculated by averaging within the cell limits all segments i e their profiles that totally or partially remained or entered the cell a step note we do not apply any type of staggering of variables in our model that is all prognostic fields u w π θ are defined at the same grid points as consequence wind components at segment edges necessary for the e step are approximated using the two contiguous cells what exactly defines the numerical behaviour of the rea scheme is the particular choice of the slope for the r step for instance a zero slope yields a scheme equivalent to the first order upwind method known for correctly preserving the monotonicity of the solution but inducing an unacceptable degree of dissipation slopes consistent with popular second or higher order methods can also be defined but then other characteristic problems of these schemes like phase error and oscillatory contamination of the solution can easily emerge the previous pathologies can be greatly reduced by using slope limiter methods a synonym term for the flux limiting strategy distinctive of the high resolution finite volume methods leveque 2002 among the large family of these specially defined and local solution dependent slopes and guided by several advection tests not shown we found the monotonized central difference limiter mc limiter van leer 1977 as the most suitable choice additionally we allow in our model a vertical stretching of the grid cells with the purpose of placing more resolution at low levels where it is needed to properly resolve the complexities of the thermal structure e g the sharp vertical gradients of stability seen in the sounding of fig 2 but the use of too short δ z would severely restrict the maximum time step compatible with numerical stability in order to circumvent this problem acoustic vertical modes linked to z w and z π terms in the first and last equations respectively are stabilized with an implicit formulation of these derivatives in the finite difference form of the temporal integration this is a common practice in numerical codes of elastic models e g skamarock et al 2008 and basically means that the cfl criterion behind the maximum allowable time step will now be determined exclusively in terms of the horizontal grid length δ x we subjected our model to several benchmark tests found in the literature some of these tests involve the simulation of thermal bubbles as an example fig 3a shows the same four stages of the exercise proposed by robert 1993 regarding the interaction of a rising large warm bubble and a descending small cold bubble introduced in a calm and neutrally stable environment times shown are 0 4 7 and 10 min as in fig 9 of the above paper another well known test is a density current simulation initialized with a strong cold anomaly embedded in the same kind of environment straka et al 1993 our fig 3b shows again the θ evolution half domain only at exactly the same moments of the straka et al experiment 0 5 10 and 15 min compare with their fig 1 our model also passed mountain wave tests after activating a topographic bottom boundary condition and a gravity wave absorbing layer towards the upper troposphere and above rayleigh damping term added to w equation klemp et al 2008 the schär et al 2002 test for instance analyses the stationary response of a uniform westerly current 10 m s 1 with constant stratification brunt väisälä frequency n 0 01 s 1 to the presence of a 250 m height mountain possessing an analytical profile composed of a bell shaped envelope combined with shorter scale cosine shaped components see fig 3c where the w field is shown with a contour interval of 0 05 m s 1 the solution for this mountain wave is very interesting as it contains a mixture of a larger scale hydrostatic wave with deep propagation in the vertical and smaller scale nonhydrostatic waves rapidly decaying with height this output can be directly compared with other model simulations and with the analytical solution see fig 13 of schär et al 2002 our final illustrative example deals with the simulation of an intense mountain wave excided by sierra nevada range ca usa under the impingement of a flow that is initialized using a real upstream sounding taken during the t rex observational campaign doyle et al 2011 nonlinearities and transient features are highly influential in this case and no stationary state is reached but persistent features in this simulation fig 3d are the downslope windstorm conditions and hydraulic jump found at low levels along the eastern slope and the profound wave breaking occurring aloft these structures have been represented after 4 h of simulation exactly in the same way as in the model intercomparison composite contained in fig 5 of doyle et al 2011 black contours display the potential temperature field at intervals of 10 k and colour indicates the horizontal perturbation wind component interval of 5 m s 1 and 5 m s 1 for red and blue areas respectively based on these and several other comparison exercises including tests with the three dimensional version of the code we can easily conclude that our model performs at least as well as state of the art modelling systems with regard to the specific application to the rissaga problem the model is initialized with a horizontally homogeneous basic state π θ u imported from the representative palma sounding fig 2 for the case study and runs for a 12 h period the simulation uses a non orographic domain extended along the relevant direction namely the sw ne axis oriented 30 with respect to the zonal direction dashed line in fig 1 thus the sounding winds are first projected along such direction to build the initial u profile to avoid any spurious contamination of the results with boundary artefacts our model includes a proper scheme for the relaxation of the inner solution towards the basic state imposed at the lateral boundaries davies and turner 1977 in addition we use a long enough domain of 300 km ciutadella lies at the central point of this length in the vertical the domain extends till 20 km height the horizontal resolution is δ x 300 m while in the vertical it varies gradually from δ z 20 m at sea level to 180 m at the uppermost computational layers a critical issue of the method is how to excite the gravity waves in the simulation so as to allow the environmental characteristics shear and stability profiles to govern their downstream propagation amplification or dissipation triggering mechanisms that are naturally ubiquitous in the real atmosphere are absent in our highly synthetic and simplified context we found an effective way of introducing the atmospheric disturbances in the domain by resorting to the left boundary condition for the w field a gaussian shaped vertical profile of downward motion centred at a height of 8 km with a maximum of 8 5 m s 1 and possessing a full width at half maximum of 6 km is continuously forced along that boundary during the simulation this type of triggering function focused on the mid upper troposphere is inspired by the observations of atmospheric jets as preferred sources of internal gravity waves e g plougonven and zhang 2014 mutual adjustment of mass and wind prognostic fields as this perturbation enters the domain is all what is needed to develop a significant gravity wave response unless the basic environment found downstream is hostile admittedly this perturbation technique is rather arbitrary and the maximum downdraft value especially can be considered a free or calibration parameter of our modelling system in our specific case we experimented with a range of values approximately at intervals of 0 5 m s 1 global results in terms of mean simulated wave height for 126 analysed rissaga events were found to be optimal i e closest to observations see section 3 1 when using 8 5 m s 1 future improvements of the technique could incorporate the individual characteristics of the synoptic situation and use a different parameter for each day for instance the parameter could be scaled according to the amount of flow imbalance associated with the upper level jet since many different studies have consistently highlighted jet exit regions where this imbalance tends to be maximized as a favoured locus for intense gravity waves see plougonven and zhang 2014 a graphical representation of the atmospheric gravity wave resulting for our case study is included in fig 4a that shows the total potential temperature field θ θ at 5 h of simulation in agreement with the physical scheme described in the previous section the most remarkable features of this result are the lack of dissipation of the disturbance as it propagates downstream from left to right in the figure and the notable amplitude of the wave near the surface where it is needed to properly interact with the underlying water body the crucial role of both wind and temperature vertical profiles for enabling the previous features can be easily demonstrated by repeating the numerical experiment after altering these profiles for instance fig 4b shows a simulation initialized with a uniform wind along the z axis i e no shear namely the vertically averaged value of the sounding wind data the disturbance rapidly decays both in the vertical and horizontal dimensions on the other hand fig 4c results from an environment possessing the same wind as the reference sounding of fig 2 but this time assuming a temperature profile similar to the standard atmosphere a lapse rate of 6 k km is applied in the troposphere isothermal conditions above in this case the gravity waves remain practically confined to the mid upper troposphere and no appreciable signatures in short pressure fluctuations are revealed at surface 2 2 menorca channel proudman resonance wave shoaling the second step in the meteotsunami generation scheme of šepić et al 2015 involves a favourable atmosphere ocean coupling in the menorca channel the channel was unequivocally demonstrated by ličer et al 2017 to be the key build up region determining meteotsunami amplitude in ciutadella looking at the travelling sea level pressure slp fluctuations provided by the previous simulation of the 21 june 1984 case study several promising features are observed in the surface wave these features are practically absent under the modified environments of fig 4b and c first of all the resulting pressure wave possesses a significant amplitude of about 2 hpa the slp time series at the south western limit of the channel is displayed in fig 5a in second place the oscillating nature of the signal with a dominant period in the range of minutes becomes evident at the location of fig 5a for instance it can be seen that after the initial two hours when the disturbance has not yet arrived a quasi regular pattern of pressure variations is established leaving aside the non linear influences these characteristic periodicities are exclusively an intrinsic property of the background environment where the gravity waves are embedded not an artificial consequence of the method note in particular we do not impose any oscillatory character or time dependency in the above described gw triggering function the characteristics of the slp signal can be better analysed through its wavelet transform fig 5b this tool captures the change in frequency response with respect to time and is especially useful to analyse transients aperiodicities and other non stationary signal features e g kelley 2018 in this case we use the morlet wavelet transform and show only the energy scalogram which gives the relative importance of different periods at the selected location in fig 5b the bold black contour highlights the frequency regions where the power is significant power noise ratio significant at level 95 the wavelet power spectrum clearly indicates that the surface image of the gravity wave activity is most intense for periods around 10 min precisely the optimum for ciutadella inlet additional peaks of energy content at about 20 and 45 min are also delineated during some phases of the 21 june 1984 simulation fig 5b as expected similar analyses to fig 5 but for the no shear and standard atmosphere runs graphics not shown not only reveal pressure fluctuations of much less amplitude but also quite different distributions of the energy across the spectral bands no apparent peaks for instance appear near the 10 min optimum finally the propagation speed of the slp wave should be examined as this represents the most crucial factor for the amplification of the forced ocean waves via proudman resonance a rough estimate of this speed over the domain of interest can be obtained by searching the time lag that maximizes the correlation between the slp series simulated at both sides of menorca channel we use the 100 km and 150 km points of fig 4a for this purpose the temporal evolution of the propagation speed so calculated is shown in fig 6 note that this speed is continuously fluctuating in spite of starting from horizontally homogeneous conditions and maintaining the same initial sounding at the lateral boundaries this is due to the strong non linear interactions among the spatially complex atmospheric disturbances fig 4a and the background state based only on fig 6 we can identify several phases of the simulation exhibiting a north eastward translation of the slp wave across the channel faster than 20 m s 1 but it is the maximum obtained shortly after 4 h of simulation time propagation speeds in the range 25 30 m s 1 what emerges as the best scenario for proudman type intensification of the long ocean waves in our simplified approach the nonlinear oceanic response in the menorca channel is numerically quantified by means of the shallow water equations 4 4 this is an appropriate framework for our problem because the shallow depth assumptions are fully applicable water is considered incompressible viscous effects are negligible and the ocean wave lengths of interest 10 20 km are much larger than the water depth 100 m after inclusion of the appropriate atmospheric forcing term h t u h x h u x u t u u x g h x 1 ρ p x g u 2 h c 2 predictive equations for water depth h and velocity u are solved for the 55 km long mallorca menorca stretch fig 1 using a horizontal resolution δ x 600 m and non reflecting boundary conditions initially the channel is assumed to have a uniform depth of 80 m i e flat bottom topography a good approximation for the menorca channel given its smooth relief and to be at rest the oceanic component is connected with the atmospheric system through the pressure forcing term affecting the second equation p is the time and space varying sea level pressure provided by the atmospheric simulation every 20 s sea density ρ is set at 1028 kg m 3 similarly to vilibić 2008 we also include in the momentum equation a drag force where the seabed frictional resistance c is defined as c 18 log10 0 37 h z 0 with the bottom roughness z 0 set at 0 003 m no additional terms like coriolis and wind driven forces are considered as these are assumed to be of second order importance for our problem diffusion is acting implicitly in the simulation as part of the advection scheme the numerical scheme used to solve the coupled equations is analogous to the procedure followed for the atmospheric model except for the time splitting which is not applied in this case specifically we also follow a rk2 implementation of the two time level scheme with a forward backward second order formulation of mass and wind terms and rea representation of advection pressure forcing and drag terms are simply handled as sources in the discretized equations the performance of the numerical scheme in 1d and 2d was favourably checked on the basis of classical shallow water tests like the spread of several kinds of smooth or steep water bumps and the dam break problem delis and katsaounis 2005 tests not shown fig 7 shows the simulated water depth at the northeasterly boundary of the domain that is at the entrance of the ciutadella inlet note that this output as it is shown already includes the contribution due to wave shoaling remember this process is parameterized in a very simple way by virtue of green s law for an 80 to 5 m change in marine depth the simulated wave amplitude is artificially doubled before forcing the coastal response in ciutadella next section as expected for the 21 june 1984 case study the atmospheric forcing and proudman resonance become instrumental for allowing the ocean waves to gain significant amplitude before impinging ciutadella the greatest wave heights are simulated some minutes after t 4 h fig 7a reaching about 70 cm shelf amplification included in addition the involved wave frequencies mostly in the range between 6 and 20 min fig 7b become in principle highly favourable to excite a wide seiche response in the harbour 2 3 ciutadella inlet harbour resonance the final step of our numerical method aimed at the prediction of meteotsunamis in ciutadella is its coastal component again an idealized framework which operates on a domain 1 1 km long and 5 m deep quite representative of the inlet geometry top left inset in fig 1 the same shallow water model of last section will be applied but with the frictional force as the only extra term in the momentum equation the nature of the boundary conditions is obviously different water depth anomaly is prescribed every 20 s at the sw boundary open to the menorca channel this is the output of the preceding ocean model e g fig 7a while rigid wall conditions are assumed at the ne closed end the simulation is run with a spatial resolution δ x 12 m and we are interested in exploring the outcome in terms of the water depth near this latter boundary where the effect of the harbour resonance would be at its maximum fig 8 shows the result of the coastal simulation for the 21 june 1984 case study this can be compared with the input forcing that was shown in fig 7 substantially amplified seiches i e rissaga oscillations are obtained at the harbour as it could have been anticipated from previous steps of the prognostic chain the largest of these meteotsunamis is found at around t 4 5 h fig 8a with a calculated magnitude maximum crest to trough difference of 358 3 cm this means an extraordinary meteotsunami in the context of the known climatology and turns out to be in excellent agreement with the estimated magnitude of this historical event 350 cm as expected the energy of the simulated signal is highly focalized around the theoretical fundamental period of the harbour 10 5 min see fig 8b on the other hand a few more lessons on the functionality of the method can be derived solely from the selected case study first it is interesting to analyse what would have been the outcome if instead of feeding the technique with the original sounding we would have used the modified soundings that led to the atmospheric simulations of figs 4b and c for these no shear and standard lapse rate soundings we find respectively a maximum harbour oscillation of only 22 5 and 7 8 cm that is no rissaga at all we also wonder if the current model configuration without any extra adjustment or filtering criteria is naturally suited to discard as rissaga situations those environments lacking a substantial background flow from the southwest indeed four additional experiments starting with exactly the same sounding of fig 2 but rotating all winds clockwise by 90 180 and 270 degrees yield irrelevant oscillations of 13 1 0 5 and 2 7 cm respectively 3 overall performance of the prognostic system the potential of the new method has only been demonstrated for a particular although certainly extraordinary rissaga event the idea that extreme manifestations of complex physical processes can be accurately anticipated by a prognostic system whatever its degree of sophistication still seems far off but even a modest skill in identifying at least qualitatively a good number of hazardous situations would make of such system a very useful tool especially when combined with parallel techniques of similar relevance is the ability to detect the much more frequent non hazardous days in order to keep predicted false alarms within acceptable limits in this section we analyse these attributes by running our method on a meaningful number of rissaga and non rissaga days 3 1 rissaga events vs ordinary situations no systematic database of rissaga cases has been maintained at the balearic islands with a full description of the episodes e g time of the day exhibiting the maximum oscillation measured wave height etc except for the last years when proper measuring devices have been in operation in ciutadella harbour or for a few cases which happened during special field campaigns there is no practical way of reconstructing these quantitative details nevertheless thanks to different sources these are acknowledged at the end of the document we were able to compile a list of 128 events with a mere indication of the meteotsunami date and estimated magnitude for two of the dates no sounding data from palma was available so the final list is reduced to 126 rissaga events extending heterogeneously from july 1981 to july 2018 plus one old case from september 1975 by definition these events refer to oscillations greater than 70 cm this is the conventional threshold for a seiche to be classified a rissaga it should be taken into account that in many cases especially from the 80s and 90s the assigned magnitude is inherently uncertain for being based on newspaper news or testimonies from witnesses despite all these limitations this dataset seems enough for our purposes each of the 126 rissaga days was submitted to our modelling system starting except for possible gaps with the three operational palma soundings launched at 00 and 12 utc on the same day and at 00 utc the next day the harbour seiche of greatest amplitude is chosen from these simulations recall that the time of the observed event is generally unknown fig 9 displays simulated vs observed wave heights red dots ideally these points would lie close to the diagonal we find substantial spread in the results but there is a general tendency of the sample to draw a growing profile and about two thirds of the simulated events contain errors within the 50 cm interval the point labelled as a in fig 9 corresponds to the already discussed outstanding forecast of the 21 june 1984 historical event on the contrary two particular outliers stand out in the graph the severe under prediction of the 15 june 2006 record meteotsunami labelled as b and the extreme overestimation of the moderate rissaga of 8 may 2015 point c a plausible explanation for the 15 june 2006 miss is the fact that the current version of our atmospheric model does not include moist processes and therefore cannot simulate pressure jumps linked to the genesis and propagation of convective systems whereas the observational evidence confers a leading role to convection on that day jansà et al 2007 the 8 may 2015 outlier would deserve special investigation the responsible palma sounding at 00 utc not shown reveals extreme south westerly winds throughout the full troposphere except near the surface with abnormally large speeds of up to 95 kt around 300 hpa implying high shear underneath these features appear to have been critical for the atmospheric simulation which implicitly assumes the meteorological conditions reflected in a sounding are settled during several hours over the western mediterranean however the thermal and wind profiles appear to have evolved very rapidly on that day as indicated by the observed sounding at 12 utc which reveals upper tropospheric winds of around 80 kt and produces a simulated rissaga of 134 cm much closer to the observed magnitude of 104 cm on average the rissaga prediction system is well calibrated as indicated by the mean simulated wave height of 119 6 cm to be compared with the observed mean value of 120 8 cm in terms of correlation the results of fig 9 do not endorse a very high quantitative correspondence between obs and sim the calculated linear correlation coefficient 0 264 indicates a moderate association if the two discussed outliers are omitted from the population this correlation coefficient increases to 0 393 in second place a contrasting set of non rissaga days maximum harbour oscillations below 70 cm were simulated thanks to the official institution ports de balears observed values in this case correspond to actually measured data at the site 1 min resolution series in particular we considered the quasi continuous record from december 2016 to july 2018 after filtering out a dozen of rissaga days happened in that period these are included in the previous rissaga dataset and discarding those days without thermodynamic soundings available we ended up with a substantial set of 549 non rissaga days these days were simulated using the closest sounding to the moment of the observed maximum 10 min oscillation the results are displayed in fig 9 using black dots we observe some tendency of the prognostic system to overestimate the magnitude of many ordinary situations in fact 7 of the simulations entail maximum oscillations with errors greater than 50 cm but in fairness most of the points appear well clustered near the origin in terms of averages the simulated mean oscillation is 25 1 cm slightly above the observed mean of 17 8 cm the correlation coefficient between simulated and observed values for the non rissaga set is 0 428 3 2 summary for categories of practical interest overall the results shown in fig 9 are quite encouraging with regard to potential applications of the forecasting system for the automatic identification of rissaga prone situations and even for the issue of special warnings about the risk of large meteotsunamis operationally speaking this kind of quantitative forecasts necessarily uncertain are only of relative importance compared to the skill of the system to categorize the daily predictions according to a risk scale of practical interest in this sense it has been customary for the ciutadella harbour to apply the five following forecasting categories 5 5 these same categories are used by the aemet and brifs forecasting systems mentioned in the introduction section weak oscillations wave heights 20 cm moderate oscillations 20 70 cm rissaga 70 100 cm intense rissaga 100 200 cm and extreme rissaga wave height 200 cm the first class identifies the most common state of the harbour waters which are constantly oscillating at the fundamental frequency of the inlet these oscillations might occasionally reach remarkable although non hazardous amplitudes second class and only beyond the arbitrary limit of 70 cm rissaga definition some impacts on the port activities can be expected in our specific case 382 and 167 days out of the whole set of 549 ordinary situations belong to the first and second categories while the 126 rissaga days are distributed as follows 44 basic rissaga cases 70 intense events and 12 extreme meteotsunamis it should be noted that in terms of verification the narrow limits that define the third class pose some challenges to any predictive system as individual forecasts can easily fall within contiguous categories we first raise the question of what percentage of the events are correctly forecast by the prognostic system table 1 looking at the table we note as a positive characteristic the quasi diagonal pattern of the matrix non rissaga days will be correctly forecast most of the times on weak days first class false alarms occur with a percentage less than 3 yellow orange and red levels taken together on moderate days second category the chance of issuing an incorrect rissaga forecast increases to 18 the remaining percentage is evenly distributed between the two non rissaga categories regarding the skill of the system when a rissaga is presented yellow orange and red rows in table 1 the phenomenon will have been missed i e an oscillation 70 cm is predicted about 15 35 of the occasions this level depending on the magnitude of the observed rissaga the stronger the event the lower the risk of being undetected by the forecast it is noteworthy that 60 of significant meteotsunamis orange and red levels considered together would have been anticipated by the prognostic system as expected a perfect prediction of yellow level meteotsunamis becomes trickier only 18 2 in percentage but if we accept as a valuable guidance of the potential risk a forecast from green to orange i e wave heights around one metre then the predictive skill increases to 86 additionally it is also interesting to wonder what percentage of the forecasts are correct in terms of the considered categories table 2 we find again the desired broad diagonal disposition of the matrix leading elements although this table should be analysed with caution because the 126 549 ratio of dataset populations does not reflect the actual climatological frequency of rissaga situations 5 10 cases per year it is outstanding the ability of the method to produce credible predictions of weak situations grey and green categories the results are less robust when a rissaga event is forecasted yellow orange and red rows in table 2 in consistency with fig 9 we observe that a significant fraction of these forecasts aprox 25 will end up as false alarms nevertheless the fraction of hits is remarkably high especially if we accept the adjacent categories as a suitable domain for verification the elements of the above matrices can be further processed to build sim obs contingency tables for categorical forecasts of interest and from these to derive commonly used verification indices e g wilks 2011 jolliffe and stephenson 2012 we specifically consider the following representative scores accuracy acc bias bias probability of detection pod false alarm rate far and probability of false detection pofd a perfect system would exhibit acc bias and pod equal to 1 and far pofd equal to 0 all scores can range between 0 and 1 except bias that has no upper bound these scores have been computed considering the conventional thresholds that classify an observed or predicted maximum harbour seiche as non rissaga rissaga intense oscillation or extreme event table 3 regarding the power of the forecasting system to discriminate between non rissaga days and rissaga situations first two columns in the table the results are in both cases remarkable accuracy and bias are very good pod exceeds 90 and 70 respectively and while far is very low for non events 0 07 and more adverse for rissagas 0 31 the opposite occurs for the pofd index 0 29 and 0 07 respectively as expected the skill of the system is significantly degraded when considering its application to intense and extreme events table 3 but it is nonetheless quite encouraging acc is close to 1 in both cases the bias score is greater than 1 especially for the extreme threshold meaning a tendency to over forecast these situations pofd keeps very low and the pod far ratio keeps decreasing as we shift from left to right in the table for instance before extraordinary oscillations above two metres the prognostic system would exhibit a valuable pod of 33 but at the expense of many false alarms far 84 it should be noted that this category is scarcely populated and thus the statistical significance of these results is rather uncertain finally it would be interesting to compare the performance of our system with the results offered by other techniques also devised for rissaga prediction in the balearics the empirically based aemet system and the computationally intensive brifs method both of them briefly described in the introduction unfortunately no publications exist on the statistical performance of these companion techniques and raw data is not available to allow a strict inter comparison but at least some flavour of their behaviour can be distilled from what was recently presented by their authors in a topical conference 6 6 the first world conference on meteotsunamis split croatia 8 11 may 2019 a contingency table drawn from a limited sample of aemet forecasts shows a jansà personal communication i when moderate 30 cm oscillations were observed 84 of the forecasts indicated a seiche in excess of such threshold 16 missed the event ii for the 30 75 cm range in particular 25 12 and 63 of the forecasts resulted in under prediction correct prediction and over prediction of this category respectively iii the observed 75 150 cm category was correctly matched 70 of the occasions with an even number of under and over predictions and iv high amplitude events 150 cm were correctly anticipated by the aemet method in only 13 of the cases although two thirds of the remaining under predicted events were forecast in the 75 150 cm rissaga category with regard to the brifs system the following conclusions can be drawn b mourre personal communication i brifs was able to produce a 3 m oscillation for the dramatic june 2006 meteotsunami event analysed in renault et al 2011 ii the model clearly shows a tendency to underestimate the observed magnitude of the harbour seiches iii in spite of this issue which is not systematic during the last four years brifs generated significant oscillations 0 5 m in about 75 of observed rissaga events greater than 1 m iv the performance of brifs would benefit from more frequent atmospheric outputs used to force the oceanic submodel 1 min frequency or higher and by using a probabilistic approach built on the basis of multi physical parameterization schemes in the wrf model although the computational burden of these measures prevents for the moment from their operational implementation all the above results are clear evidences of the very challenging nature of producing accurate meteotsunami predictions especially for the most extreme high impact cases 4 conclusions and future lines of work the current study proves that basic knowledge of the leading atmosphere ocean generation mechanisms along with its plain translation into simple but physically realistic numerical models is a practical shortcut for predicting meteotsunamis in ciutadella harbour from beginning to end i e from reading atmospheric sounding data to computation of the maximum sea level oscillation our approach merely takes about 5 min to run in a standard pc cluster and yet it shows valuable skill for the recognition of rissaga risk situations and their classification as weak moderate or intense compared with the application of computationally expensive full models which at high resolution would require running times of several hours the new method appears as an interesting supplementary approach we advocate for the continuous integration of all available rissaga forecasting methods as the ideal operational scenario that is an ensemble based approach our pragmatic approach does not pursue reproduction of actual details of meteotsunami episodes not only because it focuses exclusively on first order physical processes but also because it incorporates obvious synthetic elements in particular with our strategy aimed at exciting gravity waves in the atmospheric sub model we do not expect to recreate the observed dynamical evolution the key idea is to rate the surface pressure anomalies magnitude and propagation speed that are allowed by the background environment the implicit assumption that atmospheric disturbances entering the balearic region are always guaranteed thanks to some sort of upstream source as well as the hypothesis of a homogeneous and slowly evolving background state reflected in a single sounding might be questionable in some situations future improvements of the technique could take into account the effective onset of gravity waves e g by means of satellite surveillance systems and should penalize meteorological settings that are forecasted to rapidly evolve from favourable into hostile conditions e g by ingesting time varying profiles the versatility of the system could also be improved by a proper recalibration for non supportive settings or simply for the cold season as a whole where rissaga events are unlikely since we observed a tendency to overpredict the harbour oscillations in these situations but above all the rissaga forecasting system will be benefited by the future inclusion of moist physics in the atmospheric sub model this is the only way to capture rapid surface pressure fluctuations of convective origin a relevant player in some ciutadella meteotsunamis even in its current prototypical version it is worth testing and adjusting the method for real time operations with this idea in mind a web based forecasting tool was recently implemented 7 7 see http meteo uib es rissaga the system provides probabilistic predictions of rissaga risk according to the five category types discussed in last section considering a time horizon of three days and separate forecasts for early central and late hours of the day input soundings over the balearics are taken from the hourly predictions of ncep global forecast system gfs model each of these soundings 10 for each period of the day is submitted to the rissaga prognostic method and the modelled maximum oscillations are scrutinized to ascertain the probabilities of each risk level thus we seek to assimilate in this first experimental system the previous notion that there must be a connection between the persistence of a rissaga favourable environment and the probability of finally observing the phenomenon additionally we are currently exploring the application of artificial neural networks ann as rissaga prediction tools it is expected that a properly trained ann could not only emulate the expert eye of the human forecaster in detecting the risk of the phenomenon based on the local sounding and the synoptic situation but also being able to capture those subtleties of the atmospheric state that can lead to intense cases in particular the ingestion in the ann of moisture profiles and convective indices e g cape apart from wind and temperature data will likely result in an increased versatility of the network another kind of prospective work involves the application of these computationally efficient techniques as downscaling methods to assess the possible changes in the future risk of meteotsunamis in ciutadella the use of fast simulation methods built on the basis of synthetic idealized components but including the relevant physics has proven to be very successful in climate change research for instance romero and emanuel 2017 applied a statistical deterministic method to generate from general circulation models gcms and at low cost thousands of synthetic storms with the aim of projecting the future risk of hurricane like cyclones in the north atlantic and in the mediterranean the method takes advantage of the axisymmetric nature of these cyclones and needs only a 2d framework to adequately model the intensification mechanisms in addition an ingredients based approach was followed to build the synthetic hurricane prone environments used as input for each considered climate scenario for the rissaga problem we would need to process a representative large number of daily states provided by the gcms both for present and future climatic conditions undoubtedly a prior screening of these states in terms of synoptic scale proxies recently formulated in connection with the probability of meteotsunami occurrence in the mediterranean šepić et al 2016 vilibić et al 2018 will help to reduce significantly the number of necessary simulations acknowledgments we acknowledge four anonymous reviewers for their thorough and useful comments on an earlier version of the study we would like to thank the agencia estatal de meteorología aemet spain and our university colleague prof s monserrat for transferring their lists of

24017,ciutadella menorca balearic islands spain is well known for the large amplitude seiches of about 10 5 min period registered in its long and narrow inlet especially during the warm season this phenomenon locally referred to as rissaga might reach extreme wave heights in the range 1 5 4 m with a recurrence of only a few years leading to damaging consequences in the port activities and moored vessels the provision of as accurate as possible predictions of the rissaga risk hours or days ahead appears as a crucial element in helping to mitigate these consequences we devise a chain of atmospheric and oceanic numerical simulation components aimed at capturing with low computational cost the key physical processes conducive to the vast majority of rissaga events i the genesis upstream from the balearic islands of high amplitude atmospheric gravity waves travelling in the sw ne direction these mesoscale waves are synthetically triggered using a 2d nonhydrostatic fully compressible model within a vertical environment provided by a representative sounding ii the oceanic response to the concomitant pressure fluctuations along the menorca channel in the form of long oceanic waves subject to proudman resonance these processes are simulated with a shallow water model applied over a 80 m depth channel iii shelf amplification which according to theory green s law accounts for a doubling of the wave amplitude for a depth jump from 80 to 5 m and iv harbour resonance within ciutadella inlet a crucial mechanism solved again with the shallow water equations over the idealized 5 m deep channel the prognostic system is successfully tested for the available set of 126 rissaga events and for a complementary set of 549 ordinary situations our approach discriminates fairly well non rissaga events from high amplitude oscillations and tends to correctly categorize the meteotsunamis among weak moderate or strong events we are now pursuing the real time application of the method in a probabilistic context 1 introduction and physical mechanisms meteotsunamis or atmospherically induced high frequency sea level variations oscillation periods in the range of minutes monserrat et al 2006 are known to have hit coasts all around the world especially in bays with high amplification factor or narrow harbours where the local seiches can more easily resonate with the external forcing and develop large amplitudes rabinovich 2009 wherever and whenever this phenomenon interacts with humans it will pose a hazard to our activities pattiaratchi and wijeratne 2015 destructive meteotsunamis i e with effects comparable to their seismic counterparts are certainly exceptional and seem to be the result of optimal combinations of atmospheric sources of appropriate in both amplitude and time scale sea level pressure fluctuations with resonant mechanisms unfolded during the oceanic phase of the episode as for most of extreme phenomena of natural origin it is the geographical context and notably in this case the topographies of the sea floor and coastal feature what determines the meteotsunami prone areas globally one of such places is the ciutadella harbour in menorca balearic islands spain right in the centre of the western mediterranean sea ramis and jansà 1983 rabinovich and monserrat 1998 during most active years ciutadella will experience several rissaga 1 1 risssaga is the local name for a meteotsunami in ciutadella the phenomenon is most common during the warm season may to september events of about 100 cm wave height crest to trough difference with oscillation periods close to 10 5 min this is the fundamental period of the seiche in a long narrow rectangular and semiclosed basin wilson 1972 with the characteristics of ciutadella harbour 1 1 km length 80 m width and 5 m depth see fig 1 in extreme cases on average every 5 10 years these oscillations can reach several metres like the event of 15 june 2006 with 400 cm wave height the most violent manifestation of a rissaga reported during the last decades jansà et al 2007 closely followed by the meteotsunami of 21 june 1984 350 cm in this sense ciutadella readily competes with other singular territories where this kind of extreme atmospherically induced ocean waves in the tsunami frequency band have also been reported e g nagasaki bay japan with its abiki phenomenon hibiya and kajiura 1982 and the vast geographically complex eastern adriatic coast of croatia historically impinged by several destructive meteotsunamis vilibić and šepić 2009 for a more general context of the problem see adams selin and johnson 2010 and pattiaratchi and wijeratne 2015 obviously the strong currents induced by even moderate oscillations of sea level within the ciutadella harbour become highly disruptive for the normal operations of the port in the most severe cases like the june 1984 and june 2006 events in only 5 min the state of the port switches between a dry bed near the closed end of the harbour and enormous water levels that flood contiguous areas and break moorings leaving the vessels adrift any step towards a better prediction of the rissaga phenomenon has the potential to help anticipating these effects hours or days in advance and thus the adoption of proportional measures of protection the fundamental processes leading to meteotsunami generation over the mediterranean and black sea regions were nicely illustrated by šepić et al 2015 the chain of atmospheric oceanic mechanisms see the well known fig 4 of that paper is certainly applicable to the majority of rissaga events first pressure fluctuations of enough entity a few hpa and short time periods several minutes are generated at sea level via the tropospheric ducting of internal gravity waves lindzen and tung 1976 monserrat and thorpe 1996 for the trapping and propagation of these waves without significant vertical energy loss and dissipation an upward transition in a highly sheared environment from a layer with large static stability even with a thermal inversion to steep mid tropospheric lapse rates becomes necessary in these circumstances an unstable atmospheric layer in terms of the richardson number ri 0 25 that might contain a critical steering level will overlie a stable layer ri 0 25 and the surface manifestation of the atmospheric gravity waves would take the form of noticeable pressure variations for the specific case of ciutadella the required basic current and strong unidirectional wind shear across the tropospheric column should be preferentially from the w sw direction as this is the orientation of the inlet fig 1 at synoptic scale all the previous conditions are linked to the presence of a relatively cold upper level trough to the west of the balearics simultaneous with or shortly preceded by a weak circulation from the southern sector at low levels that brings a surge of warm african air and a strong temperature inversion over the western mediterranean waters ramis and jansà 1983 in fact the surveillance of such synoptic pattern most frequent during the warm season forms the basis of an empirically based rissaga warning system currently operational at the national weather service of spain aemet the reliability of these warnings improves for the short term when clear signals of gravity wave activity can be confirmed on satellite images i e propagation of elongated southwesterly plumes of cloud bands aligned in the transverse direction although quantitative estimations of the possible rissaga generally remain elusive a real example of a perfect combination of atmospheric ingredients as observed by the regional sounding launched at palma de mallorca station 100 km upstream from menorca see fig 1 is shown in fig 2 for the june 1984 event rapid sea level atmospheric oscillations sometimes lasting several hours might include singular pressure jumps in response to more intense phases of gravity wave activity paxton and sobien 1998 or such pressure jumps are simply the consequence of other kinds of meteorological disturbances jansà et al 2007 e g the northeastward propagation of a mesoscale convective system mcs including small squall lines a crucial element for some of the largest sea level oscillations observed in ciutadella the role of mcs surface pressure anomalies as a trigger of meteotsunamis has been exhaustively documented in other places thanks to the continuous information provided by rich observing systems e g for the june 13th 2013 events along the us east coast wertman et al 2014 bailey et al 2014 to the point that an early warning of mcs generated tsunamis is revealed as a feasible task wherever a detailed monitoring of these anomalies is possible with the available data in our experience the occasional formation of a mcs during rissaga situations is just another symptom of the occurrence of greatly amplified gravity waves specifically for the abovementioned record breaking event of 15 june 2006 where the passage of a mcs with its characteristic pressure jump during the evening was crucial jansà et al 2007 atmospheric gravity waves and moderate sea level oscillations of around 100 cm had been observed all day long the air mass evolved from thermodynamic and kinematic profiles at the beginning of the day similar to those shown in fig 2 into an afternoon environment with greatly reduced convective inhibition and large cape aprox 2000 j kg for the parcels located right above the inversion soundings not shown thus allowing the gravity waves to release this convective energy equilibrium response to surface pressure variations of only a few hpa cannot directly explain large oscillations of the sea level inverted barometer principle would account for an equivalent of nothing more than few centimetres anomalously amplified harbour seiches at ciutadella are known to be mainly associated with the external forcing provided by long ocean waves travelling northeastward in the open sea between mallorca and menorca ramis and jansà 1983 marcos et al 2009 these waves with periods predominantly in the range of 5 50 min are driven by the atmospheric disturbance but in order to become effective they must gain enough amplitude when impinging on the mouth of the harbour the previous conceptual model by šepić et al 2015 emphasizes the proudman resonance proudman 1929 and shelf amplification due to shoaling green 1838 as the leading mechanisms for this crucial stage of the phenomenon proudman resonance is due to the matching of the long ocean waves speed 25 30 m s 1 for a depth of about 80 m between the islands and the propagation speed of the precursor atmospheric gravity wave shoaling effects for a depth transition from 80 m in the channel to 5 m of the harbour would mean doubling the wave amplitude according to green s law together both mechanisms could feasibly build ocean wave amplitudes of several tens of cm after the 50 km path separating the islands fig 1 and to practically 1 m in most extreme cases finally the last and most evident step of the šepić et al 2015 physical scheme for a rissaga generation is the harbour resonance due to matching of the frequency of incoming long ocean waves and harbour eigenperiods periods close to the fundamental mode of 10 5 min will generally be the most effective for generating rissagas in ciutadella under an optimal sequence of the outlined atmosphere ocean processes in terms of their attributes amplitudes frequencies and propagation speeds incoming ocean waves can be amplified more than 100 times before hitting ciutadella coast entailing a destructive meteotsunami in principle a modelling system suited for quantitative rissaga forecasts will need some type of formulation of the above generation mechanisms and their complex interactions for the ocean a simple shallow water model for instance may suffice to represent the dynamics and amplification of the long ocean waves provided the atmospheric coupling and resonant mechanisms are accounted for the inclusion of several kinds of resonances in semi idealized numerical frameworks is uncomplicated and has been exploited profusely in the literature in order to analyse the role of these processes in real systems e g with one of such models vennell 2010 investigates the resonance and trapping of topographic transient ocean waves by prescribing a moving atmospheric disturbance bubalo et al 2018 simulates chrystal and proudman resonances in a closed rectangular basin with two finite element and one finite difference ocean models and vilibić 2008 designs numerical modelling exercises with various sinusoidal air pressure disturbances to reproduce the proudman resonance on a shelf drawing illuminating conclusions about the genesis of destructive meteotsunami events regarding the atmospheric component of the modelling system realistic representations of internal gravity waves or other precursor atmospheric disturbances is more demanding but it is also practicable with a good investment in resolution and appropriate versions of the primitive nonlinear hydrodynamic equations e g stephan et al 2016 in this work we devise a pragmatic and computationally inexpensive numerical approach aimed at predicting the occurrence and magnitude of meteotsunamis in ciutadella harbour the idea is to retain exclusively the physical mechanisms pointed out by šepić et al 2015 and the consideration of contexts as simple as possible e g initialization with a single radiosounding and use of 2d geometries and flat bottom topography the method involves the application of the nonhydrostatic fully compressible equations for the atmospheric part and the adaptation of the shallow water equations to simulate the oceanic response we propose this strategy for the moment for a dry atmosphere as an effective and affordable method that avoids the application of full 3d high resolution atmosphere ocean coupled models where meteotsunami generation processes are supposed to emerge and combine naturally that is the case specifically of the sophisticated socib brifs rissaga forecasting system 2 2 see http www socib es index php seccion modelling facility rissagaforecast operational at the balearic islands the system was described and successfully tested for the june 2006 meteotsunami event by renault et al 2011 last years experience with brifs reveals its good skill to recognize rissaga situations but a clear tendency to underestimate the wave height a jansà personal communication the characteristics of our three step methodology are described in section 2 in first place we present the atmospheric component responsible for the generation and propagation of gravity waves 2 1 in second place the menorca channel submodel aimed at driving the long ocean waves and their possible amplification via proudman and shoaling processes 2 2 and finally the model application to ciutadella inlet in order to incorporate the harbour resonance mechanism 2 3 key features of the new construct will be illustrated with reference to the 21 june 1984 case study that is through the results obtained after feeding the technique with the environmental characteristics of the sounding of fig 2 in section 3 we summarize the statistical performance of the prognostic system based on its application to the available set of historical rissaga events and to a contrasting collection of non rissaga days section 3 1 section 3 2 outlines its skill when it comes to differentiating categories of practical interest finally section 4 will contain the main conclusions of the study and some hints for short and mid term research 2 methodology description 21 june 1984 case study 2 1 atmospheric component gravity wave generation the atmospheric model of our prognostic system uses one of the traditional equation sets that govern the dynamics of a nonhydrostatic fully compressible atmosphere see giraldo and restelly 2008 in two dimensions x z these equations are written as π t u π x w π z w π z r c v π π u x w z θ t u θ x w θ z w θ z u t u u x w u z c p θ θ π x w t u w x w w z c p θ θ π z g θ θ where besides the tendencies for the wind in the vertical plane u w predictive equations for exner pressure and potential temperature perturbations π θ appear these perturbations are defined with respect to a reference state indicated with overbars that depends on height only and is in hydrostatic balance in addition to the inviscid flow conditions that define the above form of the euler equations our simplified atmosphere is dry and adiabatic that is no other physical processes explicit or parameterized apart from basic hydro and thermo dynamics are formulated 3 3 truly speaking some amount of mixing of the prognostic fields is implicitly incorporated in the solution owing to the numerical formulation of the advective terms see text explicit diffusion terms or filters are not needed in our model to guarantee a good behaviour of the numerical solution note we also omit coriolis and curvature terms in summary all these possible influences are considered irrelevant or at least of second order for gravity wave driven rissaga events from the initial conditions the system of equations is integrated using a forward in time splitting method e g wicker and skamarock 1998 that is using two time levels and considering a large time step for the horizontal and vertical advection slow terms and a short time step for the other terms appearing on the right side of the equations the formulation of these latter fast terms uses standard second order finite difference spatial operators and in time applies a forward backward scheme mass equations are updated first then followed by wind equations that proceeds through an intermediate point of the short time interval according to a second order runge kutta rk2 cycle a thorough review of the concepts and benefits of these numerical strategies can be found in durran 2010 regarding the advection terms these are integrated over the large time step typically 6 10 times longer than previous δ t in the rectangular x z grid following a reconstruct evolve average rea philosophy inspired by the finite volume methods point of view see leveque 2002 specifically a rea algorithm with piecewise linear reconstruction is applied in the vertical direction and then in the horizontal dimensional splitting as follows i for each grid cell segment a linear profile of the field is reconstructed using the central grid point value and an adequate choice for the slope or gradient in that direction r step ii this profile evolves conservatively i e the segment is translated along the corresponding direction and possibly stretches shrinks by the action of the velocity components found at segment edges e step and iii the new grid point values resulting from the advection process are calculated by averaging within the cell limits all segments i e their profiles that totally or partially remained or entered the cell a step note we do not apply any type of staggering of variables in our model that is all prognostic fields u w π θ are defined at the same grid points as consequence wind components at segment edges necessary for the e step are approximated using the two contiguous cells what exactly defines the numerical behaviour of the rea scheme is the particular choice of the slope for the r step for instance a zero slope yields a scheme equivalent to the first order upwind method known for correctly preserving the monotonicity of the solution but inducing an unacceptable degree of dissipation slopes consistent with popular second or higher order methods can also be defined but then other characteristic problems of these schemes like phase error and oscillatory contamination of the solution can easily emerge the previous pathologies can be greatly reduced by using slope limiter methods a synonym term for the flux limiting strategy distinctive of the high resolution finite volume methods leveque 2002 among the large family of these specially defined and local solution dependent slopes and guided by several advection tests not shown we found the monotonized central difference limiter mc limiter van leer 1977 as the most suitable choice additionally we allow in our model a vertical stretching of the grid cells with the purpose of placing more resolution at low levels where it is needed to properly resolve the complexities of the thermal structure e g the sharp vertical gradients of stability seen in the sounding of fig 2 but the use of too short δ z would severely restrict the maximum time step compatible with numerical stability in order to circumvent this problem acoustic vertical modes linked to z w and z π terms in the first and last equations respectively are stabilized with an implicit formulation of these derivatives in the finite difference form of the temporal integration this is a common practice in numerical codes of elastic models e g skamarock et al 2008 and basically means that the cfl criterion behind the maximum allowable time step will now be determined exclusively in terms of the horizontal grid length δ x we subjected our model to several benchmark tests found in the literature some of these tests involve the simulation of thermal bubbles as an example fig 3a shows the same four stages of the exercise proposed by robert 1993 regarding the interaction of a rising large warm bubble and a descending small cold bubble introduced in a calm and neutrally stable environment times shown are 0 4 7 and 10 min as in fig 9 of the above paper another well known test is a density current simulation initialized with a strong cold anomaly embedded in the same kind of environment straka et al 1993 our fig 3b shows again the θ evolution half domain only at exactly the same moments of the straka et al experiment 0 5 10 and 15 min compare with their fig 1 our model also passed mountain wave tests after activating a topographic bottom boundary condition and a gravity wave absorbing layer towards the upper troposphere and above rayleigh damping term added to w equation klemp et al 2008 the schär et al 2002 test for instance analyses the stationary response of a uniform westerly current 10 m s 1 with constant stratification brunt väisälä frequency n 0 01 s 1 to the presence of a 250 m height mountain possessing an analytical profile composed of a bell shaped envelope combined with shorter scale cosine shaped components see fig 3c where the w field is shown with a contour interval of 0 05 m s 1 the solution for this mountain wave is very interesting as it contains a mixture of a larger scale hydrostatic wave with deep propagation in the vertical and smaller scale nonhydrostatic waves rapidly decaying with height this output can be directly compared with other model simulations and with the analytical solution see fig 13 of schär et al 2002 our final illustrative example deals with the simulation of an intense mountain wave excided by sierra nevada range ca usa under the impingement of a flow that is initialized using a real upstream sounding taken during the t rex observational campaign doyle et al 2011 nonlinearities and transient features are highly influential in this case and no stationary state is reached but persistent features in this simulation fig 3d are the downslope windstorm conditions and hydraulic jump found at low levels along the eastern slope and the profound wave breaking occurring aloft these structures have been represented after 4 h of simulation exactly in the same way as in the model intercomparison composite contained in fig 5 of doyle et al 2011 black contours display the potential temperature field at intervals of 10 k and colour indicates the horizontal perturbation wind component interval of 5 m s 1 and 5 m s 1 for red and blue areas respectively based on these and several other comparison exercises including tests with the three dimensional version of the code we can easily conclude that our model performs at least as well as state of the art modelling systems with regard to the specific application to the rissaga problem the model is initialized with a horizontally homogeneous basic state π θ u imported from the representative palma sounding fig 2 for the case study and runs for a 12 h period the simulation uses a non orographic domain extended along the relevant direction namely the sw ne axis oriented 30 with respect to the zonal direction dashed line in fig 1 thus the sounding winds are first projected along such direction to build the initial u profile to avoid any spurious contamination of the results with boundary artefacts our model includes a proper scheme for the relaxation of the inner solution towards the basic state imposed at the lateral boundaries davies and turner 1977 in addition we use a long enough domain of 300 km ciutadella lies at the central point of this length in the vertical the domain extends till 20 km height the horizontal resolution is δ x 300 m while in the vertical it varies gradually from δ z 20 m at sea level to 180 m at the uppermost computational layers a critical issue of the method is how to excite the gravity waves in the simulation so as to allow the environmental characteristics shear and stability profiles to govern their downstream propagation amplification or dissipation triggering mechanisms that are naturally ubiquitous in the real atmosphere are absent in our highly synthetic and simplified context we found an effective way of introducing the atmospheric disturbances in the domain by resorting to the left boundary condition for the w field a gaussian shaped vertical profile of downward motion centred at a height of 8 km with a maximum of 8 5 m s 1 and possessing a full width at half maximum of 6 km is continuously forced along that boundary during the simulation this type of triggering function focused on the mid upper troposphere is inspired by the observations of atmospheric jets as preferred sources of internal gravity waves e g plougonven and zhang 2014 mutual adjustment of mass and wind prognostic fields as this perturbation enters the domain is all what is needed to develop a significant gravity wave response unless the basic environment found downstream is hostile admittedly this perturbation technique is rather arbitrary and the maximum downdraft value especially can be considered a free or calibration parameter of our modelling system in our specific case we experimented with a range of values approximately at intervals of 0 5 m s 1 global results in terms of mean simulated wave height for 126 analysed rissaga events were found to be optimal i e closest to observations see section 3 1 when using 8 5 m s 1 future improvements of the technique could incorporate the individual characteristics of the synoptic situation and use a different parameter for each day for instance the parameter could be scaled according to the amount of flow imbalance associated with the upper level jet since many different studies have consistently highlighted jet exit regions where this imbalance tends to be maximized as a favoured locus for intense gravity waves see plougonven and zhang 2014 a graphical representation of the atmospheric gravity wave resulting for our case study is included in fig 4a that shows the total potential temperature field θ θ at 5 h of simulation in agreement with the physical scheme described in the previous section the most remarkable features of this result are the lack of dissipation of the disturbance as it propagates downstream from left to right in the figure and the notable amplitude of the wave near the surface where it is needed to properly interact with the underlying water body the crucial role of both wind and temperature vertical profiles for enabling the previous features can be easily demonstrated by repeating the numerical experiment after altering these profiles for instance fig 4b shows a simulation initialized with a uniform wind along the z axis i e no shear namely the vertically averaged value of the sounding wind data the disturbance rapidly decays both in the vertical and horizontal dimensions on the other hand fig 4c results from an environment possessing the same wind as the reference sounding of fig 2 but this time assuming a temperature profile similar to the standard atmosphere a lapse rate of 6 k km is applied in the troposphere isothermal conditions above in this case the gravity waves remain practically confined to the mid upper troposphere and no appreciable signatures in short pressure fluctuations are revealed at surface 2 2 menorca channel proudman resonance wave shoaling the second step in the meteotsunami generation scheme of šepić et al 2015 involves a favourable atmosphere ocean coupling in the menorca channel the channel was unequivocally demonstrated by ličer et al 2017 to be the key build up region determining meteotsunami amplitude in ciutadella looking at the travelling sea level pressure slp fluctuations provided by the previous simulation of the 21 june 1984 case study several promising features are observed in the surface wave these features are practically absent under the modified environments of fig 4b and c first of all the resulting pressure wave possesses a significant amplitude of about 2 hpa the slp time series at the south western limit of the channel is displayed in fig 5a in second place the oscillating nature of the signal with a dominant period in the range of minutes becomes evident at the location of fig 5a for instance it can be seen that after the initial two hours when the disturbance has not yet arrived a quasi regular pattern of pressure variations is established leaving aside the non linear influences these characteristic periodicities are exclusively an intrinsic property of the background environment where the gravity waves are embedded not an artificial consequence of the method note in particular we do not impose any oscillatory character or time dependency in the above described gw triggering function the characteristics of the slp signal can be better analysed through its wavelet transform fig 5b this tool captures the change in frequency response with respect to time and is especially useful to analyse transients aperiodicities and other non stationary signal features e g kelley 2018 in this case we use the morlet wavelet transform and show only the energy scalogram which gives the relative importance of different periods at the selected location in fig 5b the bold black contour highlights the frequency regions where the power is significant power noise ratio significant at level 95 the wavelet power spectrum clearly indicates that the surface image of the gravity wave activity is most intense for periods around 10 min precisely the optimum for ciutadella inlet additional peaks of energy content at about 20 and 45 min are also delineated during some phases of the 21 june 1984 simulation fig 5b as expected similar analyses to fig 5 but for the no shear and standard atmosphere runs graphics not shown not only reveal pressure fluctuations of much less amplitude but also quite different distributions of the energy across the spectral bands no apparent peaks for instance appear near the 10 min optimum finally the propagation speed of the slp wave should be examined as this represents the most crucial factor for the amplification of the forced ocean waves via proudman resonance a rough estimate of this speed over the domain of interest can be obtained by searching the time lag that maximizes the correlation between the slp series simulated at both sides of menorca channel we use the 100 km and 150 km points of fig 4a for this purpose the temporal evolution of the propagation speed so calculated is shown in fig 6 note that this speed is continuously fluctuating in spite of starting from horizontally homogeneous conditions and maintaining the same initial sounding at the lateral boundaries this is due to the strong non linear interactions among the spatially complex atmospheric disturbances fig 4a and the background state based only on fig 6 we can identify several phases of the simulation exhibiting a north eastward translation of the slp wave across the channel faster than 20 m s 1 but it is the maximum obtained shortly after 4 h of simulation time propagation speeds in the range 25 30 m s 1 what emerges as the best scenario for proudman type intensification of the long ocean waves in our simplified approach the nonlinear oceanic response in the menorca channel is numerically quantified by means of the shallow water equations 4 4 this is an appropriate framework for our problem because the shallow depth assumptions are fully applicable water is considered incompressible viscous effects are negligible and the ocean wave lengths of interest 10 20 km are much larger than the water depth 100 m after inclusion of the appropriate atmospheric forcing term h t u h x h u x u t u u x g h x 1 ρ p x g u 2 h c 2 predictive equations for water depth h and velocity u are solved for the 55 km long mallorca menorca stretch fig 1 using a horizontal resolution δ x 600 m and non reflecting boundary conditions initially the channel is assumed to have a uniform depth of 80 m i e flat bottom topography a good approximation for the menorca channel given its smooth relief and to be at rest the oceanic component is connected with the atmospheric system through the pressure forcing term affecting the second equation p is the time and space varying sea level pressure provided by the atmospheric simulation every 20 s sea density ρ is set at 1028 kg m 3 similarly to vilibić 2008 we also include in the momentum equation a drag force where the seabed frictional resistance c is defined as c 18 log10 0 37 h z 0 with the bottom roughness z 0 set at 0 003 m no additional terms like coriolis and wind driven forces are considered as these are assumed to be of second order importance for our problem diffusion is acting implicitly in the simulation as part of the advection scheme the numerical scheme used to solve the coupled equations is analogous to the procedure followed for the atmospheric model except for the time splitting which is not applied in this case specifically we also follow a rk2 implementation of the two time level scheme with a forward backward second order formulation of mass and wind terms and rea representation of advection pressure forcing and drag terms are simply handled as sources in the discretized equations the performance of the numerical scheme in 1d and 2d was favourably checked on the basis of classical shallow water tests like the spread of several kinds of smooth or steep water bumps and the dam break problem delis and katsaounis 2005 tests not shown fig 7 shows the simulated water depth at the northeasterly boundary of the domain that is at the entrance of the ciutadella inlet note that this output as it is shown already includes the contribution due to wave shoaling remember this process is parameterized in a very simple way by virtue of green s law for an 80 to 5 m change in marine depth the simulated wave amplitude is artificially doubled before forcing the coastal response in ciutadella next section as expected for the 21 june 1984 case study the atmospheric forcing and proudman resonance become instrumental for allowing the ocean waves to gain significant amplitude before impinging ciutadella the greatest wave heights are simulated some minutes after t 4 h fig 7a reaching about 70 cm shelf amplification included in addition the involved wave frequencies mostly in the range between 6 and 20 min fig 7b become in principle highly favourable to excite a wide seiche response in the harbour 2 3 ciutadella inlet harbour resonance the final step of our numerical method aimed at the prediction of meteotsunamis in ciutadella is its coastal component again an idealized framework which operates on a domain 1 1 km long and 5 m deep quite representative of the inlet geometry top left inset in fig 1 the same shallow water model of last section will be applied but with the frictional force as the only extra term in the momentum equation the nature of the boundary conditions is obviously different water depth anomaly is prescribed every 20 s at the sw boundary open to the menorca channel this is the output of the preceding ocean model e g fig 7a while rigid wall conditions are assumed at the ne closed end the simulation is run with a spatial resolution δ x 12 m and we are interested in exploring the outcome in terms of the water depth near this latter boundary where the effect of the harbour resonance would be at its maximum fig 8 shows the result of the coastal simulation for the 21 june 1984 case study this can be compared with the input forcing that was shown in fig 7 substantially amplified seiches i e rissaga oscillations are obtained at the harbour as it could have been anticipated from previous steps of the prognostic chain the largest of these meteotsunamis is found at around t 4 5 h fig 8a with a calculated magnitude maximum crest to trough difference of 358 3 cm this means an extraordinary meteotsunami in the context of the known climatology and turns out to be in excellent agreement with the estimated magnitude of this historical event 350 cm as expected the energy of the simulated signal is highly focalized around the theoretical fundamental period of the harbour 10 5 min see fig 8b on the other hand a few more lessons on the functionality of the method can be derived solely from the selected case study first it is interesting to analyse what would have been the outcome if instead of feeding the technique with the original sounding we would have used the modified soundings that led to the atmospheric simulations of figs 4b and c for these no shear and standard lapse rate soundings we find respectively a maximum harbour oscillation of only 22 5 and 7 8 cm that is no rissaga at all we also wonder if the current model configuration without any extra adjustment or filtering criteria is naturally suited to discard as rissaga situations those environments lacking a substantial background flow from the southwest indeed four additional experiments starting with exactly the same sounding of fig 2 but rotating all winds clockwise by 90 180 and 270 degrees yield irrelevant oscillations of 13 1 0 5 and 2 7 cm respectively 3 overall performance of the prognostic system the potential of the new method has only been demonstrated for a particular although certainly extraordinary rissaga event the idea that extreme manifestations of complex physical processes can be accurately anticipated by a prognostic system whatever its degree of sophistication still seems far off but even a modest skill in identifying at least qualitatively a good number of hazardous situations would make of such system a very useful tool especially when combined with parallel techniques of similar relevance is the ability to detect the much more frequent non hazardous days in order to keep predicted false alarms within acceptable limits in this section we analyse these attributes by running our method on a meaningful number of rissaga and non rissaga days 3 1 rissaga events vs ordinary situations no systematic database of rissaga cases has been maintained at the balearic islands with a full description of the episodes e g time of the day exhibiting the maximum oscillation measured wave height etc except for the last years when proper measuring devices have been in operation in ciutadella harbour or for a few cases which happened during special field campaigns there is no practical way of reconstructing these quantitative details nevertheless thanks to different sources these are acknowledged at the end of the document we were able to compile a list of 128 events with a mere indication of the meteotsunami date and estimated magnitude for two of the dates no sounding data from palma was available so the final list is reduced to 126 rissaga events extending heterogeneously from july 1981 to july 2018 plus one old case from september 1975 by definition these events refer to oscillations greater than 70 cm this is the conventional threshold for a seiche to be classified a rissaga it should be taken into account that in many cases especially from the 80s and 90s the assigned magnitude is inherently uncertain for being based on newspaper news or testimonies from witnesses despite all these limitations this dataset seems enough for our purposes each of the 126 rissaga days was submitted to our modelling system starting except for possible gaps with the three operational palma soundings launched at 00 and 12 utc on the same day and at 00 utc the next day the harbour seiche of greatest amplitude is chosen from these simulations recall that the time of the observed event is generally unknown fig 9 displays simulated vs observed wave heights red dots ideally these points would lie close to the diagonal we find substantial spread in the results but there is a general tendency of the sample to draw a growing profile and about two thirds of the simulated events contain errors within the 50 cm interval the point labelled as a in fig 9 corresponds to the already discussed outstanding forecast of the 21 june 1984 historical event on the contrary two particular outliers stand out in the graph the severe under prediction of the 15 june 2006 record meteotsunami labelled as b and the extreme overestimation of the moderate rissaga of 8 may 2015 point c a plausible explanation for the 15 june 2006 miss is the fact that the current version of our atmospheric model does not include moist processes and therefore cannot simulate pressure jumps linked to the genesis and propagation of convective systems whereas the observational evidence confers a leading role to convection on that day jansà et al 2007 the 8 may 2015 outlier would deserve special investigation the responsible palma sounding at 00 utc not shown reveals extreme south westerly winds throughout the full troposphere except near the surface with abnormally large speeds of up to 95 kt around 300 hpa implying high shear underneath these features appear to have been critical for the atmospheric simulation which implicitly assumes the meteorological conditions reflected in a sounding are settled during several hours over the western mediterranean however the thermal and wind profiles appear to have evolved very rapidly on that day as indicated by the observed sounding at 12 utc which reveals upper tropospheric winds of around 80 kt and produces a simulated rissaga of 134 cm much closer to the observed magnitude of 104 cm on average the rissaga prediction system is well calibrated as indicated by the mean simulated wave height of 119 6 cm to be compared with the observed mean value of 120 8 cm in terms of correlation the results of fig 9 do not endorse a very high quantitative correspondence between obs and sim the calculated linear correlation coefficient 0 264 indicates a moderate association if the two discussed outliers are omitted from the population this correlation coefficient increases to 0 393 in second place a contrasting set of non rissaga days maximum harbour oscillations below 70 cm were simulated thanks to the official institution ports de balears observed values in this case correspond to actually measured data at the site 1 min resolution series in particular we considered the quasi continuous record from december 2016 to july 2018 after filtering out a dozen of rissaga days happened in that period these are included in the previous rissaga dataset and discarding those days without thermodynamic soundings available we ended up with a substantial set of 549 non rissaga days these days were simulated using the closest sounding to the moment of the observed maximum 10 min oscillation the results are displayed in fig 9 using black dots we observe some tendency of the prognostic system to overestimate the magnitude of many ordinary situations in fact 7 of the simulations entail maximum oscillations with errors greater than 50 cm but in fairness most of the points appear well clustered near the origin in terms of averages the simulated mean oscillation is 25 1 cm slightly above the observed mean of 17 8 cm the correlation coefficient between simulated and observed values for the non rissaga set is 0 428 3 2 summary for categories of practical interest overall the results shown in fig 9 are quite encouraging with regard to potential applications of the forecasting system for the automatic identification of rissaga prone situations and even for the issue of special warnings about the risk of large meteotsunamis operationally speaking this kind of quantitative forecasts necessarily uncertain are only of relative importance compared to the skill of the system to categorize the daily predictions according to a risk scale of practical interest in this sense it has been customary for the ciutadella harbour to apply the five following forecasting categories 5 5 these same categories are used by the aemet and brifs forecasting systems mentioned in the introduction section weak oscillations wave heights 20 cm moderate oscillations 20 70 cm rissaga 70 100 cm intense rissaga 100 200 cm and extreme rissaga wave height 200 cm the first class identifies the most common state of the harbour waters which are constantly oscillating at the fundamental frequency of the inlet these oscillations might occasionally reach remarkable although non hazardous amplitudes second class and only beyond the arbitrary limit of 70 cm rissaga definition some impacts on the port activities can be expected in our specific case 382 and 167 days out of the whole set of 549 ordinary situations belong to the first and second categories while the 126 rissaga days are distributed as follows 44 basic rissaga cases 70 intense events and 12 extreme meteotsunamis it should be noted that in terms of verification the narrow limits that define the third class pose some challenges to any predictive system as individual forecasts can easily fall within contiguous categories we first raise the question of what percentage of the events are correctly forecast by the prognostic system table 1 looking at the table we note as a positive characteristic the quasi diagonal pattern of the matrix non rissaga days will be correctly forecast most of the times on weak days first class false alarms occur with a percentage less than 3 yellow orange and red levels taken together on moderate days second category the chance of issuing an incorrect rissaga forecast increases to 18 the remaining percentage is evenly distributed between the two non rissaga categories regarding the skill of the system when a rissaga is presented yellow orange and red rows in table 1 the phenomenon will have been missed i e an oscillation 70 cm is predicted about 15 35 of the occasions this level depending on the magnitude of the observed rissaga the stronger the event the lower the risk of being undetected by the forecast it is noteworthy that 60 of significant meteotsunamis orange and red levels considered together would have been anticipated by the prognostic system as expected a perfect prediction of yellow level meteotsunamis becomes trickier only 18 2 in percentage but if we accept as a valuable guidance of the potential risk a forecast from green to orange i e wave heights around one metre then the predictive skill increases to 86 additionally it is also interesting to wonder what percentage of the forecasts are correct in terms of the considered categories table 2 we find again the desired broad diagonal disposition of the matrix leading elements although this table should be analysed with caution because the 126 549 ratio of dataset populations does not reflect the actual climatological frequency of rissaga situations 5 10 cases per year it is outstanding the ability of the method to produce credible predictions of weak situations grey and green categories the results are less robust when a rissaga event is forecasted yellow orange and red rows in table 2 in consistency with fig 9 we observe that a significant fraction of these forecasts aprox 25 will end up as false alarms nevertheless the fraction of hits is remarkably high especially if we accept the adjacent categories as a suitable domain for verification the elements of the above matrices can be further processed to build sim obs contingency tables for categorical forecasts of interest and from these to derive commonly used verification indices e g wilks 2011 jolliffe and stephenson 2012 we specifically consider the following representative scores accuracy acc bias bias probability of detection pod false alarm rate far and probability of false detection pofd a perfect system would exhibit acc bias and pod equal to 1 and far pofd equal to 0 all scores can range between 0 and 1 except bias that has no upper bound these scores have been computed considering the conventional thresholds that classify an observed or predicted maximum harbour seiche as non rissaga rissaga intense oscillation or extreme event table 3 regarding the power of the forecasting system to discriminate between non rissaga days and rissaga situations first two columns in the table the results are in both cases remarkable accuracy and bias are very good pod exceeds 90 and 70 respectively and while far is very low for non events 0 07 and more adverse for rissagas 0 31 the opposite occurs for the pofd index 0 29 and 0 07 respectively as expected the skill of the system is significantly degraded when considering its application to intense and extreme events table 3 but it is nonetheless quite encouraging acc is close to 1 in both cases the bias score is greater than 1 especially for the extreme threshold meaning a tendency to over forecast these situations pofd keeps very low and the pod far ratio keeps decreasing as we shift from left to right in the table for instance before extraordinary oscillations above two metres the prognostic system would exhibit a valuable pod of 33 but at the expense of many false alarms far 84 it should be noted that this category is scarcely populated and thus the statistical significance of these results is rather uncertain finally it would be interesting to compare the performance of our system with the results offered by other techniques also devised for rissaga prediction in the balearics the empirically based aemet system and the computationally intensive brifs method both of them briefly described in the introduction unfortunately no publications exist on the statistical performance of these companion techniques and raw data is not available to allow a strict inter comparison but at least some flavour of their behaviour can be distilled from what was recently presented by their authors in a topical conference 6 6 the first world conference on meteotsunamis split croatia 8 11 may 2019 a contingency table drawn from a limited sample of aemet forecasts shows a jansà personal communication i when moderate 30 cm oscillations were observed 84 of the forecasts indicated a seiche in excess of such threshold 16 missed the event ii for the 30 75 cm range in particular 25 12 and 63 of the forecasts resulted in under prediction correct prediction and over prediction of this category respectively iii the observed 75 150 cm category was correctly matched 70 of the occasions with an even number of under and over predictions and iv high amplitude events 150 cm were correctly anticipated by the aemet method in only 13 of the cases although two thirds of the remaining under predicted events were forecast in the 75 150 cm rissaga category with regard to the brifs system the following conclusions can be drawn b mourre personal communication i brifs was able to produce a 3 m oscillation for the dramatic june 2006 meteotsunami event analysed in renault et al 2011 ii the model clearly shows a tendency to underestimate the observed magnitude of the harbour seiches iii in spite of this issue which is not systematic during the last four years brifs generated significant oscillations 0 5 m in about 75 of observed rissaga events greater than 1 m iv the performance of brifs would benefit from more frequent atmospheric outputs used to force the oceanic submodel 1 min frequency or higher and by using a probabilistic approach built on the basis of multi physical parameterization schemes in the wrf model although the computational burden of these measures prevents for the moment from their operational implementation all the above results are clear evidences of the very challenging nature of producing accurate meteotsunami predictions especially for the most extreme high impact cases 4 conclusions and future lines of work the current study proves that basic knowledge of the leading atmosphere ocean generation mechanisms along with its plain translation into simple but physically realistic numerical models is a practical shortcut for predicting meteotsunamis in ciutadella harbour from beginning to end i e from reading atmospheric sounding data to computation of the maximum sea level oscillation our approach merely takes about 5 min to run in a standard pc cluster and yet it shows valuable skill for the recognition of rissaga risk situations and their classification as weak moderate or intense compared with the application of computationally expensive full models which at high resolution would require running times of several hours the new method appears as an interesting supplementary approach we advocate for the continuous integration of all available rissaga forecasting methods as the ideal operational scenario that is an ensemble based approach our pragmatic approach does not pursue reproduction of actual details of meteotsunami episodes not only because it focuses exclusively on first order physical processes but also because it incorporates obvious synthetic elements in particular with our strategy aimed at exciting gravity waves in the atmospheric sub model we do not expect to recreate the observed dynamical evolution the key idea is to rate the surface pressure anomalies magnitude and propagation speed that are allowed by the background environment the implicit assumption that atmospheric disturbances entering the balearic region are always guaranteed thanks to some sort of upstream source as well as the hypothesis of a homogeneous and slowly evolving background state reflected in a single sounding might be questionable in some situations future improvements of the technique could take into account the effective onset of gravity waves e g by means of satellite surveillance systems and should penalize meteorological settings that are forecasted to rapidly evolve from favourable into hostile conditions e g by ingesting time varying profiles the versatility of the system could also be improved by a proper recalibration for non supportive settings or simply for the cold season as a whole where rissaga events are unlikely since we observed a tendency to overpredict the harbour oscillations in these situations but above all the rissaga forecasting system will be benefited by the future inclusion of moist physics in the atmospheric sub model this is the only way to capture rapid surface pressure fluctuations of convective origin a relevant player in some ciutadella meteotsunamis even in its current prototypical version it is worth testing and adjusting the method for real time operations with this idea in mind a web based forecasting tool was recently implemented 7 7 see http meteo uib es rissaga the system provides probabilistic predictions of rissaga risk according to the five category types discussed in last section considering a time horizon of three days and separate forecasts for early central and late hours of the day input soundings over the balearics are taken from the hourly predictions of ncep global forecast system gfs model each of these soundings 10 for each period of the day is submitted to the rissaga prognostic method and the modelled maximum oscillations are scrutinized to ascertain the probabilities of each risk level thus we seek to assimilate in this first experimental system the previous notion that there must be a connection between the persistence of a rissaga favourable environment and the probability of finally observing the phenomenon additionally we are currently exploring the application of artificial neural networks ann as rissaga prediction tools it is expected that a properly trained ann could not only emulate the expert eye of the human forecaster in detecting the risk of the phenomenon based on the local sounding and the synoptic situation but also being able to capture those subtleties of the atmospheric state that can lead to intense cases in particular the ingestion in the ann of moisture profiles and convective indices e g cape apart from wind and temperature data will likely result in an increased versatility of the network another kind of prospective work involves the application of these computationally efficient techniques as downscaling methods to assess the possible changes in the future risk of meteotsunamis in ciutadella the use of fast simulation methods built on the basis of synthetic idealized components but including the relevant physics has proven to be very successful in climate change research for instance romero and emanuel 2017 applied a statistical deterministic method to generate from general circulation models gcms and at low cost thousands of synthetic storms with the aim of projecting the future risk of hurricane like cyclones in the north atlantic and in the mediterranean the method takes advantage of the axisymmetric nature of these cyclones and needs only a 2d framework to adequately model the intensification mechanisms in addition an ingredients based approach was followed to build the synthetic hurricane prone environments used as input for each considered climate scenario for the rissaga problem we would need to process a representative large number of daily states provided by the gcms both for present and future climatic conditions undoubtedly a prior screening of these states in terms of synoptic scale proxies recently formulated in connection with the probability of meteotsunami occurrence in the mediterranean šepić et al 2016 vilibić et al 2018 will help to reduce significantly the number of necessary simulations acknowledgments we acknowledge four anonymous reviewers for their thorough and

24018,in this study we identify the drivers of the dominant mode of sea surface height interannual variability over the patagonian shelf using a suite of process oriented numerical experiments consistent with altimetry the dominant mode of the model sea surface height interannual variability which accounts for approximately 84 of the total variance exhibits a robust deterministic low frequency variability the weak sea surface height gradients indicate that this mode has a weak dynamical effect but the contribution of the steric effect is shown to be non significant here we demonstrate that the temporal variability of this mode is not driven by heat or freshwater fluxes but by the propagation of sea surface height perturbations generated in the pacific in particular we show that sea surface height interannual variability over the patagonian shelf is influenced by wind stress forcing in the offshore region of southern chile and by the propagation of equatorial sea

monitored quasi continuously on a global scale with satellite altimetry thanks to remarkable advances in altimetry technology use of remotely sensed ssh data has been extended from the open ocean its original realm to the continental shelf in particular at seasonal and larger time scales saraceno et al 2014 ruiz etcheverry et al 2016 thus documenting the wide range physical phenomena connecting these distinct regions strub et al 2015 in this study we use altimeter data and model output to characterize the dominant mode of the ssh interannual variability of the patagonian shelf ps a vast region that extends from the tip of south america 56 s to the mouth of the rio de la plata 36 s fig 1 the ps is among the widest shelves of the world s ocean 6 of longitude at 50 s and one of the most productive regions of the southern ocean acha et al 2004 romero et al 2006 garcia et al 2008 there are few studies of the ssh of the ps ruiz etcheverry et al 2016 showed that seasonal ssh is mainly ascribed to thermosteric variability in the northern limit of the ps the ssh is primarily driven by the local wind stress and also coherent with the el niño southern oscillation enso saraceno et al 2014 over the la plata river plume saraceno et al 2014 attribute the rise of the ssh during el niño events to the combination of a rise of ssh associated with an increase of the river outflow and a rise of ssh due to easterly winds anomaly observed during warm enso events strub et al 2015 showed that a large portion of the seasonal ssh can be ascribed to wind stress forcing few studies suggested that remote forcing also influences the ps ocean variability at intraseasonal timescales baroclinic shelf waves originated from the drake passage have been observed vivier et al 2001 and modeled smith et al 1994 to propagate along the edge of the ps vivier et al 2001 suggest that these waves may originate from the equatorial pacific generated at the equatorial pacific by local forcing kelvin waves particularly strong during el niño events travel east until they encounter the south america continent in the northern hemisphere those waves then travel toward the california current system in the southern hemisphere previous studies have observed the propagation of those coastally trapped waves as south as central chile 33 s clarke and ahmed 1999 hormazabal et al 2001 whether those coastally

data over regions of large tides ruiz etcheverry et al 2015 the model overestimates the amplitudes of seasonal ssh not shown and underestimates the amplitudes of interannual variability fig 2a b we argue that the weaker interannual variability of the model ssh results from a weaker interannual variability of the model wind stress forcing compared to the quikscat wind stress in particular off southern chile not shown in agreement with ruiz etcheverry et al 2016 we find that the seasonal variability of the ssh has the same order of magnitude than the seasonal steric ssh computed from eq 1 not shown on interannual timescales however steric effects are negligible on the ssh a fig 2c to further corroborate the lack of influence of the net heat flux interannual variability on the ps ssh a we run exp nointerhf nest in which the heat fluxes vary only seasonally there is no interannual variability of the net heat flux in exp nointerhf nest yet the interannual variability of the ps ssh a is very similar to the one from exp control nest the correlation between the time series of the first eof of the two experiments is 0 89 hereafter all analyses will be applied to the interannual variability i e no seasonal cycle of the ssh ocean currents and surface wind stress eof analysis shows a dominant ssh a mode eof1 with a maximum over the central shelf containing 84 of the total variance fig 3b the spatial and temporal structure of this mode is similar to the one calculated from altimeter data fig 3a correlation between the two time series of model and altimeter is r 0 72 fig 3c due to weak horizontal gradients in the ssh a eof1 it does not contain much information about the time variability of geostrophic currents anomaly in fact the geostrophic currents associated with this mode are smaller than the standard deviation of surface currents anomaly averaged over the ps 3 5 cm s fig 3b instead the variability of the eof1 of the vertically integrated velocity anomaly field is more closely related to the variability of the eof2 of the ssh a variability which accounts for 7 of the total variance r 0 63 fig 4b c the variability of the eof2 of the model ssh a which is similar to the eof2 from altimetry data fig 4a r 0 75 is driven by the wind stress forcing combes and matano 2018 in this article we assess the drivers of the eof1 of ssh a variability while ruiz etcheverry et al 2016 argued that the seasonal variability of the ssh over the ps is driven by thermosteric effects two facts suggest that it is not the case for the ssh interannual variability first because the spatial eof1 of ssh a calculated from altimeter data is nearly identical to the one calculated from our boussinesq model which does not reproduce steric effects second though the eof1 of ssh a has a dominant interannual variability there are no significant interannual variability of the heat and freshwater fluxes over the ps in the following analysis we shall show that the variability of the ssh a eof1 is a manifestation of the teleconnections between the pacific and the ps to increase the degrees of freedom we include model results for the period 1979 2012 over the period 1993 2012 the variability of the ssh a eof1 computed for the period 1979 2012 is nearly identical r 0 99 to the variability of the ssh a eof1 computed for the period 1993 2012 to identify the connections between the pacific and atlantic regions we first computed a time lagged correlation between the time series of the ssh a eof1 and the time series of the model ssh a at every model grid point fig 5a this calculation shows a high correlation band extending from the equatorial pacific towards the ps thus suggesting a propagating ssh a signal north of 20 s however the correlation is below the 99 confidence level the lag of maximum correlation is 20 days at 25 s i e the coastal ssh a at 25 s leads the ssh a eof1 by 20 days and 10 days at 40 s which corresponds to a southward propagation speed of 1 8 m s fig 5a this value is consistent with the estimate from enfield and allen 1980 who estimated a phase speed along north america of 180 100 km d 2 08 m s these values are derived from a lagged correlation structure of coastal ssha over 3 decades and are lower than the estimates of 3 1 m s hormazabal et al 2001 2 9 m s clarke and ahmed 1999 2 9 3 5 m s blanco et al 2002 or 4 9 m s enfield 1987 all using a shorter period time these higher values are nonetheless also consistent with the model propagation speed derived from a hovmoller diagram of ssh a along the western coast of south america during the 1997 enso event fig 1c the hovmoller diagram suggests that the model ssh a propagation speeds of 3 4 to 4 4 m s fig 5b comparison of exp control and exp noeqvar where there is no propagating signal originating from the equator further illustrates the impact of equatorial pacific variability over the ps the correlation between the ssh a eof1 time series of exp control and exp noeqvar which in the absence of equatorial pacific influences should be r 1 decreases to r 0 59 main discrepancies are observed during strong enso years thus suggesting that the influence of these events propagates into the ps fig 6a the difference of the two experiments time series is highly correlated with the ssh eq time series r 0 84 fig 6b in exp nowindvar where the surface forcing has no interannual variability the effect of the equatorial pacific ssh a propagating signal on the ssh a variability over the ps is even more evident the ssh a eof1 in exp nowindvar is highly and significantly correlated with the ssh eq variability r 0 81 in summary the present analysis indicates that strong enso events generate a ssh a variability that propagates around the continental boundary into the ps other potential drivers of the ps ssh a variability are the open ocean circulation namely the acc and the local wind stress forcing the acc is the main source of ps waters combes and matano 2018 but its transport variability does not significantly affect the ps ssh a eof1 comparison of exp noeqvar and exp noeqvar noaccvar which only differ on the variability of the acc transport show nearly identical ssh a variability patterns over the ps correlation of the ssh a eof1 time series of both experiments is r 0 96 thus indicating that acc variability does not significantly affect the ssh a eof1 of the ps this does not mean that the acc has no impact on the ps interannual variability the acc transport variability has a larger influence on higher ssh a modes which as shown in previous work are more closely related to the dynamics of the ps circulation combes and matano 2018 to identify the contribution of local wind forcing to the ps interannual variability we first correlated the ssh a eof1 of exp control to the time series of the local zonal and meridional wind stress anomaly at every model grid point the correlation is weak and not statistically significant fig 7a a similar calculation using exp noeqvar however shows a high and statistically significant correlation along the southern pacific coast of south america fig 7b c thus suggesting that propagation of pacific equatorial anomalies in exp control reduces the correlation value between the wind stress anomaly variability and the ssh a eof1 the influence of wind stress forcing on the ssh a eof1 variability is such that equatorward poleward coastal wind stress off southern chile generates positive negative local coastal ssh a which then reaches the ps ancillary correlation between the ssh a eof1 of exp control and a multiple linear regression of wind stress anomaly and ssh eq time series show correlations similar to those between exp noeqvar and wind stress anomaly fig 7b which reach values up to r 0 71 off southern chile fig 7d the model experiments therefore indicate that the propagating ssh eq modulated by the wind stress off southern chile is highly correlated with the ssh a of the ps to further corroborate the lack of influence of local wind stress anomaly variability over the ssh a eof1 we run exp nowindvar70 w which lacks wind stress anomaly forcing variability over the ps as expected the ssh a eof1 of this experiment and exp control are highly correlated r 0 87 it is worth to note that the lack of influence of local wind stress anomaly over the ps ssh a variability is restricted to the temporal structure of the ssh a eof1 as shown in our previous works local wind stress anomaly is the dominant driver of the higher more dynamically significant modes of ssh a variability combes and matano 2018 model results however indicate that local wind stress anomaly forcing does not significantly influence the time series of the ssh a eof1 which is the dominant mode of ssh a variability in the southern patagonia region this mode is largely modulated by perturbations generated in the equatorial pacific that propagate to the ps along the continental slope of the pacific coast to complement the previous analysis we constructed the cross wavelet transform and wavelet coherence maps between the time series of the ssh a eof1 variability and the ssh eq variability and the same maps between the time series of the ssh a eof1 variability and the wind stress anomaly variability off southern chile fig 8 the times series of the wind stress anomaly is chosen where the correlation coefficient is the highest between the ssh a eof1 and wind stress anomaly variability from exp noeqvar blue dot in fig 7b the wavelet analyses indicate that both the wind stress blue in fig 8c and ssh eq red in fig 8c modulate the ssh a eof1 variability in particular at periodicities higher than 2 years periodicities of common power fig 8a b at periodicities lower than 2 years i e high frequency however the ssh eq and local wind stress anomaly contribute to the ssh a eof1 variability during different time periods for example the local wind stress anomaly is the principal contributor for the period 1995 2005 note that a strong positive ssh a at the equator is in phase with an upwelling favorable wind stress anomaly inducing negative ssh a off southern chile this is particularly apparent during strong el niño events fig 8d and according to montecinos and gomez 2010 more evident during september october november thus during strong el niño events strong downwelling positive ssh a coastally trapped waves propagate along the southeast pacific and are farther hampered by upwelling favorable wind stress anomaly off southern chile inducing negative ssh a before reaching the southern ps 4 summary and conclusion this article identifies the drivers of the low frequency variability of the ssh a over the ps for the period 1979 2012 a suite of process oriented model experiments assess the contributions of equatorial ssha and wind driven ssh a local and remote forcings on the dominant mode of ssh a variability eof1 it is concluded that the dominant mode of ssh a variability over the ps is driven by the propagation of ssh a anomalies that are generated in the pacific ssh a over the ps is influenced by the wind stress forcing from the offshore region of southern chile and by the propagation of equatorial sea surface height anomalies the analysis of the model ssh a is consistent with satellite observations fig 9 over the period 2000 2008 aviso and quikscat data common period there is a statistically significant correlation between the ssh a eof1 variability derived from the aviso altimetry and the time series defined as a multiple linear regression of the equatorial ssh a aviso ssh eq variability and the quikscat satellite wind stress anomaly variability off southern chile fig 9b the correlation coefficient between the ssh a eof1 variability and the wind stress anomaly off southern chile is higher during the period 2000 2008 fig 9a than for the period 1979 2012 fig 7a this is consistent with the model output where the correlation coefficient between the eof1 and meridional velocity off southern chile is 0 28 over the period 1979 2012 fig 7a and 0 54 over the period 2000 2008 this can be explained by a weaker equatorial ssh a variability during the period 2000 2008 compared to the period 1979 2012 where strong el niño events e g 1982 1998 occur fig 6b this mode has however a weak dynamical effect fig 3b in fact the model solution indicates that it is the second mode of the ssh a variability consistent with altimetry data that is highly correlated with the first mode of the shelf circulation variability fig 4c the first mode of the shelf circulation variability corresponds to the variations of the north south shelf transport detailed in combes and matano 2018 the latter mode is found to be driven by the local wind stress and shows a significant correlation with the time variations of the southern annular mode index acknowledgments we acknowledge the financial support of

24018,in this study we identify the drivers of the dominant mode of sea surface height interannual variability over the patagonian shelf using a suite of process oriented numerical experiments consistent with altimetry the dominant mode of the model sea surface height interannual variability which accounts for approximately 84 of the total variance exhibits a robust deterministic low frequency variability the weak sea surface height gradients indicate that this mode has a weak dynamical effect but the contribution of the steric effect is shown to be non significant here we demonstrate that the temporal variability of this mode is not driven by heat or freshwater fluxes but by the propagation of sea surface height perturbations generated in the pacific in particular we show that sea surface height interannual variability over the patagonian shelf is influenced by wind stress forcing in the offshore region of southern chile and by the propagation of equatorial sea surface height anomalies keywords sea surface height variability patagonian shelf enso chile wind stress 1 introduction sea surface height ssh is an important oceanographic parameter that can be monitored quasi continuously on a global scale with satellite altimetry thanks to remarkable advances in altimetry technology use of remotely sensed ssh data has been extended from the open ocean its original realm to the continental shelf in particular at seasonal and larger time scales saraceno et al 2014 ruiz etcheverry et al 2016 thus documenting the wide range physical phenomena connecting these distinct regions strub et al 2015 in this study we use altimeter data and model output to characterize the dominant mode of the ssh interannual variability of the patagonian shelf ps a vast region that extends from the tip of south america 56 s to the mouth of the rio de la plata 36 s fig 1 the ps is among the widest shelves of the world s ocean 6 of longitude at 50 s and one of the most productive regions of the southern ocean acha et al 2004 romero et al 2006 garcia et al 2008 there are few studies of the ssh of the ps ruiz etcheverry et al 2016 showed that seasonal ssh is mainly ascribed to thermosteric variability in the northern limit of the ps the ssh is primarily driven by the local wind stress and also coherent with the el niño southern oscillation enso saraceno et al 2014 over the la plata river plume saraceno et al 2014 attribute the rise of the ssh during el niño events to the combination of a rise of ssh associated with an increase of the river outflow and a rise of ssh due to easterly winds anomaly observed during warm enso events strub et al 2015 showed that a large portion of the seasonal ssh can be ascribed to wind stress forcing few studies suggested that remote forcing also influences the ps ocean variability at intraseasonal timescales baroclinic shelf waves originated from the drake passage have been observed vivier et al 2001 and modeled smith et al 1994 to propagate along the edge of the ps vivier et al 2001 suggest that these waves may originate from the equatorial pacific generated at the equatorial pacific by local forcing kelvin waves particularly strong during el niño events travel east until they encounter the south america continent in the northern hemisphere those waves then travel toward the california current system in the southern hemisphere previous studies have observed the propagation of those coastally trapped waves as south as central chile 33 s clarke and ahmed 1999 hormazabal et al 2001 whether those coastally trapped waves reach the southern tip of south america and the ps remains unknown here we use altimeter data and the results of a suite of process oriented numerical simulations to identify the drivers

not shown on interannual timescales however steric effects are negligible on the ssh a fig 2c to further corroborate the lack of influence of the net heat flux interannual variability on the ps ssh a we run exp nointerhf nest in which the heat fluxes vary only seasonally there is no interannual variability of the net heat flux in exp nointerhf nest yet the interannual variability of the ps ssh a is very similar to the one from exp control nest the correlation between the time series of the first eof of the two experiments is 0 89 hereafter all analyses will be applied to the interannual variability i e no seasonal cycle of the ssh ocean currents and surface wind stress eof analysis shows a dominant ssh a mode eof1 with a maximum over the central shelf containing 84 of the total variance fig 3b the spatial and temporal structure of this mode is similar to the one calculated from altimeter data fig 3a correlation between the two time series of model and altimeter is r 0 72 fig 3c due to weak horizontal gradients in the ssh a eof1 it does not contain much information about the time variability of geostrophic currents anomaly in fact the geostrophic currents associated with this mode are smaller than the standard deviation of surface currents anomaly averaged over the ps 3 5 cm s fig 3b instead the variability of the eof1 of the vertically integrated velocity anomaly field is more closely related to the variability of the eof2 of the ssh a variability which accounts for 7 of the total variance r 0 63 fig 4b c the variability of the eof2 of the model ssh a which is similar to the eof2 from altimetry data fig 4a r 0 75 is driven by the wind stress forcing combes and matano 2018 in this article we assess the drivers of the eof1 of ssh a variability while ruiz etcheverry et al 2016 argued that the seasonal variability of the ssh over the ps is driven by thermosteric effects two facts suggest that it is not the case for the ssh interannual variability first because the spatial eof1 of ssh a calculated from altimeter data is nearly identical to the one calculated from our boussinesq model which does not reproduce steric effects second though the eof1 of ssh a has a dominant interannual variability there are no significant interannual variability of the heat and freshwater fluxes over the ps in the following analysis we shall show that the variability of the ssh a eof1 is a manifestation of the teleconnections between the pacific and the ps to increase the degrees of freedom we include model results for the period 1979 2012 over the period 1993 2012 the variability of the ssh a eof1 computed for the period 1979 2012 is nearly identical r 0 99 to the variability of the ssh a eof1 computed for the period 1993 2012 to identify the connections between the pacific and atlantic regions we first computed a time lagged correlation between the time series of the ssh a eof1 and the time series of the model ssh a at every model grid point fig 5a this calculation shows a high correlation band extending from the equatorial pacific towards the ps thus suggesting a propagating ssh a signal north of 20 s however the correlation is below the 99 confidence level the lag of maximum correlation is 20 days at 25 s i e the coastal ssh a at 25 s leads the ssh a eof1 by 20 days and 10 days at 40 s which corresponds to a southward propagation speed of 1 8 m s fig 5a this value is consistent with the estimate from enfield and allen 1980 who estimated a phase speed along north america of 180 100 km d 2 08 m s these values are derived from a lagged correlation structure of coastal ssha over 3 decades and are lower than the estimates of 3 1 m s hormazabal et al 2001 2 9 m s clarke and ahmed 1999 2 9 3 5 m s blanco et al 2002 or 4 9 m s enfield 1987 all using a shorter period time these higher values are nonetheless also consistent with the model propagation speed derived from a hovmoller diagram of ssh a along the western coast of south america during the 1997 enso event fig 1c the hovmoller diagram suggests that the model ssh a propagation speeds of 3 4 to 4 4 m s fig 5b comparison of exp control and exp noeqvar where there is no propagating signal originating from the equator further illustrates the impact of equatorial pacific variability over the ps the correlation between the ssh a eof1 time series of exp control and exp noeqvar which in the absence of equatorial pacific influences should be r 1 decreases to r 0 59 main discrepancies are observed during strong enso years thus suggesting that the influence of these events propagates into the ps fig 6a the difference of the two experiments time series is highly correlated with the ssh eq time series r 0 84 fig 6b in exp nowindvar where the surface forcing has no interannual variability the effect of the equatorial pacific ssh a propagating signal on the ssh a variability over the ps is even more evident the ssh a eof1 in exp nowindvar is highly and significantly correlated with the ssh eq variability r 0 81 in summary the present analysis indicates that strong enso events generate a ssh a variability that propagates around the continental boundary into the ps other potential drivers of the ps ssh a variability are the open ocean circulation namely the acc and the local wind stress forcing the acc is the main source of ps waters combes and matano 2018 but its transport variability does not significantly affect the ps ssh a eof1 comparison of exp noeqvar and exp noeqvar noaccvar which only differ on the variability of the acc transport show nearly identical ssh a variability patterns over the ps correlation of the ssh a eof1 time series of both experiments is r 0 96 thus indicating that acc variability does not significantly affect the ssh a eof1 of the ps this does not mean that the acc has no impact on the ps interannual variability the acc transport variability has a larger influence on higher ssh a modes which as shown in previous work are more closely related to the dynamics of the ps circulation combes and matano 2018 to identify the contribution of local wind forcing to the ps interannual variability we first correlated the ssh a eof1 of exp control to the time series of the local zonal and meridional wind stress anomaly at every model grid point the correlation is weak and not statistically significant fig 7a a similar calculation using exp noeqvar however shows a high and statistically significant correlation along the southern pacific coast of south america fig 7b c thus suggesting that propagation of pacific equatorial anomalies in exp control reduces the correlation value between the wind stress anomaly variability and the ssh a eof1 the influence of wind stress forcing on the ssh a eof1 variability is such that equatorward poleward coastal wind stress off southern chile generates positive negative local coastal ssh a which then reaches the ps ancillary correlation between the ssh a eof1 of exp control and a multiple linear regression of wind stress anomaly and ssh eq time series show correlations similar to those between exp noeqvar and wind stress anomaly fig 7b which reach values up to r 0 71 off southern chile fig 7d the model experiments therefore indicate that the propagating ssh eq modulated by the wind stress off southern chile is highly correlated with the ssh a of the ps to further corroborate the lack of influence of local wind stress anomaly variability over the ssh a eof1 we run exp nowindvar70 w which lacks wind stress anomaly forcing variability over the ps as expected the ssh a eof1 of this experiment and exp control are highly correlated r 0 87 it is worth to note that the lack of influence of local wind stress anomaly over the ps ssh a variability is restricted to the temporal structure of the ssh a eof1 as shown in our previous works local wind stress anomaly is the dominant driver of the higher more dynamically significant modes of ssh a variability combes and matano 2018 model results however indicate that local wind stress anomaly forcing does not significantly influence the time series of the ssh a eof1 which is the dominant mode of ssh a variability in the southern patagonia region this mode is largely modulated by perturbations generated in the equatorial pacific that propagate to the ps along the continental slope of the pacific coast to complement the previous analysis we constructed the cross wavelet transform and wavelet coherence maps between the time series of the ssh a eof1 variability and the ssh eq variability and the same maps between the time series of the ssh a eof1 variability and the wind stress anomaly variability off southern chile fig 8 the times series of the wind stress anomaly is chosen where the correlation coefficient is the highest between the ssh a eof1 and wind stress anomaly variability from exp noeqvar blue dot in fig 7b the wavelet analyses indicate that both the wind stress blue in fig 8c and ssh eq red in fig 8c modulate the ssh a eof1 variability in particular at periodicities higher than 2 years periodicities of common power fig 8a b at periodicities lower than 2 years i e high frequency however the ssh eq and local wind stress anomaly contribute to the ssh a eof1 variability during different time periods for example the local wind stress anomaly is the principal contributor for the period 1995 2005 note that a strong positive ssh a at the equator is in phase with an upwelling favorable wind stress anomaly inducing negative ssh a off southern chile this is particularly apparent during strong el niño events fig 8d and according to montecinos and gomez 2010 more evident during september october november thus during strong el niño events strong downwelling positive ssh a coastally trapped waves propagate along the southeast pacific and are farther hampered by upwelling favorable wind stress anomaly off southern chile inducing negative ssh a before reaching the southern ps 4 summary and conclusion this article identifies the drivers of the low frequency variability of the ssh a over the ps for the period 1979 2012 a suite of process oriented model experiments assess the contributions of equatorial ssha and wind driven ssh a local and remote forcings on the dominant mode of ssh a variability eof1 it is concluded that the dominant mode of ssh a variability over the ps is driven by the propagation of ssh a anomalies that are generated in the pacific ssh a over the ps is influenced by the wind stress forcing from the offshore region of southern chile and by the propagation of equatorial sea surface height anomalies the analysis of the model ssh a is consistent with satellite observations fig 9 over the period 2000 2008 aviso and quikscat data common period there is a statistically significant correlation between the ssh a eof1 variability derived from the aviso altimetry and the time series defined as a multiple linear regression of the equatorial ssh a aviso ssh eq variability and the quikscat satellite wind stress anomaly variability off southern chile fig 9b the correlation coefficient between the ssh a eof1 variability and the wind stress anomaly off southern chile is higher during the period 2000 2008 fig 9a than for the period 1979 2012 fig 7a this is consistent with the model output where the correlation coefficient between the eof1 and meridional velocity off southern chile is 0 28 over the period 1979 2012 fig 7a and 0 54 over the period 2000 2008 this can be explained by a weaker equatorial ssh a variability during the period 2000 2008 compared to the period 1979 2012 where strong el niño events e g 1982 1998 occur fig 6b this mode has however a weak dynamical effect fig 3b in fact the model solution indicates that it is the second mode of the ssh a variability consistent with altimetry data that is highly correlated with the first mode of the shelf circulation variability fig 4c the first mode of the shelf circulation variability corresponds to the variations of the north south shelf transport detailed in combes and matano 2018 the latter mode is found to be driven by the local wind stress and shows a significant correlation with the time variations of the southern annular mode index acknowledgments we acknowledge the financial support of

24019,the current feedback cfb to the atmosphere simply represents the influence of the surface oceanic currents on near surface wind and surface stress as the cfb has a significant influence on the oceanic circulation it is crucial to implement it properly in a coupled ocean atmosphere model in this study we first detail the modifications to be implemented into atmospheric models to account for the cfb in the computation of air sea fluxes the relative winds i e the difference between the near surface winds and the surface oceanic currents instead of absolute winds have to be used modification m1 however because of the implicit treatment of the bottom boundary condition in most atmospheric models the use of relative winds also involves a modification of the tridiagonal problem associated with the discretization of the vertical turbulent viscosity modification m2 secondly we show both analytically and using global coupled simulations that omitting m2 leads to a large underestimation of the surface stress curl response to the cfb and subsequently of the coupling coefficient between mesoscale surface stress curl and surface current vorticity as a consequence the dampening of the mesoscale activity induced by the cfb is strongly reduced by a minimum a factor of 2 or more the practical implementation of the cfb must be done carefully in the atmospheric component of a coupled model in order to avoid a large underestimation of the cfb effect on the oceanic circulation keywords coupled ocean atmosphere models current feedback to the atmosphere implementation of the current feedback in coupled models consequences of a poor implementation oceanic mesoscale activity 1 introduction we refer to the current feedback cfb to the atmosphere as the influence of the oceanic surface currents onto the atmospheric wind and stress in the past assuming that the oceanic motions are much weaker than the wind the cfb has been largely ignored by the atmospheric and oceanic modeling communities however numerous studies have shown consequent effects on the oceanic and atmospheric dynamics and thermodynamics the cfb modifies directly the surface stress bye 1985 and has a bottom up effect on the wind i e a negative stress anomaly causes a positive surface wind anomaly renault et al 2016a 2019a a simulation that neglects the cfb do not represent the stress anomalies induced by the cfb as observed by satellite renault et al 2017a 2019a from an atmospheric perspective the cfb leads to small changes in the mean momentum and heat fluxes 1 to 7 duhaut and straub 2006 with the exception of regions characterized with strong currents and relatively weak wind such as e g the equatorial band where the cfb can reduce the median wind stress magnitude by 20 kelly et al 2001 at the mesoscale the cfb mainly affects the stress wind curl but does not have a systematic effect on its magnitude nor divergence o neill et al 2003 chelton et al 2004 renault et al 2016a both wind and stress response to the cfb are generally relatively weak with respect to their absolute values except potentially over regions with strong currents e g tidal currents and weak winds for instance a surface current of 1 m s 1 causes a 10 m wind anomaly of 0 3 m s 1 see renault et al 2019a however because these anomalies are collocated over the eddies and are systematic they play an important role in the determination of the transfer of energy between the ocean and the atmosphere and in the determination of the ocean dynamic renault et al 2019a from the oceanic point of view the cfb leads to a slow down of the mean oceanic circulation pacanowski 1987 luo et al 2005 and to a dampening of the oceanic mesoscale and submesoscale activity by inducing sinks of energy from the currents to the atmosphere and a subsequent eddy killing process dewar and flierl 1987 duhaut and straub 2006 dawe and thompson 2006 eden and dietze 2009 xu and scott 2008 seo et al 2016 renault et al 2016a 2017b oerder et al 2018 renault et al 2018 the cfb also partly controls the western boundary currents by reducing the eddy mean flow interaction renault et al 2016b 2017a 2019b finally by altering the mean oceanic circulation and the sea surface temperature the cfb can indirectly change the precipitation rate renault et al 2017a hence it seems important to take into account properly the cfb in a coupled model in this regard the objective of this study is twofold the first aim is to describe the necessary modifications that have to be done in the atmospheric models to accurately resolve the cfb this implies modifications in the implementation of the bulk formula m1 but also in some cases in the tridiagonal problem associated with the implicit treatment of vertical turbulent mixing m2 m1 is necessary to properly account for the cfb effect on wind stress norm while m2 is necessary to properly compute the modification of wind stress orientation by cfb effect then this study strives to characterize the theoretical and practical consequences of a misrepresentation of the cfb in an atmospheric model by applying a simple approach based on a taylor expansion but also by using a global high resolution ocean atmosphere coupled model the main focus is on the sensitivity of the stress response to the cfb implementation in coupled ocean atmosphere models the modifications that have to be done in an atmospheric model are described and discussed in section 2 sections 3 and 4 aim to characterize the sensitivity of the cfb surface stress response to the modifications that have to be implemented in an atmospheric model from analytical and global coupled models perspectives respectively the results are then discussed and summarized in section 5 2 implementing the current feedback in a coupled model in this section we discuss the practical implementation of the oceanic current feedback within a coupled model as described below such implementation differs depending on how the boundary condition at the air sea interface for the vertical turbulent viscosity term is discretized in time in the atmospheric model 2 1 surface layer atmosphere coupling let us consider the following diffusion equation for an air column 1 t u a z ν z u a with u a the horizontal atmospheric velocity vector ν the turbulent viscosity given by an adequate boundary layer parameterization scheme and z the vertical direction in numerical models the vertical turbulent viscosity is systematically treated implicitly in time for stability reasons due to the small vertical grid distance relative to the horizontal one typically used in most configurations when the cfb is accounted for the boundary condition for 1 at the air sea interface is ρ a ν z u a z 0 τ ρ a c d u a 0 u o 0 u a 0 u o 0 with τ the surface wind stress u o 0 the surface oceanic currents u a 0 the surface winds and c d a drag coefficient provided by a surface layer parameterization a k a bulk formulation and computed using u o 0 since 1 is treated implicitly in time an estimate of τ n 1 at time t n 1 n 1 δ t is required to advance from t n to t n 1 with δ t the time step for the temporal discretization at this point we can distinguish two possible configurations both leading to a consistent discretization of the stress boundary condition 1 the momentum flux computation is done outside the atmospheric model e g in the coupler in this case the wind stress would necessarily be 2 τ n 1 ρ a c d u a 0 n u o 0 u a 0 n u o 0 since no information at time n 1 is available this case is often referred to as explicit flux coupling and is subject to a stability constraint lemarié et al 2015 beljaars et al 2017 in 2 u o 0 can either represent an instantaneous value at time n or a temporal average depending on the ocean atmosphere coupling algorithm 2 the momentum flux is computed inside the atmospheric model making it possible to treat the surface boundary condition implicitly in time we would thus consider that 3 τ n 1 ρ a c d u a 0 n u o 0 u a 0 n 1 u o 0 this case is often referred to as implicit flux coupling and is expected not to raise any stability issue beljaars et al 2017 their app b since 3 involves u a 0 n 1 it requires adjustments in the tridiagonal matrix associated with the implicit treatment of 1 note that the numerically correct boundary condition τ n 1 ρ a c d u a 0 n 1 u o 0 u a 0 n 1 u o 0 is never used in practice in numerical models because it would require the solution of an iterative problem this is the reason why the linearized boundary condition 3 is considered here 2 2 implications for cfb implementation in the case of an explicit flux coupling adding the oceanic currents feedback does not require any modification of the atmospheric and oceanic codes it is only necessary to replace the absolute wind u a 0 by the relative wind u a 0 u o 0 within the surface layer parameterization to compute c d and when computing the wind stress when an implicit flux coupling is used the same modification is required in the surface layer parameterization m1 but it is also needed to adjust the implicit treatment of the vertical viscous term m2 indeed with boundary condition 3 the discretization of 1 in the bottom most grid cell with index k 1 i e u a k 1 u a 0 in the atmospheric model would be 4 1 ν 3 2 δ t δ z 1 δ z 3 2 c d δ t δ z 1 u a k 1 n u o 0 u a k 1 n 1 ν 3 2 δ t δ z 1 δ z 3 2 u a k 2 n 1 u a k 1 n c d δ t δ z 1 u a k 1 n u o 0 u o 0 where δ z 1 is the thickness of the grid cell k 1 δ z 3 2 the distance between the centers of grid cells k 1 and k 2 and ν 3 2 the turbulent viscosity at the interface between grid cells k 1 and k 2 see 16 for all the details on the derivation of 4 in 4 the second term in the right hand side is non zero only when cfb is included omitting this term i e omitting modification m2 would amount to consider an incorrect boundary condition 5 τ n 1 ρ a c d u a 0 n u o 0 u a 0 n 1 as far as the oceanic model is concerned the cfb on the wind stress does not require any modifications besides providing u o 0 to the coupling interface unlike discretizations 2 and 3 discretization 5 is inconsistent in the sense that for δ t 0 it does not converge toward the correct continuous form of the bottom boundary condition since the majority of atmospheric models uses an implicit flux coupling we study the consequences of an incomplete implementation of the cfb effect in this case in the next section 3 analytical analysis in the following we assume that the sensitivity of the drag coefficient c d to the cfb is negligibly weak and that δ t is sufficiently small to consider that u a 0 u o 0 and u a 0 u o 0 are evaluated at the same moment in time doing so we can express the wind stress using the generic formulation 6 τ α λ ρ a c d u a 0 α u o 0 u a 0 λ u o 0 when the cfb is ignored we simply have α λ 0 0 while when the cfb is accounted for we have α λ 1 1 in the event the cfb is improperly implemented by omitting the second term in the rhs in 4 we would have α λ 1 0 considering that u o 0 u a 0 we easily obtain u a 0 u o 0 u a 0 e a u o 0 o u o 0 2 v o 0 2 u o 0 v o 0 e a u a 0 u a 0 where e a is a unit vector in the wind direction and u o 0 u o 0 v o 0 in the spirit of 2 8 10 32 or 28 using this taylor expansion we can express τ α λ the stress difference between τ α λ and τ 0 0 as 7 τ α λ ρ a c d λ u a 0 u o 0 α e a u o 0 u a 0 ρ a c d u a 0 u o 0 λ e o α e a e o e a with e o the unit vector in the oceanic surface currents direction first we can notice that when the winds and the currents are aligned we exactly have τ 1 1 2 τ 1 0 if we express all the vectors in the orthonormal basis formed by the two vectors e 1 1 0 and e 2 0 1 such that e 1 e a the term in curly bracket in 7 is equal to v α λ α λ cos θ λ sin θ with θ the angle between the winds and the currents in particular we would have v 1 1 2 cos θ sin θ and v 1 0 cos θ 0 in fig 1 the norms v 1 1 and v 1 0 as well as the angle between v 1 1 and v 1 0 are represented as functions of the angle θ between the winds and the oceanic currents it can readily be seen that by omitting the second term in the rhs in 4 the intensity of the stress anomalies induced by the cfb are divided by at least two and even more than two when the angle θ between the surface winds and currents is larger than 45 the orientation of the stress anomaly is also largely incorrect fig 1 right panel using τ 1 0 instead of τ 1 1 largely underestimates the cfb effect on the stress curl and thus the mesoscale activity dampening see next section however this simple analytical development does not consider the wind response to the cfb that will partly counteract the stress response renault et al 2016a additionally as shown by 24 c d can also be impacted by the cfb but its response strongly depends on the bulk formula used 4 characterizing the surface stress response to the current feedback in coupled simulations 4 1 model configuration ec earth is a global coupled climate model hazeleger et al 2012 that has been developed by a consortium of european institutes that consist presently of 27 research institutes http www ec earth org it is used in a wide range of studies spanning in time from paleoresearch to climate projections including also seasonal and decadal forecasts the atmospheric component of ec earth is the integrated forecast system ifs based on version cycle 36r4 of the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf it uses a reduced gaussian grid with 91 vertical levels the horizontal domain is based on a spectral truncation at t1279 corresponding to a nominal spatial resolution of 15 km globally the h tessel model is used for the land surface and is an integral part of the ifs atmospheric model for more details see 11 the ocean component is the nucleus for european modelling of the ocean nemo madec et al 2015 version 3 6 it uses a tri polar grid with poles over northern north america siberia and antarctica with a resolution of about 1 12 the so called orca12 configuration and 75 vertical levels nemo includes the louvain la neuve sea ice model version 3 lim3 vancoppenolle et al 2012 which is a dynamic thermodynamic sea ice model with 5 ice thickness categories the atmosphere land and ocean sea ice components are coupled through the oasis mct ocean atmosphere sea ice soil coupler craig et al 2017 at hourly frequency 4 2 coupled simulations a set of three global coupled simulations is performed with the setup described in section 4 1 over a period of 1 day as explained hereafter this time period is long enough to illustrate the stress response to the cfb and its sensitivity to the modifications of the bulk formula m1 and of the tridiagonal problem associated with the discretization of the vertical turbulent mixing m2 described in section 2 however to verify it the simulations have also been run for a period of 1 month the coupled simulations only differ by the degree of coupling they consider n o c r t does not consider the cfb and thus uses the absolute wind to estimate the surface stress see section 2 and eq 6 with α λ 0 0 c r t 10 considers only m1 omitting m2 α λ 1 0 whereas c r t 11 considers both m1 and m2 α λ 1 1 the three simulations start from the same restart after a 10 years spin up that uses the n o c r t configuration note the state of the ocean in the restart does not really matter here because only the stress response to the cfb is assessed and not directly the oceanic response 4 3 mesoscale stress response to the cfb as shown in sections 2 and 3 the cfb instantaneously induces surface stress anomalies that are collocated right over the surface currents and are anti correlated e g a negative surface current mesoscale anomaly causes a positive surface stress mesoscale anomaly and vice versa the wind response is mainly situated at the near surface renault et al 2016a its adjustment time corresponds to the adjustment time of the planetary boundary layer pbl to a change in the surface boundary condition which is roughly 1 h the wind response only partially counteracts the surface stress changes e g a decrease of the surface stress causes an increase of the wind renault et al 2016a at the mesoscale the stress response to the cfb is usually assessed using its curl because mesoscale currents are very nearly geostrophic and mainly non divergent o neill et al 2003 chelton et al 2004 renault et al 2016a and because it allows to properly characterize the stress response renault et al 2017b 2019a the impact of the cfb at the oceanic mesoscale on the surface stress curl in c r t 10 and c r t 11 is estimated in two steps first the mesoscale surface stress curl and surface current vorticity are estimated for each simulations using a high pass gaussian spatial filter with a 250 km cut off as in renault et al 2017b then because after one day the atmospheric and oceanic large scale circulations and the sea surface temperature are not significantly different in all the simulations not shown the cfb impacts in c r t 10 and c r t 11 can simply be isolated by computing the mesoscale surface stress curl difference between these simulations and nocrt a one day simulation has therefore the advantage to have a very low cost in terms of computational hours and also to allow to cleanly remove from the surface stress curl both weather related variability and thermal feedback imprint fig 2 depicts the mesoscale surface stress curl and surface currents vorticity anomalies as estimated from c r t 10 and c r t 11 over a region that encompasses the gulf stream in c r t 11 where the cfb is fully taken into account consistent with e g 3 and 30 the surface currents have a clear imprint on the mesoscale surface stress curl over the gulf stream path and over mesoscale eddies a negative current vorticity causes a positive stress curl anomaly by contrast in c r t 10 consistent with section 3 the surface stress curl anomalies are largely reduced because the changes of the surface stress orientation are omitted sections 2 and 3 note that the use of a 1 month simulation leads to similar results in terms of location and intensity of the induced stress curl anomalies however the synoptic variability has to be removed by using a 29 day average and the tfb impact on the stress curl cannot be properly removed renault et al 2019a 4 4 cfb coupling coefficient and sinks of energy at the mesoscale the surface stress anomalies induced by the cfb cause sinks of energy from the surface currents to the atmosphere which in turn are responsible of the eddy killing effect in the ocean i e a large dampening of the mesoscale activity by 30 at a quasi global scale renault et al 2019a jullien et al 2019 as suggested by 28 the sinks of energy can be predicted as the product of the coupling coefficient between the mesoscale surface current and the mesoscale surface stress s τ and the eddy kinetic energy e k e a measure of the mesoscale activity s τ allows to characterize the efficiency of the eddy killing the more negative the s τ the more efficient the eddy killing and thus the larger the dampening of the mesoscale activity s τ can therefore be used as a proxy of a correct implementation of the cfb in a coupled model as in 28 and 26 s τ is estimated as the slope of the linear regression between mesoscale surface stress curl and oceanic current vorticity estimated following the method described above and over a given region s τ is characterized by spatial and temporal variations that are driven by the magnitude of the near surface wind renault et al 2017b here s τ is estimated over the global domain and over the gulf stream fig 3 in c r t 11 over the gulf stream s τ 1 44 1 0 2 n s m 3 whereas as the global scale s τ 0 65 1 0 2 n s m 3 i e weaker because the global domain includes many regions of much weaker stress curl and current vorticity mesoscale variability than the gulf stream note that the absolute values of s τ estimated here are only valid for this specific day as s τ is mainly driven by the near surface wind from c r t 11 to c r t 10 at the global scale and over the gulf stream s τ is reduced by a factor 3 because in c r t 10 the cfb is improperly implemented as it omits m2 i e α λ 1 0 and thus the rectification of the stress orientation similar results are found for any other regions of the world ocean not shown to verify the validity of the 1 day simulation s τ is also estimated using 1 month simulations and using spatial and temporal filter as in 26 an underestimation by a factor of at least 2 5 is found which is consistent with the one day simulations results the s τ reduction found from the coupled simulations is also consistent with the analytical prediction presented in the previous section but does take the wind response and the c d variations into account from an oceanic perspective the systematic underestimation of s τ in c r t 10 will reduce the sinks of energy induced by the cfb by a factor of at least 2 and thus cause an underestimation of the dampening of the mesoscale activity by roughly the same order of magnitude renault et al 2017b 5 conclusion the cfb by causing surface stress anomalies modulates the oceanic circulation by slowing down the mean oceanic circulation and dampening the mesoscale activity and by altering the western boundary currents in order to properly account for its effect on the wind stress magnitude and orientation in most coupled models i e those with an implicit coupling where the wind stress computed within the atmospheric model we have shown that two modifications are needed both in the bulk formula modification m1 but also of the tridiagonal problem associated with the discretization of the vertical turbulent mixing modification m2 m1 insures to consider the effect of the cfb on the friction velocity whereas m2 allows to fully take into account the cfb effect on the surface stress orientation which is the main effect of the cfb by using a simple analytical development of the stress estimation in a bulk formula we furthermore confirm that ignoring m2 should lead to an underestimation of the stress response to the cfb by a factor of at least 2 however this simple approach does not take into account e g the surface drag nor the wind responses to the cfb using realistic global coupled simulations we finally show that ignoring m2 actually causes an even larger underestimation of the stress response and of the coupling coefficient s τ by a factor of 3 s τ controls the sinks of energy and the eddy killing process induced by the cfb the more negative the s τ the more efficient the eddy killing and thus the dampening of the mesoscale activity ignoring m2 can thus lead to an underestimation of the mesoscale activity dampening by a factor of 3 note that for coarse resolution models i e models that do not resolve the oceanic mesoscale activity ignoring m2 should lead to a poor representation of the slow down of the mean currents induced by the cfb luo et al 2005 renault et al 2016b to the

24019,the current feedback cfb to the atmosphere simply represents the influence of the surface oceanic currents on near surface wind and surface stress as the cfb has a significant influence on the oceanic circulation it is crucial to implement it properly in a coupled ocean atmosphere model in this study we first detail the modifications to be implemented into atmospheric models to account for the cfb in the computation of air sea fluxes the relative winds i e the difference between the near surface winds and the surface oceanic currents instead of absolute winds have to be used modification m1 however because of the implicit treatment of the bottom boundary condition in most atmospheric models the use of relative winds also involves a modification of the tridiagonal problem associated with the discretization of the vertical turbulent viscosity modification m2 secondly we show both analytically and using global coupled simulations that omitting m2 leads to a large underestimation of the surface stress curl response to the cfb and subsequently of the coupling coefficient between mesoscale surface stress curl and surface current vorticity as a consequence the dampening of the mesoscale activity induced by the cfb is strongly reduced by a minimum a factor of 2 or more the practical implementation of the cfb must be done carefully in the atmospheric component of a coupled model in order to avoid a large underestimation of the cfb effect on the oceanic circulation keywords coupled ocean atmosphere models current feedback to the atmosphere implementation of the current feedback in coupled models consequences of a poor implementation oceanic mesoscale activity 1 introduction we refer to the current feedback cfb to the atmosphere as the influence of the oceanic surface currents onto the atmospheric wind and stress in the past assuming that the oceanic motions are much weaker than the wind the cfb has been largely ignored by the atmospheric and oceanic modeling communities however numerous studies have shown consequent effects on the oceanic and atmospheric dynamics and thermodynamics the cfb modifies directly the surface stress bye 1985 and has a bottom up effect on the wind i e a negative stress anomaly causes a positive surface wind anomaly renault et al 2016a 2019a a simulation that neglects the cfb do not represent the stress anomalies induced by the cfb as observed by satellite renault et al 2017a 2019a from an atmospheric perspective the cfb leads to small changes in the mean momentum and heat fluxes 1 to 7 duhaut and straub 2006 with the exception of regions characterized with strong currents and relatively weak wind such as e g the equatorial band where the cfb can reduce the median wind stress magnitude by 20 kelly et al 2001 at the mesoscale the cfb mainly affects the stress wind curl but does not have a systematic effect on its magnitude nor divergence o neill et al 2003 chelton et al 2004 renault et al 2016a both wind and stress response to the cfb are generally relatively weak with respect to their absolute values except potentially over regions with strong currents e g tidal currents and weak winds for instance a surface current of 1 m s 1 causes a 10 m wind anomaly of 0 3 m s 1 see renault et al 2019a however because these anomalies are collocated over the eddies and are systematic they play an important role in the determination of the transfer of energy between the ocean and the atmosphere and in the determination of the ocean dynamic renault et al 2019a from the oceanic point of view the cfb leads to a slow down of the mean oceanic circulation pacanowski 1987 luo et al 2005 and to a dampening of the oceanic mesoscale and submesoscale activity by inducing sinks of energy from the currents to the atmosphere and a subsequent eddy killing process dewar and flierl 1987 duhaut and straub 2006 dawe and thompson 2006 eden and dietze 2009 xu and scott 2008 seo et al 2016 renault et al 2016a 2017b oerder et al 2018 renault et al 2018 the cfb also partly controls the western boundary currents by reducing the eddy mean flow interaction renault et al 2016b 2017a 2019b finally by altering the mean oceanic circulation and the sea surface temperature the cfb can indirectly change the precipitation rate renault et al 2017a hence it seems important to take into account properly the cfb in a coupled model in this regard the objective of this study is twofold the first aim is to describe the necessary modifications that have to be done in the atmospheric models to accurately resolve the cfb this implies modifications in the implementation of the bulk formula m1 but also in some cases in the tridiagonal problem associated with the implicit treatment of vertical turbulent mixing m2 m1 is necessary to properly account for the cfb effect on wind stress norm while m2 is necessary to properly compute the modification of wind stress orientation by cfb effect then this study strives to characterize the theoretical and practical consequences of a misrepresentation of the cfb in an atmospheric model by applying a simple approach based on a taylor expansion but also by using a global high resolution ocean atmosphere coupled model the main focus is on the sensitivity of the stress response to the cfb implementation in coupled ocean atmosphere models the modifications that have to be done in an atmospheric model are described and discussed in section 2 sections 3 and 4 aim to characterize the sensitivity of the cfb surface stress response to the modifications that have to be implemented in an atmospheric model from analytical and global coupled models perspectives respectively the results are then discussed and summarized in section 5 2 implementing the current feedback in a coupled model in this section we discuss the practical implementation of the oceanic current feedback within a coupled model as described below such implementation differs depending on how the boundary condition at the air sea interface for the vertical turbulent viscosity term is discretized in time in the atmospheric model 2 1 surface layer atmosphere coupling let us consider the following diffusion equation for an air column 1 t u a z ν z u a with u a the horizontal atmospheric velocity vector ν the turbulent viscosity given by an adequate boundary layer parameterization scheme and z the vertical direction in numerical models the vertical turbulent viscosity is systematically treated implicitly in time for stability reasons due to the small vertical grid distance relative to the horizontal one typically used in most configurations when the cfb is accounted for the boundary condition for 1 at the air sea interface is ρ a ν z u a z 0 τ ρ a c d u a 0 u o 0 u a 0 u o 0 with τ the surface wind stress u o 0 the surface oceanic currents u a 0 the surface winds and c d a drag coefficient provided by a surface layer parameterization a k a bulk formulation and computed using u o 0 since 1 is treated implicitly in time an estimate of τ n 1 at time t n 1 n 1 δ t is required to advance from t n to t n 1 with δ t the time step for the temporal discretization at this point we can distinguish two possible configurations both leading to a consistent discretization of the stress boundary condition 1 the momentum flux computation is done outside the atmospheric model e g in the coupler in this case the wind stress would necessarily be 2 τ n 1 ρ a c d u a 0 n u o 0 u a 0 n u o 0 since no information at time n 1 is available this case is often referred to as explicit flux coupling and is subject to a stability constraint lemarié et al 2015 beljaars et al 2017 in 2 u o 0 can either represent an instantaneous value at time n or a temporal average depending on the ocean atmosphere coupling algorithm 2 the momentum flux is computed inside the atmospheric model making it possible to treat the surface boundary condition implicitly in time we would thus consider that 3 τ n 1 ρ a c d u a 0 n u o 0 u a 0 n 1 u o 0 this case is often referred to as implicit flux coupling and is expected not to raise any stability issue beljaars et al 2017 their app b since 3 involves u a 0 n 1 it requires adjustments in the tridiagonal matrix associated with the implicit treatment of 1 note that the numerically correct boundary condition τ n 1 ρ a c d u a 0 n 1 u o 0 u a 0 n 1 u o 0 is never used in practice in numerical models because it would require the solution of an iterative problem this is the reason why the linearized boundary condition 3 is considered here 2 2 implications for cfb implementation in the case of an explicit flux coupling adding the oceanic currents feedback does not require any modification of the atmospheric and oceanic codes it is only necessary to replace the absolute wind u a 0 by the relative wind u a 0 u o 0 within the surface layer parameterization to compute c d and when computing the wind stress when an implicit flux coupling is used the same modification is required in the surface layer parameterization m1 but it is also needed to adjust the implicit treatment of the vertical viscous term m2 indeed with boundary condition 3 the discretization of 1 in the bottom most grid cell with index k 1 i e u a k 1 u a 0 in the atmospheric model would be 4 1 ν 3 2 δ t δ z 1 δ z 3 2 c d δ t δ z 1 u a k 1 n u o 0 u a k 1 n 1 ν 3 2 δ t δ z 1 δ z 3 2 u a k 2 n 1 u a k 1 n c d δ t δ z 1 u a k 1 n u o 0 u o 0 where δ z 1 is the thickness of the grid cell k 1 δ z 3 2 the distance between the centers of grid cells k 1 and k 2 and ν 3 2 the turbulent viscosity at the interface between grid cells k 1 and k 2 see 16 for all the details on the derivation of 4 in 4 the second term in the right hand side is non zero only when cfb is included omitting this term i e omitting modification m2 would amount to consider an incorrect boundary condition 5 τ n 1 ρ a c d u a 0 n u o 0 u a 0 n 1 as far as the oceanic model is concerned the cfb on the wind stress does not require any modifications besides providing u o 0 to the coupling interface unlike discretizations 2 and 3 discretization 5 is inconsistent in the sense that for δ t 0 it does not converge toward the correct continuous form of the bottom boundary condition since the majority of atmospheric models uses an implicit flux coupling we study the consequences of an incomplete implementation of the cfb effect in this case in the next section 3 analytical analysis in the following we assume that the sensitivity of the drag coefficient c d to the cfb is negligibly weak and that δ t is sufficiently small to consider that u a 0 u o 0 and u a 0 u o 0 are evaluated at the same moment in time doing so we can express the wind stress using the generic formulation 6 τ α λ ρ a c d u a 0 α u o 0 u a 0 λ u o 0 when the cfb is ignored we simply have α λ 0 0 while when the cfb is accounted for we have α λ 1 1 in the event the cfb is improperly implemented by omitting the second term in the rhs in 4 we would have α λ 1 0 considering that u o 0 u a 0 we easily obtain u a 0 u o 0 u a 0 e a u o 0 o u o 0 2 v o 0 2 u o 0 v o 0 e a u a 0 u a 0 where e a is a unit vector in the wind direction and u o 0 u o 0 v o 0 in the spirit of 2 8 10 32 or 28 using this taylor expansion we can express τ α λ the stress difference between τ α λ and τ 0 0 as 7 τ α λ ρ a c d λ u a 0 u o 0 α e a u o 0 u a 0 ρ a c d u a 0 u o 0 λ e o α e a e o e a with e o the unit vector in the oceanic surface currents direction first we can notice that when the winds and the currents are aligned we exactly have τ 1 1 2 τ 1 0 if we express all the vectors in the orthonormal basis formed by the two vectors e 1 1 0 and e 2 0 1 such that e 1 e a the term in curly bracket in 7 is equal to v α λ α λ cos θ λ sin θ with θ the angle between the winds and the currents in particular we would have v 1 1 2 cos θ sin θ and v 1 0 cos θ 0 in fig 1 the norms v 1 1 and v 1 0 as well as the angle between v 1 1 and v 1 0 are represented as functions of the angle θ between the winds and the oceanic currents it can readily be seen that by omitting the second term in the rhs in 4 the intensity of the stress anomalies induced by the cfb are divided by at least two and even more than two when the angle θ between the surface winds and currents is larger than 45 the orientation of the stress anomaly is also largely incorrect fig 1 right panel using τ 1 0 instead of τ 1 1 largely underestimates the cfb effect on the stress curl and thus the mesoscale activity dampening see next section however this simple analytical development does not consider the wind response to the cfb that will partly counteract the stress response renault et al 2016a additionally as shown by 24 c d can also be impacted by the cfb but its response strongly depends on the bulk formula used 4 characterizing the surface stress response to the current feedback in coupled simulations 4 1 model configuration ec earth is a global coupled climate model hazeleger et al 2012 that has been developed by a consortium of european institutes that consist presently of 27 research institutes http www ec earth org it is used in a wide range of studies spanning in time from paleoresearch to climate projections including also seasonal and decadal forecasts the atmospheric component of ec earth is the integrated forecast system ifs based on version cycle 36r4 of the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf it uses a reduced gaussian grid with 91 vertical levels the horizontal domain is based on a spectral truncation at t1279 corresponding to a nominal spatial resolution of 15 km globally the h tessel model is used for the land surface and is an integral part of the ifs atmospheric model for more details see 11 the ocean component is the nucleus for european modelling of the ocean nemo madec et al 2015 version 3 6 it uses a tri polar grid with poles over northern north america siberia and antarctica with a resolution of about 1 12 the so called orca12 configuration and 75 vertical levels nemo includes the louvain la neuve sea ice model version 3 lim3 vancoppenolle et al 2012 which is a dynamic thermodynamic sea ice model with 5 ice thickness categories the atmosphere land and ocean sea ice components are coupled through the oasis mct ocean atmosphere sea ice soil coupler craig et al 2017 at hourly frequency 4 2 coupled simulations a set of three global coupled simulations is performed with the setup described in section 4 1 over a period of 1 day as explained hereafter this time period is long enough to illustrate the stress response to the cfb and its sensitivity to the modifications of the bulk formula m1 and of the tridiagonal problem associated with the discretization of the vertical turbulent mixing m2 described in section 2 however to verify it the simulations have also been run for a period of 1 month the coupled simulations only differ by the degree of coupling they consider n o c r t does not consider the cfb and thus uses the absolute wind to estimate the surface stress see section 2 and eq 6 with α λ 0 0 c r t 10 considers only m1 omitting m2 α λ 1 0 whereas c r t 11 considers both m1 and m2 α λ 1 1 the three simulations start from the same restart after a 10 years spin up that uses the n o c r t configuration note the state of the ocean in the restart does not really matter here because only the stress response to the cfb is assessed and not directly the oceanic response 4 3 mesoscale stress response to the cfb as shown in sections 2 and 3 the cfb instantaneously induces surface stress anomalies that are collocated right over the surface currents and are anti correlated e g a negative surface current mesoscale anomaly causes a positive surface stress mesoscale anomaly and vice versa the wind response is mainly situated at the near surface renault et al 2016a its adjustment time corresponds to the adjustment time of the planetary boundary layer pbl to a change in the surface boundary condition which is roughly 1 h the wind response only partially counteracts the surface stress changes e g a decrease of the surface stress causes an increase of the wind renault et al 2016a at the mesoscale the stress response to the cfb is usually assessed using its curl because mesoscale currents are very nearly geostrophic and mainly non divergent o neill et al 2003 chelton et al 2004 renault et al 2016a and because it allows to properly characterize the stress response renault et al 2017b 2019a the impact of the cfb at the oceanic mesoscale on the surface stress curl in c r t 10 and c r t 11 is estimated in two steps first the mesoscale surface stress curl and surface current vorticity are estimated for each simulations using a high pass gaussian spatial filter with a 250 km cut off as in renault et al 2017b then because after one day the atmospheric and oceanic large scale circulations and the sea surface temperature are not significantly different in all the simulations not shown the cfb impacts in c r t 10 and c r t 11 can simply be isolated by computing the mesoscale surface stress curl difference between these simulations and nocrt a one day simulation has therefore the advantage to have a very low cost in terms of computational hours and also to allow to cleanly remove from the surface stress curl both weather related variability and thermal feedback imprint fig 2 depicts the mesoscale surface stress curl and surface currents vorticity anomalies as estimated from c r t 10 and c r t 11 over a region that encompasses the gulf stream in c r t 11 where the cfb is fully taken into account consistent with e g 3 and 30 the surface currents have a clear imprint on the mesoscale surface stress curl over the gulf stream path and over mesoscale eddies a negative current vorticity causes a positive stress curl anomaly by contrast in c r t 10 consistent with section 3 the surface stress curl anomalies are largely reduced because the changes of the surface stress orientation are omitted sections 2 and 3 note that the use of a 1 month simulation leads to similar results in terms of location and intensity of the induced stress curl anomalies however the synoptic variability has to be removed by using a 29 day average and the tfb impact on the stress curl cannot be properly removed renault et al 2019a 4 4 cfb coupling coefficient and sinks of energy at the mesoscale the surface stress anomalies induced by the cfb cause sinks of energy from the surface currents to the atmosphere which in turn are responsible of the eddy killing effect in the ocean i e a large dampening of the mesoscale activity by 30 at a quasi global scale renault et al 2019a jullien et al 2019 as suggested by 28 the sinks of energy can be predicted as the product of the coupling coefficient between the mesoscale surface current and the mesoscale surface stress s τ and the eddy kinetic energy e k e a measure of the mesoscale activity s τ allows to characterize the efficiency of the eddy killing the more negative the s τ the more efficient the eddy killing and thus the larger the dampening of the mesoscale activity s τ can therefore be used as a proxy of a correct implementation of the cfb in a coupled model as in 28 and 26 s τ is estimated as the slope of the linear regression between mesoscale surface stress curl and oceanic current vorticity estimated following the method described above and over a given region s τ is characterized by spatial and temporal variations that are driven by the magnitude of the near surface wind renault et al 2017b here s τ is estimated over the global domain and over the gulf stream fig 3 in c r t 11 over the gulf stream s τ 1 44 1 0 2 n s m 3 whereas as the global scale s τ 0 65 1 0 2 n s m 3 i e weaker because the global domain includes many regions of much weaker stress curl and current vorticity mesoscale variability than the gulf stream note that the absolute values of s τ estimated here are only valid for this specific day as s τ is mainly driven by the near surface wind from c r t 11 to c r t 10 at the global scale and over the gulf stream s τ is reduced by a factor 3 because in c r t 10 the cfb is improperly implemented as it omits m2 i e α λ 1 0 and thus the rectification of the stress orientation similar results are found for any other regions of the world ocean not shown to verify the validity of the 1 day simulation s τ is also estimated using 1 month simulations and using spatial and temporal filter as in 26 an underestimation by a factor of at least 2 5 is found which is consistent with the one day simulations results the s τ reduction found from the coupled simulations is also consistent with the analytical prediction presented in the previous section but does take the wind response and the c d variations into account from an oceanic perspective the systematic underestimation of s τ in c r t 10 will reduce the sinks of energy induced by the cfb by a factor of at least 2 and thus cause an underestimation of the dampening of the mesoscale activity by roughly the same order of magnitude renault et al 2017b 5 conclusion the cfb by causing surface stress anomalies modulates the oceanic circulation by slowing down the mean oceanic circulation and dampening the mesoscale activity and by altering the western boundary currents in order to properly account for its effect on the wind stress magnitude and orientation in most coupled models i e those with an implicit coupling where the wind stress computed within the atmospheric model we have shown that two modifications are needed both in the bulk formula modification m1 but also of the tridiagonal problem associated with the discretization of the vertical turbulent mixing modification m2 m1 insures to consider the effect of the cfb on the friction velocity whereas m2 allows to fully take into account the cfb effect on the surface stress orientation which is the main effect of the cfb by using a simple analytical development of the stress estimation in a bulk formula we furthermore confirm that ignoring m2 should lead to an underestimation of the stress response to the cfb by a factor of at least 2 however this simple approach does not take into account e g the surface drag nor the wind responses to the cfb using realistic global coupled simulations we finally show that ignoring m2 actually causes an even larger underestimation of the stress response and of the coupling coefficient s τ by a factor of 3 s τ controls the sinks of energy and the eddy killing process induced by the cfb the more negative the s τ the more efficient the eddy killing and thus the dampening of the mesoscale activity ignoring m2 can thus lead to an underestimation of the mesoscale activity dampening by a factor of 3 note that for coarse resolution models i e models that do not resolve the oceanic mesoscale activity ignoring m2 should lead to a poor representation of the slow down of the mean currents induced by the cfb luo et al 2005 renault et al 2016b to the authors knowledge cfb has been incorporated correctly i e both m1 and m2 in ifs atmospheric model used in section 4 and wrf models since version wrf3 3 1 in the latter m2 modification is somehow tedious because it must be done for each pbl parameterization since the building of the tridiagonal system is done locally in the parameterization routines and not through a common interface thus in

its implementation in atmospheric models we recommend this should be specified from now on finally future studies should aim at assessing the sensitivity of the surface stress and wind responses to
