9280,does the implementation of agricultural water conservation policy necessarily bring about a reduction in agricultural water extraction taking china s national agricultural water conservation outline proposed in 2012 as an example this paper uses the data of 31 provinces from 2000 to 2019 and employs an empirical strategy of difference in differences did to estimate the impact of the agricultural water conservation policy on agricultural water extraction the results show that the agricultural water conservation policy does not achieve the decline of agricultural water extraction but increases agricultural water extraction when addressing contemporaneous water related policies or estimating in subsample these results are robust the possible reason for this phenomenon is that the agricultural water conservation policy promotes agricultural production especially by increasing the sown area and irrigated area and the expansion of irrigated area is the main reason for the increase in agricultural water extraction moreover land potentiality for crop production may affect the water saving effect of the agricultural water conservation policy in which provinces with higher land potentiality will have less increase in agricultural water extraction caused by the agricultural water conservation policy therefore with the empirical evidence from china agricultural water conservation policy may not necessarily reduce agricultural water extraction and this phenomenon is always regarded as rebound effects in order to avoid the adverse impacts of the rebound effect agricultural water saving technologies can be strengthened in areas with high land potentiality for agricultural production and market oriented policies such as water rights reform can be employed to avoid excessive use of water resources in areas with severe over extraction keywords agricultural water conservation policy agricultural water saving effect water rebound effect water management china data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction fresh water is a critical resource for humans and nature as well as the foundation for long term sustainable economic development many countries throughout the world are experiencing water shortages as a result of global climate change increased demand for fresh water from economic development and increased environmental concerns hanjra and qureshi 2010 for example china s total water resources are estimated to be over 2812 billion m3 per year putting it in fifth place in the world jiang 2009 however due to its population of 1 3 billion people china has an extreme low per capita amount of water resources which is just a quarter of the world average level jun and chen 2001 another hazard to china s long term sustainable water use is the regional mismatch between agricultural development and water resources yu 2011 the agriculture is the largest sector in fresh water extraction which accounts for roughly 70 of the whole fresh water demand grafton et al 2018 therefore agricultural water extraction offers a lot of water saving potential in the future in china agriculture is also a major water user and the agricultural water extraction accounts for about 62 of the total economic and social water use on average and it is as high as 90 in some regions the china s central government indicates that the low water use efficiency in agriculture is the main reason for high proportion of agricultural water extraction thus the water saving potential is great besides promoting agricultural water conservation by expanding the irrigation area and then improving the water saving irrigation technology is an important measure to promote the sustainable use of water resources ensure the national food security and accelerate the economic development therefore promoting water saving irrigation is a major strategy in agricultural water conservation for sustainable economic and social development existing strategy of china s central government mainly focuses on improving water saving irrigation technology by the agricultural water conservation policy which aims to reduce agricultural water withdrawal specially in china the national agricultural water conservation outline was proposed in 2012 in order to expand the irrigation area and then improve the water saving irrigation technology national agricultural water conservation outline in china proposes four strategies for saving agricultural water extraction first agricultural water needs to be optimally allocated in areas without conventional irrigation conditions local pools will be used to collect rainwater for irrigation second the structure of agricultural production should be adjusted reasonably in areas with water shortages it is necessary to strictly limit the cultivation of crops with high water use and encourage the cultivation of crops with less water use and high added value thirdly agricultural water saving irrigation technology should be improved in water scarce areas high efficiency water saving irrigation and water fertilizer integration technologies such as sprinkler irrigation micro irrigation and drip irrigation under film should be actively promoted fourthly biotechnology water saving measures also should be promoted the drought tolerant and high yielding varieties should be used to improve the utilization rate of natural rainfall besides in drought prone areas and soil erosion prone areas conservation tillage techniques should be promoted the four strategies are used to improve agricultural water use efficiency especially by enhancing water saving irrigation technologies the improvement of water use efficiency by agricultural water conservation policy can reduce the water extraction if the demand for water resources in agricultural production is constant however the agricultural water conservation policy ensures the demand for water resources in agricultural production which will promote agricultural development and increase the demand for water especially by increasing irrigated area which is also known as rebound effects therefore whether the agricultural water conservation policy can reduce the agricultural water extraction still needs to be tested by empirical data the agricultural water conservation policy proposed by china s central government in 2012 which can be seen as a natural experiment provides an opportunity to study the water saving effect of agricultural water conservation policy the agricultural water conservation policy is mainly aimed at saving water in the crop production and then the treatment density of the agricultural water conservation policy will be affected by the area of arable land according to nunn and qian 2011 this paper uses exogenous land area suitable for cultivation as a treatment variable for the agricultural water conservation policy using the data of 31 provinces in china from 2000 to 2019 the difference in differences did is employed to empirically analyze the relationship between agricultural water conservation policy and agricultural water extraction this study finds that the implementation of agricultural water conservation policy not only fails to reduce agricultural water extraction but instead increases agricultural water extraction when considering other water resources policies including reform of the water rights system and the south to north water diversion project the estimates remain robust in subsample estimation after excluding municipalities directly under the central government in china including beijing tianjin shanghai and chongqing the results of the baseline model also remain robust why does agricultural water conservation policy not only fail to reduce agricultural water extraction but instead increase agricultural water extraction the possible reason is that agricultural water conservation policy has promoted agricultural production specifically the agricultural water conservation policy has promoted the increase of the sown area and the irrigated area and ensured the demand for water resources in agricultural production in the empirical analysis of this paper agricultural water conservation policy can significantly increase agricultural value added and can also significantly increase sown area and irrigated area when controlling agricultural value added sown area and irrigated area the impact of agricultural water conservation policy on the increase of agricultural water extraction will be reduced and the coefficient decreases the most when irrigated area is added therefore the agricultural water conservation policy mainly increases the agricultural water extraction by increasing the irrigation area the increased agricultural water extraction can also be interpreted as rebound effects the overall impact can be separated approximately into the physical and economic impacts which account for 30 84 and 69 16 respectively in the heterogeneity analysis there is no heterogeneity in the impact of agricultural water conservation policy on agricultural water extraction under different precipitation and slope but there is heterogeneity under different land potentiality for crop production in particular in provinces with high land potentiality the increase in agricultural water extraction by agricultural water conservation policy will be alleviated our work contributes most directly to the agricultural water conservation policy facing water shortages there are many ways to save water resources such as social norms chang et al 2016 liu et al 2018 dean et al 2021 water rights zhang et al 2021 mu et al 2022 water management gao et al 2014 hu et al 2021 ma et al 2021 virtual water trade wang 2013 tamea et al 2014 liu et al 2019 and water use efficiency wang 2019 xu et al 2021 different from the existing literature this paper does not analyze a specific measure of agricultural water conservation policy using the promulgation of china s agricultural water conservation policy in 2012 this paper employs a quasi experimental method did to empirically analyze the overall water saving effect of the policy therefore this paper cannot distinguish which specific measures have led to an increase in agricultural water extraction more broadly this study contributes to the large body of literature on water rebound effects a large body of literature has concentrated on quantifying the water rebound effect berbel and mateos 2014 loch and adamson 2015 song et al 2018 freire gonzález 2019 fang et al 2020 xu et al 2021 fei et al 2021 according to the literature about the agricultural water rebound effect in china song et al 2018 fang et al 2020 xu et al 2021 fei et al 2021 the estimated water rebound effect of china is about 65 89 with various estimation methods in recent years some research has empirically analyzed the water saving effect of the rise of agricultural water saving technology using econometric specifications pfeiffer and lin 2014 estimate the effect of high efficiency irrigation adoption and find that the groundwater extraction increases when the adoption occurs with household based data wheeler et al 2020 show that irrigation infrastructure subsidies will significantly increase water extraction about 21 28 in the murray darling basin the water rebound effect can be a potential interpretation about the increase in agricultural water extraction due to the agricultural water conservation policy this study uses data of 31 provinces in china during 2000 and 2019 as an example to analyze the effect of agricultural water conservation policy on agricultural water extraction the remainder of the paper is organized as follows the methodology including methods and data sources is provided in section 2 the main results of this study are presented in section 3 the discussion is included in section 4 the section 5 in this study summarizes the findings 2 methods and data 2 1 empirical strategy in this paper our empirical strategy is difference in differences did different from the standard did strategy the treatment in this paper is a continuous variable the baseline specification is as follows 1 ln agricultural water extraction it β ln land area i post t i γ i i i t 2001 2019 ρ t i t t 2001 2019 ν t x i i t λ p it ε it where i indexes provinces in china and t indexes years which is from 2000 to 2019 the variable ln agricultural water extraction it is the natural logarithm of the agricultural water extraction in province i and year t ln land area i is the natural logarithm of the land area suitable for cultivation post t is a dummy variable which is equal to 1 for the time period t after 2012 and 0 otherwise i i and i t are dummy variables as fixed effects of province and year in the fixed effects of province one province will be left to be the reference group and the year 2000 will be left to be the reference group in fixed effects of year x i is the vector of control variables including slope and land potentiality for crop production in this paper and it will not vary across years the interactions between the time invariant control variables and the year dummy variables will be included in the estimation in which the year 2000 will also be left as the reference group p it is precipitation which is a time variant control variable ε it is error term which includes other factors influencing the agricultural water extraction β γ i ρ t ν t and λ are coefficients which need to be estimated the coefficient of interest in above equation is β which can be interpreted as the effect of the land area suitable for cultivation on agricultural water extraction between before and after the agricultural water conservation policy a negative coefficient means that the provinces with more land area suitable for cultivation will extract less water and conserve more water after the agricultural water conservation policy but a positive coefficient indicates that the provinces with more land area suitable for cultivation will extract more water and cannot conserve any water after the agricultural water conservation policy whether the treatment variable land area suitable for cultivation can reflect the treatment density of the agricultural water conservation policy requires the above did specification to satisfy the parallel trend assumption to validate the parallel trend in identifying assumption we employ a flexible estimation which is similar to the event study the specification of the flexible estimation can be written as follows 2 ln agricultural water extraction it t 2001 2019 β t ln land area i i t i γ i i i t 2001 2019 ρ t i t t 2001 2019 ν t x i i t λ p it ε it where the variables are all defined as previous equation different from the previous equation the coefficient of interest is β t which is varying across years and the year 2000 is also left to be reference group the estimated coefficients of β t s clarify the impacts of land area suitable for cultivation on the agricultural water extraction during different time periods if the parallel trend in identifying assumption is satisfied the coefficients before 2012 will not be different from zero which means that the land area suitable for cultivation cannot affect the agricultural water extraction before the agricultural water conservation policy in china and after the agricultural water conservation policy there should be any estimated coefficients which begin to differ significantly from zero thus the treatment variable land area suitable for cultivation can reflect the treatment density of the agricultural water conservation policy 2 2 data sources the dependent variable agricultural water extraction is obtained from china water resource bulletin the treatment variable is the land area suitable for cultivation which is defined as the amount of land area with land potentiality greater than zero per unit area for crop production and this variable is calculated based on the data from liu et al 2015 similar to nunn and qian 2011 the treatment density of the agricultural water conservation policy will be impacted by the land area suitable for cultivation there are three control variables which include precipitation land potentiality and slope the precipitation is average rainfall in one year which is from national meteorological science data center in china the land potentiality refers to average potential production per unit area which is from liu et al 2015 the slope is obtained from resource and environment science and data center in china and value of 1 means the slope of a standard hill there are also three variables about potential mechanisms which include agricultural value added sown area and irrigation area the agricultural value added is calculated with the constant price in 2000 which is obtained from china statistical yearbook the sown area and irrigation area are also obtained from china statistical yearbook further summary statistics of the above variables can be seen in table 1 the standard deviation s d of dependent variable is large which also indicates that the range of agricultural water extraction is great the issue may be due to the differentiated size and shape of provinces in china which may bias the estimation briant et al 2010 damania 2020 therefore we will use the natural logarithmic form of agricultural water extraction as the dependent variable in analysis in which the results can be interpreted as growth rates in order to evaluate the association between the variables we report a correlation coefficient matrix of the variables in table 2 according to the correlation coefficient matrix it can be found that the dependent variable agricultural water extraction is significantly positively correlated with the treatment variable land area suitable for cultivation the possible mechanisms agricultural value added sown area and irrigation area are all significantly positively correlated with the dependent variable agricultural water extraction and the treatment variable land area suitable for cultivation is also significantly positively correlated with the possible mechanisms the above correlation analysis provides the potential association between the dependent variable the treatment variable and the potential mechanisms 3 results 3 1 baseline results the baseline regression results are shown in table 3 all columns include province fixed effects and year fixed effects column 1 does not include other control variables and the results show that after the implementation of the agricultural water conservation policy in 2012 the agricultural water extraction does not decrease but increases significantly column 2 adds precipitation as a control variable but the results are consistent with column 1 while the estimated coefficient decreases slightly column 3 adds land potentiality as a control variable but the results are the same as the column 1 while the standard error increases slightly column 4 adds slope as a control variable and the estimation results are also consistent with column 1 but the estimated coefficient has increased slightly column 5 adds all control variables including precipitation land potentiality and slope as control variables and the estimated results are also consistent with column 1 but only the estimated coefficient increases slightly according to the preferred specification with full control variables increasing the amount of land area suitable for cultivation by 1 increases agricultural water extraction by 0 0869 on average to sum up the implementation of the agricultural water conservation policy by china s central government in 2012 does not bring about a reduction in agricultural water extraction but significantly increases agricultural water extraction in order to verify that the increase in agricultural water extraction is due to the agricultural water conservation policy in 2012 we employ a flexible estimation model and the estimated results are shown in table 4 same as table 3 all columns have added province fixed effects and time fixed effects column 1 only adds province fixed effects and time fixed effects the results show that after the implementation of the agricultural water conservation policy in 2012 the agricultural water conservation policy begins to have a significant positive impact on agricultural water extraction in 2014 which is the second year after the policy implementation before the implementation of the agricultural water conservation policy the land area suitable for cultivation has no significant effect on agricultural water extraction therefore it can be regarded as a relationship between agricultural water conservation policy implemented in 2012 and agricultural water extraction which indicates that the baseline model satisfies the parallel trend hypothesis columns 2 4 add precipitation land potentiality and slope as control variables respectively and the estimated results are consistent with column 1 that is in the second year after the implementation of the agricultural water conservation policy the land area suitable for cultivation can significantly increase agricultural water extraction column 5 adds all control variables including precipitation land potentiality and slope and the results show that the agricultural water conservation policy implemented in 2012 begins to significantly increase agricultural water extraction in the first year after the policy is implemented although it is only significant at the 10 level these results show that before the implementation of the policy the land area suitable for cultivation has no significant effect on the agricultural water extraction and only after the implementation of the policy the land area suitable for cultivation will have significant impact on the agricultural water extraction therefore the treatment variable land area suitable for cultivation is appropriate for indexing the treatment density of the agricultural water conservation policy implemented by china s central government in 2012 the column 5 of table 4 with full control variables is the preferred specification in flexible estimation which can be plotted clearly by fig 1 the markers and dash lines represent the estimated coefficients and their 95 confidence intervals based on standard errors in different periods the results show that although the estimated coefficients fluctuate up and down before the agricultural water conservation policy is implemented the estimated coefficients are not significant at the 5 level but only after the policy is implemented in the second year the estimated coefficients begin to be significant at the 5 level so the increase in agricultural water extraction is indeed due to the agricultural water conservation policy implemented in 2012 besides after the implementation of the agricultural water conservation policy in 2012 the impact on agricultural water extraction continues to increase these results show that the agricultural water conservation policy will bring more increase in agricultural water extraction over time in particular over a five year period the impact of the policy has almost doubled in the seventh year relative to the second year after the implementation therefore these results can indicate that the agricultural water conservation policy of china in 2012 can increase agricultural water extraction and the impact is increasing as time goes on 3 2 robustness checks 3 2 1 contemporaneous water related policies around 2012 in addition to the implementation of the agricultural water conservation outline in china there were other policies related to water resources mainly including the reform of the water rights system and the south to north water diversion project the reform of the water rights system was implemented in 2014 which involves gansu guangdong henan hubei jiangxi inner mongolia and ningxia the south to north water diversion project was implemented in 2013 which involves beijing hebei henan hubei jiangsu shandong and tianjin these two water related policies were implemented during 2013 and 2014 then there is a time overlap between these two policies and the agricultural water conservation policy therefore these two water related policies may affect the estimation of the above model for robustness check the two water related policies will be incorporated into the control variables to further analyze the impact of the agricultural water conservation policy on agricultural water extraction so as to exclude the estimation bias caused by the two contemporaneous water related policies table 5 further incorporates the reform of the water rights system into the control variables it should be noted that the province fixed effects the time fixed effects and the reform of the water rights system are all included in the models column 1 does not add other control variables after the agricultural water conservation policy is implemented land area suitable for cultivation still has a significant positive impact on agricultural water extraction while the reform of the water rights reform is controlled columns 2 4 adds precipitation land potentiality and slope respectively and column 5 adds all the above variables in the estimation and the estimated results in columns 2 5 are all consistent with column 1 according to the preferred specification with full control variables increasing the amount of land area suitable for cultivation by 1 increases agricultural water extraction by 0 0892 on average when addressing the water rights reform compared with the coefficient estimated by the baseline model with full control variables the estimated coefficient after addressing the reform of the water rights system only increases slightly to sum up when considering the impact of the reform of the water rights system the agricultural water conservation policy still has a significant positive impact on agricultural water extraction after the implementation so the benchmark model is robust table 6 further incorporates the south to north water diversion project into the control variables it should be noted that the province fixed effects time fixed effects and south to north water diversion project are all included in the models column 1 does not add other control variables after the agricultural water conservation policy is implemented land area suitable for cultivation still has a significant positive impact on agricultural water extraction while south to north water diversion project is controlled columns 2 4 add precipitation land potentiality and slope respectively and column 5 adds all the above variables in the estimation and the estimated results in columns 2 5 are all consistent with column 1 according to the preferred specification with full control variables increasing the amount of land area suitable for cultivation by 1 increases agricultural water extraction by 0 0815 on average when addressing the south to north water diversion the estimated coefficient after taking into account the south to north water diversion only slightly decreases in comparison to the coefficient estimated by the baseline model with full control variables in summary when addressing the impact of the south to north water diversion project the agricultural water conservation policy still has a significant positive impact on agricultural water extraction after the implementation so the benchmark model is robust according to table 5 and table 6 it can be also found that the water rights reform and south to north water diversion can significantly reduce the agricultural water extraction specifically according to the preferred specifications with full control variables it can be found that the water rights reform can reduce agricultural water extraction by 4 38 on average while the south to north water diversion can reduce agricultural water extraction by 31 86 on average the possible reason is that the two water related reforms in china are market based policies through water trade china s water rights reform is mainly based on the exchange of water resources between the agricultural sector and the non agricultural sector while the south to north water diversion is based on the exchange of water resources between the yellow river basin and the yangtze river basin the market oriented water allocation method will promote the transfer of water resources to high value added industries so the above two water related policies will promote the transfer of water resources from the agricultural sector to the non agricultural sector however china s agricultural water saving policy just subsidizes agricultural sector to promote water saving technologies which creates a comparative advantage in water use for agricultural production under the policy of subsidizing agricultural water conservation it is difficult to transfer the agricultural water extraction to the non agricultural sector therefore market based water resources policies may be more effective in water conservation 3 2 2 estimation with subsample the benchmark model incorporates special regions in china which are called municipality directly under the central government in china including beijing tianjin shanghai and chongqing these regions have a very special political status in china and the implementation of any policies will have more favorable measures in these special regions so the inclusion of the above special regions may lead to estimation bias for the further robustness of the model estimation the above regions are further excluded for subsample regression the results of subsample regression are shown in table 7 it should be noted that the province fixed effects and time fixed effects are all included in the models column 1 does not add other control variables and the estimation results still show that agricultural water extraction still increases significantly after the implementation of the agricultural water conservation policy although the estimated coefficient decreases slightly compared to the baseline model columns 2 4 add precipitation land potentiality and slope as control variables respectively while column 5 adds all control variables and the estimated results in columns 2 5 are all consistent with column 1 specifically according to the preferred specification with full control variables increasing the amount of land area suitable for cultivation by 1 increases agricultural water extraction by 0 0777 on average therefore the estimated coefficients with full control variables after excluding municipalities directly under the central government in china will decrease by 10 59 compared to the preferred baseline specification the potential reason is that the water saving effect of agricultural water conservation policy in these special regions may be worse than that in other regions due to the difficulty in shifting the water resources from the agricultural sector to the non agricultural sector in these developed areas although the estimated coefficients decrease the estimated results are also consistent with the benchmark model to sum up the implementation of agricultural water conservation policy does not reduce agricultural water extraction when estimating with subsample however it increases agricultural water extraction therefore the benchmark model is still robust in subsample estimation 4 discussions 4 1 potential mechanisms why does agricultural water conservation policy increase agricultural water extraction a large body of literature explains the phenomenon from the perspective of the rebound effect song et al 2018 wheeler et al 2020 xu and song 2022 the rebound effect of agricultural water conservation policies indeed happens over the world for example australia also tries to reduce agricultural water extraction by subsidizing irrigation infrastructure in the murray darling basin wheeler et al 2020 also find that the rebound effect indeed exists in the murray darling basin because the irrigators who receive the subsidy will increase the water extraction for production freire gonzález 2019 estimates the rebound effect of improved water productivity in spain and finds that the rebound effect is more than 100 pfeiffer and lin 2014 find that the shifting to more efficient irrigation technology which is subsidized by state and nation also increases water extraction in western kansas the results in china are consistent with that in australia spain and america and the results of pfeiffer and lin 2014 and wheeler et al 2020 provide micro foundation for this paper this paper indicates that the increase in agricultural water extraction brought by the agricultural water conservation policy is mainly due to the promotion of agricultural production which is increased by the expansion of planting area and irrigation area table 8 further estimates the impact of the agricultural water conservation policy on agricultural value added sown area and irrigated area it is worth noting that all models incorporate province fixed effects and time fixed effects and also include precipitation land potentiality and slope as control variables column 1 shows that the agricultural water conservation policy has a significant positive impact on the agricultural value added specifically increasing the amount of land area suitable for cultivation by 1 increases agricultural value added by 0 0972 on average column 2 shows that after the agricultural water conservation policy is implemented the sown area will increase significantly specifically increasing the amount of land area suitable for cultivation by 1 increases sown area by 0 1004 on average column 3 shows that after the implementation of the agricultural water conservation policy the land area suitable for cultivation has a significant positive impact on the irrigated area specifically increasing the amount of land area suitable for cultivation by 1 increases irrigated area by 0 1130 on average the increase in agricultural value added sown area and irrigated area will increase the demand for agricultural water extraction which would be the potential mechanisms according to the magnitude of the estimated coefficients it can be found that the increase of irrigated area is the largest so the increase of irrigated area may be the main potential mechanism leading to the increase of agricultural water extraction after the implementation of the agricultural water conservation policy in order to further ensure the above possible potential mechanisms table 9 further incorporates the possible mechanisms into the benchmark model column 1 is the result of the benchmark model which is reported for comparison and columns 2 4 add agricultural value added sown area and irrigated area respectively in column 2 the results show that after controlling for agricultural value added the estimated coefficient drops by 39 13 from 0 0869 to 0 0529 which indicates that the increase in agricultural value added may be a possible mechanism for the increase in agricultural water extraction in column 3 the estimated coefficient decreases by 63 06 from 0 0869 to 0 0321 after controlling for sown area suggesting that the increase in sown area may also be a possible mechanism for the increase in agricultural water extraction in column 4 after controlling for irrigated area the estimated coefficient decreases dramatically by 69 16 from 0 0869 to 0 0268 suggesting that the increase in irrigated area may be another mechanism for the increase in agricultural water extraction according to the decreased magnitude of the estimated coefficients after the potential mechanisms are controlled it can be confirmed that the increase of irrigated area is indeed the most important mechanism for the increase in agricultural water extraction irrigation water is the main source of agricultural water extraction when the irrigated area is not controlled the increase in agricultural water extraction can be regarded as the overall impact of the agricultural water conservation policy according to column 1 of table 8 it can be found that the overall impact is 0 0869 when the irrigated area is controlled the increase in agricultural water extraction can be regarded as the physical impact of the agricultural water conservation policy the physical impact is that the ratio of area irrigated to water extracted increases the improved technology in irrigation will result in higher consumption crop et per unit of water extracted in which classical irrigation efficiency increases and ratio of area irrigated to extraction increases thus when the volume extracted also increases the consumption increases even further therefore according to column 4 of table 8 the physical impact of the agricultural water conservation policy is 0 0268 after removing the physical impact from overall impact the economic impact is 0 0601 the economic impact is the increase in demand because the abstracted water is more productive which always accompanies by increased irrigation area based on this the physical and economic impacts account for 30 84 and 69 16 of the overall impact respectively therefore the impact of the agricultural water conservation policy on agricultural water extraction mainly comes from the economic impact then in the case of limited arable land that can be irrigated the economic impact of agricultural water conservation policy will be limited thus the increased agricultural water extraction can be also restricted which is consistent with berbel and mateos 2014 4 2 further heterogeneity the baseline estimation does not consider the heterogeneous impact of agricultural water conservation policy on agricultural water extraction table 10 further analyzes the heterogeneous impact of the agricultural water conservation policy heterogeneity analysis is mainly carried out from three perspectives precipitation land potentiality and slope for the heterogeneity analysis we multiply precipitation land potentiality and slope with ln land area post respectively the results show that there is no heterogeneity in the water saving effect of the agricultural water conservation policy under different precipitations and slopes however there is heterogeneity in agricultural water saving effect of the agricultural water conservation policy under different land potentialities specifically provinces with higher land potentiality for crop production have better water saving effects the possible explanation lies in the substitution relationship between land and water resources in which the land with high potentiality for crop production may also contain more water in soil resulting in less water demand for agricultural production this suggests that implementing agricultural water conservation policies in areas with high land potentiality for crop production will be more effective 5 conclusion does the implementation of agricultural water conservation policy necessarily reduce agricultural water extraction taking china s national water conservation outline proposed in 2012 as an example this paper uses the data of 31 provinces from 2000 to 2019 and employs an empirical strategy of difference in differences did to estimate the effect of the agricultural water conservation policy on agricultural water extraction in this paper it can be found that the agricultural water conservation policy does not result in a reduction in agricultural water extraction but rather increases agricultural water extraction when considering the impact of other contemporaneous water related policies including the reform of the water rights system and the south to north water diversion project the above conclusions remain robust consistent conclusions are still obtained under the subsample estimation after excluding the municipalities directly under the central government in china the possible reason why the agricultural water conservation policy does not reduce agricultural water extraction but increases agricultural water extraction is that agricultural water conservation policy promotes the agricultural production especially by expanding the sown area and irrigated area and the expansion of irrigated area is the main reason for the increase in agricultural water extraction besides the overall impact of the agricultural water extraction policy can be approximately separated into physical and economic impacts which account for 30 84 and 69 16 of the overall impact respectively therefore the economic impact is the main driver of the increase in agricultural water extraction which is consistent with the increase in the irrigated area in the heterogeneity analysis the difference in precipitation or slope does not affect the water saving effect of the agricultural water conservation policy but land potentiality for crop production will affect the water saving effect of the agricultural water conservation policy in which provinces with higher land potentiality will have less increase in agricultural water extraction caused by the agricultural water conservation policy although agricultural water conservation policy can ideally reduce the waste of water resources and efficiently utilize water resources thereby reducing the demand for water resources agricultural water conservation policy can also increase the demand for water resources by promoting agricultural production taking china as an example it is found that agricultural water conservation policy may play a greater role in increasing agricultural production which in turn leads to an increase in agricultural water extraction instead of decreasing this phenomenon is also interpreted as rebound effects in order to alleviate the rebound effects brought by agricultural water conservation policy more intensive efforts can be given in areas with high land potentiality for crop production the rebound effect of agricultural water extraction indeed happens over the world the possible reason is that agricultural water conservation policies try to reduce agricultural water extraction by subsidizing water saving technology this way may reduce the cost of agricultural water extraction and lead to more area irrigated which may make it difficult for the water resources to transfer from the agricultural sector to the non agricultural sector therefore the possible way to reduce the rebound effects is to make the use of water resources market oriented such as the reform of the water rights system the water rebound effect will be serious if it leads to drastic overdraft of groundwater threatening the sustainability of water utilization and the health of the ecosystem therefore in areas where the groundwater levels are unstable it is necessary to reduce agricultural water use through market based policies such as water rights reform the above conclusions are based on the data of 31 provinces in china from 2000 to 2019 with an empirical strategy of difference in differences did however the conclusions obtained by using other methods or data may be different therefore research based on other samples and methods especially the micro research based on farmers will be the future research direction declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
9280,does the implementation of agricultural water conservation policy necessarily bring about a reduction in agricultural water extraction taking china s national agricultural water conservation outline proposed in 2012 as an example this paper uses the data of 31 provinces from 2000 to 2019 and employs an empirical strategy of difference in differences did to estimate the impact of the agricultural water conservation policy on agricultural water extraction the results show that the agricultural water conservation policy does not achieve the decline of agricultural water extraction but increases agricultural water extraction when addressing contemporaneous water related policies or estimating in subsample these results are robust the possible reason for this phenomenon is that the agricultural water conservation policy promotes agricultural production especially by increasing the sown area and irrigated area and the expansion of irrigated area is the main reason for the increase in agricultural water extraction moreover land potentiality for crop production may affect the water saving effect of the agricultural water conservation policy in which provinces with higher land potentiality will have less increase in agricultural water extraction caused by the agricultural water conservation policy therefore with the empirical evidence from china agricultural water conservation policy may not necessarily reduce agricultural water extraction and this phenomenon is always regarded as rebound effects in order to avoid the adverse impacts of the rebound effect agricultural water saving technologies can be strengthened in areas with high land potentiality for agricultural production and market oriented policies such as water rights reform can be employed to avoid excessive use of water resources in areas with severe over extraction keywords agricultural water conservation policy agricultural water saving effect water rebound effect water management china data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction fresh water is a critical resource for humans and nature as well as the foundation for long term sustainable economic development many countries throughout the world are experiencing water shortages as a result of global climate change increased demand for fresh water from economic development and increased environmental concerns hanjra and qureshi 2010 for example china s total water resources are estimated to be over 2812 billion m3 per year putting it in fifth place in the world jiang 2009 however due to its population of 1 3 billion people china has an extreme low per capita amount of water resources which is just a quarter of the world average level jun and chen 2001 another hazard to china s long term sustainable water use is the regional mismatch between agricultural development and water resources yu 2011 the agriculture is the largest sector in fresh water extraction which accounts for roughly 70 of the whole fresh water demand grafton et al 2018 therefore agricultural water extraction offers a lot of water saving potential in the future in china agriculture is also a major water user and the agricultural water extraction accounts for about 62 of the total economic and social water use on average and it is as high as 90 in some regions the china s central government indicates that the low water use efficiency in agriculture is the main reason for high proportion of agricultural water extraction thus the water saving potential is great besides promoting agricultural water conservation by expanding the irrigation area and then improving the water saving irrigation technology is an important measure to promote the sustainable use of water resources ensure the national food security and accelerate the economic development therefore promoting water saving irrigation is a major strategy in agricultural water conservation for sustainable economic and social development existing strategy of china s central government mainly focuses on improving water saving irrigation technology by the agricultural water conservation policy which aims to reduce agricultural water withdrawal specially in china the national agricultural water conservation outline was proposed in 2012 in order to expand the irrigation area and then improve the water saving irrigation technology national agricultural water conservation outline in china proposes four strategies for saving agricultural water extraction first agricultural water needs to be optimally allocated in areas without conventional irrigation conditions local pools will be used to collect rainwater for irrigation second the structure of agricultural production should be adjusted reasonably in areas with water shortages it is necessary to strictly limit the cultivation of crops with high water use and encourage the cultivation of crops with less water use and high added value thirdly agricultural water saving irrigation technology should be improved in water scarce areas high efficiency water saving irrigation and water fertilizer integration technologies such as sprinkler irrigation micro irrigation and drip irrigation under film should be actively promoted fourthly biotechnology water saving measures also should be promoted the drought tolerant and high yielding varieties should be used to improve the utilization rate of natural rainfall besides in drought prone areas and soil erosion prone areas conservation tillage techniques should be promoted the four strategies are used to improve agricultural water use efficiency especially by enhancing water saving irrigation technologies the improvement of water use efficiency by agricultural water conservation policy can reduce the water extraction if the demand for water resources in agricultural production is constant however the agricultural water conservation policy ensures the demand for water resources in agricultural production which will promote agricultural development and increase the demand for water especially by increasing irrigated area which is also known as rebound effects therefore whether the agricultural water conservation policy can reduce the agricultural water extraction still needs to be tested by empirical data the agricultural water conservation policy proposed by china s central government in 2012 which can be seen as a natural experiment provides an opportunity to study the water saving effect of agricultural water conservation policy the agricultural water conservation policy is mainly aimed at saving water in the crop production and then the treatment density of the agricultural water conservation policy will be affected by the area of arable land according to nunn and qian 2011 this paper uses exogenous land area suitable for cultivation as a treatment variable for the agricultural water conservation policy using the data of 31 provinces in china from 2000 to 2019 the difference in differences did is employed to empirically analyze the relationship between agricultural water conservation policy and agricultural water extraction this study finds that the implementation of agricultural water conservation policy not only fails to reduce agricultural water extraction but instead increases agricultural water extraction when considering other water resources policies including reform of the water rights system and the south to north water diversion project the estimates remain robust in subsample estimation after excluding municipalities directly under the central government in china including beijing tianjin shanghai and chongqing the results of the baseline model also remain robust why does agricultural water conservation policy not only fail to reduce agricultural water extraction but instead increase agricultural water extraction the possible reason is that agricultural water conservation policy has promoted agricultural production specifically the agricultural water conservation policy has promoted the increase of the sown area and the irrigated area and ensured the demand for water resources in agricultural production in the empirical analysis of this paper agricultural water conservation policy can significantly increase agricultural value added and can also significantly increase sown area and irrigated area when controlling agricultural value added sown area and irrigated area the impact of agricultural water conservation policy on the increase of agricultural water extraction will be reduced and the coefficient decreases the most when irrigated area is added therefore the agricultural water conservation policy mainly increases the agricultural water extraction by increasing the irrigation area the increased agricultural water extraction can also be interpreted as rebound effects the overall impact can be separated approximately into the physical and economic impacts which account for 30 84 and 69 16 respectively in the heterogeneity analysis there is no heterogeneity in the impact of agricultural water conservation policy on agricultural water extraction under different precipitation and slope but there is heterogeneity under different land potentiality for crop production in particular in provinces with high land potentiality the increase in agricultural water extraction by agricultural water conservation policy will be alleviated our work contributes most directly to the agricultural water conservation policy facing water shortages there are many ways to save water resources such as social norms chang et al 2016 liu et al 2018 dean et al 2021 water rights zhang et al 2021 mu et al 2022 water management gao et al 2014 hu et al 2021 ma et al 2021 virtual water trade wang 2013 tamea et al 2014 liu et al 2019 and water use efficiency wang 2019 xu et al 2021 different from the existing literature this paper does not analyze a specific measure of agricultural water conservation policy using the promulgation of china s agricultural water conservation policy in 2012 this paper employs a quasi experimental method did to empirically analyze the overall water saving effect of the policy therefore this paper cannot distinguish which specific measures have led to an increase in agricultural water extraction more broadly this study contributes to the large body of literature on water rebound effects a large body of literature has concentrated on quantifying the water rebound effect berbel and mateos 2014 loch and adamson 2015 song et al 2018 freire gonzález 2019 fang et al 2020 xu et al 2021 fei et al 2021 according to the literature about the agricultural water rebound effect in china song et al 2018 fang et al 2020 xu et al 2021 fei et al 2021 the estimated water rebound effect of china is about 65 89 with various estimation methods in recent years some research has empirically analyzed the water saving effect of the rise of agricultural water saving technology using econometric specifications pfeiffer and lin 2014 estimate the effect of high efficiency irrigation adoption and find that the groundwater extraction increases when the adoption occurs with household based data wheeler et al 2020 show that irrigation infrastructure subsidies will significantly increase water extraction about 21 28 in the murray darling basin the water rebound effect can be a potential interpretation about the increase in agricultural water extraction due to the agricultural water conservation policy this study uses data of 31 provinces in china during 2000 and 2019 as an example to analyze the effect of agricultural water conservation policy on agricultural water extraction the remainder of the paper is organized as follows the methodology including methods and data sources is provided in section 2 the main results of this study are presented in section 3 the discussion is included in section 4 the section 5 in this study summarizes the findings 2 methods and data 2 1 empirical strategy in this paper our empirical strategy is difference in differences did different from the standard did strategy the treatment in this paper is a continuous variable the baseline specification is as follows 1 ln agricultural water extraction it β ln land area i post t i γ i i i t 2001 2019 ρ t i t t 2001 2019 ν t x i i t λ p it ε it where i indexes provinces in china and t indexes years which is from 2000 to 2019 the variable ln agricultural water extraction it is the natural logarithm of the agricultural water extraction in province i and year t ln land area i is the natural logarithm of the land area suitable for cultivation post t is a dummy variable which is equal to 1 for the time period t after 2012 and 0 otherwise i i and i t are dummy variables as fixed effects of province and year in the fixed effects of province one province will be left to be the reference group and the year 2000 will be left to be the reference group in fixed effects of year x i is the vector of control variables including slope and land potentiality for crop production in this paper and it will not vary across years the interactions between the time invariant control variables and the year dummy variables will be included in the estimation in which the year 2000 will also be left as the reference group p it is precipitation which is a time variant control variable ε it is error term which includes other factors influencing the agricultural water extraction β γ i ρ t ν t and λ are coefficients which need to be estimated the coefficient of interest in above equation is β which can be interpreted as the effect of the land area suitable for cultivation on agricultural water extraction between before and after the agricultural water conservation policy a negative coefficient means that the provinces with more land area suitable for cultivation will extract less water and conserve more water after the agricultural water conservation policy but a positive coefficient indicates that the provinces with more land area suitable for cultivation will extract more water and cannot conserve any water after the agricultural water conservation policy whether the treatment variable land area suitable for cultivation can reflect the treatment density of the agricultural water conservation policy requires the above did specification to satisfy the parallel trend assumption to validate the parallel trend in identifying assumption we employ a flexible estimation which is similar to the event study the specification of the flexible estimation can be written as follows 2 ln agricultural water extraction it t 2001 2019 β t ln land area i i t i γ i i i t 2001 2019 ρ t i t t 2001 2019 ν t x i i t λ p it ε it where the variables are all defined as previous equation different from the previous equation the coefficient of interest is β t which is varying across years and the year 2000 is also left to be reference group the estimated coefficients of β t s clarify the impacts of land area suitable for cultivation on the agricultural water extraction during different time periods if the parallel trend in identifying assumption is satisfied the coefficients before 2012 will not be different from zero which means that the land area suitable for cultivation cannot affect the agricultural water extraction before the agricultural water conservation policy in china and after the agricultural water conservation policy there should be any estimated coefficients which begin to differ significantly from zero thus the treatment variable land area suitable for cultivation can reflect the treatment density of the agricultural water conservation policy 2 2 data sources the dependent variable agricultural water extraction is obtained from china water resource bulletin the treatment variable is the land area suitable for cultivation which is defined as the amount of land area with land potentiality greater than zero per unit area for crop production and this variable is calculated based on the data from liu et al 2015 similar to nunn and qian 2011 the treatment density of the agricultural water conservation policy will be impacted by the land area suitable for cultivation there are three control variables which include precipitation land potentiality and slope the precipitation is average rainfall in one year which is from national meteorological science data center in china the land potentiality refers to average potential production per unit area which is from liu et al 2015 the slope is obtained from resource and environment science and data center in china and value of 1 means the slope of a standard hill there are also three variables about potential mechanisms which include agricultural value added sown area and irrigation area the agricultural value added is calculated with the constant price in 2000 which is obtained from china statistical yearbook the sown area and irrigation area are also obtained from china statistical yearbook further summary statistics of the above variables can be seen in table 1 the standard deviation s d of dependent variable is large which also indicates that the range of agricultural water extraction is great the issue may be due to the differentiated size and shape of provinces in china which may bias the estimation briant et al 2010 damania 2020 therefore we will use the natural logarithmic form of agricultural water extraction as the dependent variable in analysis in which the results can be interpreted as growth rates in order to evaluate the association between the variables we report a correlation coefficient matrix of the variables in table 2 according to the correlation coefficient matrix it can be found that the dependent variable agricultural water extraction is significantly positively correlated with the treatment variable land area suitable for cultivation the possible mechanisms agricultural value added sown area and irrigation area are all significantly positively correlated with the dependent variable agricultural water extraction and the treatment variable land area suitable for cultivation is also significantly positively correlated with the possible mechanisms the above correlation analysis provides the potential association between the dependent variable the treatment variable and the potential mechanisms 3 results 3 1 baseline results the baseline regression results are shown in table 3 all columns include province fixed effects and year fixed effects column 1 does not include other control variables and the results show that after the implementation of the agricultural water conservation policy in 2012 the agricultural water extraction does not decrease but increases significantly column 2 adds precipitation as a control variable but the results are consistent with column 1 while the estimated coefficient decreases slightly column 3 adds land potentiality as a control variable but the results are the same as the column 1 while the standard error increases slightly column 4 adds slope as a control variable and the estimation results are also consistent with column 1 but the estimated coefficient has increased slightly column 5 adds all control variables including precipitation land potentiality and slope as control variables and the estimated results are also consistent with column 1 but only the estimated coefficient increases slightly according to the preferred specification with full control variables increasing the amount of land area suitable for cultivation by 1 increases agricultural water extraction by 0 0869 on average to sum up the implementation of the agricultural water conservation policy by china s central government in 2012 does not bring about a reduction in agricultural water extraction but significantly increases agricultural water extraction in order to verify that the increase in agricultural water extraction is due to the agricultural water conservation policy in 2012 we employ a flexible estimation model and the estimated results are shown in table 4 same as table 3 all columns have added province fixed effects and time fixed effects column 1 only adds province fixed effects and time fixed effects the results show that after the implementation of the agricultural water conservation policy in 2012 the agricultural water conservation policy begins to have a significant positive impact on agricultural water extraction in 2014 which is the second year after the policy implementation before the implementation of the agricultural water conservation policy the land area suitable for cultivation has no significant effect on agricultural water extraction therefore it can be regarded as a relationship between agricultural water conservation policy implemented in 2012 and agricultural water extraction which indicates that the baseline model satisfies the parallel trend hypothesis columns 2 4 add precipitation land potentiality and slope as control variables respectively and the estimated results are consistent with column 1 that is in the second year after the implementation of the agricultural water conservation policy the land area suitable for cultivation can significantly increase agricultural water extraction column 5 adds all control variables including precipitation land potentiality and slope and the results show that the agricultural water conservation policy implemented in 2012 begins to significantly increase agricultural water extraction in the first year after the policy is implemented although it is only significant at the 10 level these results show that before the implementation of the policy the land area suitable for cultivation has no significant effect on the agricultural water extraction and only after the implementation of the policy the land area suitable for cultivation will have significant impact on the agricultural water extraction therefore the treatment variable land area suitable for cultivation is appropriate for indexing the treatment density of the agricultural water conservation policy implemented by china s central government in 2012 the column 5 of table 4 with full control variables is the preferred specification in flexible estimation which can be plotted clearly by fig 1 the markers and dash lines represent the estimated coefficients and their 95 confidence intervals based on standard errors in different periods the results show that although the estimated coefficients fluctuate up and down before the agricultural water conservation policy is implemented the estimated coefficients are not significant at the 5 level but only after the policy is implemented in the second year the estimated coefficients begin to be significant at the 5 level so the increase in agricultural water extraction is indeed due to the agricultural water conservation policy implemented in 2012 besides after the implementation of the agricultural water conservation policy in 2012 the impact on agricultural water extraction continues to increase these results show that the agricultural water conservation policy will bring more increase in agricultural water extraction over time in particular over a five year period the impact of the policy has almost doubled in the seventh year relative to the second year after the implementation therefore these results can indicate that the agricultural water conservation policy of china in 2012 can increase agricultural water extraction and the impact is increasing as time goes on 3 2 robustness checks 3 2 1 contemporaneous water related policies around 2012 in addition to the implementation of the agricultural water conservation outline in china there were other policies related to water resources mainly including the reform of the water rights system and the south to north water diversion project the reform of the water rights system was implemented in 2014 which involves gansu guangdong henan hubei jiangxi inner mongolia and ningxia the south to north water diversion project was implemented in 2013 which involves beijing hebei henan hubei jiangsu shandong and tianjin these two water related policies were implemented during 2013 and 2014 then there is a time overlap between these two policies and the agricultural water conservation policy therefore these two water related policies may affect the estimation of the above model for robustness check the two water related policies will be incorporated into the control variables to further analyze the impact of the agricultural water conservation policy on agricultural water extraction so as to exclude the estimation bias caused by the two contemporaneous water related policies table 5 further incorporates the reform of the water rights system into the control variables it should be noted that the province fixed effects the time fixed effects and the reform of the water rights system are all included in the models column 1 does not add other control variables after the agricultural water conservation policy is implemented land area suitable for cultivation still has a significant positive impact on agricultural water extraction while the reform of the water rights reform is controlled columns 2 4 adds precipitation land potentiality and slope respectively and column 5 adds all the above variables in the estimation and the estimated results in columns 2 5 are all consistent with column 1 according to the preferred specification with full control variables increasing the amount of land area suitable for cultivation by 1 increases agricultural water extraction by 0 0892 on average when addressing the water rights reform compared with the coefficient estimated by the baseline model with full control variables the estimated coefficient after addressing the reform of the water rights system only increases slightly to sum up when considering the impact of the reform of the water rights system the agricultural water conservation policy still has a significant positive impact on agricultural water extraction after the implementation so the benchmark model is robust table 6 further incorporates the south to north water diversion project into the control variables it should be noted that the province fixed effects time fixed effects and south to north water diversion project are all included in the models column 1 does not add other control variables after the agricultural water conservation policy is implemented land area suitable for cultivation still has a significant positive impact on agricultural water extraction while south to north water diversion project is controlled columns 2 4 add precipitation land potentiality and slope respectively and column 5 adds all the above variables in the estimation and the estimated results in columns 2 5 are all consistent with column 1 according to the preferred specification with full control variables increasing the amount of land area suitable for cultivation by 1 increases agricultural water extraction by 0 0815 on average when addressing the south to north water diversion the estimated coefficient after taking into account the south to north water diversion only slightly decreases in comparison to the coefficient estimated by the baseline model with full control variables in summary when addressing the impact of the south to north water diversion project the agricultural water conservation policy still has a significant positive impact on agricultural water extraction after the implementation so the benchmark model is robust according to table 5 and table 6 it can be also found that the water rights reform and south to north water diversion can significantly reduce the agricultural water extraction specifically according to the preferred specifications with full control variables it can be found that the water rights reform can reduce agricultural water extraction by 4 38 on average while the south to north water diversion can reduce agricultural water extraction by 31 86 on average the possible reason is that the two water related reforms in china are market based policies through water trade china s water rights reform is mainly based on the exchange of water resources between the agricultural sector and the non agricultural sector while the south to north water diversion is based on the exchange of water resources between the yellow river basin and the yangtze river basin the market oriented water allocation method will promote the transfer of water resources to high value added industries so the above two water related policies will promote the transfer of water resources from the agricultural sector to the non agricultural sector however china s agricultural water saving policy just subsidizes agricultural sector to promote water saving technologies which creates a comparative advantage in water use for agricultural production under the policy of subsidizing agricultural water conservation it is difficult to transfer the agricultural water extraction to the non agricultural sector therefore market based water resources policies may be more effective in water conservation 3 2 2 estimation with subsample the benchmark model incorporates special regions in china which are called municipality directly under the central government in china including beijing tianjin shanghai and chongqing these regions have a very special political status in china and the implementation of any policies will have more favorable measures in these special regions so the inclusion of the above special regions may lead to estimation bias for the further robustness of the model estimation the above regions are further excluded for subsample regression the results of subsample regression are shown in table 7 it should be noted that the province fixed effects and time fixed effects are all included in the models column 1 does not add other control variables and the estimation results still show that agricultural water extraction still increases significantly after the implementation of the agricultural water conservation policy although the estimated coefficient decreases slightly compared to the baseline model columns 2 4 add precipitation land potentiality and slope as control variables respectively while column 5 adds all control variables and the estimated results in columns 2 5 are all consistent with column 1 specifically according to the preferred specification with full control variables increasing the amount of land area suitable for cultivation by 1 increases agricultural water extraction by 0 0777 on average therefore the estimated coefficients with full control variables after excluding municipalities directly under the central government in china will decrease by 10 59 compared to the preferred baseline specification the potential reason is that the water saving effect of agricultural water conservation policy in these special regions may be worse than that in other regions due to the difficulty in shifting the water resources from the agricultural sector to the non agricultural sector in these developed areas although the estimated coefficients decrease the estimated results are also consistent with the benchmark model to sum up the implementation of agricultural water conservation policy does not reduce agricultural water extraction when estimating with subsample however it increases agricultural water extraction therefore the benchmark model is still robust in subsample estimation 4 discussions 4 1 potential mechanisms why does agricultural water conservation policy increase agricultural water extraction a large body of literature explains the phenomenon from the perspective of the rebound effect song et al 2018 wheeler et al 2020 xu and song 2022 the rebound effect of agricultural water conservation policies indeed happens over the world for example australia also tries to reduce agricultural water extraction by subsidizing irrigation infrastructure in the murray darling basin wheeler et al 2020 also find that the rebound effect indeed exists in the murray darling basin because the irrigators who receive the subsidy will increase the water extraction for production freire gonzález 2019 estimates the rebound effect of improved water productivity in spain and finds that the rebound effect is more than 100 pfeiffer and lin 2014 find that the shifting to more efficient irrigation technology which is subsidized by state and nation also increases water extraction in western kansas the results in china are consistent with that in australia spain and america and the results of pfeiffer and lin 2014 and wheeler et al 2020 provide micro foundation for this paper this paper indicates that the increase in agricultural water extraction brought by the agricultural water conservation policy is mainly due to the promotion of agricultural production which is increased by the expansion of planting area and irrigation area table 8 further estimates the impact of the agricultural water conservation policy on agricultural value added sown area and irrigated area it is worth noting that all models incorporate province fixed effects and time fixed effects and also include precipitation land potentiality and slope as control variables column 1 shows that the agricultural water conservation policy has a significant positive impact on the agricultural value added specifically increasing the amount of land area suitable for cultivation by 1 increases agricultural value added by 0 0972 on average column 2 shows that after the agricultural water conservation policy is implemented the sown area will increase significantly specifically increasing the amount of land area suitable for cultivation by 1 increases sown area by 0 1004 on average column 3 shows that after the implementation of the agricultural water conservation policy the land area suitable for cultivation has a significant positive impact on the irrigated area specifically increasing the amount of land area suitable for cultivation by 1 increases irrigated area by 0 1130 on average the increase in agricultural value added sown area and irrigated area will increase the demand for agricultural water extraction which would be the potential mechanisms according to the magnitude of the estimated coefficients it can be found that the increase of irrigated area is the largest so the increase of irrigated area may be the main potential mechanism leading to the increase of agricultural water extraction after the implementation of the agricultural water conservation policy in order to further ensure the above possible potential mechanisms table 9 further incorporates the possible mechanisms into the benchmark model column 1 is the result of the benchmark model which is reported for comparison and columns 2 4 add agricultural value added sown area and irrigated area respectively in column 2 the results show that after controlling for agricultural value added the estimated coefficient drops by 39 13 from 0 0869 to 0 0529 which indicates that the increase in agricultural value added may be a possible mechanism for the increase in agricultural water extraction in column 3 the estimated coefficient decreases by 63 06 from 0 0869 to 0 0321 after controlling for sown area suggesting that the increase in sown area may also be a possible mechanism for the increase in agricultural water extraction in column 4 after controlling for irrigated area the estimated coefficient decreases dramatically by 69 16 from 0 0869 to 0 0268 suggesting that the increase in irrigated area may be another mechanism for the increase in agricultural water extraction according to the decreased magnitude of the estimated coefficients after the potential mechanisms are controlled it can be confirmed that the increase of irrigated area is indeed the most important mechanism for the increase in agricultural water extraction irrigation water is the main source of agricultural water extraction when the irrigated area is not controlled the increase in agricultural water extraction can be regarded as the overall impact of the agricultural water conservation policy according to column 1 of table 8 it can be found that the overall impact is 0 0869 when the irrigated area is controlled the increase in agricultural water extraction can be regarded as the physical impact of the agricultural water conservation policy the physical impact is that the ratio of area irrigated to water extracted increases the improved technology in irrigation will result in higher consumption crop et per unit of water extracted in which classical irrigation efficiency increases and ratio of area irrigated to extraction increases thus when the volume extracted also increases the consumption increases even further therefore according to column 4 of table 8 the physical impact of the agricultural water conservation policy is 0 0268 after removing the physical impact from overall impact the economic impact is 0 0601 the economic impact is the increase in demand because the abstracted water is more productive which always accompanies by increased irrigation area based on this the physical and economic impacts account for 30 84 and 69 16 of the overall impact respectively therefore the impact of the agricultural water conservation policy on agricultural water extraction mainly comes from the economic impact then in the case of limited arable land that can be irrigated the economic impact of agricultural water conservation policy will be limited thus the increased agricultural water extraction can be also restricted which is consistent with berbel and mateos 2014 4 2 further heterogeneity the baseline estimation does not consider the heterogeneous impact of agricultural water conservation policy on agricultural water extraction table 10 further analyzes the heterogeneous impact of the agricultural water conservation policy heterogeneity analysis is mainly carried out from three perspectives precipitation land potentiality and slope for the heterogeneity analysis we multiply precipitation land potentiality and slope with ln land area post respectively the results show that there is no heterogeneity in the water saving effect of the agricultural water conservation policy under different precipitations and slopes however there is heterogeneity in agricultural water saving effect of the agricultural water conservation policy under different land potentialities specifically provinces with higher land potentiality for crop production have better water saving effects the possible explanation lies in the substitution relationship between land and water resources in which the land with high potentiality for crop production may also contain more water in soil resulting in less water demand for agricultural production this suggests that implementing agricultural water conservation policies in areas with high land potentiality for crop production will be more effective 5 conclusion does the implementation of agricultural water conservation policy necessarily reduce agricultural water extraction taking china s national water conservation outline proposed in 2012 as an example this paper uses the data of 31 provinces from 2000 to 2019 and employs an empirical strategy of difference in differences did to estimate the effect of the agricultural water conservation policy on agricultural water extraction in this paper it can be found that the agricultural water conservation policy does not result in a reduction in agricultural water extraction but rather increases agricultural water extraction when considering the impact of other contemporaneous water related policies including the reform of the water rights system and the south to north water diversion project the above conclusions remain robust consistent conclusions are still obtained under the subsample estimation after excluding the municipalities directly under the central government in china the possible reason why the agricultural water conservation policy does not reduce agricultural water extraction but increases agricultural water extraction is that agricultural water conservation policy promotes the agricultural production especially by expanding the sown area and irrigated area and the expansion of irrigated area is the main reason for the increase in agricultural water extraction besides the overall impact of the agricultural water extraction policy can be approximately separated into physical and economic impacts which account for 30 84 and 69 16 of the overall impact respectively therefore the economic impact is the main driver of the increase in agricultural water extraction which is consistent with the increase in the irrigated area in the heterogeneity analysis the difference in precipitation or slope does not affect the water saving effect of the agricultural water conservation policy but land potentiality for crop production will affect the water saving effect of the agricultural water conservation policy in which provinces with higher land potentiality will have less increase in agricultural water extraction caused by the agricultural water conservation policy although agricultural water conservation policy can ideally reduce the waste of water resources and efficiently utilize water resources thereby reducing the demand for water resources agricultural water conservation policy can also increase the demand for water resources by promoting agricultural production taking china as an example it is found that agricultural water conservation policy may play a greater role in increasing agricultural production which in turn leads to an increase in agricultural water extraction instead of decreasing this phenomenon is also interpreted as rebound effects in order to alleviate the rebound effects brought by agricultural water conservation policy more intensive efforts can be given in areas with high land potentiality for crop production the rebound effect of agricultural water extraction indeed happens over the world the possible reason is that agricultural water conservation policies try to reduce agricultural water extraction by subsidizing water saving technology this way may reduce the cost of agricultural water extraction and lead to more area irrigated which may make it difficult for the water resources to transfer from the agricultural sector to the non agricultural sector therefore the possible way to reduce the rebound effects is to make the use of water resources market oriented such as the reform of the water rights system the water rebound effect will be serious if it leads to drastic overdraft of groundwater threatening the sustainability of water utilization and the health of the ecosystem therefore in areas where the groundwater levels are unstable it is necessary to reduce agricultural water use through market based policies such as water rights reform the above conclusions are based on the data of 31 provinces in china from 2000 to 2019 with an empirical strategy of difference in differences did however the conclusions obtained by using other methods or data may be different therefore research based on other samples and methods especially the micro research based on farmers will be the future research direction declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
9281,agricultural water use in heavily irrigated regions can reduce surface water flow the most remarkable hydrological change in recent times in central asia is the rapid dry up of the aral sea in this paper the evolution of agricultural development was traced back to the 1910s land water food lwf nexus in central asia was evaluated and the relationship between agricultural development and aral sea dry up was built it was noted that for the 1910 2010s the harvested land area in the region expanded nearly two folds from 7 2 to 21 6 million ha production of cereal crops increased over eight folds from 4 0 to 37 6 million tonnes cotton production reached 5 5 million tonnes a seven fold increase the high increase in productivity was driven by increasing agricultural irrigation since the 1950s irrigation water requirement for the five main crops wheat cotton maize barley and rice increased by about 50 from 64 3 km3 in the 1950s to 95 9 km3 in the 2010s cotton and wheat were the top two crops with respective total irrigation water use of 66 9 and 16 4 for the study area lwf nexus was quantified in terms of production efficiency using the data envelopment analysis method and it was shown that excess water and land resources made agricultural production inefficient analysis of the irrigated area and the aral sea water surface area suggested that for every 1 0 km2 increase in irrigated land area water surface area in the aral sea declined by 1 2 km2 the analysis of lwf tradeoff was key not only for sustainable land water and ecological management but also for food production in degraded arid lands around the globe keywords land water food nexus crop water requirement sankey diagram data envelopment analysis production efficiency aral sea data availability the

less use of water resources the nexus thinking benefits the improvement in resource efficiency regarding usage and avoids the adverse effects of single resource development strategy el gafy et al 2017 ibrahim et al 2019 since land and water resources are among the basic requirements for food production a land water food lwf nexus can be used to study the linkages between land and water resources relative to food production the lwf nexus is built on tracking resource use efficiency a comprehensive and efficient use of land and water resources can improve agricultural production efficiency and thereby prevent the broader effects of water shortage lwf nexus can further be used to determine the potential of national food production and food security by linking the drivers of food demand with the available land and water resources ibarrola rivas et al 2017 kumar et al 2012 the cultivation structure of crops can be adjusted to not only resolve regional water shortage but also ensure food security by formulating local food consumption as the basis for adjustments in grain production ren et al 2018 the aral sea has been shrinking since the early 1960s the same period when the soviet government started promoting agricultural development in the region water has since been diverted from the two main rivers syrdarya and amudarya rivers for agricultural production in the next 40 years or so that followed irrigated area increased rapidly and led tothe boom in crop production cai et al 2003 the decreasing inflow from these main tributary rivers resulted in the rapid shrinkage of the aral sea micklin 2006 2007 which phenomenon continues to date it is therefore key to have a comprehensive analysis of the evolution of agricultural development in this area of central asia and evaluate the correlation between agricultural development and the aral sea shrinkage thus the objects of this study were to determine i changes in cultivated area and crop production in the study area since the 1910s ii changes in irrigation water requirement for five main crops in the study area since the 1950s iii the dynamics of the lwf nexus in terms of resource use and production efficiency and iv the link between the development of irrigated agriculture and the shrinkage of the aral sea address these areas will guide us about what is needed for sustainable agriculture production in the region and elsewhere in the world thus the study will not only help understand the causes of water loss in the aral sea but can also help develop a sustainable agricultural production and ecological restoration strategy in central asia this is critical for the land and water management and for ecological protection in degraded arid lands across the globe 2 materials and method 2 1 study area the region of central asia covered in this study consists of five countries kazakhstan uzbekistan turkmenistan kyrgyzstan and tajikistan and a total area of 4 million km2 fig 1 kazakhstan is the largest country accounting for 68 1 of the area of the central asia study area uzbekistan and turkmenistan together occupy 23 4 of the study area the two smallest countries kyrgyzstan and tajikistan together comprise only 8 5 of the total area frenken 2013 far away from the ocean there is a dominant continental climate with low rainfall and extreme temperature the landscape is characterized by mountains deserts and steppes babu and tashmatov 1999 the highly heterogeneous terrain and varying altitude 0 7500 m asl form the basis of the diverse micro climatic conditions in the region the mean annual precipitation is 273 mm with an annual range of 80 200 mm in the lowland desert in the southwest 300 400 mm in the foothill region and 600 800 mm in the mountains in the east frenken 2013 the aral sea one of the water bodies with the most severe shrinkage and ecological degradation in the world lies in the central west of central asia the amudarya and syrdarya rivers are the two largest rivers in central asia driving inflow water into the aral sea micklin 2007 central asia is one of the regions with the most ancient irrigation infrastructure abdullaev and rakhmatullaev 2015 irrigated agriculture is the largest water user accounting for 75 6 of all water withdrawal in kazakhstan and over 90 in the other four countries frenken 2013 this proportion of water withdrawal is clearly above the 70 global average for irrigated lands mueller et al 2014 expansion of irrigation network has significantly increased crop production in the region especially cotton o hara 1997 wheat barley and cotton are the main crops grown in central asia with respective total harvested areas of 61 12 and 10 in 1992 2016 rice and maize are also the two significant cereal crops in central asia irrigation water requirement for the above five crops was estimated for the period since the 1950s 2 2 data collection and estimation first data were collected on land production irrigation weather and crop distribution the crop efficient method was used to calculate water requirements of the various crops the irrigation water requirement was determined by multiplying irrigated area by the difference between evapotranspiration and effective rainfall in addition data on water dynamics in the aral sea and the aral sea basin were collected to clarify the evolution of aral sea and its relationship with the development of irrigated agriculture 2 2 1 data collection 2 2 1 1 land and production data on harvested area irrigated area yield and total production for the period 1913 2016 were collected the data for the period 1913 1976 were obtained from the soviet national economic statistical yearbook central statistical office of the soviet union 1957 and the soviet national economy in sixty years central statistical office of the soviet union 1979 then data for 1992 2016 were from the literatures bucknall et al 2003 frenken 2013 and the food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao http www fao org home en data on irrigated land area in the aral sea basin were from boomer et al 2000 and yang et al 2020 2 2 1 2 meteorological data two sets of meteorological data were downloaded for the central asia region to calculate et o one set of the weather data including monthly temperature and precipitation for 1953 2016 in 75 of the meteorological stations was from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa at https gis ncdc noaa gov maps ncei summaries monthly the other set of monthly mean data for climatic parameters including maximum and minimum temperature relative humidity wind speed and sunshine hours covered the period 1971 2000 and was from 19 meteorological stations in the climwat database published by fao http www fao org land water databases and software 2 2 1 3 crop distribution monthly spatial distribution of rainfed and irrigated area of the five crops in central asia was extracted from the mirca 2000 dataset portmann et al 2010 this was calculated based on the 1998 2002 data at 5 arc minute resolution grid cell this includes 26 different crops and their distributions for irrigated and rainfed areas in the world 2 2 1 4 hydrology data the aral sea surface area water volume and inflow into the aral sea were collected from cawater info website http cawater info net river runoff was from asarin et al 2010 and zan et al 2021 2 2 2 irrigation water requirement 2 2 2 1 crop water requirement calculation first monthly et o from the 19 meteorological stations locations marked in red in fig 1 was calculated using two methods the thornthwaite equation known as et o th pascual ferrer and candela 2015 thornthwaite 1948 and the cropwat model known as et o pm http www fao org land water databases and software the monthly calibration coefficient average et o pm et o th was used to calibrate the corresponding et o from the 75 meteorological stations locations marked in blue in fig 1 using the thornthwaite equation the penman monteith method nested in the cropwat model is more credible whereas the thornthwaite model is good for estimating et o in limited weather data conditions with the needed input data being only temperature second crop water requirement was estimated using the crop coefficient method et o was interpolated via idw inverse distance weighted for all the meteorological stations and et c for the five irrigated crops determined based on the distributions of the crops then monthly et c for the various crops was calculated using eq 1 as follows 1 et c et o k c where et c is monthly water requirement of each crop in a growing season mm and k c is monthly crop coefficient of the main crops for the growing period in the cropwat model k c was derived from cropwat model and calibrated by locally available values cholpankulov et al 2008 pereira et al 2009 conrad et al 2013 the crop coefficient for each month of the growing season was estimated via linear interpolation of k c for each of the crop growth stages as the general mode of irrigation was traditional furrow and flood irrigation with high specific water use average of 12400 m3 ha cawater info website we assumed that the actual crop water consumption was close to the estimated et c for crop with no water stress this assumption was reasonable as most farmers cannot forego yield by subjecting crops to water stress abdullaev and molden 2004 based on faostat the variation in actual crop yield in ca was comparatively gentle this suggested that the assumption was valid 2 2 2 2 irrigation water requirement calculation the simplified usda soil conservation service method nested in the cropwat model smith 1992 was used to calculate effective rainfall in eq 2 and eq 3 as 2 p effmon p mon 125 0 2 p mon 125 for p mon 250 mm month 3 p effmon 125 0 1 p mon for p mon 250 mm month where p effmon is monthly effective rainfall mm p mon is monthly rainfall mm and spatial p effmon is interpolated via idw and p effmon for places with the five irrigated crops determined based on the spatial distributions of the crops irrigation water requirement is et c without effective rainfall in addition given water loss during irrigation such as canal loss and deep seepage in farmland the actual crop irrigation water requirement cir was divided by irrigation water use efficiency i e in eq 4 as 4 cir area m initial stage m late season et c mon p ef f mon i e m mont h initial month l a t e s e a s o n where area is irrigated area of various crops million km2 non collected irrigation areas in some years were estimated from harvested areas and irrigation proportions of the various crops calculated based on the distributions of rainfed and irrigated crops in the various countries then cir is for the whole growing season km3 furrow and basin irrigation are the most common forms of irrigation in central asia the estimated field level efficiency of furrow and basin irrigation varies within 40 55 bekchanov et al 2010 and 30 35 of the water diverted from the source was used in agricultural irrigation dukhovny et al 2018 thus 33 was used for i e in this study to estimate actual cir 2 3 sankey diagram the sankey diagram is vital in determining inefficiencies and potential savings when dealing with resources schmidt 2008 and it is commonly used in visualizing water energy food nexus curmi et al 2013 mathis et al 2021 for example it is used to visualize the flows of materials and energy in several applications to understand losses and inefficiencies to map production processes and to give sense of scale across systems lupton and allwood 2017 in this study sankey diagrams were used to visualize the evolution of harvested areas and productions of various crops since the 1910s and that of cir since the 1950s in central asia data for 1913 1953 1995 2005 and 2015 denoted respectively the 1910s 1950s 1990s 2000s and 2010s 2 4 production efficiency evaluation to understand the past and current states of agricultural production in central asia the lwf nexus was quantified using production efficiency obtained from the data envelopment analysis dea dea is a non parametric technique used to measure the relative efficiency of a decision making unit dmu with multi input consumption and multi output production li et al 2016 it addresses systems with black box characteristics by relaxing complex relations to evaluate individual units using resources consumed and outcomes produced emrouznejad and yang 2018 there are multiple dea models each with different economic interpretations the dea model used to assess technical efficiency under the variable returns to scale vrs assumption was first developed by banker et al 1984 and was called bcc banker charnes and cooper model in addition the study of efficiency using dea can be orientated towards input or output the difference lies in whether the objective is to continue using the same amount of input while producing more output output orientated dea or to produce the same amount of output with fewer inputs input orientated dea apparently it is more rational to choose input orientation to consider the potential decrease in resource use than increase in production in the increasing water scarcity in the study area it is assumed that there are n dmus to be evaluated dmu consumes varying amounts of m different inputs to produce s different outputs then the bcc input oriented model is illustrated below in eq 5 as follows sözen et al 2010 malana and malano 2006 5 min h 0 ϕ ε i 1 m s i r 1 s s r subject to j 1 n λ j x ij s i ϕ x 0 j 1 n λ j y rj s r y 0 j 1 n λ j 1 λ j 0 s i 0 s r 0 j 1 n i 1 m r 1 s where the subscript o means that dmu is assessed and h 0 is efficiency score of dmuo ϕ is a scalar variable that represents the possible radial enlargement constant applied to all outputs to obtain projected output values x ij and y rj denote input i and output r of dmu j respectively λj is the jth coefficient of a vector of n dmus and indicates the relevance or intensity of each of the best performers as benchmark for the dmuo under analysis ε is an arbitrary small non archimedean number s i is the slack or excess in the ith input and s r is the slack or shortage in the rth output following the bcc input oriented model an efficient dmu j can be defined to satisfy the conditions that ϕ 1 s i 0 s r 0 if ϕ 1 it suggests a degree of inefficiency in input deap version 2 1 was used in this study which is a computer program written to conduct dea for the purpose of calculating efficiencies in production the production situations in the 1950s 1990s 2000s and 2010s were evaluated thus there were four dmus for each country the two inputs were harvested area and irrigation water amount and the one output was production the final evaluation gives an efficiency of value between 0 and 1 for every dmu here 1 denotes the highest production efficiency with no potential for further reduction in land and water resources an efficiency value less than 1 however suggests a degree of inefficiency in production this could mean that there is excess land and or water use compared with efficient dmus as the benchmark the reduction in input of each inefficient dmu is estimated it is noted that given the differences in yield per unit area for various crops and countries the total production in lwf nexus analysis was adjusted for each country wheat production was used as a base for actual productions of the other crops adjusted by multiplying by respective coefficients that is the price of another crop divided by the price of wheat where the production in lwf nexus analysis is the sum of actual wheat production and adjusted productions of other crops in addition the prices were from fao website 3 results 3 1 evolution of harvested area fig 2 shows the evolution of harvested area in central asia for the period from the 1910s to the 2010s the left part of fig 2 histogram 1 3 shows the changes in harvested area and the increases in various crops in different periods in the 1910s the total harvested crop area was only 7 2 million ha with wheat accounting for 4 3 million ha cotton 0 56 million ha and the other cereals 2 3 millionha in the 1910 1950s the total harvested area for all the crops increased by 3 7 million ha representing 50 expansion in wheat cultivation in the following 1950s1990s the total harvested area again increased by 6 0 million ha with wheat accounting for 91 2 of that increase 5 5 million ha and other cereal crops reduced by 2 6million ha in the 10 year period the most rapid expansion was in the 1990s2000s with a total increase of 3 1 million ha of this increase 3 3 million ha was in wheat and the areas under barley rice and the other cereals dropped the 1 6 million ha increase in the 2000s2010s was about half of that in the 1990s2000s and also nearly all the expansion was for wheat in the 2010s the total harvested crop area reached 21 6 million ha the right part of fig 2 histogram 1 4 6 shows the harvested areas for the various crops and the corresponding countries in the 2010s the area under wheat was largest 16 7 million ha accounting for 77 0 of the total 21 6 million ha harvested area of the total area under wheat 82 1 13 7 million ha was in kazakhstan this made kazakhstan the main wheat cultivation country in central asia the area under cotton was 2 3 million ha ranking second 58 3 1 3 million ha of which was in uzbekistan this made uzbekistan the main cotton cultivation region in central asia 3 2 cir evolution fig 3 depicts the evolution of cir in central asia for the 1950s2010s the start time was the 1950s and not the 1910s because there was no data on irrigated cultivation the left half of fig 3 histograms 1 3 shows changes in cir along with increases in various crops in different periods in the 1950s total cir was 64 3 km3 with cotton cir being the highest accounting for 51 7 km3 84 0 of the total cir wheat cir ranked second accounting for only 6 4 km3 10 0 of the total cir the highest increase in cir was 40 8 km3 which was in the 1950 1990s this increase was driven by the increase in cotton 26 3 km3 wheat 7 8 km3 and other crops 6 7 km3 there was only 1 7 km3 increase in cir in the 1990s2000s this included increase in wheat cotton and maize and then decrease in rice and barley the final increase in cir was negative 10 9 km3 which was in the 2000s2010s then the highest drop was in cotton 15 4 km3 which implied that the total cir dropped in the 2010s over that in the 2000s the final cir for all the crops in central asia was 95 9 km3 which was in the 2010s the right half of fig 3 histogram 1 histograms 4 6 shows the respective cir of the various crops and in different countries in the 2010s the highest cir 64 2 km3 was for cotton accounting for 66 9 of the total amount in the 2010s for the cotton cir 39 5 km3 61 6 was in uzbekistan and 16 1 km3 25 1 in turkmenistan the top two highest cir countries in the 2010s were uzbekistan 51 1 and turkmenistan 27 8 driven mainly by cotton cultivation wheat cir of 15 8 km3 ranked second accounting for 16 4 of the total cir 6 6 km3 42 1 of which was in uzbekistan and 5 8 km3 36 8 in turkmenistan 3 3 crop production evolution given the low cotton yield per unit area the production of cotton was presented separately from those of cereal crops wheat maize barley rice and others cereals fig 4 shows the production evolution of cereal crops in central asia for the 1910s2010s the left half of fig 4 histograms 1 3 shows the changes in production along with the increases in the various cereal crops in different periods in the 1910s the total cereal production was only 4 0 million tonnes wheat was 2 3 million tonnes of this amount accounting for 58 5 of the total production the total increase of 15 4 million tonnes in the 1950s1990s was higher with wheat increasing by 13 3 million tonnes 86 2 of that total for the ten year period 11 8 million tonnes of the increase was in the 2000s2010s this was the highest increase the increase in wheat was 10 3 million tonnes accounting for 87 4 of the total the production increase was less in the 1910s1950s and the 1990s2000s the total cereal crop production reached 37 6 million tonnes in the 2010s in central asia the right half of fig 4 histogram 1 histograms 4 6 depicts the respective productions of the various cereal crops and the producing countries in the 2010s the highest wheat production was 32 0 million tonnes accounting for 84 9 of the total production of cereal crops of this amount 22 7 million tonnes 71 1 of the total was in kazakhstan and 6 5 million tonnes 20 4 of the total in uzbekistan thus kazakhstan was the main wheat producer in central asia fig 5 shows the evolution of cotton production since the 1910s there was a general increase in trend for the period 1910s2000s the initial cotton production was only 0 66 million tonnes in the 1910s and the highest production reached 5 8 million tonnes in the 2000s there was a slight decrease since the 2000s and the production was 5 5 million tonnes in the 2010s which was 8 3 times of that in the 1910s the production range of 0 52 3 7 million tonnes in uzbekistan was the driving factor of the average trend in central asia the highest percent range for uzbekistan 64 2 78 2 of the total for the various periods made the country the highest cotton producer in central asia cotton production in turkmenistan ranked second averagely accounting for 18 1 of the total in central asia 4 discussion 4 1 accuracy of estimated irrigation water requirement as agriculture was the highest water user in the study area it was important to evaluate the accuracy of cir obtained in this study taking cotton et c for the 2000s as an example the estimated values varied within 749 1002 mm the highest et c for uzbekistan almost matched with what has been reported in several other studies using the penman monteith equation and the same country they were 768 816 mm by pereira et al 2009 927 8 mm by conrad et al 2013 and 999 mm by chapagain et al 2006 it was also close to the actual evapotranspiration 936 1326 mm measured using lysimeters zheleznyh and cholponkulov 1985 the variations in crop coefficients and spatial variability in climatic conditions were very likely responsible for the deviations conrad et al 2013 the estimated et c for cotton was higher than the one obtained from remote sensing based actual et c of 768 mm conrad et al 2007 the satellite based remote sensing method usually underestimates et c because it takes into account crop water stress ibragimov et al 2007 showed in a field experiment in uzbekistan a much lower et c for cotton 642 739 mm cultivated under deficit furrow irrigation also the accuracy of the estimated et c from remote sensing was lower for relatively heterogeneous pixels liu et al 2016 the 908 mm cotton et c for turkmenistan agreed with the 896 925 mm obtained using the same crop efficient method thevs et al 2015 it was much higher than the 485 658 mm obtained via the satellite based remote sensing method thevs et al 2015 the low actual evapotranspiration can be explained partly in terms of under estimation by the satellite based remote sensing method but also water stress that was evident in the low crop yield thevs et al 2015 based on total water withdrawal for agricultural production in central asia the estimated 105 1 km3 in this study for the 1990s was lower than the actual amount of 125 5 km3 for 1994 frenken 2013 the estimated 106 8 km3 in this study for the 2000s was close to the actual withdrawal water 108 7 km3 in 2005 frenken 2013 the slightly lower values in this study were because the estimated cir was only for the five main crops in contrast the estimated 95 9 km3 in this study for the 2010s was slightly higher than the actual water withdrawal 95 3 km3 in 2018 abbasova et al 2019 the difference was realistic because of the increasing use of water saving technologies and more efficient irrigation methods abbasova et al 2019 for uzbekistan cir dropped since the 1990s with a total drop of 9 8 km3 by the 2010s this was close to the reduction of 9 3 km3 in actual withdrawal for irrigation abbasova et al 2019 frenken 2013 therefore the estimated cir in this study was reasonable the declining cir was partly driven by the changes in cultivated crops there was a shift from cotton to grains which have shorter vegetative periods and economic incentive for irrigation frenken 2013 using multiple remote sensing data de beurs et al 2015 noted a drop in evapotranspiration due to a shift from cotton to wheat in the southern region of the aral sea the relatively reasonable cir in this study was due to the way some of the key calculations were done i the monthly et o calibration using data from 75 meteorological stations involved multiplication by a calibrated coefficient average of et o pm et o th to have a relatively accurate reference crop evapotranspiration ii the respective estimation of monthly et o and effective rainfall for each crop and country was based on the spatial distributions of the irrigated crops iii the use of monthly crop coefficient instead of a constant for the entire growing season and the calibration by locally available values improved the estimated cir 4 2 lwf nexus based on production efficiency fig 6 shows the lwf nexus based on production efficiency since the 1950s for five main crops in various countries in central asia the harvested area and production almost continuously increased since the 1950s indicating a boom in agricultural production in the region the later negative or positive cir feedback on the continuous increase in harvested area or production indicated significant differences in the lwf nexuses in the various countries the variations in lwf nexus could be due to the significant differences and changes in production harvested area and cir fig 6 a kazakhstan and uzbekistan two main agriculture countries in central asia had entirely different planting structures and irrigation management practices wheat was the main crop accounting for 74 5 of all harvested area and 99 2 of it was under rainfed cultivation in kazakhstan portmann et al 2010 the expansion of rainfed wheat area resulted in a significant increase in production and negligible increase in cir on the country the change in planting structure from cotton to irrigated wheat started since the 1990s in uzbekistan irrigation water requirement of cotton during the growing season was about 1 0 folds higher than that of wheat it implied then that the continuous increase in production was driven by irrigated wheat and the huge decline in cir driven by the decline in harvested area of cotton in the 2010s there was continuous increase in harvested area and cir in turkmenistan however there was a sharp drop in production due to the shift in planting structure shifting from cereals to cotton and a sharp decline in wheat yield water stress led to low wheat yield because of inefficient irrigation water use thevs et al 2015 the decline in water withdrawal for agriculture and the drop in irrigated area partly led to the decline in production in the 2010s abbasova et al 2019 frenken 2013 there were marked variations in production efficiency in the five countries fig 6 b in kazakhstan for example the production efficiency was 0 8 in the 1950s with 2 1 million ha in excess harvested area and 1 2 km3 in excess cir this meant inefficient production because of excessive use of irrigation water and land the efficiency can be 1 0 if cuts are done in excess land and water use to keep the current production in the 1990s the production efficiency was highest reaching 1 0 due to rational land and water use and high production therefore there was no excess water and land use in the 1990s compared with production in the 1990s the production efficiency declined to 0 79 in the 2000s this was because the relatively low production and high harvested area and cir meant that there was overuse of water and land the production efficiency again reached the highest value of 1 0 due to rising production with stable harvested area and dropping cir in the 2010s the production efficiency in uzbekistan increased since the 1950s and peaked to 1 0 in the 2010s this was because there was significant rise in production and decline in harvested area and cir since the 1990s in contrast the production efficiency in turkmenistan decreased from 1 0 in the 1950s to 0 35 in the 2010s this was because there was significant rise in cir and harvested area and a significant decline in production in the 2010s the production efficiencies in tajikistan in the 1990s and 2000s were lower due mainly to excessive water use however the efficiencies in kyrgyzstan for the same periods remained high and stable tracking land and water consumptions via production efficiency evaluation is critical to set future targets with high efficiency it is possible that inefficient production can improve productivity by adopting the best resource use practices of efficient production in fig 6 b the inefficient production in some periods resulted in excess water and land use compared with highly efficient production with production efficiency of 1 0 at least one highly efficient production being the benchmark the ideal and theoretical targets of land and water use were the numerical values deducted from the excess amounts in conditions of no production decline the ways of reducing resource use were a matter of the various agricultural production conditions such as planting structure and irrigation efficiency the significantly high cir and water use in uzbekistan and turkmenistan resulted from the extensive cultivation of cotton generally under flood irrigation of high water use planting high yielding and drought resistant crops optimizing planting ratio of cereals and cotton and improving water use efficiency were some of the measures of less water use ruan et al 2020 showed that increasing wheat proportion effectively decreased water consumption in central asia the local food consumption can serve as the baseline for adjustment of cultivation structure of cereals ren et al 2018 4 3 tradeoff between irrigated agricultural development and aral sea shrinkage irrigated agriculture consumes some 80 85 of the available water resources in the region abdullaev and molden 2004 surface water is the main source of water for agricultural irrigation accounting on average for 96 4 of the water use frenken 2013 to know whether irrigated agricultural development was the main cause of desiccation of the aral sea a tradeoff analysis was done between irrigated agriculture and aral sea shrinkage in fact even though there was 36 500 km2 of agricultural land expansion in central asia during the 1910 1950s the aral sea shrinkage was negligible before 1960 an analysis of the hydrological dynamics of the aral sea cawater info website suggested an upward trend in the surface area with a slope of 10 5 km2 year however the water volume lightly dropped with a slope of 0 03 km3 year in 1911 1960 equal to 0 51 mm year decline for the 65 972 km2 aral sea area the stable hydrological features of the aral sea were on one hand driven by the high expansion of cereals in the 1910 1950s the increase in the area under cereals accounted for 70 25 500 km2 of the total expansion for which it was totally rainfed wheat in kazakhstan the increase in cotton area accounted for 30 11 000 km2 of the total land expansion and was mostly in uzbekistan and turkmenistan table 1 suggests an increase of only 9100 km2 of irrigated area in the aral sea basin during the 1930 1950s therefore the planting structure at that period hadn t resulted in the apparent increase in the total amount of irrigated area and water consumption on the other hand the stable hydrological features of the aral sea before 1960 was driven by the apparent increase in river runoff in the mountainous upstream area runoff increased by 10 2 km3 from 95 3 km3 in the 1930s to 105 5 km3 in the 1950s table 1 meanwhile irrigation water withdrawal increased by 12 3 km3 from 25 3 km3 to 37 6 km3 in the same period asarin et al 2010 this meant that the increase in irrigation water use was largely compensated for by the rise in runoff in the mountainous upstream area resulting in rising inflow into the asral sea in the 1950s compared with the 1930s table 1 the aral sea started to shrink in the early 1960s the same period the soviet government started to promote agricultural development in the region and especially irrigation agriculture the high withdrawal of surface water in the expanding irrigation system such as along syrdarya river was the drive behind the drastic change in the natural flow regime and in the ecosystem and the less inflow into the aral sea micklin 2006 1988 voeykov 1957 the total water withdrawal in the aral sea basin was estimated at 64 7 km3 in 1960 and 107 km3 in 2006 with corresponding irrigation withdrawals accounting for 58 2 km3 and 96 3 km3 90 of those totals frenken 2013 also irrigation water accounted for 95 3 km3 84 of the 113 km3 water withdrawal in 2018 abbasova et al 2019 irrigation withdrawal was very close to the contemporaneous runoff loss in rivers flowing through the aral sea basin table 1 meanwhile the runoff loss difference y was positively correlated with irrigation area x a correlation equation of y 1 1x 8 3 r2 0 99 for the 1930 2010s this was the direct response of river hydrology to agricultural expansion since the 1930s in response to the increasing water withdrawal annual river discharge into the aral sea was 62 5 km3 in the 1950s which was before the start of intensive irrigation in the study area net inflow to the aral sea dropped to only 7 1 km3 annually in the 1980s and to 9 0 km3 in the 2010s table 1 there was an apparent negative trend between the surface area of the aral sea and irrigated land area since the 1950s table 1 the water surface area of the sea dropped from 67 150 km2 in the 1950s to 8310 km2 in the 2010s conversely irrigated land area increased from 33 250 km2 in the 1950s to 80 500 km2 in the 2010s the correlation equation between the surface area of the aral sea y1 and irrigated area x was y1 1 2x 115 6 r2 0 86 for the 1950 2010s the negative correlation with a slope of 1 2 implied that the thriving irrigated agriculture depleted the inflow into the aral sea accelerating shrinkage of the aral sea further analysis showed that reclamation of 1 0 km2 of irrigated land resulted in an average shrinkage in the aral sea of 1 2 km2 the decline in both the aral sea and irrigated land area in the 2010s was partly because of the decreasing runoff in mountainous upstream area there was a decrease of 8 9 km3 relative to the runoff in the 2000s su et al 2021a noted that the still high agricultural water use continued to exert the pressure on the sea and therefore further shrinkage the other factors responsible for the shrinkage in the sea included the increasing water use by the increasing natural vegetation cover su et al 2021b and water bodies discharge of agricultural drainage surrounding the aral sea wang et al 2020 also the increase in domestic and industrial water use reduced the amount of river flow into the aral sea li et al 2021 further noted that the aral sea crisis was persistent and driven by competing water demands across different regions on the one hand and inefficient cross boundary water resources management on the other it is clear that both anthropogenic activity and long term climatic change together altered the dynamics of the aral seas in the period of only in one century the strong tradeoff between irrigated agricultural development and aral sea shrinkage suggested that agricultural water use was the leading driver of decreasing river inflow into the sea addressing climate change and its influence on the evolution of the aral sea is extremely complex because of micro sea climate in the aral sea regional climate in the area sea basin and even global climate the micro sea climate more directly affected the variations in the surface area of the aral sea through open evaporation and precipitation the regional and global climatic conditions more or less indirectly affected surface area of the aral sea by affecting river runoff from glacier melt cretaux et al 2013 and crop evapotranspiration and agriculture water use ruan et al 2020 also there was the complex interaction between anthropogenic activities and climate change destouni et al 2010 noted that water use for irrigation resulted in regional cooling of 0 6 c this was driven by increasing evapotranspiration and latent heat flux from irrigated lands often irrigation cooling effect masks regional effect of global warming the calculated shrinkage in the aral sea triggered regional temperature rise by 0 5 c which offset the cooling effect of irrigation destouni et al 2010 therefore it was hard to clearly isolate the effects of agricultural irrigation and climate change on aral sea shrinkage cretaux et al 2013 in the century of increasing annual air temperature in the aral sea basin precipitation peaked in the 1950s and reached lows in the 1910s and 1970s and the tendency for temperature and precipitation variations in different periods over the sea was not always coherent with that in the watershed surkova 2010 there has been no consensus on the effect of climate change on the aral sea shibuo et al 2007 showed that climate change slightly increased runoff into the aral sea by about 6 instead of driving its shrinkage destouni et al 2010 purported that runoff into and evaporation from the aral sea only slightly increased by 3 4 due to global climate change su et al 2021a and wang et al 2020 also reported a positive effect of climate change on water supply in the aral sea in contrast aus der beek et al 2011 noted that about 14 of the aral sea shrinkage was due to climate change much the same as noted by small et al 2001 even without consensus it was clear that runoff will decline in the aral sea basin due to glacier mass loss from warming temperatures huss and hock 2018 oberhänsli et al 2011 yang et al 2020 also crop water use will generally increase in a warming climate ruan et al 2020 these cause effect factors will lead to further desiccation of the aral sea and water stress in the basin it is therefore urgent to save water especially in agriculture 4 4 needed agricultural improvement agriculture water saving is the key to sustainable use of water resources and a good ecological environment given the large water use irrigation quota of 12400 m3 ha in agriculture cawater info website and the weak governance of transboundary water resources thevs et al 2015 there was an urgent need for efficient irrigation water use in central asia water loss was huge along the whole chain from headwater intake structure to downstream irrigated fields this was because the infrastructure of the furrow and basin irrigation systems used were outdated and ineffective bekchanov et al 2016 optimal irrigation strategies were key at the farm level and this was especially so for the main irrigated crops relatively mild deficit irrigation was good because it can ensure not only the continuous availability of soil water and groundwater but also minimal yield loss horst et al 2007 pereira et al 2009 the use of effective irrigation technologies and rational water schedules can ensure optimal water use efficiency and harvest ibragimov et al 2021 2007 turayeva 2012 the shift in cropping patterns from cotton to cereal led to the low specific water use theodoridis et al 2014 in addition investment in conveyance efficiency was critical for water availability and high output bekchanov et al 2016 water consumption in rainfed agriculture had a stronger effect on the hydrological cycle and global water stress because globally 80 of the croplands are rainfed and 60 70 of the food produced is under rainfed agriculture rost et al 2008 wheat was the most cultivated crop under rainfed agriculture portmann et al 2010 nearly all the wheat in kazakhstan was cultivated under rainfed conditions this form of agriculture should receive as much attention as irrigated agriculture for a comprehensive understanding of the impacts of agriculture production on regional hydrology and water resources increasing evapotranspiration results in decreasing runoff especially in arid and semiarid regions farley et al 2005 wang et al 2019 in the central asia study area evapotranspiration increased in over 50 of the vegetated area since the 1980s zhang et al 2015 in fact for every 10 increase in farmland there was 1 2 mm decline in runoff wang et al 2019 also once crops were planted the use of precipitation water by forest grassland or built up land was limited d odorico et al 2019 as rainfed agriculture used more water than uncultivated lands maintaining a certain amount of uncultivated land in upstream watersheds was critical for water availability in the downstream regions increasing productivity of rainfed lands via various measures kassam et al 2012 ngigi et al 2006 schierhorn et al 2014 and rationally limiting the expansion of rainfed agriculture were key ways of food and water security in central asia 5 conclusions this study analyzed in detail the evolution of agricultural development in central asia since the 1910s evaluated lwf nexus using production efficiency established the correlation between agricultural development and the aral sea shrinkage and then discussed the need for improvement in agricultural practices in the region and beyond compared with the 1910s there was 7 8 fold increase in total production and 2 fold increase in harvested area in the 2010s the higher increase in production was driven by the booming irrigated agriculture since the 1950s irrigation water requirement for the five main crops increased from 64 3 km3 in the 1950s to the peak of 106 8 km3 in the 2000s it dropped to 95 9 km3 in the 2010s due mainly to the drop in the area of land under cotton cotton and wheat were the cultivated crops with respective shares of the total water requirement of 66 9 and 16 4 uzbekistan and turkmenistan accounted respectively for 51 1 and 27 8 of the total water use due mainly to the cotton production in the 2010s for further understanding of the past and current states of agricultural production in central asia a lwf nexus in terms of production efficiency was evaluated by the dea method excess water and land use were estimated for various periods and countries and agricultural practices with the highest production efficiency were recommended the entirely different lwf nexus was mainly due to the different planting structures and irrigation practices a series of agriculture measures were needed to reduce resource use in the basin the stable hydrology features of the aral sea in 1911 1960 were driven by the large expansion of rain fed wheat and the synchronously rise in river inflow from upstream area which offset the increase in agriculture water the strong correlation between irrigated area in the aral sea basin and surface water area of the aral sea since the 1950s suggested that an increase of 1 0 km2 in irrigated area resulted in a decline of 1 2 km2 in surface water area in the aral sea it was critical to improve water use efficiency in agriculture and maintain proper scale of rainfed agriculture for sustainable crop production and water ecological security in central asia declaration of competing

9281,agricultural water use in heavily irrigated regions can reduce surface water flow the most remarkable hydrological change in recent times in central asia is the rapid dry up of the aral sea in this paper the evolution of agricultural development was traced back to the 1910s land water food lwf nexus in central asia was evaluated and the relationship between agricultural development and aral sea dry up was built it was noted that for the 1910 2010s the harvested land area in the region expanded nearly two folds from 7 2 to 21 6 million ha production of cereal crops increased over eight folds from 4 0 to 37 6 million tonnes cotton production reached 5 5 million tonnes a seven fold increase the high increase in productivity was driven by increasing agricultural irrigation since the 1950s irrigation water requirement for the five main crops wheat cotton maize barley and rice increased by about 50 from 64 3 km3 in the 1950s to 95 9 km3 in the 2010s cotton and wheat were the top two crops with respective total irrigation water use of 66 9 and 16 4 for the study area lwf nexus was quantified in terms of production efficiency using the data envelopment analysis method and it was shown that excess water and land resources made agricultural production inefficient analysis of the irrigated area and the aral sea water surface area suggested that for every 1 0 km2 increase in irrigated land area water surface area in the aral sea declined by 1 2 km2 the analysis of lwf tradeoff was key not only for sustainable land water and ecological management but also for food production in degraded arid lands around the globe keywords land water food nexus crop water requirement sankey diagram data envelopment analysis production efficiency aral sea data availability the authors are unable or have chosen not to specify which data has been used 1 introduction global surface water inland and coastal dynamics has very much been driven by human activity in the last decades which trend is projected to increase with time vo ro smarty et al 2000 some 90 000 km2 of permanent global surface water vanished between 1984 and 2015 35 of which was in the aral sea in central asia pekel et al 2016 the fact is that overuse of water resources has resulted in significant changes in the dynamics of water resources tuninetti et al 2019 this overuse is for most cases related with agriculture the singular direct drive of water shortage especially in heavily irrigated regions ma et al 2012 micklin 2007 varis 2014 generally higher efficiency in agriculture results in less use of water resources the nexus thinking benefits the improvement in resource efficiency regarding usage and avoids the adverse effects of single resource development strategy el gafy et al 2017 ibrahim et al 2019 since land and water resources are among the basic requirements for food production a land water food lwf nexus can be used to study the linkages between land and water resources relative to food production the lwf nexus is built on tracking resource use efficiency a comprehensive and efficient use of land and water resources can improve agricultural production efficiency and thereby prevent the broader effects of water shortage lwf nexus can further be used to determine the potential of national food production and food security by linking the drivers of food demand with the available land and water resources ibarrola rivas et al 2017 kumar et al 2012 the cultivation structure of crops can be adjusted to not only resolve regional water shortage but also ensure food security by formulating local food consumption as the basis for adjustments in grain production ren et al 2018 the aral sea has been shrinking since the early 1960s the same period when the soviet government started promoting agricultural development in the region water has since been diverted from the two main rivers syrdarya and amudarya rivers for agricultural production in the next 40 years or so that followed irrigated area increased rapidly and led tothe boom in crop production cai et al 2003 the decreasing inflow from these main tributary rivers resulted in the rapid shrinkage of the aral sea micklin 2006 2007 which phenomenon continues to date it is therefore key to have a comprehensive analysis of the evolution of agricultural development in this area of central asia and evaluate the correlation between agricultural development and the aral sea shrinkage thus the objects of this study were to determine i changes in cultivated area and crop production in the study area since the 1910s ii changes in irrigation water requirement for five main crops in the study area since the 1950s iii the dynamics of the lwf nexus in terms of resource use and production efficiency and iv the link between the development of irrigated agriculture and the shrinkage of the aral sea address these areas will guide us about what is needed for sustainable agriculture production in the region and elsewhere in the world thus the study will not only help understand the causes of water loss in the aral sea but can also help develop a sustainable agricultural production and ecological restoration strategy in central asia this is critical for the land and water management and for ecological protection in degraded arid lands across the globe 2 materials and method 2 1 study area the region of central asia covered in this study consists of five countries kazakhstan uzbekistan turkmenistan kyrgyzstan and tajikistan and a total area of 4 million km2 fig 1 kazakhstan is the largest country accounting for 68 1 of the area of the central asia study area uzbekistan and turkmenistan together occupy 23 4 of the study area the two smallest countries kyrgyzstan and tajikistan together comprise only 8 5 of the total area frenken 2013 far away from the ocean there is a dominant continental climate with low rainfall and extreme temperature the landscape is characterized by mountains deserts and steppes babu and tashmatov 1999 the highly heterogeneous terrain and varying altitude 0 7500 m asl form the basis of the diverse micro climatic conditions in the region the mean annual precipitation is 273 mm with an annual range of 80 200 mm in the lowland desert in the southwest 300 400 mm in the foothill region and 600 800 mm in the mountains in the east frenken 2013 the aral sea one of the water bodies with the most severe shrinkage and ecological degradation in the world lies in the central west of central asia the amudarya and syrdarya rivers are the two largest rivers in central asia driving inflow water into the aral sea micklin 2007 central asia is one of the regions with the most ancient irrigation infrastructure abdullaev and rakhmatullaev 2015 irrigated agriculture is the largest water user accounting for 75 6 of all water withdrawal in kazakhstan and over 90 in the other four countries frenken 2013 this proportion of water withdrawal is clearly above the 70 global average for irrigated lands mueller et al 2014 expansion of irrigation network has significantly increased crop production in the region especially cotton o hara 1997 wheat barley and cotton are the main crops grown in central asia with respective total harvested areas of 61 12 and 10 in 1992 2016 rice and maize are also the two significant cereal crops in central asia irrigation water requirement for the above five crops was estimated for the period since the 1950s 2 2 data collection and estimation first data were collected on land production irrigation weather and crop distribution the crop efficient method was used to calculate water requirements of the various crops the irrigation water requirement was determined by multiplying irrigated area by the difference between evapotranspiration and effective rainfall in addition data on water dynamics in the aral sea and the aral sea basin were collected to clarify the evolution of aral sea and its relationship with the development of irrigated agriculture 2 2 1 data collection 2 2 1 1 land and production data on harvested area irrigated area yield and total production for the period 1913 2016 were collected the data for the period 1913 1976 were obtained from the soviet national economic statistical yearbook central statistical office of the soviet union 1957 and the soviet national economy in sixty years central statistical office of the soviet union 1979 then data for 1992 2016 were from the literatures bucknall et al 2003 frenken 2013 and the food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao http www fao org home en data on irrigated land area in the aral sea basin were from boomer et al 2000 and yang et al 2020 2 2 1 2 meteorological data two sets of meteorological data were downloaded for the central asia region to calculate et o one set of the weather data including monthly temperature and precipitation for 1953 2016 in 75 of the meteorological stations was from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa at https gis ncdc noaa gov maps ncei summaries monthly the other set of monthly mean data for climatic parameters including maximum and minimum temperature relative humidity wind speed and sunshine hours covered the period 1971 2000 and was from 19 meteorological stations in the climwat database published by fao http www fao org land water databases and software 2 2 1 3 crop distribution monthly spatial distribution of rainfed and irrigated area of the five crops in central asia was extracted from the mirca 2000 dataset portmann et al 2010 this was calculated based on the 1998 2002 data at 5 arc minute resolution grid cell this includes 26 different crops and their distributions for irrigated and rainfed areas in the world 2 2 1 4 hydrology data the aral sea surface area water volume and inflow into the aral sea were collected from cawater info website http cawater info net river runoff was from asarin et al 2010 and zan et al 2021 2 2 2 irrigation water requirement 2 2 2 1 crop water requirement calculation first monthly et o from the 19 meteorological stations locations marked in red in fig 1 was calculated using two methods the thornthwaite equation known as et o th pascual ferrer and candela 2015 thornthwaite 1948 and the cropwat model known as et o pm http www fao org land water databases and software the monthly calibration coefficient average et o pm et o th was used to calibrate the corresponding et o from the 75 meteorological stations locations marked in blue in fig 1 using the thornthwaite equation the penman monteith method nested in the cropwat model is more credible whereas the thornthwaite model is good for estimating et o in limited weather data conditions with the needed input data being only temperature second crop water requirement was estimated using the crop coefficient method et o was interpolated via idw inverse distance weighted for all the meteorological stations and et c for the five irrigated crops determined based on the distributions of the crops then monthly et c for the various crops was calculated using eq 1 as follows 1 et c et o k c where et c is monthly water requirement of each crop in a growing season mm and k c is monthly crop coefficient of the main crops for the growing period in the cropwat model k c was derived from cropwat model and calibrated by locally available values cholpankulov et al 2008 pereira et al 2009 conrad et al 2013 the crop coefficient for each month of the growing season was estimated via linear interpolation of k c for each of the crop growth stages as the general mode of irrigation was traditional furrow and flood irrigation with high specific water use average of 12400 m3 ha cawater info website we assumed that the actual crop water consumption was close to the estimated et c for crop with no water stress this assumption was reasonable as most farmers cannot forego yield by subjecting crops to water stress abdullaev and molden 2004 based on faostat the variation in actual crop yield in ca was comparatively gentle this suggested that the assumption was valid 2 2 2 2 irrigation water requirement calculation the simplified usda soil conservation service method nested in the cropwat model smith 1992 was used to calculate effective rainfall in eq 2 and eq 3 as 2 p effmon p mon 125 0 2 p mon 125 for p mon 250 mm month 3 p effmon 125 0 1 p mon for p mon 250 mm month where p effmon is monthly effective rainfall mm p mon is monthly rainfall mm and spatial p effmon is interpolated via idw and p effmon for places with the five irrigated crops determined based on the spatial distributions of the crops irrigation water requirement is et c without effective rainfall in addition given water loss during irrigation such as canal loss and deep seepage in farmland the actual crop irrigation water requirement cir was divided by irrigation water use efficiency i e in eq 4 as 4 cir area m initial stage m late season et c mon p ef f mon i e m mont h initial month l a t e s e a s o n where area is irrigated area of various crops million km2 non collected irrigation areas in some years were estimated from harvested areas and irrigation proportions of the various crops calculated based on the distributions of rainfed and irrigated crops in the various countries then cir is for the whole growing season km3 furrow and basin irrigation are the most common forms of irrigation in central asia the estimated field level efficiency of furrow and basin irrigation varies within 40 55 bekchanov et al 2010 and 30 35 of the water diverted from the source was used in agricultural irrigation dukhovny et al 2018 thus 33 was used for i e in this study to estimate actual cir 2 3 sankey diagram the sankey diagram is vital in determining inefficiencies and potential savings when dealing with resources schmidt 2008 and it is commonly used in visualizing water energy food nexus curmi et al 2013 mathis et al 2021 for example it is used to visualize the flows of materials and energy in several applications to understand losses and inefficiencies to map production processes and to give sense of scale across systems lupton and allwood 2017 in this study sankey diagrams were used to visualize the evolution of harvested areas and productions of various crops since the 1910s and that of cir since the 1950s in central asia data for 1913 1953 1995 2005 and 2015 denoted respectively the 1910s 1950s 1990s 2000s and 2010s 2 4 production efficiency evaluation to understand the past and current states of agricultural production in central asia the lwf nexus was quantified using production efficiency obtained from the data envelopment analysis dea dea is a non parametric technique used to measure the relative efficiency of a decision making unit dmu with multi input consumption and multi output production li et al 2016 it addresses systems with black box characteristics by relaxing complex relations to evaluate individual units using resources consumed and outcomes produced emrouznejad and yang 2018 there are multiple dea models each with different economic interpretations the dea model used to assess technical efficiency under the variable returns to scale vrs assumption was first developed by banker et al 1984 and was called bcc banker charnes and cooper model in addition the study of efficiency using dea can be orientated towards input or output the difference lies in whether the objective is to continue using the same amount of input while producing more output output orientated dea or to produce the same amount of output with fewer inputs input orientated dea apparently it is more rational to choose input orientation to consider the potential decrease in resource use than increase in production in the increasing water scarcity in the study area it is assumed that there are n dmus to be evaluated dmu consumes varying amounts of m different inputs to produce s different outputs then the bcc input oriented model is illustrated below in eq 5 as follows sözen et al 2010 malana and malano 2006 5 min h 0 ϕ ε i 1 m s i r 1 s s r subject to j 1 n λ j x ij s i ϕ x 0 j 1 n λ j y rj s r y 0 j 1 n λ j 1 λ j 0 s i 0 s r 0 j 1 n i 1 m r 1 s where the subscript o means that dmu is assessed and h 0 is efficiency score of dmuo ϕ is a scalar variable that represents the possible radial enlargement constant applied to all outputs to obtain projected output values x ij and y rj denote input i and output r of dmu j respectively λj is the jth coefficient of a vector of n dmus and indicates the relevance or intensity of each of the best performers as benchmark for the dmuo under analysis ε is an arbitrary small non archimedean number s i is the slack or excess in the ith input and s r is the slack or shortage in the rth output following the bcc input oriented model an efficient dmu j can be defined to satisfy the conditions that ϕ 1 s i 0 s r 0 if ϕ 1 it suggests a degree of inefficiency in input deap version 2 1 was used in this study which is a computer program written to conduct dea for the purpose of calculating efficiencies in production the production situations in the 1950s 1990s 2000s and 2010s were evaluated thus there were four dmus for each country the two inputs were harvested area and irrigation water amount and the one output was production the final evaluation gives an efficiency of value between 0 and 1 for every dmu here 1 denotes the highest production efficiency with no potential for further reduction in land and water resources an efficiency value less than 1 however suggests a degree of inefficiency in production this could mean that there is excess land and or water use compared with efficient dmus as the benchmark the reduction in input of each inefficient dmu is estimated it is noted that given the differences in yield per unit area for various crops and countries the total production in lwf nexus analysis was adjusted for each country wheat production was used as a base for actual productions of the other crops adjusted by multiplying by respective coefficients that is the price of another crop divided by the price of wheat where the production in lwf nexus analysis is the sum of actual wheat production and adjusted productions of other crops in addition the prices were from fao website 3 results 3 1 evolution of harvested area fig 2 shows the evolution of harvested area in central asia for the period from the 1910s to the 2010s the left part of fig 2 histogram 1 3 shows the changes in harvested area and the increases in various crops in different periods in the 1910s the total harvested crop area was only 7 2 million ha with wheat accounting for 4 3 million ha cotton 0 56 million ha and the other cereals 2 3 millionha in the 1910 1950s the total harvested area for all the crops increased by 3 7 million ha representing 50 expansion in wheat cultivation in the following 1950s1990s the total harvested area again increased by 6 0 million ha with wheat accounting for 91 2 of that increase 5 5 million ha and other cereal crops reduced by 2 6million ha in the 10 year period the most rapid expansion was in the 1990s2000s with a total increase of 3 1 million ha of this increase 3 3 million ha was in wheat and the areas under barley rice and the other cereals dropped the 1 6 million ha increase in the 2000s2010s was about half of that in the 1990s2000s and also nearly all the expansion was for wheat in the 2010s the total harvested crop area reached 21 6 million ha the right part of fig 2 histogram 1 4 6 shows the harvested areas for the various crops and the corresponding countries in the 2010s the area under wheat was largest 16 7 million ha accounting for 77 0 of the total 21 6 million ha harvested area of the total area under wheat 82 1 13 7 million ha was in kazakhstan this made kazakhstan the main wheat cultivation country in central asia the area under cotton was 2 3 million ha ranking second 58 3 1 3 million ha of which was in uzbekistan this made uzbekistan the main cotton cultivation region in central asia 3 2 cir evolution fig 3 depicts the evolution of cir in central asia for the 1950s2010s the start time was the 1950s and not the 1910s because there was no data on irrigated cultivation the left half of fig 3 histograms 1 3 shows changes in cir along with increases in various crops in different periods in the 1950s total cir was 64 3 km3 with cotton cir being the highest accounting for 51 7 km3 84 0 of the total cir wheat cir ranked second accounting for only 6 4 km3 10 0 of the total cir the highest increase in cir was 40 8 km3 which was in the 1950 1990s this increase was driven by the increase in cotton 26 3 km3 wheat 7 8 km3 and other crops 6 7 km3 there was only 1 7 km3 increase in cir in the 1990s2000s this included increase in wheat cotton and maize and then decrease in rice and barley the final increase in cir was negative 10 9 km3 which was in the 2000s2010s then the highest drop was in cotton 15 4 km3 which implied that the total cir dropped in the 2010s over that in the 2000s the final cir for all the crops in central asia was 95 9 km3 which was in the 2010s the right half of fig 3 histogram 1 histograms 4 6 shows the respective cir of the various crops and in different countries in the 2010s the highest cir 64 2 km3 was for cotton accounting for 66 9 of the total amount in the 2010s for the cotton cir 39 5 km3 61 6 was in uzbekistan and 16 1 km3 25 1 in turkmenistan the top two highest cir countries in the 2010s were uzbekistan 51 1 and turkmenistan 27 8 driven mainly by cotton cultivation wheat cir of 15 8 km3 ranked second accounting for 16 4 of the total cir 6 6 km3 42 1 of which was in uzbekistan and 5 8 km3 36 8 in turkmenistan 3 3 crop production evolution given the low cotton yield per unit area the production of cotton was presented separately from those of cereal crops wheat maize barley rice and others cereals fig 4 shows the production evolution of cereal crops in central asia for the 1910s2010s the left half of fig 4 histograms 1 3 shows the changes in production along with the increases in the various cereal crops in different periods in the 1910s the total cereal production was only 4 0 million tonnes wheat was 2 3 million tonnes of this amount accounting for 58 5 of the total production the total increase of 15 4 million tonnes in the 1950s1990s was higher with wheat increasing by 13 3 million tonnes 86 2 of that total for the ten year period 11 8 million tonnes of the increase was in the 2000s2010s this was the highest increase the increase in wheat was 10 3 million tonnes accounting for 87 4 of the total the production increase was less in the 1910s1950s and the 1990s2000s the total cereal crop production reached 37 6 million tonnes in the 2010s in central asia the right half of fig 4 histogram 1 histograms 4 6 depicts the respective productions of the various cereal crops and the producing countries in the 2010s the highest wheat production was 32 0 million tonnes accounting for 84 9 of the total production of cereal crops of this amount 22 7 million tonnes 71 1 of the total was in kazakhstan and 6 5 million tonnes 20 4 of the total in uzbekistan thus kazakhstan was the main wheat producer in central asia fig 5 shows the evolution of cotton production since the 1910s there was a general increase in trend for the period 1910s2000s the initial cotton production was only 0 66 million tonnes in the 1910s and the highest production reached 5 8 million tonnes in the 2000s there was a slight decrease since the 2000s and the production was 5 5 million tonnes in the 2010s which was 8 3 times of that in the 1910s the production range of 0 52 3 7 million tonnes in uzbekistan was the driving factor of the average trend in central asia the highest percent range for uzbekistan 64 2 78 2 of the total for the various periods made the country the highest cotton producer in central asia cotton production in turkmenistan ranked second averagely accounting for 18 1 of the total in central asia 4 discussion 4 1 accuracy of estimated irrigation water requirement as agriculture was the highest water user in the study area it was important to evaluate the accuracy of cir obtained in this study taking cotton et c for the 2000s as an example the estimated values varied within 749 1002 mm the highest et c for uzbekistan almost matched with what has been reported in several other studies using the penman monteith equation and the same country they were 768 816 mm by pereira et al 2009 927 8 mm by conrad et al 2013 and 999 mm by chapagain et al 2006 it was also close to the actual evapotranspiration 936 1326 mm measured using lysimeters zheleznyh and cholponkulov 1985 the variations in crop coefficients and spatial variability in climatic conditions were very likely responsible for the deviations conrad et al 2013 the estimated et c for cotton was higher than the one obtained from remote sensing based actual et c of 768 mm conrad et al 2007 the satellite based remote sensing method usually underestimates et c because it takes into account crop water stress ibragimov et al 2007 showed in a field experiment in uzbekistan a much lower et c for cotton 642 739 mm cultivated under deficit furrow irrigation also the accuracy of the estimated et c from remote sensing was lower for relatively heterogeneous pixels liu et al 2016 the 908 mm cotton et c for turkmenistan agreed with the 896 925 mm obtained using the same crop efficient method thevs et al 2015 it was much higher than the 485 658 mm obtained via the satellite based remote sensing method thevs et al 2015 the low actual evapotranspiration can be explained partly in terms of under estimation by the satellite based remote sensing method but also water stress that was evident in the low crop yield thevs et al 2015 based on total water withdrawal for agricultural production in central asia the estimated 105 1 km3 in this study for the 1990s was lower than the actual amount of 125 5 km3 for 1994 frenken 2013 the estimated 106 8 km3 in this study for the 2000s was close to the actual withdrawal water 108 7 km3 in 2005 frenken 2013 the slightly lower values in this study were because the estimated cir was only for the five main crops in contrast the estimated 95 9 km3 in this study for the 2010s was slightly higher than the actual water withdrawal 95 3 km3 in 2018 abbasova et al 2019 the difference was realistic because of the increasing use of water saving technologies and more efficient irrigation methods abbasova et al 2019 for uzbekistan cir dropped since the 1990s with a total drop of 9 8 km3 by the 2010s this was close to the reduction of 9 3 km3 in actual withdrawal for irrigation abbasova et al 2019 frenken 2013 therefore the estimated cir in this study was reasonable the declining cir was partly driven by the changes in cultivated crops there was a shift from cotton to grains which have shorter vegetative periods and economic incentive for irrigation frenken 2013 using multiple remote sensing data de beurs et al 2015 noted a drop in evapotranspiration due to a shift from cotton to wheat in the southern region of the aral sea the relatively reasonable cir in this study was due to the way some of the key calculations were done i the monthly et o calibration using data from 75 meteorological stations involved multiplication by a calibrated coefficient average of et o pm et o th to have a relatively accurate reference crop evapotranspiration ii the respective estimation of monthly et o and effective rainfall for each crop and country was based on the spatial distributions of the irrigated crops iii the use of monthly crop coefficient instead of a constant for the entire growing season and the calibration by locally available values improved the estimated cir 4 2 lwf nexus based on production efficiency fig 6 shows the lwf nexus based on production efficiency since the 1950s for five main crops in various countries in central asia the harvested area and production almost continuously increased since the 1950s indicating a boom in agricultural production in the region the later negative or positive cir feedback on the continuous increase in harvested area or production indicated significant differences in the lwf nexuses in the various countries the variations in lwf nexus could be due to the significant differences and changes in production harvested area and cir fig 6 a kazakhstan and uzbekistan two main agriculture countries in central asia had entirely different planting structures and irrigation management practices wheat was the main crop accounting for 74 5 of all harvested area and 99 2 of it was under rainfed cultivation in kazakhstan portmann et al 2010 the expansion of rainfed wheat area resulted in a significant increase in production and negligible increase in cir on the country the change in planting structure from cotton to irrigated wheat started since the 1990s in uzbekistan irrigation water requirement of cotton during the growing season was about 1 0 folds higher than that of wheat it implied then that the continuous increase in production was driven by irrigated wheat and the huge decline in cir driven by the decline in harvested area of cotton in the 2010s there was continuous increase in harvested area and cir in turkmenistan however there was a sharp drop in production due to the shift in planting structure shifting from cereals to cotton and a sharp decline in wheat yield water stress led to low wheat yield because of inefficient irrigation water use thevs et al 2015 the decline in water withdrawal for agriculture and the drop in irrigated area partly led to the decline in production in the 2010s abbasova et al 2019 frenken 2013 there were marked variations in production efficiency in the five countries fig 6 b in kazakhstan for example the production efficiency was 0 8 in the 1950s with 2 1 million ha in excess harvested area and 1 2 km3 in excess cir this meant inefficient production because of excessive use of irrigation water and land the efficiency can be 1 0 if cuts are done in excess land and water use to keep the current production in the 1990s the production efficiency was highest reaching 1 0 due to rational land and water use and high production therefore there was no excess water and land use in the 1990s compared with production in the 1990s the production efficiency declined to 0 79 in the 2000s this was because the relatively low production and high harvested area and cir meant that there was overuse of water and land the production efficiency again reached the highest value of 1 0 due to rising production with stable harvested area and dropping cir in the 2010s the production efficiency in uzbekistan increased since the 1950s and peaked to 1 0 in the 2010s this was because there was significant rise in production and decline in harvested area and cir since the 1990s in contrast the production efficiency in turkmenistan decreased from 1 0 in the 1950s to 0 35 in the 2010s this was because there was significant rise in cir and harvested area and a significant decline in production in the 2010s the production efficiencies in tajikistan in the 1990s and 2000s were lower due mainly to excessive water use however the efficiencies in kyrgyzstan for the same periods remained high and stable tracking land and water consumptions via production efficiency evaluation is critical to set future targets with high efficiency it is possible that inefficient production can improve productivity by adopting the best resource use practices of efficient production in fig 6 b the inefficient production in some periods resulted in excess water and land use compared with highly efficient production with production efficiency of 1 0 at least one highly efficient production being the benchmark the ideal and theoretical targets of land and water use were the numerical values deducted from the excess amounts in conditions of no production decline the ways of reducing resource use were a matter of the various agricultural production conditions such as planting structure and irrigation efficiency the significantly high cir and water use in uzbekistan and turkmenistan resulted from the extensive cultivation of cotton generally under flood irrigation of high water use planting high yielding and drought resistant crops optimizing planting ratio of cereals and cotton and improving water use efficiency were some of the measures of less water use ruan et al 2020 showed that increasing wheat proportion effectively decreased water consumption in central asia the local food consumption can serve as the baseline for adjustment of cultivation structure of cereals ren et al 2018 4 3 tradeoff between irrigated agricultural development and aral sea shrinkage irrigated agriculture consumes some 80 85 of the available water resources in the region abdullaev and molden 2004 surface water is the main source of water for agricultural irrigation accounting on average for 96 4 of the water use frenken 2013 to know whether irrigated agricultural development was the main cause of desiccation of the aral sea a tradeoff analysis was done between irrigated agriculture and aral sea shrinkage in fact even though there was 36 500 km2 of agricultural land expansion in central asia during the 1910 1950s the aral sea shrinkage was negligible before 1960 an analysis of the hydrological dynamics of the aral sea cawater info website suggested an upward trend in the surface area with a slope of 10 5 km2 year however the water volume lightly dropped with a slope of 0 03 km3 year in 1911 1960 equal to 0 51 mm year decline for the 65 972 km2 aral sea area the stable hydrological features of the aral sea were on one hand driven by the high expansion of cereals in the 1910 1950s the increase in the area under cereals accounted for 70 25 500 km2 of the total expansion for which it was totally rainfed wheat in kazakhstan the increase in cotton area accounted for 30 11 000 km2 of the total land expansion and was mostly in uzbekistan and turkmenistan table 1 suggests an increase of only 9100 km2 of irrigated area in the aral sea basin during the 1930 1950s therefore the planting structure at that period hadn t resulted in the apparent increase in the total amount of irrigated area and water consumption on the other hand the stable hydrological features of the aral sea before 1960 was driven by the apparent increase in river runoff in the mountainous upstream area runoff increased by 10 2 km3 from 95 3 km3 in the 1930s to 105 5 km3 in the 1950s table 1 meanwhile irrigation water withdrawal increased by 12 3 km3 from 25 3 km3 to 37 6 km3 in the same period asarin et al 2010 this meant that the increase in irrigation water use was largely compensated for by the rise in runoff in the mountainous upstream area resulting in rising inflow into the asral sea in the 1950s compared with the 1930s table 1 the aral sea started to shrink in the early 1960s the same period the soviet government started to promote agricultural development in the region and especially irrigation agriculture the high withdrawal of surface water in the expanding irrigation system such as along syrdarya river was the drive behind the drastic change in the natural flow regime and in the ecosystem and the less inflow into the aral sea micklin 2006 1988 voeykov 1957 the total water withdrawal in the aral sea basin was estimated at 64 7 km3 in 1960 and 107 km3 in 2006 with corresponding irrigation withdrawals accounting for 58 2 km3 and 96 3 km3 90 of those totals frenken 2013 also irrigation water accounted for 95 3 km3 84 of the 113 km3 water withdrawal in 2018 abbasova et al 2019 irrigation withdrawal was very close to the contemporaneous runoff loss in rivers flowing through the aral sea basin table 1 meanwhile the runoff loss difference y was positively correlated with irrigation area x a correlation equation of y 1 1x 8 3 r2 0 99 for the 1930 2010s this was the direct response of river hydrology to agricultural expansion since the 1930s in response to the increasing water withdrawal annual river discharge into the aral sea was 62 5 km3 in the 1950s which was before the start of intensive irrigation in the study area net inflow to the aral sea dropped to only 7 1 km3 annually in the 1980s and to 9 0 km3 in the 2010s table 1 there was an apparent negative trend between the surface area of the aral sea and irrigated land area since the 1950s table 1 the water surface area of the sea dropped from 67 150 km2 in the 1950s to 8310 km2 in the 2010s conversely irrigated land area increased from 33 250 km2 in the 1950s to 80 500 km2 in the 2010s the correlation equation between the surface area of the aral sea y1 and irrigated area x was y1 1 2x 115 6 r2 0 86 for the 1950 2010s the negative correlation with a slope of 1 2 implied that the thriving irrigated agriculture depleted the inflow into the aral sea accelerating shrinkage of the aral sea further analysis showed that reclamation of 1 0 km2 of irrigated land resulted in an average shrinkage in the aral sea of 1 2 km2 the decline in both the aral sea and irrigated land area in the 2010s was partly because of the decreasing runoff in mountainous upstream area there was a decrease of 8 9 km3 relative to the runoff in the 2000s su et al 2021a noted that the still high agricultural water use continued to exert the pressure on the sea and therefore further shrinkage the other factors responsible for the shrinkage in the sea included the increasing water use by the increasing natural vegetation cover su et al 2021b and water bodies discharge of agricultural drainage surrounding the aral sea wang et al 2020 also the increase in domestic and industrial water use reduced the amount of river flow into the aral sea li et al 2021 further noted that the aral sea crisis was persistent and driven by competing water demands across different regions on the one hand and inefficient cross boundary water resources management on the other it is clear that both anthropogenic activity and long term climatic change together altered the dynamics of the aral seas in the period of only in one century the strong tradeoff between irrigated agricultural development and aral sea shrinkage suggested that agricultural water use was the leading driver of decreasing river inflow into the sea addressing climate change and its influence on the evolution of the aral sea is extremely complex because of micro sea climate in the aral sea regional climate in the area sea basin and even global climate the micro sea climate more directly affected the variations in the surface area of the aral sea through open evaporation and precipitation the regional and global climatic conditions more or less indirectly affected surface area of the aral sea by affecting river runoff from glacier melt cretaux et al 2013 and crop evapotranspiration and agriculture water use ruan et al 2020 also there was the complex interaction between anthropogenic activities and climate change destouni et al 2010 noted that water use for irrigation resulted in regional cooling of 0 6 c this was driven by increasing evapotranspiration and latent heat flux from irrigated lands often irrigation cooling effect masks regional effect of global warming the calculated shrinkage in the aral sea triggered regional temperature rise by 0 5 c which offset the cooling effect of irrigation destouni et al 2010 therefore it was hard to clearly isolate the effects of agricultural irrigation and climate change on aral sea shrinkage cretaux et al 2013 in the century of increasing annual air temperature in the aral sea basin precipitation peaked in the 1950s and reached lows in the 1910s and 1970s and the tendency for temperature and precipitation variations in different periods over the sea was not always coherent with that in the watershed surkova 2010 there has been no consensus on the effect of climate change on the aral sea shibuo et al 2007 showed that climate change slightly increased runoff into the aral sea by about 6 instead of driving its shrinkage destouni et al 2010 purported that runoff into and evaporation from the aral sea only slightly increased by 3 4 due to global climate change su et al 2021a and wang et al 2020 also reported a positive effect of climate change on water supply in the aral sea in contrast aus der beek et al 2011 noted that about 14 of the aral sea shrinkage was due to climate change much the same as noted by small et al 2001 even without consensus it was clear that runoff will decline in the aral sea basin due to glacier mass loss from warming temperatures huss and hock 2018 oberhänsli et al 2011 yang et al 2020 also crop water use will generally increase in a warming climate ruan et al 2020 these cause effect factors will lead to further desiccation of the aral sea and water stress in the basin it is therefore urgent to save water especially in agriculture 4 4 needed agricultural improvement agriculture water saving is the key to sustainable use of water resources and a good ecological environment given the large water use irrigation quota of 12400 m3 ha in agriculture cawater info website and the weak governance of transboundary water resources thevs et al 2015 there was an urgent need for efficient irrigation water use in central asia water loss was huge along the whole chain from headwater intake structure to downstream irrigated fields this was because the infrastructure of the furrow and basin irrigation systems used were outdated and ineffective bekchanov et al 2016 optimal irrigation strategies were key at the farm level and this was especially so for the main irrigated crops relatively mild deficit irrigation was good because it can ensure not only the continuous availability of soil water and groundwater but also minimal yield loss horst et al 2007 pereira et al 2009 the use of effective irrigation technologies and rational water schedules can ensure optimal water use efficiency and harvest ibragimov et al 2021 2007 turayeva 2012 the shift in cropping patterns from cotton to cereal led to the low specific water use theodoridis et al 2014 in addition investment in conveyance efficiency was critical for water availability and high output bekchanov et al 2016 water consumption in rainfed agriculture had a stronger effect on the hydrological cycle and global water stress because globally 80 of the croplands are rainfed and 60 70 of the food produced is under rainfed agriculture rost et al 2008 wheat was the most cultivated crop under rainfed agriculture portmann et al 2010 nearly all the wheat in kazakhstan was cultivated under rainfed conditions this form of agriculture should receive as much attention as irrigated agriculture for a comprehensive understanding of the impacts of agriculture production on regional hydrology and water resources increasing evapotranspiration results in decreasing runoff especially in arid and semiarid regions farley et al 2005 wang et al 2019 in the central asia study area evapotranspiration increased in over 50 of the vegetated area since the 1980s zhang et al 2015 in fact for every 10 increase in farmland there was 1 2 mm decline in runoff wang et al 2019 also once crops were planted the use of precipitation water by forest grassland or built up land was limited d odorico et al 2019 as rainfed agriculture used more water than uncultivated lands maintaining a certain amount of uncultivated land in upstream watersheds was critical for water availability in the downstream regions increasing productivity of rainfed lands via various measures kassam et al 2012 ngigi et al 2006 schierhorn et al 2014 and rationally limiting the expansion of rainfed agriculture were key ways of food and water security in central asia 5 conclusions this study analyzed in detail the evolution of agricultural development in central asia since the 1910s evaluated lwf nexus using production efficiency established the correlation between agricultural development and the aral sea shrinkage and then discussed the need for improvement in agricultural practices in the region and beyond compared with the 1910s there was 7 8 fold increase in total production and 2 fold increase in harvested area in the 2010s the higher increase in production was driven by the booming irrigated agriculture since the 1950s irrigation water requirement for the five main crops increased from 64 3 km3 in the 1950s to the peak of 106 8 km3 in the 2000s it dropped to 95 9 km3 in the 2010s due mainly to the drop in the area of land under cotton cotton and wheat were the cultivated crops with respective shares of the total water requirement of 66 9 and 16 4 uzbekistan and turkmenistan accounted respectively for 51 1 and 27 8 of the total water use due mainly to the cotton production in the 2010s for further understanding of the past and current states of agricultural production in central asia a lwf nexus in terms of production efficiency was evaluated by the dea method excess water and land use were estimated for various periods and countries and agricultural practices with the highest production efficiency were recommended the entirely different lwf nexus was mainly due to the different planting structures and irrigation practices a series of agriculture measures were needed to reduce resource use in the basin the stable hydrology features of the aral sea in 1911 1960 were driven by the large expansion of rain fed wheat and the synchronously rise in river inflow from upstream area which offset the increase in agriculture water the strong correlation between irrigated area in the aral sea basin and surface water area of the aral sea since the 1950s suggested that an increase of 1 0 km2 in irrigated area resulted in a decline of 1 2 km2 in surface water area in the aral sea it was critical to improve water use efficiency in agriculture and maintain proper scale of rainfed agriculture for sustainable crop production and water ecological security in central asia declaration of competing

9282,in this study factor analysis principal component analysis pca and correlation analysis were used to analyze the water quality in dry season of dongping lake which is the only natural lake in the lower yellow river and an important hub of south north water diversion project snwdp of china the nutritional status of the lake was evaluated by trophic level index and the spatial heterogeneity and aggregation status of the eutrophication level were studied by spatial autocorrelation analysis moreover the pollution discharge coefficient method was carried out to clarify the potential pollutant sources results showed that the lake was in the light eutropher state with the water quality of v and poor v nitrogen pollutants were the primary driving factor of water quality and water depth was the main environmental factor affecting the spatial distribution of nitrogen pollutants the eutrophication level of the entire lake showed significant positive spatial autocorrelation due to the influence of regional eutrophication levels the spatial heterogeneity of eutrophication level was low two hotspots high high concentration of eutrophication were present in the southeast p 0 01 and the north p 0 05 of the lake however causes for the formation of these two hotspots were different which mainly resulted from the non point source discharge of surrounding towns along the southeastern lake and the weak hydrodynamic conditions in the northern lake respectively therefore it is necessary to pay more attention to control the non point source discharge into dongping lake especially for regions around the southeast of the lake in the future management keywords dongping lake water quality pca spatial autocorrelation source analysis data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in recent decades the deterioration of water quality and the degradation of ecological function have become the common problems that most lakes in the world are facing especially the eutrophication which poses a great threat to lake ecosystem is still a major challenge in the field of lake research e g smith 2003 dodds et al 2009 qin et al 2020a identifying the lake eutrophication level and analyzing its pollutant sources are the key to lake management and play an important role in implementing the one lake one policy strategy in china for many lakes in china the water quality is usually worse during dry season than other periods due to the shortage of water resources and weak hydrodynamics in this season e g wen et al 2020 tian et al 2021 liu et al 2022 concerning water quality variations and analyzing pollutant sources in the dry season are helpful to reveal the eutrophication levels and pollution effects of lakes in china as the second largest freshwater lake in shandong province dongping lake is the only flood detention area in the lower yellow river and an important pivot of south north water diversion project snwdp its water quality is of vital importance to the environmental protection and high quality development of the yellow river basin in recent years with the rapid economic development and population growth in dongping lake basin pollutants originated from residents living aquaculture and industries have increased significantly resulting to serious water pollution in dongping lake e g chen et al 2014 zhang et al 2016 tian et al 2013 using multivariate statistical methods liu et al 2021 explored the relationship between the diatom taxa preserved in surface sediments and environmental variables in dongping lake and results showed that the lake was eutrophicated in all seasons zhang et al 2016 found that concentrations of the total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp and chemical oxygen demand cod of surface water in dongping lake were lower than grade iii of the china surface water quality standard gb3838 2002 and obviously affected by the wastewater drainage from dawen river time series of the water environmental factors of dongping lake in recent 40 years 1980 2016 were analyzed by li et al 2018 and four stages i e the initial deterioration period 1980 1989 rapid deterioration period 1990 1999 slow improvement period 2000 2006 and post improvement period 2007 2016 could be divided hu 2017 evaluated the influence of snwdp on the water quality nutrition and health risk of dongping lake before and after water delivery of snwdp the water quality of dongping lake all suffered light pollution the nutrition level was improved from mid eutrophication to medium nutrition and the health risk level was reduced from high medium to medium risks related studies about water quality of dongping lake mainly focused on water quality monitoring and evaluation and the influence of snwdp however to our knowledge few studies analyzed the pollutant sources of dongping lake although enormous researches have been carried out to evaluate the water eutrophication the methodologies were mainly restricted to the single factor method the trophic level index t li σ method and the principal component analysis pca e g liu et al 2020 zhang et al 2006 li et al 2019a in recent years remote sensing model simulation cluster analysis discriminant analysis and other multivariate statistical methods or techniques have been widely used in water quality analysis and evaluation identification of potential pollution sources and other aspects e g duan et al 2013 2016 however the spatial dependence of eutrophication and the spatial heterogeneity between different lake areas were usually neglected spatial autocorrelation has great applicability in analyzing the time space distribution and factor dependence and is widely used in aquaculture mineral exploration transportation planning and environmental pollution e g jossart et al 2020 nguyen and vu 2019 górniak 2016 wang et al 2016 li et al 2019b zhang et al 2008 for example using spatial autocorrelation li et al 2019b investigated the regional differences in environmental regulations spatial spillover and hysteresis effects on haze pollution zhang et al 2008 used spatial autocorrelation to identify the pollution hotspots of soil pb in galway ireland which provided a theoretical reference for urban environmental management although the spatial autocorrelation method can measure the spatial dependence of observed data application of one method will lead to a certain degree of deviation combination of multiple methods can evaluate the eutrophication level of lake more comprehensively and objectively based on previous studies methods including single factor evaluation method t li σ method spatial autocorrelation combined with gis and geoda and pca were used to evaluate the water quality aiming to illustrate the distribution features of nutrient factors and the degree of water pollution and eutrophication in dongping lake during dry season besides the pollution discharge coefficient method was used to analyze the pollutant sources to provide scientific references for the control and prevention of water pollution in dongping lake 2 material and methods 2 1 description of study area dongping lake 116 00 116 30 e 35 30 36 20 n is located in dongping county shandong province it is the second largest freshwater lake in shandong province and the only natural lake in the lower yellow river dongping lake receives inflows mainly from dawen river in the southeast and discharges into the yellow river via qinghe river in the north fig 1 except floodways and water transfer of snwdp dawen river is the only runoff into the lake th total area of dongping lake is 627 km2 and can be divided into the old and the new lake areas the old lake covers an area of 209 km2 with water area of 124 km2 and average water depth of 2 4 m commonly known as dongping lake the new lake covers an area of 418 km2 as a flood detention area the new lake holds no water all year round except in special flood years chen et al 2013 2014 the area studied in this paper refers to the old lake area with perennial water storage dongping lake lies in the temperate continental monsoon climate zone with november to march the dry season and june to august the wet season the aquatic vegetations in lake area are abundant with the potamogeton crispus and water chestnut widely distributed in the north and east regions of the lake deng et al 2016 yu et al 2020 the abundant aquatic vegetations provide sufficient food and various habitats for freshwater fishes shrimps and crabs making dongping lake an important aquaculture base in shandong province in 2002 dongping lake was identified as the last storing lake in the eastern route of snwdp and the starting lake in the water transport line to eastern shandong province water transfer in dongping lake as part of the eastern route of snwdp was started in 2013 and usually occurred from december to next may since then dongping lake has played a vital role in ensuring water security in northern china and eastern shandong 2 2 sample collection and measurements considering the impact of water transfer of the eastern route of snwdp samples were collected at the end of november 2020 to investigate the water quality of dongping lake in the dry season a total of 59 sampling sites were set over the entire lake fig 1 but in fact 52 samples were collected due to the influence of weather in the field for each sampling site water was sampled from the upper middle and lower layers of water column with a 5 l water collector to reduce the influence of vertical differences of water quality over the entire water column water samples from these three layers were mixed evenly and about 500 ml water samples were taken and sent to laboratory for water quality measurements the main factors analyzed in this study were total nitrogen tn nitrate nitrogen no3 n nitrite nitrogen no2 n ammonia nitrogen nh4 n total phosphorus tp phosphate po4 p chlorophyll chla and suspended sediment concentration ssc the samples were pretreated and measured according to the national standard methods tn and tp were determined by persulfate oxidation method hj636 2012 using uv spectrophotometer nh4 n was determined by nessler s reagent colorimetry method hj535 2009 no3 n was determined by uv spectrophotometry hj636 2012 and no2 n was determined by diazo coupling spectrophotometry chla was determined using a spectrophotometer after extraction in hot ethanol extraction po4 p was determined by molybdenum blue method and ssc was determined by filter weighing method 2 3 data analysis in present study water quality of dongping lake during dry season were evaluated by some traditional methods i e the single factor evaluation t li σ and pca besides spatial autocorrelation was used to analyzed the spatial heterogeneity of the eutrophication level of dongping lake and the pollution discharge coefficient method was applied to estimate the non point source pollution emissions from regions around dongping lake the research flow was shown in fig 2 2 3 1 single factor evaluation t li σ and pca single factor evaluation is a method to determine the water quality level by comparing the value of a certain water quality factor with the evaluation standard zhao et al 2021 in present study surface water quality standard gb3838 2002 issued by state environmental protection administration of china was selected to classify and evaluate the water quality based on the concentrations of tn tp and nh4 n based on gb3838 2002 the water quality can be classified into five grades with their evaluation standards and water body functions shown in table 1 t li σ can be expressed as the weighted sum of the tropic level index t li i with i representing the i th factor of water quality factors with t li i calculated from the concentration of the i th factor by a certain formula liu et al 2020 concentrations of chla tn and tp were used in present study and five grades can be categorized i e oligotropher t li σ 30 mesotropher 30 t li σ 50 light eutropher 50 t li σ 60 middle eutropher 60 t li σ 70 hyper eutropher t li σ 70 pca is used to select fewer comprehensive factors to replace the original variable factors and analyze the main factors affecting water quality it is a dimensionality reduction technique that helps to simplify the data and make it easier to visualize by finding a set of principal components duan et al 2016 in our study spss software was used to conduct pca on the measured data and the principal components were selected when the cumulative contribution rate was approximate to 80 2 3 2 spatial autocorrelation analysis spatial autocorrelation including global autocorrelation and local autocorrelation analyzes the correlation of an attribute value between adjacent regions qin et al 2019 global autocorrelation reflects the spatial agglomeration or dispersion degrees of the attribute value with the measurement index of global moran s i i g getis and ord 1992 the value of i g ranges from 1 1 generally a higher positive i g indicates a tendency towards aggregation while a lower negative i g indicates a tendency towards dispersion local autocorrelation can further determine the specific locations of the agglomeration or isolated area by local moran s i i l ord and getis 1995 when i l 0 the local spatial unit is positively correlated with its adjacent units showing high high or low low aggregation in contrast negative correlation exists between adjacent spatial units with i l 0 manifested as high low or low high distribution spatial autocorrelation analysis for the t li σ was conducted using geoda software in present study first i g was calculated and significance test was carried out with 95 confidence interval second i l was calculated and regional visualization was conducted by building lisa local indicators of spatial association maps to reveal different spatial distribution types 2 3 3 pollution discharge coefficient analysis the pollution discharge coefficient method can be used to estimate the emission of non point source pollutants in the absence of measured data with the aquaculture net cage withdrawn from dongping lake since 2018 feeding is strictly prohibited in the lake meanwhile the surrounding areas of dongping lake are mainly rural regions so that the non point source pollution in dongping lake are mainly from the agricultural farming and the residential living in present study pollutant emissions from agricultural sources including planting and livestock breeding and residential living sources were estimated in 8 towns around dongping lake i e zhoucheng daimiao xinhu laohu jiuxian shanglaozhuang yinshan and banjiudian with their locations shown in fig 1 according to the manual on accounting methods and coefficients of pollution production and emission in statistical investigation of emission sources issued by the ministry of ecology and environment of china equations of the theoretical emission of tn tp nh4 n and cod from agricultural and living sources are presented in table 2 with the calculation coefficients shown in table 3 the quantities of pollutant discharged into lake can then be expressed as the sum of emissions q from various pollution sources multiplied by the inflow coefficient λ taking tn as an example the quantity g discharged into lake can be expressed as 1 g j 1 n q j λ j in which q i and λ i represent the emission load and inflow coefficient from the j th pollution source respectively the inflow coefficients applied in yang et al 2020 were adopted in present study and shown in table 3 in addition the basic data of the population area consumption of chemical fertilizer livestock breeding in dongping county and towns surrounding dongping lake were taken from the dongping yearbook 2018 3 results and discussion 3 1 spatial distribution characteristics of water quality factors in order to illustrate the spatial distribution characteristics of water quality factors in dongping lake during the dry season spatial distributions of tn no3 n nh4 n tp and chla were analyzed using kriging interpolation method in arcgis as shown in fig 3 the average concentrations of tn no3 n nh4 n tp and chla were 2 51 mg l 1 60 mg l 0 53 mg l 0 06 mg l and 6 87 mg m3 respectively except for chla similar distributions were present between parameters mentioned above that is the concentrations gradually decreased from southeast to northwest of the lake the highest tn concentration measured in present study appeared in the southeast of the lake corresponding to the area around towns of laohu zhoucheng and xinhu and gradually decreased to the western and northern fig 3a no3 n accounted for the highest proportion 40 75 in tn concentration and its spatial distribution was similar to tn fig 3b nh4 n concentration was higher in the south of lake and lower in the northern fig 3c meanwhile tp concentration gradually decreased from south to north and increased slightly in a special part of the northern fig 3d it should be noted that the concentration of chla was lowest in the western and gradually increased towards the eastern and northern reaching the maximum at the northern outlet of the lake fig 3e in fact the chla distribution is not only affected by nutrient content but also largely depends on hydrodynamic conditions wu et al 2015 as the northern of dongping lake is very narrow fig 1 the disturbances of wind on water body are weak leading to the enrichment of chla and the presence of maximum in the north of dongping lake the spatial distribution characteristics of water quality factors with high concentrations present in the southeast were consistent with many other studies and it was usually attributed to the nutrient input of dawen river e g zhang et al 2016 as the only runoff into lake in the non impoundment period of snwdp dawen river flows into dongping lake from the southeast resulting in the domestic sewage industrial and agricultural waste water from the towns along the river eventually discharging into the lake however recent studies revealed that the non point source pollution in the surrounding area of the dawen river had been controlled effectively with the development of governance projects such as river dredging storage engineering and constructed wetland etc and the water quality had been significantly improved to grade ⅲ in recent years i e tn 1 0 mg l tp 0 05 mg l e g shen et al 2021 guo and zhang 2018 therefore compared with the input of dawen river the non point source discharge from areas around dongping lake made more contributions to the spatial distributions of nutrient in the lake which will be discussed in detail in section 3 4 3 2 evaluation and analysis of water quality and eutrophication level three water quality indicators i e tn tp and nh4 n were chosen to evaluate the water quality of dongping lake in dry season by single factor method taking tn as the evaluation indicator the water quality of all sampling sites was classified to grades ⅴ and poor ⅴ and the samples with poor ⅴ accounted for 82 7 fig 4a while taking tp as the evaluation indicator all the samples showed ⅲ and ⅳ water quality fig 4b among which samples located in the southern part of lake were in relatively poor water quality the evaluation results were better when take nh4 n as indicator and water quality of most samples were ⅱ 42 3 and ⅲ 57 7 fig 4c according to the requirements of the single factor method the comprehensive water quality is determined by the factor which reflects the worst water quality therefore the water quality in dongping lake during the dry season were ⅴ and poor ⅴ and predominant in poor ⅴ indicating that the water is only applicable to agricultural water areas and general landscape requirements table 1 tn was the main limiting factor of the water quality the ratio of tn to tp by mass was used as an indicator of potential lake nutrient limitation with n the only limitation if tn tp 10 p the only limitation if tn tp 20 and co limitation if 10 tn tp 20 mamun et al 2020 in dry season of dongping lake tn tp was 14 6 72 6 with an average of 44 1 suggesting that the growth of algae was mainly limited by p this was consistent with qin et al 2020b which indicated that compared with n loss caused by denitrification p sedimentation is more widespread and pervasive leading to p limitation predominated 94 4 in most lakes all over the world in addition downing et al 2001 found that the risk of blue green algae dominance was less than 10 when tp 0 03 mg l and increased to 40 when 0 03 tp 0 07 mg l and raised up to 80 when tp was close to 0 10 mg l in present study tp concentrations were less than 0 03 mg l for only 2 samples 0 03 0 07 mg l for 65 samples and higher than 0 10 mg l for 12 samples indicating that there may be a risk of algal blooms in dongping lake in order to evaluate the degree of eutrophication t li σ of each sample in dongping lake during the dry season was calculated based on tp tn and chla as shown in fig 5 most samples in the lake were in light eutropher state only one sample in the northern was in middle eutropher state and 6 samples located in the central lake were in mesotropher state among the samples in light eutropher state green circles shown in fig 5 t li σ of samples in the southeastern and northern lake were relatively higher forming two regions with high t li σ the average value of t li σ over the entire lake was 53 19 this was similar to the t li σ 48 71 58 50 measured in the year of 2015 hu et al 2016b and better than 2006 2010 which showed light or middle eutrophication level liu 2012 noted that dongping lake began to fill as a storing lake in the eastern route of snwdp since 2013 in order to ensure the water quality transferred northward water quality management was enhanced in upstream lakes improving the water quality into dongping lake and reducing the water eutrophication level by diluting the pollutants in the lake to further analyze the spatial heterogeneity in eutrophication level of dongping lake spatial autocorrelation analysis was carried out on t li σ of all samples results showed that the global moran s i i g of t li σ was 0 438 top right subgraph of fig 6 and it passed the significance test with a confidence level of 95 indicating that the eutrophication level of the entire lake showed significant positive spatial autocorrelation with a tendency of spatial aggregation as shown in low side subplot of fig 6 i g 0 in the range of 0 5 km indicating that the influence radius at the same eutrophication level in the dry season of dongping lake was about 5 km in which factors affecting eutrophication such as hydrodynamics hydrologic conditions and physicochemical properties of water were the same in the range of 5 12 5 km i g 0 indicating a negative spatial correlation and the average distance between regions with different eutrophication levels was 5 12 5 km with i g 0 in the range of 12 5 21 km the direct distance of different regions with the same eutrophication level in dongping lake was 12 5 21 km lisa local indicators of spatial association cluster map of t li σ was constructed to further reveal the spatial heterogeneity two hotspots high high concentration of eutrophication were present in the southeast p 0 01 and the north p 0 05 of the lake reasons for the formation of these two hotspots were different in the southeast of dongping lake the aggregation of eutrophication was mainly affected by the discharge of non point source pollutants from surrounding towns while the eutrophication aggregation in the northern lake was caused mainly by the weak hydrodynamic conditions besides the cold spots low low concentration of eutrophication in dongping lake were located in the middle of the lake p 0 05 as a part of the eastern route of snwdp water quality of dongping lake has great influence on the water security of downstream residents in this study water quality of dongping lake was compared with other lakes gaoyou lake nansi lake hongze lake and luoma lake along the eastern route of snwdp and lakes daotunwa lake mata lake and baiyun lake in the lower yellow river table 4 among the lakes along eastern route of snwdp all lakes are in the light eutropher state however the tn concentration in dongping lake was higher than others and the tp was the highest besides hongze lake for the lakes in the lower yellow river the water quality of dongping lake was better than mata lake but worse than daotunwa and baiyun lake in conclusion the water quality of dongping lake in the dry season in 2020 belonged to ⅴ or poor ⅴ evaluated by single factor method and tn was the main limiting factor according to the n p ratio of the lake the algae growth was mainly limited by p and the risk of algae bloom was more than 40 at the current tp concentration the lake was in the light eutropher state in present study a significant positive spatial autocorrelation was found in the eutrophication level of the entire lake and the hotspots high high concentration of eutrophication were mainly located in the southeast and north of the lake although the water quality of dongping lake has improved since 2013 it is still at a poor level compared with other lakes along the eastern route of snwdp and lakes in the lower reach of yellow river 3 3 analysis of the main driving factors in water eutrophication in order to explore the main driving factors of water eutrophication in dongping lake pca and correlation analysis were performed the load matrix for the major components and the correlation coefficient matrix between different water quality and environmental parameters are presented in table 5 and table 6 respectively four principal components were retrieved and the cumulative variance contribution of these four components reached 79 99 table 5 the first principal component pc1 had a variance contribution of 35 72 parameters related to pc1 were mainly tn no3 n and no2 n and they were significantly correlated table 6 therefore pc1 indicated that the primary driving factor for water eutrophication in dongping lake during the dry season was n pollution the variance contribution of the second principal component pc2 was 17 65 and the main related parameters were nh4 n and chla this component reflected the interactions of nh4 n phytoplankton and submerged plants the main parameters associated with the third pc3 and fourth pc4 principal component were ssc and tp respectively showing the influence of water turbidity and phosphorus pollutant on water eutrophication table 6 showed that there was a strong correlation between tn no3 n no2 n and nh4 n resulting in similar spatial distribution characteristics fig 3 and they were also significantly related to the water depth the water depth can reflect the variations in water level and water storage which have significant influence on the pollutants release the diffusion and degradation in lakes and then affect the nutritional status of lakes i e qin et al 2020b in deep water the diffusion and degradation of n and p are restricted resulting in the enrichment of nutrients and raising eutrophication risk this was consistent with ye et al 2002 in present study chla was negatively related to nh4 n this can be contributed to that the absorption of inorganic nitrogen by phytoplankton was preferentially nh4 n berges 1997 gao et al 2016 and chla is closely related to the phytoplankton photosynthesis according to pca and correlation analyses nitrogen pollutants are the primarily driving factor of the water quality in dongping lake during dry season and water depth is the main environmental factor affecting the spatial distribution of nitrogen pollutants 3 4 source analyses of non point source pollutants in dongping lake as stated in section 3 1 compared with the pollutant input of dawen river the non point source emissions from the surrounding areas of dongping lake are the main pollutant source in dongping lake using eq 1 4 the yearly inputs of cod tn tp and nh4 n from residential living agricultural planting and livestock production in the 8 towns around dongping lake were calculated the contribution rates from different sources for each pollutant were shown in fig 7 a livestock breeding sources contributed significantly to cod tn and tp emissions with contribution rates of 56 44 and 83 respectively rural living sources contributed the most to the emissions of nh4 n 82 their contribution to tn was also high which accounted for 43 contribution of agricultural planting sources to tn tp and nh4 n were only 13 2 and 1 respectively differences of the pollutant emission contribution existed between different towns as shown in fig 7b contributions of pollutant emission were high for towns located in the south and southeast of the lake i e zhoucheng daimiao xinhu and laohu while towns in the west and north of the lake area i e jiuxian yinshan banjiudian and shanglaozhuang had low contributions with the contribution rates to cod tn tp and nh4 n emissions 22 20 25 and 18 respectively zhoucheng contributed the largest pollutant emissions i e 85 among the 8 towns around lake the cumulative contribution rates in daimiao 80 and laohu 81 were similar jiuxian and shanglaozhuang had the lowest contributions of pollutants and the cumulative contribution rates of these two towns were only 18 recall that for most water quality parameters the concentrations decreased gradually from the southeast to northwest of the lake in present study fig 3 therefore the high emissions of pollutant from towns in the southeast of the lake area were the main cause for this spatial distribution pattern according to eqs 2 4 the main controlling factors of rural living sources agricultural planting sources and livestock breeding sources are the permanent population farming area nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizer consumption and livestock productions in 2018 the permanent population of laohu was 71 000 ranking first among the 8 towns the farming area in xinhu was 108 000 ha and consumption of the nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizers were 5 767 million and 2 287 million tons respectively which were the highest the high pollutant emission in daimiao could be attributed to the livestock production with 86 300 heads in 2018 for zhoucheng its permanent population was 63 000 rank 2 farming area were 8000 ha rank 3 and the livestock production were 76 900 heads rank 2 making its pollutant emission highest among the 8 towns around dongping lake based on the trophic status of dongping lake in the dry season and the sources of non point source pollution control on the pollutant emissions from non point source in towns surrounding the lake should be the priority for the water pollution treatment of dongping lake specific suggestions are listed as follows 1 towns around dongping lake especially the xinhu and laohu with high chemical fertilizer consumption should develop ecological agriculture and fertilize precisely as needed 2 for towns with large livestock breeding such as daimiao and zhoucheng the breeding structure should be optimized to improve the utilization efficiency of the manure 3 for laohu and zhoucheng with large population and sewage discharge diversion of rain and sewage water should be implemented to achieve the centralized and efficient treatment of domestic sewage and rainwater 4 conclusions in present study water quality of dongping lake in dry season was evaluated by various methods in the dry season the water quality of dongping lake was classified to grade v or poor v and the non point sources emissions around the lake were the main sources of pollutants the lake was in the light eutropher state and n was the main driving factor of water eutrophication based on pca according to the spatial autocorrelation analysis spatial aggregation was presented for the trophic level of dongping lake in dry season and the hotspots high high concentration of t li σ were mainly distributed in the southeast and north of the lake area source analysis showed that the pollutant emissions from towns located in the east and south of dongping lake accounted for a relatively high proportion and lower in the west and north of the lake which leading to the pollutant concentration decreasing gradually from the southeast to the northwest in dongping lake therefore controls of the non point source emissions from towns in the southeast of the lake should be enhanced in the pollution treatment of dongping lake and the government should pay attention to the chemical fertilizer reduction breeding structure optimization and improving the utilization efficiency of livestock manure although various methods were used in present study to evaluate and analyze the water quality and pollution sources of dongping lake in dry season water quality is affected by many factors besides the non point source discharge mentioned in this study water quality is also affected by the migration and transformation of pollutants in atmosphere water and sediment and other pollutants such as heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants this may lead to some bias in our analysis results therefore future studies should be conducted to explore the pollution levels of other pollutants and clarify the migration and transformation mechanism of

9282,in this study factor analysis principal component analysis pca and correlation analysis were used to analyze the water quality in dry season of dongping lake which is the only natural lake in the lower yellow river and an important hub of south north water diversion project snwdp of china the nutritional status of the lake was evaluated by trophic level index and the spatial heterogeneity and aggregation status of the eutrophication level were studied by spatial autocorrelation analysis moreover the pollution discharge coefficient method was carried out to clarify the potential pollutant sources results showed that the lake was in the light eutropher state with the water quality of v and poor v nitrogen pollutants were the primary driving factor of water quality and water depth was the main environmental factor affecting the spatial distribution of nitrogen pollutants the eutrophication level of the entire lake showed significant positive spatial autocorrelation due to the influence of regional eutrophication levels the spatial heterogeneity of eutrophication level was low two hotspots high high concentration of eutrophication were present in the southeast p 0 01 and the north p 0 05 of the lake however causes for the formation of these two hotspots were different which mainly resulted from the non point source discharge of surrounding towns along the southeastern lake and the weak hydrodynamic conditions in the northern lake respectively therefore it is necessary to pay more attention to control the non point source discharge into dongping lake especially for regions around the southeast of the lake in the future management keywords dongping lake water quality pca spatial autocorrelation source analysis data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in recent decades the deterioration of water quality and the degradation of ecological function have become the common problems that most lakes in the world are facing especially the eutrophication which poses a great threat to lake ecosystem is still a major challenge in the field of lake research e g smith 2003 dodds et al 2009 qin et al 2020a identifying the lake eutrophication level and analyzing its pollutant sources are the key to lake management and play an important role in implementing the one lake one policy strategy in china for many lakes in china the water quality is usually worse during dry season than other periods due to the shortage of water resources and weak hydrodynamics in this season e g wen et al 2020 tian et al 2021 liu et al 2022 concerning water quality variations and analyzing pollutant sources in the dry season are helpful to reveal the eutrophication levels and pollution effects of lakes in china as the second largest freshwater lake in shandong province dongping lake is the only flood detention area in the lower yellow river and an important pivot of south north water diversion project snwdp its water quality is of vital importance to the environmental protection and high quality development of the yellow river basin in recent years with the rapid economic development and population growth in dongping lake basin pollutants originated from residents living aquaculture and industries have increased significantly resulting to serious water pollution in dongping lake e g chen et al 2014 zhang et al 2016 tian et al 2013 using multivariate statistical methods liu et al 2021 explored the relationship between the diatom taxa preserved in surface sediments and environmental variables in dongping lake and results showed that the lake was eutrophicated in all seasons zhang et al 2016 found that concentrations of the total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp and chemical oxygen demand cod of surface water in dongping lake were lower than grade iii of the china surface water quality standard gb3838 2002 and obviously affected by the wastewater drainage from dawen river time series of the water environmental factors of dongping lake in recent 40 years 1980 2016 were analyzed by li et al 2018 and four stages i e the initial deterioration period 1980 1989 rapid deterioration period 1990 1999 slow improvement period 2000 2006 and post improvement period 2007 2016 could be divided hu 2017 evaluated the influence of snwdp on the water quality nutrition and health risk of dongping lake before and after water delivery of snwdp the water quality of dongping lake all suffered light pollution the nutrition level was improved from mid eutrophication to medium nutrition and the health risk level was reduced from high medium to medium risks related studies about water quality of dongping lake mainly focused on water quality monitoring and evaluation and the influence of snwdp however to our knowledge few studies analyzed the pollutant sources of dongping lake although enormous researches have been carried out to evaluate the water eutrophication the methodologies were mainly restricted to the single factor method the trophic level index t li σ method and the principal component analysis pca e g liu et al 2020 zhang et al 2006 li et al 2019a in recent years remote sensing model simulation cluster analysis discriminant analysis and other multivariate statistical methods or techniques have been widely used in water quality analysis and evaluation identification of potential pollution sources and other aspects e g duan et al 2013 2016 however the spatial dependence of eutrophication and the spatial heterogeneity between different lake areas were usually neglected spatial autocorrelation has great applicability in analyzing the time space distribution and factor dependence and is widely used in aquaculture mineral exploration transportation planning and environmental pollution e g jossart et al 2020 nguyen and vu 2019 górniak 2016 wang et al 2016 li et al 2019b zhang et al 2008 for example using spatial autocorrelation li et al 2019b investigated the regional differences in environmental regulations spatial spillover and hysteresis effects on haze pollution zhang et al 2008 used spatial autocorrelation to identify the pollution hotspots of soil pb in galway ireland which provided a theoretical reference for urban environmental management although the spatial autocorrelation method can measure the spatial dependence of observed data application of one method will lead to a certain degree of deviation combination of multiple methods can evaluate the eutrophication level of lake more comprehensively and objectively based on previous studies methods including single factor evaluation method t li σ method spatial autocorrelation combined with gis and geoda and pca were used to evaluate the water quality aiming to illustrate the distribution features of nutrient factors and the degree of water pollution and eutrophication in dongping lake during dry season besides the pollution discharge coefficient method was used to analyze the pollutant sources to provide scientific references for the control and prevention of water pollution in dongping lake 2 material and methods 2 1 description of study area dongping lake 116 00 116 30 e 35 30 36 20 n is located in dongping county shandong province it is the second largest freshwater lake in shandong province and the only natural lake in the lower yellow river dongping lake receives inflows mainly from dawen river in the southeast and discharges into the yellow river via qinghe river in the north fig 1 except floodways and water transfer of snwdp dawen river is the only runoff into the lake th total area of dongping lake is 627 km2 and can be divided into the old and the new lake areas the old lake covers an area of 209 km2 with water area of 124 km2 and average water depth of 2 4 m commonly known as dongping lake the new lake covers an area of 418 km2 as a flood detention area the new lake holds no water all year round except in special flood years chen et al 2013 2014 the area studied in this paper refers to the old lake area with perennial water storage dongping lake lies in the temperate continental monsoon climate zone with november to march the dry season and june to august the wet season the aquatic vegetations in lake area are abundant with the potamogeton crispus and water chestnut widely distributed in the north and east regions of the lake deng et al 2016 yu et al 2020 the abundant aquatic vegetations provide sufficient food and various habitats for freshwater fishes shrimps and crabs making dongping lake an important aquaculture base in shandong province in 2002 dongping lake was identified as the last storing lake in the eastern route of snwdp and the starting lake in the water transport line to eastern shandong province water transfer in dongping lake as part of the eastern route of snwdp was started in 2013 and usually occurred from december to next may since then dongping lake has played a vital role in ensuring water security in northern china and eastern shandong 2 2 sample collection and measurements considering the impact of water transfer of the eastern route of snwdp samples were collected at the end of november 2020 to investigate the water quality of dongping lake in the dry season a total of 59 sampling sites were set over the entire lake fig 1 but in fact 52 samples were collected due to the influence of weather in the field for each sampling site water was sampled from the upper middle and lower layers of water column with a 5 l water collector to reduce the influence of vertical differences of water quality over the entire water column water samples from these three layers were mixed evenly and about 500 ml water samples were taken and sent to laboratory for water quality measurements the main factors analyzed in this study were total nitrogen tn nitrate nitrogen no3 n nitrite nitrogen no2 n ammonia nitrogen nh4 n total phosphorus tp phosphate po4 p chlorophyll chla and suspended sediment concentration ssc the samples were pretreated and measured according to the national standard methods tn and tp were determined by persulfate oxidation method hj636 2012 using uv spectrophotometer nh4 n was determined by nessler s reagent colorimetry method hj535 2009 no3 n was determined by uv spectrophotometry hj636 2012 and no2 n was determined by diazo coupling spectrophotometry chla was determined using a spectrophotometer after extraction in hot ethanol extraction po4 p was determined by molybdenum blue method and ssc was determined by filter weighing method 2 3 data analysis in present study water quality of dongping lake during dry season were evaluated by some traditional methods i e the single factor evaluation t li σ and pca besides spatial autocorrelation was used to analyzed the spatial heterogeneity of the eutrophication level of dongping lake and the pollution discharge coefficient method was applied to estimate the non point source pollution emissions from regions around dongping lake the research flow was shown in fig 2 2 3 1 single factor evaluation t li σ and pca single factor evaluation is a method to determine the water quality level by comparing the value of a certain water quality factor with the evaluation standard zhao et al 2021 in present study surface water quality standard gb3838 2002 issued by state environmental protection administration of china was selected to classify and evaluate the water quality based on the concentrations of tn tp and nh4 n based on gb3838 2002 the water quality can be classified into five grades with their evaluation standards and water body functions shown in table 1 t li σ can be expressed as the weighted sum of the tropic level index t li i with i representing the i th factor of water quality factors with t li i calculated from the concentration of the i th factor by a certain formula liu et al 2020 concentrations of chla tn and tp were used in present study and five grades can be categorized i e oligotropher t li σ 30 mesotropher 30 t li σ 50 light eutropher 50 t li σ 60 middle eutropher 60 t li σ 70 hyper eutropher t li σ 70 pca is used to select fewer comprehensive factors to replace the original variable factors and analyze the main factors affecting water quality it is a dimensionality reduction technique that helps to simplify the data and make it easier to visualize by finding a set of principal components duan et al 2016 in our study spss software was used to conduct pca on the measured data and the principal components were selected when the cumulative contribution rate was approximate to 80 2 3 2 spatial autocorrelation analysis spatial autocorrelation including global autocorrelation and local autocorrelation analyzes the correlation of an attribute value between adjacent regions qin et al 2019 global autocorrelation reflects the spatial agglomeration or dispersion degrees of the attribute value with the measurement index of global moran s i i g getis and ord 1992 the value of i g ranges from 1 1 generally a higher positive i g indicates a tendency towards aggregation while a lower negative i g indicates a tendency towards dispersion local autocorrelation can further determine the specific locations of the agglomeration or isolated area by local moran s i i l ord and getis 1995 when i l 0 the local spatial unit is positively correlated with its adjacent units showing high high or low low aggregation in contrast negative correlation exists between adjacent spatial units with i l 0 manifested as high low or low high distribution spatial autocorrelation analysis for the t li σ was conducted using geoda software in present study first i g was calculated and significance test was carried out with 95 confidence interval second i l was calculated and regional visualization was conducted by building lisa local indicators of spatial association maps to reveal different spatial distribution types 2 3 3 pollution discharge coefficient analysis the pollution discharge coefficient method can be used to estimate the emission of non point source pollutants in the absence of measured data with the aquaculture net cage withdrawn from dongping lake since 2018 feeding is strictly prohibited in the lake meanwhile the surrounding areas of dongping lake are mainly rural regions so that the non point source pollution in dongping lake are mainly from the agricultural farming and the residential living in present study pollutant emissions from agricultural sources including planting and livestock breeding and residential living sources were estimated in 8 towns around dongping lake i e zhoucheng daimiao xinhu laohu jiuxian shanglaozhuang yinshan and banjiudian with their locations shown in fig 1 according to the manual on accounting methods and coefficients of pollution production and emission in statistical investigation of emission sources issued by the ministry of ecology and environment of china equations of the theoretical emission of tn tp nh4 n and cod from agricultural and living sources are presented in table 2 with the calculation coefficients shown in table 3 the quantities of pollutant discharged into lake can then be expressed as the sum of emissions q from various pollution sources multiplied by the inflow coefficient λ taking tn as an example the quantity g discharged into lake can be expressed as 1 g j 1 n q j λ j in which q i and λ i represent the emission load and inflow coefficient from the j th pollution source respectively the inflow coefficients applied in yang et al 2020 were adopted in present study and shown in table 3 in addition the basic data of the population area consumption of chemical fertilizer livestock breeding in dongping county and towns surrounding dongping lake were taken from the dongping yearbook 2018 3 results and discussion 3 1 spatial distribution characteristics of water quality factors in order to illustrate the spatial distribution characteristics of water quality factors in dongping lake during the dry season spatial distributions of tn no3 n nh4 n tp and chla were analyzed using kriging interpolation method in arcgis as shown in fig 3 the average concentrations of tn no3 n nh4 n tp and chla were 2 51 mg l 1 60 mg l 0 53 mg l 0 06 mg l and 6 87 mg m3 respectively except for chla similar distributions were present between parameters mentioned above that is the concentrations gradually decreased from southeast to northwest of the lake the highest tn concentration measured in present study appeared in the southeast of the lake corresponding to the area around towns of laohu zhoucheng and xinhu and gradually decreased to the western and northern fig 3a no3 n accounted for the highest proportion 40 75 in tn concentration and its spatial distribution was similar to tn fig 3b nh4 n concentration was higher in the south of lake and lower in the northern fig 3c meanwhile tp concentration gradually decreased from south to north and increased slightly in a special part of the northern fig 3d it should be noted that the concentration of chla was lowest in the western and gradually increased towards the eastern and northern reaching the maximum at the northern outlet of the lake fig 3e in fact the chla distribution is not only affected by nutrient content but also largely depends on hydrodynamic conditions wu et al 2015 as the northern of dongping lake is very narrow fig 1 the disturbances of wind on water body are weak leading to the enrichment of chla and the presence of maximum in the north of dongping lake the spatial distribution characteristics of water quality factors with high concentrations present in the southeast were consistent with many other studies and it was usually attributed to the nutrient input of dawen river e g zhang et al 2016 as the only runoff into lake in the non impoundment period of snwdp dawen river flows into dongping lake from the southeast resulting in the domestic sewage industrial and agricultural waste water from the towns along the river eventually discharging into the lake however recent studies revealed that the non point source pollution in the surrounding area of the dawen river had been controlled effectively with the development of governance projects such as river dredging storage engineering and constructed wetland etc and the water quality had been significantly improved to grade ⅲ in recent years i e tn 1 0 mg l tp 0 05 mg l e g shen et al 2021 guo and zhang 2018 therefore compared with the input of dawen river the non point source discharge from areas around dongping lake made more contributions to the spatial distributions of nutrient in the lake which will be discussed in detail in section 3 4 3 2 evaluation and analysis of water quality and eutrophication level three water quality indicators i e tn tp and nh4 n were chosen to evaluate the water quality of dongping lake in dry season by single factor method taking tn as the evaluation indicator the water quality of all sampling sites was classified to grades ⅴ and poor ⅴ and the samples with poor ⅴ accounted for 82 7 fig 4a while taking tp as the evaluation indicator all the samples showed ⅲ and ⅳ water quality fig 4b among which samples located in the southern part of lake were in relatively poor water quality the evaluation results were better when take nh4 n as indicator and water quality of most samples were ⅱ 42 3 and ⅲ 57 7 fig 4c according to the requirements of the single factor method the comprehensive water quality is determined by the factor which reflects the worst water quality therefore the water quality in dongping lake during the dry season were ⅴ and poor ⅴ and predominant in poor ⅴ indicating that the water is only applicable to agricultural water areas and general landscape requirements table 1 tn was the main limiting factor of the water quality the ratio of tn to tp by mass was used as an indicator of potential lake nutrient limitation with n the only limitation if tn tp 10 p the only limitation if tn tp 20 and co limitation if 10 tn tp 20 mamun et al 2020 in dry season of dongping lake tn tp was 14 6 72 6 with an average of 44 1 suggesting that the growth of algae was mainly limited by p this was consistent with qin et al 2020b which indicated that compared with n loss caused by denitrification p sedimentation is more widespread and pervasive leading to p limitation predominated 94 4 in most lakes all over the world in addition downing et al 2001 found that the risk of blue green algae dominance was less than 10 when tp 0 03 mg l and increased to 40 when 0 03 tp 0 07 mg l and raised up to 80 when tp was close to 0 10 mg l in present study tp concentrations were less than 0 03 mg l for only 2 samples 0 03 0 07 mg l for 65 samples and higher than 0 10 mg l for 12 samples indicating that there may be a risk of algal blooms in dongping lake in order to evaluate the degree of eutrophication t li σ of each sample in dongping lake during the dry season was calculated based on tp tn and chla as shown in fig 5 most samples in the lake were in light eutropher state only one sample in the northern was in middle eutropher state and 6 samples located in the central lake were in mesotropher state among the samples in light eutropher state green circles shown in fig 5 t li σ of samples in the southeastern and northern lake were relatively higher forming two regions with high t li σ the average value of t li σ over the entire lake was 53 19 this was similar to the t li σ 48 71 58 50 measured in the year of 2015 hu et al 2016b and better than 2006 2010 which showed light or middle eutrophication level liu 2012 noted that dongping lake began to fill as a storing lake in the eastern route of snwdp since 2013 in order to ensure the water quality transferred northward water quality management was enhanced in upstream lakes improving the water quality into dongping lake and reducing the water eutrophication level by diluting the pollutants in the lake to further analyze the spatial heterogeneity in eutrophication level of dongping lake spatial autocorrelation analysis was carried out on t li σ of all samples results showed that the global moran s i i g of t li σ was 0 438 top right subgraph of fig 6 and it passed the significance test with a confidence level of 95 indicating that the eutrophication level of the entire lake showed significant positive spatial autocorrelation with a tendency of spatial aggregation as shown in low side subplot of fig 6 i g 0 in the range of 0 5 km indicating that the influence radius at the same eutrophication level in the dry season of dongping lake was about 5 km in which factors affecting eutrophication such as hydrodynamics hydrologic conditions and physicochemical properties of water were the same in the range of 5 12 5 km i g 0 indicating a negative spatial correlation and the average distance between regions with different eutrophication levels was 5 12 5 km with i g 0 in the range of 12 5 21 km the direct distance of different regions with the same eutrophication level in dongping lake was 12 5 21 km lisa local indicators of spatial association cluster map of t li σ was constructed to further reveal the spatial heterogeneity two hotspots high high concentration of eutrophication were present in the southeast p 0 01 and the north p 0 05 of the lake reasons for the formation of these two hotspots were different in the southeast of dongping lake the aggregation of eutrophication was mainly affected by the discharge of non point source pollutants from surrounding towns while the eutrophication aggregation in the northern lake was caused mainly by the weak hydrodynamic conditions besides the cold spots low low concentration of eutrophication in dongping lake were located in the middle of the lake p 0 05 as a part of the eastern route of snwdp water quality of dongping lake has great influence on the water security of downstream residents in this study water quality of dongping lake was compared with other lakes gaoyou lake nansi lake hongze lake and luoma lake along the eastern route of snwdp and lakes daotunwa lake mata lake and baiyun lake in the lower yellow river table 4 among the lakes along eastern route of snwdp all lakes are in the light eutropher state however the tn concentration in dongping lake was higher than others and the tp was the highest besides hongze lake for the lakes in the lower yellow river the water quality of dongping lake was better than mata lake but worse than daotunwa and baiyun lake in conclusion the water quality of dongping lake in the dry season in 2020 belonged to ⅴ or poor ⅴ evaluated by single factor method and tn was the main limiting factor according to the n p ratio of the lake the algae growth was mainly limited by p and the risk of algae bloom was more than 40 at the current tp concentration the lake was in the light eutropher state in present study a significant positive spatial autocorrelation was found in the eutrophication level of the entire lake and the hotspots high high concentration of eutrophication were mainly located in the southeast and north of the lake although the water quality of dongping lake has improved since 2013 it is still at a poor level compared with other lakes along the eastern route of snwdp and lakes in the lower reach of yellow river 3 3 analysis of the main driving factors in water eutrophication in order to explore the main driving factors of water eutrophication in dongping lake pca and correlation analysis were performed the load matrix for the major components and the correlation coefficient matrix between different water quality and environmental parameters are presented in table 5 and table 6 respectively four principal components were retrieved and the cumulative variance contribution of these four components reached 79 99 table 5 the first principal component pc1 had a variance contribution of 35 72 parameters related to pc1 were mainly tn no3 n and no2 n and they were significantly correlated table 6 therefore pc1 indicated that the primary driving factor for water eutrophication in dongping lake during the dry season was n pollution the variance contribution of the second principal component pc2 was 17 65 and the main related parameters were nh4 n and chla this component reflected the interactions of nh4 n phytoplankton and submerged plants the main parameters associated with the third pc3 and fourth pc4 principal component were ssc and tp respectively showing the influence of water turbidity and phosphorus pollutant on water eutrophication table 6 showed that there was a strong correlation between tn no3 n no2 n and nh4 n resulting in similar spatial distribution characteristics fig 3 and they were also significantly related to the water depth the water depth can reflect the variations in water level and water storage which have significant influence on the pollutants release the diffusion and degradation in lakes and then affect the nutritional status of lakes i e qin et al 2020b in deep water the diffusion and degradation of n and p are restricted resulting in the enrichment of nutrients and raising eutrophication risk this was consistent with ye et al 2002 in present study chla was negatively related to nh4 n this can be contributed to that the absorption of inorganic nitrogen by phytoplankton was preferentially nh4 n berges 1997 gao et al 2016 and chla is closely related to the phytoplankton photosynthesis according to pca and correlation analyses nitrogen pollutants are the primarily driving factor of the water quality in dongping lake during dry season and water depth is the main environmental factor affecting the spatial distribution of nitrogen pollutants 3 4 source analyses of non point source pollutants in dongping lake as stated in section 3 1 compared with the pollutant input of dawen river the non point source emissions from the surrounding areas of dongping lake are the main pollutant source in dongping lake using eq 1 4 the yearly inputs of cod tn tp and nh4 n from residential living agricultural planting and livestock production in the 8 towns around dongping lake were calculated the contribution rates from different sources for each pollutant were shown in fig 7 a livestock breeding sources contributed significantly to cod tn and tp emissions with contribution rates of 56 44 and 83 respectively rural living sources contributed the most to the emissions of nh4 n 82 their contribution to tn was also high which accounted for 43 contribution of agricultural planting sources to tn tp and nh4 n were only 13 2 and 1 respectively differences of the pollutant emission contribution existed between different towns as shown in fig 7b contributions of pollutant emission were high for towns located in the south and southeast of the lake i e zhoucheng daimiao xinhu and laohu while towns in the west and north of the lake area i e jiuxian yinshan banjiudian and shanglaozhuang had low contributions with the contribution rates to cod tn tp and nh4 n emissions 22 20 25 and 18 respectively zhoucheng contributed the largest pollutant emissions i e 85 among the 8 towns around lake the cumulative contribution rates in daimiao 80 and laohu 81 were similar jiuxian and shanglaozhuang had the lowest contributions of pollutants and the cumulative contribution rates of these two towns were only 18 recall that for most water quality parameters the concentrations decreased gradually from the southeast to northwest of the lake in present study fig 3 therefore the high emissions of pollutant from towns in the southeast of the lake area were the main cause for this spatial distribution pattern according to eqs 2 4 the main controlling factors of rural living sources agricultural planting sources and livestock breeding sources are the permanent population farming area nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizer consumption and livestock productions in 2018 the permanent population of laohu was 71 000 ranking first among the 8 towns the farming area in xinhu was 108 000 ha and consumption of the nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizers were 5 767 million and 2 287 million tons respectively which were the highest the high pollutant emission in daimiao could be attributed to the livestock production with 86 300 heads in 2018 for zhoucheng its permanent population was 63 000 rank 2 farming area were 8000 ha rank 3 and the livestock production were 76 900 heads rank 2 making its pollutant emission highest among the 8 towns around dongping lake based on the trophic status of dongping lake in the dry season and the sources of non point source pollution control on the pollutant emissions from non point source in towns surrounding the lake should be the priority for the water pollution treatment of dongping lake specific suggestions are listed as follows 1 towns around dongping lake especially the xinhu and laohu with high chemical fertilizer consumption should develop ecological agriculture and fertilize precisely as needed 2 for towns with large livestock breeding such as daimiao and zhoucheng the breeding structure should be optimized to improve the utilization efficiency of the manure 3 for laohu and zhoucheng with large population and sewage discharge diversion of rain and sewage water should be implemented to achieve the centralized and efficient treatment of domestic sewage and rainwater 4 conclusions in present study water quality of dongping lake in dry season was evaluated by various methods in the dry season the water quality of dongping lake was classified to grade v or poor v and the non point sources emissions around the lake were the main sources of pollutants the lake was in the light eutropher state and n was the main driving factor of water eutrophication based on pca according to the spatial autocorrelation analysis spatial aggregation was presented for the trophic level of dongping lake in dry season and the hotspots high high concentration of t li σ were mainly distributed in the southeast and north of the lake area source analysis showed that the pollutant emissions from towns located in the east and south of dongping lake accounted for a relatively high proportion and lower in the west and north of the lake which leading to the pollutant concentration decreasing gradually from the southeast to the northwest in dongping lake therefore controls of the non point source emissions from towns in the southeast of the lake should be enhanced in the pollution treatment of dongping lake and the government should pay attention to the chemical fertilizer reduction breeding structure optimization and improving the utilization efficiency of livestock manure although various methods were used in present study to evaluate and analyze the water quality and pollution sources of dongping lake in dry season water quality is affected by many factors besides the non point source discharge mentioned in this study water quality is also affected by the migration and transformation of pollutants in atmosphere water and sediment and other pollutants such as heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants this may lead to some bias in our analysis results therefore future studies should be conducted to explore the pollution levels of other pollutants and clarify the migration and transformation mechanism of pollutants in dongping lake declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence

9283,the accurate estimation of reference evapotranspiration eto is a fundamental requirement for precision irrigation and regional water resource planning in this regard the application of the standard model fao 56 penman monteith is limited because of insufficient meteorological data this study aims to improve the accuracy of eto calculations in regions with scarce meteorological data a hybrid model integrating two data preprocessing methods variational mode decomposition vmd and box cox transformation bc into a support vector machine svm model vmd bc svm is proposed the model estimates the daily eto based on the meteorological data 1980 2019 of 10 stations in the wei river basin of china the vmd method was employed to extract multiple intrinsic mode functions imfs and eliminate non stationarity this is achieved by decomposing meteorological factors which are further transformed by bc to alleviate skewness characteristics the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression lasso identifies the key driving modes from the transformed imfs which are used as the input of the svm model the vmd bc svm estimation model framework based on decomposition transformation identification estimation is proposed the performance of each of the hybrid vmd bc svm models was further compared with those of the standalone extreme learning machine elm model and two empirical models hargreaves samani and priestley taylor models the results revealed that the hybrid models outperformed the single models the vmd bc svm model achieved higher accuracy compared with the other models specifically the coefficient of correlation r and nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse were both greater than 0 96 furthermore the mean absolute percentage error mape and root mean square error rmse were less than 8 41 and 0 38 mm d respectively in terms of the amount of information provided the vmd bc svm model is superior to empirical models in identifying high dimensional and nonlinear information moreover the estimation performance is more stable and the level of uncertainty is lower this study provides a novel approach for predicting eto in regions with limited meteorological data keywords variational mode decomposition box cox transformation support vector machine least absolute shrinkage and selection operator wei river basin data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction reference evapotranspiration eto is an essential variable for estimating crop water requirements and plays a key role in water resource management in irrigated areas paredes et al 2018 valle júnior et al 2020 fan et al 2021 the estimation methods for eto include empirical formulae and measurement methods which require personnel and equipment and have limitations and high costs gomariz castillo et al 2017 shirmohammadi aliakbarkhani and saberali 2020 accordingly the use of the empirical formula has become the main technique for estimating eto the united nations food and agriculture organization fao has endorsed the fao 56 penman monteith fao 56p m model as the standard method for estimating eto allen et al 1998 that comprehensively considers the driving effect of various meteorological variables however the application of the fao 56p m model is limited by its high dependency on meteorological factors therefore simplifying the eto estimation is necessary using techniques such as the hargreaves samani h s hargreaves et al 1985 priestly taylor p t priestley et al 1972 makkink chen et al 2018 and 48 penman models qualls and crago 2020 however the lack of meteorological data results in low model estimation accuracy and inadequate universality consequently researchers have explored non linear approaches to improve the estimation accuracy machine learning models have been broadly applied to eto modeling ferreira and da cunha 2020 in data scarce regions these models include neural networks abdullah et al 2015 feng et al 2016 antonopoulos and antonopoulos 2017 support vector machines svms kundu et al 2016 ehteram et al 2019 chia et al 2020 mohammadi and mehdizadeh 2020 and tree based assembly models fan et al 2018 huang et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 wu et al 2020 wen et al 2015 developed four input combination strategies based on temperature data they constructed an svm model to estimate eto in the absence of meteorological data in arid areas the accuracy of the model was found to be higher than those of the priestley taylor and empirical models the implementation of machine learning models in eto estimation was investigated by mohammadi and mehdizadeh 2020 they also proved that svm had excellent estimation accuracy when applied to three different climate stations in iran including arid semi arid and humid regions based on different types of meteorological combinations another study was conducted by feng et al 2017 to compare the performance of extreme learning machine elm and generalized regression neural network grnn models in estimating eto with temperature based data the elm model was found to provide slightly better estimates of eto than the grnn and hargreaves models published articles in literature report that svm and elm are widely applied to eto calculation both yielding satisfactory estimates in addition the stability of the svm structure enables it to be used as a fundamental model for developing different data processing methods researchers have developed many models for eto estimation using different meteorological factors indicating that eto mainly depends on meteorological factors however the meteorological factors affecting eto are complex highly non stationary and seasonally irregular therefore achieving satisfactory accuracy for daily eto estimation using a single model with meteorological factors as inputs is difficult if collected data are not preprocessed over the last few years hybrid models have received considerable attention because of their improved simulation ability in terms of eto estimation to reduce the complexity and non stationarity of an original time series and improve estimation accuracy many authors have introduced signal decomposition techniques feng et al 2014 gocić et al 2015 luan 2017 qasem et al 2019 these methods include empirical mode decomposition emd and wavelet transform wt which decompose meteorological data into a relatively stable sub series and enhance the correlation between eto and meteorological factors the successful modeling results of these studies confirmed the suitability of decomposition techniques for enhancing machine learning models fu et al 2021 proposed hybrid models for estimating the monthly eto coupled with discrete wt dwt ensemble emd eemd and variational mode decomposition vmd to decompose eto and extract the main variation features their proposed models ignored the non stationarity and complexity of meteorological factors the vmd based model was found to have higher estimation accuracy than the dwt and eemd fu et al 2021 the vmd technology has achieved remarkable results in multidisciplinary fields guo et al 2020 sun and zhao 2020 feng et al 2020 li et al 2021 carvalho and de assis de souza filho 2021 however the technology has not been developed for daily eto estimation by decomposing meteorological factors it is a completely non recursive signal decomposition method based on the frequency domain dragomiretskiy et al 2014 compared with emd and wt techniques vmd not only overcomes the endpoint effect and mode aliasing problems existing in emd but also reduces the model test steps improves the model accuracy and does not require choosing a basis function as wd the decomposition of meteorological factors using vmd not only solves the limitation of eto estimation in data scarce regions but also affects the use of non stationary input factors in model estimation owing to the high non stationarity and intrinsic complexity of meteorological factors combining vmd methods to establish a hybrid estimation model without adequate meteorological data is highly desirable decomposition technology can effectively improve data stability song et al 2021 however it does not consider the influence of data symmetry and variance homogeneity on simulation accuracy to resolve these problems researchers have focused on data transformation methods amin et al 2019 devised a model using data transformation methods and presented an extensive comparison to validate the impact of these methods the results demonstrated that most data transformation methods improve model performance the box cox transformation bc has been widely applied to the field of signal science cai et al 2021 wang et al 2021 hydrology frequency analysis and calculations seong 2014 however no study on eto estimation and meteorological factor transformation has ever been conducted the bc method belongs to the family of power transformation methods box and cox 1964 it not only improves data smoothness symmetry and the homogeneity of variance and retains the information of the original dataset but also enhances the correlation between meteorological factors and eto in view of its importance in hydroclimatic research the reliable estimate and modeling of eto using a series of new methods are highly preferred the improvement of model performance to estimate eto by creating hybrid models such as those integrated with a decomposition technique has been well demonstrated accordingly the present study aims to incorporate the ability to model the daily eto accurately using a hybrid data preprocessing technique combined with vmd and bc the input variables of the models can affect their estimation accuracy some researchers have proposed using meteorological factors as model inputs to estimate eto pammar et al 2017 feng et al 2017 chia et al 2020 fu et al 2021 used the decomposition series of history eto as input for machine learning meteorological elements are non stationary and complex however the foregoing studies did not consider the decomposition of meteorological factors some scholars have proposed estimating eto by considering all the modes i e intrinsic mode functions imfs of decomposed meteorological factors as model input and achieved satisfactory results gocić et al 2015 qasem et al 2019 evidently the input variable of the model is the foremost problem in eto simulation hence it is a topic worthy of in depth discussion however the driving effects of different modes of meteorological factors on eto estimation have not been explored in the aforementioned research works whether some modes of meteorological factors have a more effective driving effect on eto estimation than others remain to be further examined this must be expected to avoid the overfitting risk of models and improve the estimation ability by introducing mode identification yu et al 2022 identified the optimal feature after eliminating the redundant features using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator lasso which effectively reduces the model complexity the lasso regression a variable selection method for nonnegative disturbance excitations sethi and mittal 2021 is a popular method for high dimensional applications in machine learning as such lasso can be used to identify the key driving modes of the decomposed meteorological factors in this study the study is aims to achieve the following 1 decompose the meteorological factors into different modes imfs using vmd and thus overcome the influence of highly non stationary inputs on model estimation 2 normalize imfs by employing bc to reduce the skewness of the meteorological factors 3 identify the optimal key modes imfs of each meteorological factor as the svm input using lasso 4 develop a novel hybrid vmd bc svm model incorporating decomposition transformation identification estimation and test it using the daily meteorological factors collected from the wei river basin 5 evaluate the performance of vmd bc svm by comparing it with single and empirical models using evaluation indices and a mutual information neural estimator mine 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data this study is conducted in the wei river basin china which is the first tributary of the yellow river the basin has a trunk length of 818 km it is located between 103 5 and 110 5 e and 33 5 37 5 n covering an area of approximately 13 5 104 km2 chen et al 2021 the basin is located in the transition zone between arid and semi arid regions and has a continental monsoon climate because of topography precipitation is unevenly distributed in space precipitation decreases from the southeast to the northwest xu et al 2021 with an annual average of 500 800 mm the surface evaporation is 700 1000 mm the study was conducted in 10 meteorological stations from the national web with different geographical characteristics four stations wugong and xiji stations in the mainstream district and wuqi and xifeng stations in the jing river and beiluo river were used as representatives of each district to describe the modeling process in detail data from the other six stations were used to analyze the applicability of the models to the wei river basin the locations of the meteorological stations were identified on the map shown in fig 1 daily meteorological data were collected from the china meteorological data network http data cma cn from 1980 to 2019 data points these include the maximum minimum and mean temperatures tmax tmin and tmean respectively relative humidity rh wind speed at a height of 10 m u10 and sunshine duration ssd the datasets were measured and collected at the elevations of the meteorological stations and were representative of regional weather conditions to determine partially missing meteorological data the lagrange interpolation method was used because of its robustness and capability to flexibly adjust data order prasopchingchana 2022 the datasets were classified into two parts model training 1980 2007 and testing 2008 2019 details of the stations are summarized in table 1 2 2 data preprocessing 2 2 1 variational modal decomposition the vmd technique an adaptive and completely non recursive mode variational and signal processing method dragomiretskiy and zosso 2014 is an effective separation and frequency domain division of the intrinsic modal sequence it is effective for obtaining the decomposition sequence to finally derive the optimal solution of a variational problem in this study each meteorological series f t is adaptively decomposed into k imfs to ensure that the decomposed sequence is a mode series with limited bandwidth and central frequency the sum of the estimated bandwidths of each mode is minimum the constraint condition is that the sum of all modes is equal to that of the original sequence the corresponding constraint variational model is constructed as 1 min u k ω k k 1 k t δ t j π t u k t e j ω k t 2 2 s t k 1 k u k t f t where u k is the set of decomposed modes ω k is the set of decomposed modal center frequencies represents the convolution operator t is the partial derivative with respect to time t and δ t is the dirac function the quadratic penalty factor and lagrange multiplier are introduced to solve the foregoing problems the alternate direction multiplier iterative algorithm is used to search for the optimal solution i e the saddle point of the lagrange function the decomposition of meteorological data through the vmd model can reduce the instability and volatility of the series as well as improve the correlation between meteorological factors and eto 2 2 2 box cox transformation the bc method a generalized power transformation technique box and cox 1964 estimates parameter λ by the maximum likelihood estimation or bayesian method and then determines the data transformation form the bc method can improve data independence stationarity and homogeneity of variance without losing the original sequence information then it can transform the model into 2 y λ y a λ 1 λ λ 0 ln y a λ 0 where y λ is the new variable after transformation and a is the translated coefficient such that all components of the original variable y become positive because the maximum likelihood estimation method is simple and entails minimal calculation this study uses this method to solve λ the model input meteorological factors are transformed using bc according to the λ value reducing the correlation between the unobtainable error and eto 2 3 support vector machine the svm model finds the best separation hyperplane in feature space such that the interval among the training sample points farthest from the plane is the largest after the kernel method is introduced svm can deal with nonlinear problems essam et al 2022 the model is based on the principle of minimizing structural risk and has satisfactory generalization ability let the training dataset be x i y i i 1 n r n r where x i and y i indicate the i th input and output vectors respectively the svm optimization can be expressed as 3 min q ω ξ 1 2 ω 2 c i 1 n ξ i ξ i 4 s t y i f x ε ξ i f x y i ε ξ i ξ i ξ i 0 where c is the penalty factor ξ i and ξ i are the slack variables and ε is the insensitive loss coefficient the lagrange function was introduced to transform the optimization problem into a duality problem and then solve it an svm nonlinear mapping model was also obtained the function is 5 f x i 1 n α i α i k x x i b where α i is the lagrange multiplier k x x i is the kernel function and b is the bias coefficient the radial basis kernel function rbf and the linear polynomial and sigmoid kernel functions are the four types of kernel functions commonly used the linear kernel function is a special case of rbf the polynomial and sigmoid kernel functions involve more parameters the latter approximates the rbf under some parameters in summary the rbf is selected as the kernel function of the svm in this study 2 4 proposed vmd bc svm hybrid model this paper proposes a novel hybrid vmd bc svm model based on a decomposition transformation identification estimation framework to estimate the daily eto the flowchart is presented in fig 2 the vmd bc svm model is developed as follows meteorological factors are decomposed into multiple modes imfs employing vmd all modes imfs are normalized using bc the key driving modes imfs that are highly correlated with eto are identified using lasso regression the proposed vmd bc svm estimation model is developed with the identified key driving modes imfs as the svm model input 2 5 empirical models for estimating eto in this study the eto calculated from the fao 56p m model was used as the standard value and the h s hargreaves and samani 1985 and p t priestley et al 1972 empirical models are used for comparison the specific calculation formulae are listed in table 2 in table 2 eto p m eto h s and eto p t

hargreaves and samani 1985 for comparison with the h s and p t models the selected input combinations of meteorological factors are listed in table 3 the study yielded two input combinations for daily eto modeling at all stations the combination of tmax and tmin and that of tmax tmin ssd and rh 2 6 model performance evaluation 2 6 1 mutual information neural estimator the mine is optimized by a neural network ozdenizci and erdogmus 2021 zbili and rama 2021 and can process random variables with arbitrary distributions in any dimension mutual information mi reveals the influence of internal implicit information such as variables and simulation results on model performance however mi has no clear upper limit the closer the mi between the estimated and standard values to the information entropy of the standard value the better the model estimation effect the following expresses mi 6 i x y d k l p q sup t ω r e p t log e q e t where p is the joint distribution p x y of x and y q is the product of the edge distribution p x p y of x and y and function t is fitted by a neural network the foregoing equation is regarded as a loss function and the loss value reaches the maximum through gradient rise until convergence the maximum value is the estimator of mi 2 6 2 evaluation indices previous studies have evaluated the estimation accuracy of the model from the perspective of error through evaluation indices and rarely discussed model performance in terms of information therefore the accuracy and performance of the models investigated for daily eto estimations were evaluated using the following the mi technology eq 6 and four commonly used evaluation metrics are combined mean absolute percentage error mape nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse coefficient of correlation r and root mean square error rmse the mape and rmse metrics were used to assess the actual situation of the estimated value error ranging 0 small mape and rmse values indicate improved model performance guo et al 2021 chen et al 2022 models with mape and rmse values that are less than 30 and 0 7 respectively are excellent the r and nse metrics are generally used to evaluate the stability and model fitting effect the closer their values are to 1 and when they exceed 0 6 the better the model fitting effect these metrics can be expressed as 7 m a p e 100 n i 1 n e t i s e t i e

i 1 n e t i s e t i e 2 where e t i s and e t i e are the ith standard and estimated values of eto respectively e t s m e a n and e t e m e a n are the averages of y i and y i respectively and n is the number of samples 3 results 3 1 meteorological factor decomposition based on vmd the vmd method was used to decompose meteorological factors into a series of modes imfs with different frequencies the number of decomposition layers is known to be crucial to the accuracy of the model wen et al 2019 in this study the decomposition layer k was set to have 3 7 layers in advance to determine the specific number of decomposition layers according to the fitting degree of the training period the vmd bc svm model selected six layers that outperformed the other layers at the wugong station therefore tmax tmin ssd and rh were decomposed into six layers the results are shown in fig 3 the other stations adopted the same method to select the number of layers table 5 the results showed that the effect was significant although the workload was more complicated 3 2 parameters of bc and key driving modes each decomposed mode is normalized by bc the values of the transformation parameter λ which determines the function type that the bc employs are listed in table 4 to demonstrate the effect of bc normalization was adopted as the data processing method for comparison the lasso regression compresses the variable coefficients by constructing penalty functions such that some coefficients with small absolute values can be directly set to zero these variables are deleted to achieve dimensionality reduction and parameter selection concurrently sethi and mittal 2021 the importance of each mode i e imf and eto at the four stations using the vmd bc svm models is compared using heat maps the regression coefficients that determine the importance of imfs based on the input of the two and four factors are shown in figs 4 and 5 respectively the exact values of the regression coefficients can be found in the excel spreadsheet provided as supplementary data the key driving factors with a high regression coefficient as model inputs are beneficial for improving the model efficiency the numbers of key driving modes and decomposition layers using different input combinations are summarized in table 5 the regression coefficient based on the input of the two factors is shown in fig 4 the figure shows that the maximum and minimum temperatures are decomposed into five layers at each station the number of selected modes is summarized in table 5 all the modes were selected as inputs for xifeng station the lowest value of the regression coefficient among the 10 modes was imf3tmin 0 086 which can be viewed in the supplementary data the lowest values in the selected modes of wuqi wugong and xiji stations are 0 085 imf4tmin 0 085 imf2tmin and 0 097 imf5tmin respectively this indicates that the selection of a mode with regression coefficients exceeding 0 08 as the model input is more advantageous similarly the lowest regression coefficients in the selected modes at wuqi wugong xiji and xifeng stations were 0 022 imf3rh 0 035 imf5rh 0 045 imf4rh and 0 022 imf4rh respectively as observed in fig 5 this indicates that imfs with a value exceeding 0 02 can be used as a model input based on the four factor model 3 3 estimated results of single model the rbf was used for the svm model ε was 0 01 and the penalty factor c and kernel function parameter g were 1 and 2 respectively the activation function and number of hidden nodes of the elm model for a training dataset were the sine function and 40 respectively the simulation accuracies of the two factor and four factor single models are listed in tables 6 and 7 respectively based on the results of the four stations the mape ranges of the svm 2 and elm 2 models were 20 97 wugong 23 77 wuqi and 21 24 wugong 25 18 wuqi respectively the r nse and rmse metrics indicate similar performance levels the optimal mape for the svm 4 model was 12 51 wuqi the results show that the simulation accuracy of the svm is better than that of the elm the svm model adopts the principle of structural risk minimization it obtains a unique solution that compensates for the disadvantages of elm which has a low learning rate and easily falls into the local minimum 3 4 estimated results of hybrid models to formulate hybrid models meteorological factors were obtained by implementing vmd bc transformation and vmd bc pre processing the results based on two factor and four factor inputs are summarized in tables 6 and 7 respectively and the errors are given in the bubble chart shown in fig 6 tables 6 and 7 indicate that vmd bc and vmd bc can improve the estimation accuracy of the machine learning models the performance of bc based models was better than that of vmd based models the mape and rmse ranges of the vmd bc svm 2 model was 11 03 wugong 13 6 wuqi and 0 62 xiji 0 74 wuqi respectively the r and nse of the vmd bc svm 2 model was more than 0 96 and 0 92 respectively in the four sites among the models for the four stations the model trained at the wuqi station had the worst performance the vmd bc elm 2 model had an acceptable estimation the wugong station had the highest accuracy mape 12 03 r 0 97 nse 0 94 and rmse 0 61 mm d the vmd bc based models are the best among all the models the data processing technology based on the fusion of vmd and bc can effectively improve the nonlinear mapping relationship between meteorological factors and eto moreover it has better performance and is suitable for the wei river basin table 6 indicates that the four factor machine learning models have a higher estimation accuracy than the other models the absence of ssd and rh lead to the absence of key parts of the mapping relationship hence the contribution of ssd and rh to the estimation accuracy of the models is positive the results of the single and vmd based models do not considerably differ for example the mape of the svm 4 and vmd svm 4 models at wuqi station were 12 51 and 13 00 respectively this positive effect deteriorates when vmd is used indicating that the decomposition of meteorological factors may be unstable the mape of the bc based model reaches 9 52 wuqi station indicating that the use of bc transformation to obtain meteorological factors is effective for model estimation therefore a combination of vmd and bc was considered to estimate the eto during the test in wuqi station the evaluation indices of the mape r nse and rmse of the vmd bc svm 4 and vmd bc elm 4 models reached 8 41 10 24 0 984 0 97 and 0 38 0 48 mm d respectively these were slightly worse than the indices of the other three stations similarly for the four factor input the model tested at wugong station exhibited the best performance among the four stations the simulation accuracy of the vmd bc svm model was higher than that of the other models in summary the ranks of the studied models in terms of estimation accuracy were vmd bc svm vmd bc elm bc svm bc elm vmd svm and vmd elm to evaluate the performance of the single and hybrid models mape and rmse were presented using bubble charts a comparison of the eight machine learning models is shown in fig 6 among all the models vmd bc svm and vmd bc elm showed satisfactory performance during training and testing the bubble charts clearly illustrate that the vmd bc svm 4 model had the smallest error mape ranged from 7 to 9 and rmse was less than 0 44 mm d the foregoing indicates that the hybrid models based on vmd bc have superior estimates compared with the other machine learning models 3 5 comparative analysis with empirical model the performance indicators of machine learning and empirical models based on two factor and four factor inputs for estimating the daily eto at the four meteorological stations are summarized in tables 6 and 7 respectively the results show that the vmd bc svm and vmd bc elm models generally outperform the h s and p t models at all meteorological stations the computing performance of the hybrid vmd bc svm 2 model was better than that of the h s model because mape decreased from 30 81 to 11 03 during the testing stage at wugong station table 6 indicates that the computing performance of the hybrid vmd bc svm 4 model is better than that of the p t model mape decreased from 18 15 to 7 24 at the wugong station therefore the vmd bc svm and vmd bc elm models can replace the h s and p t empirical models under the same meteorological input conditions respectively moreover the vmd bc svm model performs better than the vmd bc elm model 3 6 model performance analysis based on mutual information neural estimator the performance of the vmd bc svm and empirical models is evaluated in terms of information the mi between simulated results and standard values as well as the high dimensional mi between multiple meteorological factors and eto using the mine are shown in fig 7 and summarized in table 8 the figure and table similarly indicate that the performance of the vmd bc svm model is better than that of the h s and p t models moreover the mi x ystd of the four meteorological factors and eto is approximately 1 67 xifeng 1 83 xiji and the mi of the two meteorological factors is 1 18 xifeng 1 32 wuqi the foregoing indicates that multiple meteorological factors can provide more information for eto estimation the performance of the four factor vmd bc svm and p t models in terms of mi ysim ystd is the best at all the stations 1 61 2 83 followed by the vmd bc svm 2 and h s models 1 40 2 13 this indicates that a considerable amount of input data improves the accuracy of model simulation this is consistent with the previous conclusion in addition the amount of information provided by the vmd bc svm model exceeds that provided by the empirical formulae using the same input factors the mi values of the vmd bc svm 4 model are 2 60 2 74 2 83 and 2 71 at wuqi wugong xiji and xifeng stations respectively these values are the closest to the information entropy of standard eto 2 87 2 75 2 96 and 2 97 respectively this indicates that the vmd bc svm models can identify the information provided by meteorological factors moreover the models have a strong ability to deal with high dimensional and nonlinear information the foregoing further shows that the structure and performance of machine learning models are superior to those of the h s and p t empirical models this observation is consistent with the model performance resulting from the use of evaluation indices the vmd bc svm models are confirmed to have stable estimation performance 3 7 spatial distribution of evaluation indices of models to illustrate the universality of the proposed models the spatial distribution of the evaluation indices at 10 meteorological stations for the two factor and four factor models are shown in figs 8 and 9 respectively the specific evaluation indices for the other six stations are listed in tables 9 and 10 respectively in fig 8 the vmd bc svm 2 model is shown to be superior to the other machine learning models and the h s empirical model at all stations in fig 9 the hybrid vmd bc svm 4 model exhibits a higher estimation accuracy than the p t empirical model by comparing figs 8 and 9 the four factor machine learning models are found to outperform the two factor models this indicates that the eto in the wei river basin is significantly affected by meteorological factors specifically temperature ssd and rh table 9 indicates that the estimation results of the vmd bc svm 2 model at huanxian changwu baoji and tianshui stations are better than those of the other two stations the mape and rmse values are less than 12 and 0 7 mm d respectively the results listed in table 10 indicate that high r and nse values exceeding 0 99 and 0 97 respectively were obtained the mape and rmse values were less than 8 and 0 4 respectively in terms of spatial distribution the vmd bc svm models were significantly better than the other models in the wei river basin this indicates that the vmd bc data processing technology proposed in this paper can effectively improve the simulation performance of the svm model overall the vmd bc svm models perform better than the h s and p t empirical models and can be used to estimate the eto in the wei river basin even when meteorological data are scarce 4 discussion in recent decades machine learning and empirical models have been proposed to improve the accuracy and effectiveness of eto estimation niu and feng 2021 kisi et al 2019 estimated the monthly potential eto in the sistan and baluchistan provinces they found that the svm model generated more accurate estimates than the adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system model anfis and gene expression programming gep method tejada et al 2022 also revealed that the svm and elm models showed similar modeling performance and their accuracy was superior to that of the empirical models given the same input requirements in this study the svm and elm generally exhibited similar performance in estimating the daily eto for the two factor and four factors models however the performance of the svm model is slightly better than that of the elm model the svm model has a lower mape for all input combinations than the elm model the results of elm optimization can be easily trapped in the local minimum owing to the random determination of hidden bias and input weights the svm can handle extremely complex problems by mapping inputs into feature spaces through kernel function transformation furthermore svm learning can be expressed as a convex optimization problem it solves the problem wherein the global minimum value cannot be obtained by elm for highly complex meteorological data in some cases single machine learning models cannot provide satisfactory estimation accuracy to resolve this many researchers have proposed hybrid models that introduce data preprocessing techniques to machine learning models data decomposition has been widely used to develop estimation models pammar et al 2017 attempted to explore hybrid modeling using dwt and support vector machine regression svr for evaporation estimation they proved that hybrid dwt svr models are superior to conventional svr models rezaie balf et al 2019 proposed a hybrid model combining eemd and svm to predict monthly evaporation the overall results showed that the eemd has satisfactory application prospects in complex time series prediction the vmd is a more robust and adaptive data preprocessing method than wt and emd thus vmd is used to extract effective features from meteorological series a novel hybrid approach for daily eto estimation using vmd to decompose the original meteorological factors into multiple modes i e imfs is proposed in this study the daily eto estimation accuracy of vmd based model 2 was slightly higher than those of the empirical models this shows that the decomposed modes are more stable and less volatile than the original series therefore the vmd based model is more accurate than the single machine learning model the vmd method improves the ability of the model by reducing the non stationarity of highly complex and strongly nonlinear meteorological data however the performance of vmd based model 4 was worse than that of the single model this indicates that the skewness of the data may have a negative influence on the model although the vmd model decomposes the four meteorological factors into a relatively stable mode the application of data transformation methods to meteorological data can potentially mitigate these problems zhang et al 2017 investigated whether applying different transformations i e bc affects the prediction the study results show that bc leads to performance improvement in prediction models the bc methods have been widely used in various research fields amin et al 2019 wang et al 2021 however the impact of bc methods on model performance has not been comprehensively explored in the field of evapotranspiration this study proves that bc based models are not only superior to the single model but also considerably better than the vmd based models as indicated by our investigation results the bc method can improve the prediction performance it is a power transformation method that reduces the correlation between the unobservable errors in meteorological data and eto to a certain extent the symmetry and variance of data and the strengthening of the correlation between meteorological factors and eto are significantly improved by the bc method consequently the accuracy of model simulation is significantly enhanced the advantages of vmd based and bc based models are demonstrated in this study a novel hybrid data processing technique vmd bc was used to model the svm model for the first time the vmd method decomposes the meteorological factors into more stable modes imfs to solve the impact of unstable sequences on the accuracy of model estimation furthermore bc improved the symmetry and homogeneity of variance in the datasets vmd bc svm is consistently foremost in terms of estimation accuracy indicating that the vmd bc svm model exhibits not only high accuracy but also stable performance the reduction rates of mape for the best vmd bc svm 4 models compared with those for the single svm 4 models in this study testing phase were 34 9 45 6 44 6 and 39 7 at wuqi wugong xiji and xifeng stations respectively table 7 therefore the hybrid models generated by coupling vmd bc and svm are highly desirable when the same meteorological factors were used at the stations the vmd bc svm model performed better than the other machine learning models this highlights the superiority of the vmd bc svm model in dealing with complex and nonlinear relationships between eto and driving meteorological factors hybrid vmd bc data processing can achieve accurate signal separation and maintain time varying characteristics it can also improve homoscedasticity normality and additivity which are suitable for the analysis of nonlinear and non stationary signals therefore the vmd bc svm model is superior to the other methods to the best of our knowledge this hybrid data processing technology vmd bc has never been used in the field of eto estimation in this study the extended method is applied to the field of eto estimation to enrich existing knowledge previous research has solved the problem of non stationary data using decomposed meteorological factors as model inputs luan 2017 qasem et al 2019 however the key driving effects of the decomposed modes imfs of the meteorological factors on eto estimation were not identified it is considered in this study if some modes of the meteorological factors are more effective than the others for estimating eto the high dimensional characteristics of the models render direct modeling complicated therefore the use of effective statistical methods is necessary to select the key modes with high correlation and achieve data dimensionality reduction to improve the running efficiency of the model to determine the key inputs of the model the analysis of the relationship between predictors and response variables is important in this study lasso regression was utilized to reduce the number of input variables and identify the key driving modes i e prediction factors of eto the lasso regression is effective in reducing model complexity by decreasing the considerable variance caused by shrinking some coefficients to zero the modes with regression coefficients exceeding 0 08 could be used as inputs into the two factor model similarly a mode with regression coefficients exceeding 0 02 is selected as the four factor model input the corresponding analysis results are shown in figs 4 and 5 the importance of each modal factor is determined by lasso via compression estimation to select features with high regression coefficients as inputs to the model this is the first time that lasso has been introduced as the modal selection method for eto prediction the performance of the models was evaluated using multiple evaluation indices tables 6 and 7 however the impact of meteorological factors on model performance was not explored the mine can reflect the high dimensional mi between multiple meteorological factors and eto it can also evaluate the model performance in terms of the amount of information fig 7 and table 8 the vmd bc svm model simulation results provide better information than the h s and p t models fig 7 and table 8 the evaluation results of the other six station models figs 8 and 9 tables 9 and 10 also proved the superiority of the vmd bc svm model indicating the model s applicability to the research area thus we propose the hybrid vmd bc svm model as the best choice for estimating eto in regions with scarce meteorological data the estimation performance of the hybrid vmd bc svm and vmd bc elm models compared with those of the h s and p t empirical models was superior because of the ability of the machine learning models to map the eto and meteorological factors better the vmd bc svm model performed better than the other machine learning models tables 7 and 8 clearly indicate that the vmd bc svm model achieves the best performance in terms of mape r rmse and nse for all stations regardless of the input combinations the vmd bc svm model performs better than the corresponding empirical models this study proves that the vmd bc svm model can be used as an alternative to empirical models 5 conclusion an accurate estimation of the daily eto is essential for efficient water resource management and optimal irrigation scheduling particularly because of the limited applicability of the p m model in regions where meteorological data are scarce this paper proposes a hybrid vmd bc svm model for improving the daily eto estimation accuracy in data scarce regions the model is created by integrating two data preprocessing technologies vmd and bc and a modal selection method lasso into the svm the vmd bc svm models were validated using two input combinations the two factor and four factor combinations were compared with those of the h s and p t empirical models for the wei river basin the main conclusions are as follows the hybrid models offer better accuracy and stability than the single and empirical models among them the hybrid vmd bc svm models yielded the best performance for daily eto modeling and can be used to replace the empirical models in estimating the daily eto in data scarce regions the vmd model is a robust and self adaptive data preprocessing method that can be used to extract effective features from a series the original meteorological factors were decomposed into different modes imfs using vmd thereby reducing the complexity and non stationarity of the input meteorological factors this study proves that vmd can improve model estimation the bc method improves data smoothness symmetry and the homogeneity of variance while retaining the information of the original meteorological data therefore bc can effectively reduce the skewness of the data and improve the estimation accuracy of the models a novel hybrid data processing technique vmd bc was developed to model the svm the integration of vmd and bc can achieve accurate signal decomposition while maintaining time varying characteristics and further improving homoscedasticity normality and additivity thus the vmd bc model strengthens the convergence and mapping ability of the svm model the data preprocessing ability of hybrid vmd bc improved the model performance more effectively than the single data preprocessing methods the multiple high dimensional modes generated by vmd can influence the operational efficiency of the model to reduce this effect the key driving modes were selected as the input of the model from the different imfs of meteorological factors using lasso consequently not only is overfitting prevented but the complexity of the model is also reduced by removing some redundant features the hybrid vmd bc svm model developed for the semi arid region of china may not be directly applicable to other climatic regions in the world the recommendation for future research is that the application of the proposed data preprocessing technology vmd bc can be transferable to other regions in this study the modes with high regression coefficients were selected as the model input using only the lasso regression based on the penalty term future studies can explore the potential of various modal identification methods such as the filter and wrapper methods most studies have focused on estimating eto using less amounts of meteorological data however improving the prediction accuracy of eto is also important for this objective a hybrid machine

9283,the accurate estimation of reference evapotranspiration eto is a fundamental requirement for precision irrigation and regional water resource planning in this regard the application of the standard model fao 56 penman monteith is limited because of insufficient meteorological data this study aims to improve the accuracy of eto calculations in regions with scarce meteorological data a hybrid model integrating two data preprocessing methods variational mode decomposition vmd and box cox transformation bc into a support vector machine svm model vmd bc svm is proposed the model estimates the daily eto based on the meteorological data 1980 2019 of 10 stations in the wei river basin of china the vmd method was employed to extract multiple intrinsic mode functions imfs and eliminate non stationarity this is achieved by decomposing meteorological factors which are further transformed by bc to alleviate skewness characteristics the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression lasso identifies the key driving modes from the transformed imfs which are used as the input of the svm model the vmd bc svm estimation model framework based on decomposition transformation identification estimation is proposed the performance of each of the hybrid vmd bc svm models was further compared with those of the standalone extreme learning machine elm model and two empirical models hargreaves samani and priestley taylor models the results revealed that the hybrid models outperformed the single models the vmd bc svm model achieved higher accuracy compared with the other models specifically the coefficient of correlation r and nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse were both greater than 0 96 furthermore the mean absolute percentage error mape and root mean square error rmse were less than 8 41 and 0 38 mm d respectively in terms of the amount of information provided the vmd bc svm model is superior to empirical models in identifying high dimensional and nonlinear information moreover the estimation performance is more stable and the level of uncertainty is lower this study provides a novel approach for predicting eto in regions with limited meteorological data keywords variational mode decomposition box cox transformation support vector machine least absolute shrinkage and selection operator wei river basin data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction reference evapotranspiration eto is an essential variable for estimating crop water requirements and plays a key role in water resource management in irrigated areas paredes et al 2018 valle júnior et al 2020 fan et al 2021 the estimation methods for eto include empirical formulae and measurement methods which require personnel and equipment and have limitations and high costs gomariz castillo et al 2017 shirmohammadi aliakbarkhani and saberali 2020 accordingly the use of the empirical formula has become the main technique for estimating eto the united nations food and agriculture organization fao has endorsed the fao 56 penman monteith fao 56p m model as the standard method for estimating eto allen et al 1998 that comprehensively considers the driving effect of various meteorological variables however the application of the fao 56p m model is limited by its high dependency on meteorological factors therefore simplifying the eto estimation is necessary using techniques such as the hargreaves samani h s hargreaves et al 1985 priestly taylor p t priestley et al 1972 makkink chen et al 2018 and 48 penman models qualls and crago 2020 however the lack of meteorological data results in low model estimation accuracy and inadequate universality consequently researchers have explored non linear approaches to improve the estimation accuracy machine learning models have been broadly applied to eto modeling ferreira and da cunha 2020 in data scarce regions these models include neural networks abdullah et al 2015 feng et al 2016 antonopoulos and antonopoulos 2017 support vector machines svms kundu et al 2016 ehteram et al 2019 chia et al 2020 mohammadi and mehdizadeh 2020 and tree based assembly models fan et al 2018 huang et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 wu et al 2020 wen et al 2015 developed four input combination strategies based on temperature data they constructed an svm model to estimate eto in the absence of meteorological data in arid areas the accuracy of the model was found to be higher than those of the priestley taylor and empirical models the implementation of machine learning models in eto estimation was investigated by mohammadi and mehdizadeh 2020 they also proved that svm had excellent estimation accuracy when applied to three different climate stations in iran including arid semi arid and humid regions based on different types of meteorological combinations another study was conducted by feng et al 2017 to compare the performance of extreme learning machine elm and generalized regression neural network grnn models in estimating eto with temperature based data the elm model was found to provide slightly better estimates of eto than the grnn and hargreaves models published articles in literature report that svm and elm are widely applied to eto calculation both yielding satisfactory estimates in addition the stability of the svm structure enables it to be used as a fundamental model for developing different data processing methods researchers have developed many models for eto estimation using different meteorological factors indicating that eto mainly depends on meteorological factors however the meteorological factors affecting eto are complex highly non stationary and seasonally irregular therefore achieving satisfactory accuracy for daily eto estimation using a single model with meteorological factors as inputs is difficult if collected data are not preprocessed over the last few years hybrid models have received considerable attention because of their improved simulation ability in terms of eto estimation to reduce the complexity and non stationarity of an original time series and improve estimation accuracy many authors have introduced signal decomposition techniques feng et al 2014 gocić et al 2015 luan 2017 qasem et al 2019 these methods include empirical mode decomposition emd and wavelet transform wt which decompose meteorological data into a relatively stable sub series and enhance the correlation between eto and meteorological factors the successful modeling results of these studies confirmed the suitability of decomposition techniques for enhancing machine learning models fu et al 2021 proposed hybrid models for estimating the monthly eto coupled with discrete wt dwt ensemble emd eemd and variational mode decomposition vmd to decompose eto and extract the main variation features their proposed models ignored the non stationarity and complexity of meteorological factors the vmd based model was found to have higher estimation accuracy than the dwt and eemd fu et al 2021 the vmd technology has achieved remarkable results in multidisciplinary fields guo et al 2020 sun and zhao 2020 feng et al 2020 li et al 2021 carvalho and de assis de souza filho 2021 however the technology has not been developed for daily eto estimation by decomposing meteorological factors it is a completely non recursive signal decomposition method based on the frequency domain dragomiretskiy et al 2014 compared with emd and wt techniques vmd not only overcomes the endpoint effect and mode aliasing problems existing in emd but also reduces the model test steps improves the model accuracy and does not require choosing a basis function as wd the decomposition of meteorological factors using vmd not only solves the limitation of eto estimation in data scarce regions but also affects the use of non stationary input factors in model estimation owing to the high non stationarity and intrinsic complexity of meteorological factors combining vmd methods to establish a hybrid estimation model without adequate meteorological data is highly desirable decomposition technology can effectively improve data stability song et al 2021 however it does not consider the influence of data symmetry and variance homogeneity on simulation accuracy to resolve these problems researchers have focused on data transformation methods amin et al 2019 devised a model using data transformation methods and presented an extensive comparison to validate the impact of these methods the results demonstrated that most data transformation methods improve model performance the box cox transformation bc has been widely applied to the field of signal science cai et al 2021 wang et al 2021 hydrology frequency analysis and calculations seong 2014 however no study on eto estimation and meteorological factor transformation has ever been conducted the bc method belongs to the family of power transformation methods box and cox 1964 it not only improves data smoothness symmetry and the homogeneity of variance and retains the information of the original dataset but also enhances the correlation between meteorological factors and eto in view of its importance in hydroclimatic research the reliable estimate and modeling of eto using a series of new methods are highly preferred the improvement of model performance to estimate eto by creating hybrid models such as those integrated with a decomposition technique has been well demonstrated accordingly the present study aims to incorporate the ability to model the daily eto accurately using a hybrid data preprocessing technique combined with vmd and bc the input variables of the models can affect their estimation accuracy some researchers have proposed using meteorological factors as model inputs to estimate eto pammar et al 2017 feng et al 2017 chia et al 2020 fu et al 2021 used the decomposition series of history eto as input for machine learning meteorological elements are non stationary and complex however the foregoing studies did not consider the decomposition of meteorological factors some scholars have proposed estimating eto by considering all the modes i e intrinsic mode functions imfs of decomposed meteorological factors as model input and achieved satisfactory results gocić et al 2015 qasem et al 2019 evidently the input variable of the model is the foremost problem in eto simulation hence it is a topic worthy of in depth discussion however the driving effects of different modes of meteorological factors on eto estimation have not been explored in the aforementioned research works whether some modes of meteorological factors have a more effective driving effect on eto estimation than others remain to be further examined this must be expected to avoid the overfitting risk of models and improve the estimation ability by introducing mode identification yu et al 2022 identified the optimal feature after eliminating the redundant features using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator lasso which effectively reduces the model complexity the lasso regression a variable selection method for nonnegative disturbance excitations sethi and mittal 2021 is a popular method for high dimensional applications in machine learning as such lasso can be used to identify the key driving modes of the decomposed meteorological factors in this study the study is aims to achieve the following 1 decompose the meteorological factors into different modes imfs using vmd and thus overcome the influence of highly non stationary inputs on model estimation 2 normalize imfs by employing bc to reduce the skewness of the meteorological factors 3 identify the optimal key modes imfs of each meteorological factor as the svm input using lasso 4 develop a novel hybrid vmd bc svm model incorporating decomposition transformation identification estimation and test it using the daily meteorological factors collected from the wei river basin 5 evaluate the performance of vmd bc svm by comparing it with single and empirical models using evaluation indices and a mutual information neural estimator mine 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data this study is conducted in the wei river basin china which is the first tributary of the yellow river the basin has a trunk length of 818 km it is located between 103 5 and 110 5 e and 33 5 37 5 n covering an area of approximately 13 5 104 km2 chen et al 2021 the basin is located in the transition zone between arid and semi arid regions and has a continental monsoon climate because of topography precipitation is unevenly distributed in space precipitation decreases from the southeast to the northwest xu et al 2021 with an annual average of 500 800 mm the surface evaporation is 700 1000 mm the study was conducted in 10 meteorological stations from the national web with different geographical characteristics four stations wugong and xiji stations in the mainstream district and wuqi and xifeng stations in the jing river and beiluo river were used as representatives of each district to describe the modeling process in detail data from the other six stations were used to analyze the applicability of the models to the wei river basin the locations of the meteorological stations were identified on the map shown in fig 1 daily meteorological data were collected from the china meteorological data network http data cma cn from 1980 to 2019 data points these include the maximum minimum and mean temperatures tmax tmin and tmean respectively relative humidity rh wind speed at a height of 10 m u10 and sunshine duration ssd the datasets were measured and collected at the elevations of the meteorological stations and were representative of regional weather conditions to determine partially missing meteorological data the lagrange interpolation method was used because of its robustness and capability to flexibly adjust data order prasopchingchana 2022 the datasets were classified into two parts model training 1980 2007 and testing 2008 2019 details of the stations are summarized in table 1 2 2 data preprocessing 2 2 1 variational modal decomposition the vmd technique an adaptive and completely non recursive mode variational and signal processing method dragomiretskiy and zosso 2014 is an effective separation and frequency domain division of the intrinsic modal sequence it is effective for obtaining the decomposition sequence to finally derive the optimal solution of a variational problem in this study each meteorological series f t is adaptively decomposed into k imfs to ensure that the decomposed sequence is a mode series with limited bandwidth and central frequency the sum of the estimated bandwidths of each mode is minimum the constraint condition is that the sum of all modes is equal to that of the original sequence the corresponding constraint variational model is constructed as 1 min u k ω k k 1 k t δ t j π t u k t e j ω k t 2 2 s t k 1 k u k t f t where u k is the set of decomposed modes ω k is the set of decomposed modal center frequencies represents the convolution operator t is the partial derivative with respect to time t and δ t is the dirac function the quadratic penalty factor and lagrange multiplier are introduced to solve the foregoing problems the alternate direction multiplier iterative algorithm is used to search for the optimal solution i e the saddle point of the lagrange function the decomposition of meteorological data through the vmd model can reduce the instability and volatility of the series as well as improve the correlation between meteorological factors and eto 2 2 2 box cox transformation the bc method a generalized power transformation technique box and cox 1964 estimates parameter λ by the maximum likelihood estimation or bayesian method and then determines the data transformation form the bc method can improve data independence stationarity and homogeneity of variance without losing the original sequence information then it can transform the model into 2 y λ y a λ 1 λ λ 0 ln y a λ 0 where y λ is the new variable after transformation and a is the translated coefficient such that all components of the original variable y become positive because the maximum likelihood estimation method is simple and entails minimal calculation this study uses this method to solve λ the model input meteorological factors are transformed using bc according to the λ value reducing the correlation between the unobtainable error and eto 2 3 support vector machine the svm model finds the best separation hyperplane in feature space such that the interval among the training sample points farthest from the plane is the largest after the kernel method is introduced svm can deal with nonlinear problems essam et al 2022 the model is based on the principle of minimizing structural risk and has satisfactory generalization ability let the training dataset be x i y i i 1 n r n r where x i and y i indicate the i th input and output vectors respectively the svm optimization can be expressed as 3 min q ω ξ 1 2 ω 2 c i 1 n ξ i ξ i 4 s t y i f x ε ξ i f x y i ε ξ i ξ i ξ i 0 where c is the penalty factor ξ i and ξ i are the slack variables and ε is the insensitive loss coefficient the lagrange function was introduced to transform the optimization problem into a duality problem and then solve it an svm nonlinear mapping model was also obtained the function is 5 f x i 1 n α i α i k x x i b where α i is the lagrange multiplier k x x i is the kernel function and b is the bias coefficient the radial basis kernel function rbf and the linear polynomial and sigmoid kernel functions are the four types of kernel functions commonly used the linear kernel function is a special case of rbf the polynomial and sigmoid kernel functions involve more parameters the latter approximates the rbf under some parameters in summary the rbf is selected as the kernel function of the svm in this study 2 4 proposed vmd bc svm hybrid model this paper proposes a novel hybrid vmd bc svm model based on a decomposition transformation identification estimation framework to estimate the daily eto the flowchart is presented in fig 2 the vmd bc svm model is developed as follows meteorological factors are decomposed into multiple modes imfs employing vmd all modes imfs are normalized using bc the key driving modes imfs that are highly correlated with eto are identified using lasso regression the proposed vmd bc svm estimation model is developed with the identified key driving modes imfs as the svm model input 2 5 empirical models for estimating eto in this study the eto calculated from the fao 56p m model was used as the standard value and the h s hargreaves and samani 1985 and p t priestley et al 1972 empirical models are used for comparison the specific calculation formulae are listed in table 2 in table 2 eto p m eto h s and eto p t mm d are the eto estimated by p m h s and p t respectively δ is the slope of the saturation vapor pressure curve kpa c rn is the net radiation mj m2 d ra is the extraterrestrial radiation mj m2 d g is the soil heat flux mj m2 d γ is the psychrometric constant kpa c tmax tmin and t are the maximum minimum and mean daily air temperatures c respectively u2 is the wind speed at a 2 m height m s and es and ea are the saturation and actual vapor pressures kpa respectively the study area includes arid and semi arid regions thus the empirical coefficients c and e are set to 0 0023 and 0 5 respectively hargreaves and samani 1985 for comparison with the h s and p t models the selected input combinations of meteorological factors are listed in table 3 the study yielded two input combinations for daily eto modeling at all stations the combination of tmax and tmin and that of tmax tmin ssd and rh 2 6 model performance evaluation 2 6 1 mutual information neural estimator the mine is optimized by a neural network ozdenizci and erdogmus 2021 zbili and rama 2021 and can process random variables with arbitrary distributions in any dimension mutual information mi reveals the influence of internal implicit information such as variables and simulation results on model performance however mi has no clear upper limit the closer the mi between the estimated and standard values to the information entropy of the standard value the better the model estimation effect the following expresses mi 6 i x y d k l p q sup t ω r e p t log e q e t where p is the joint distribution p x y of x and y q is the product of the edge distribution p x p y of x and y and function t is fitted by a neural network the foregoing equation is regarded as a loss function and the loss value reaches the maximum through gradient rise until convergence the maximum value is the estimator of mi 2 6 2 evaluation indices previous studies have evaluated the estimation accuracy of the model from the perspective of error through evaluation indices and rarely discussed model performance in terms of information therefore the accuracy and performance of the models investigated for daily eto estimations were evaluated using the following the mi technology eq 6 and four commonly used evaluation metrics are combined mean absolute percentage error mape nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse coefficient of correlation r and root mean square error rmse the mape and rmse metrics were used to assess the actual situation of the estimated value error ranging 0 small mape and rmse values indicate improved model performance guo et al 2021 chen et al 2022 models with mape and rmse values that are less than 30 and 0 7 respectively are excellent the r and nse metrics are generally used to evaluate the stability and model fitting effect the closer their values are to 1 and when they exceed 0 6 the better the model fitting effect these metrics can be expressed as 7 m a p e 100 n i 1 n e t i s e t i e e t i s 8 n s e 1 i 1 n e t i s e t i e 2 i 1 n e t i s e t s m e a n 2 9 r i 1 n e t i s e t s m e a n e t i e e t e m e a n i 1 n e t i s e t s m e a n 2 i 1 n e t i e e t e m e a n 2 10 r m s e 1 n i 1 n e t i s e t i e 2 where e t i s and e t i e are the ith standard and estimated values of eto respectively e t s m e a n and e t e m e a n are the averages of y i and y i respectively and n is the number of samples 3 results 3 1 meteorological factor decomposition based on vmd the vmd method was used to decompose meteorological factors into a series of modes imfs with different frequencies the number of decomposition layers is known to be crucial to the accuracy of the model wen et al 2019 in this study the decomposition layer k was set to have 3 7 layers in advance to determine the specific number of decomposition layers according to the fitting degree of the training period the vmd bc svm model selected six layers that outperformed the other layers at the wugong station therefore tmax tmin ssd and rh were decomposed into six layers the results are shown in fig 3 the other stations adopted the same method to select the number of layers table 5 the results showed that the effect was significant although the workload was more complicated 3 2 parameters of bc and key driving modes each decomposed mode is normalized by bc the values of the transformation parameter λ which determines the function type that the bc employs are listed in table 4 to demonstrate the effect of bc normalization was adopted as the data processing method for comparison the lasso regression compresses the variable coefficients by constructing penalty functions such that some coefficients with small absolute values can be directly set to zero these variables are deleted to achieve dimensionality reduction and parameter selection concurrently sethi and mittal 2021 the importance of each mode i e imf and eto at the four stations using the vmd bc svm models is compared using heat maps the regression coefficients that determine the importance of imfs based on the input of the two and four factors are shown in figs 4 and 5 respectively the exact values of the regression coefficients can be found in the excel spreadsheet provided as supplementary data the key driving factors with a high regression coefficient as model inputs are beneficial for improving the model efficiency the numbers of key driving modes and decomposition layers using different input combinations are summarized in table 5 the regression coefficient based on the input of the two factors is shown in fig 4 the figure shows that the maximum and minimum temperatures are decomposed into five layers at each station the number of selected modes is summarized in table 5 all the modes were selected as inputs for xifeng station the lowest value of the regression coefficient among the 10 modes was imf3tmin 0 086 which can be viewed in the supplementary data the lowest values in the selected modes of wuqi wugong and xiji stations are 0 085 imf4tmin 0 085 imf2tmin and 0 097 imf5tmin respectively this indicates that the selection of a mode with regression coefficients exceeding 0 08 as the model input is more advantageous similarly the lowest regression coefficients in the selected modes at wuqi wugong xiji and xifeng stations were 0 022 imf3rh 0 035 imf5rh 0 045 imf4rh and 0 022 imf4rh respectively as observed in fig 5 this indicates that imfs with a value exceeding 0 02 can be used as a model input based on the four factor model 3 3 estimated results of single model the rbf was used for the svm model ε was 0 01 and the penalty factor c and kernel function parameter g were 1 and 2 respectively the activation function and number of hidden nodes of the elm model for a training dataset were the sine function and 40 respectively the simulation accuracies of the two factor and four factor single models are listed in tables 6 and 7 respectively based on the results of the four stations the mape ranges of the svm 2 and elm 2 models were 20 97 wugong 23 77 wuqi and 21 24 wugong 25 18 wuqi respectively the r nse and rmse metrics indicate similar performance levels the optimal mape for the svm 4 model was 12 51 wuqi the results show that the simulation accuracy of the svm is better than that of the elm the svm model adopts the principle of structural risk minimization it obtains a unique solution that compensates for the disadvantages of elm which has a low learning rate and easily falls into the local minimum 3 4 estimated results of hybrid models to formulate hybrid models meteorological factors were obtained by implementing vmd bc transformation and vmd bc pre processing the results based on two factor and four factor inputs are summarized in tables 6 and 7 respectively and the errors are given in the bubble chart shown in fig 6 tables 6 and 7 indicate that vmd bc and vmd bc can improve the estimation accuracy of the machine learning models the performance of bc based models was better than that of vmd based models the mape and rmse ranges of the vmd bc svm 2 model was 11 03 wugong 13 6 wuqi and 0 62 xiji 0 74 wuqi respectively the r and nse of the vmd bc svm 2 model was more than 0 96 and 0 92 respectively in the four sites among the models for the four stations the model trained at the wuqi station had the worst performance the vmd bc elm 2 model had an acceptable estimation the wugong station had the highest accuracy mape 12 03 r 0 97 nse 0 94 and rmse 0 61 mm d the vmd bc based models are the best among all the models the data processing technology based on the fusion of vmd and bc can effectively improve the nonlinear mapping relationship between meteorological factors and eto moreover it has better performance and is suitable for the wei river basin table 6 indicates that the four factor machine learning models have a higher estimation accuracy than the other models the absence of ssd and rh lead to the absence of key parts of the mapping relationship hence the contribution of ssd and rh to the estimation accuracy of the models is positive the results of the single and vmd based models do not considerably differ for example the mape of the svm 4 and vmd svm 4 models at wuqi station were 12 51 and 13 00 respectively this positive effect deteriorates when vmd is used indicating that the decomposition of meteorological factors may be unstable the mape of the bc based model reaches 9 52 wuqi station indicating that the use of bc transformation to obtain meteorological factors is effective for model estimation therefore a combination of vmd and bc was considered to estimate the eto during the test in wuqi station the evaluation indices of the mape r nse and rmse of the vmd bc svm 4 and vmd bc elm 4 models reached 8 41 10 24 0 984 0 97 and 0 38 0 48 mm d respectively these were slightly worse than the indices of the other three stations similarly for the four factor input the model tested at wugong station exhibited the best performance among the four stations the simulation accuracy of the vmd bc svm model was higher than that of the other models in summary the ranks of the studied models in terms of estimation accuracy were vmd bc svm vmd bc elm bc svm bc elm vmd svm and vmd elm to evaluate the performance of the single and hybrid models mape and rmse were presented using bubble charts a comparison of the eight machine learning models is shown in fig 6 among all the models vmd bc svm and vmd bc elm showed satisfactory performance during training and testing the bubble charts clearly illustrate that the vmd bc svm 4 model had the smallest error mape ranged from 7 to 9 and rmse was less than 0 44 mm d the foregoing indicates that the hybrid models based on vmd bc have superior estimates compared with the other machine learning models 3 5 comparative analysis with empirical model the performance indicators of machine learning and empirical models based on two factor and four factor inputs for estimating the daily eto at the four meteorological stations are summarized in tables 6 and 7 respectively the results show that the vmd bc svm and vmd bc elm models generally outperform the h s and p t models at all meteorological stations the computing performance of the hybrid vmd bc svm 2 model was better than that of the h s model because mape decreased from 30 81 to 11 03 during the testing stage at wugong station table 6 indicates that the computing performance of the hybrid vmd bc svm 4 model is better than that of the p t model mape decreased from 18 15 to 7 24 at the wugong station therefore the vmd bc svm and vmd bc elm models can replace the h s and p t empirical models under the same meteorological input conditions respectively moreover the vmd bc svm model performs better than the vmd bc elm model 3 6 model performance analysis based on mutual information neural estimator the performance of the vmd bc svm and empirical models is evaluated in terms of information the mi between simulated results and standard values as well as the high dimensional mi between multiple meteorological factors and eto using the mine are shown in fig 7 and summarized in table 8 the figure and table similarly indicate that the performance of the vmd bc svm model is better than that of the h s and p t models moreover the mi x ystd of the four meteorological factors and eto is approximately 1 67 xifeng 1 83 xiji and the mi of the two meteorological factors is 1 18 xifeng 1 32 wuqi the foregoing indicates that multiple meteorological factors can provide more information for eto estimation the performance of the four factor vmd bc svm and p t models in terms of mi ysim ystd is the best at all the stations 1 61 2 83 followed by the vmd bc svm 2 and h s models 1 40 2 13 this indicates that a considerable amount of input data improves the accuracy of model simulation this is consistent with the previous conclusion in addition the amount of information provided by the vmd bc svm model exceeds that provided by the empirical formulae using the same input factors the mi values of the vmd bc svm 4 model are 2 60 2 74 2 83 and 2 71 at wuqi wugong xiji and xifeng stations respectively these values are the closest to the information entropy of standard eto 2 87 2 75 2 96 and 2 97 respectively this indicates that the vmd bc svm models can identify the information provided by meteorological factors moreover the models have a strong ability to deal with high dimensional and nonlinear information the foregoing further shows that the structure and performance of machine learning models are superior to those of the h s and p t empirical models this observation is consistent with the model performance resulting from the use of evaluation indices the vmd bc svm models are confirmed to have stable estimation performance 3 7 spatial distribution of evaluation indices of models to illustrate the universality of the proposed models the spatial distribution of the evaluation indices at 10 meteorological stations for the two factor and four factor models are shown in figs 8 and 9 respectively the specific evaluation indices for the other six stations are listed in tables 9 and 10 respectively in fig 8 the vmd bc svm 2 model is shown to be superior to the other machine learning models and the h s empirical model at all stations in fig 9 the hybrid vmd bc svm 4 model exhibits a higher estimation accuracy than the p t empirical model by comparing figs 8 and 9 the four factor machine learning models are found to outperform the two factor models this indicates that the eto in the wei river basin is significantly affected by meteorological factors specifically temperature ssd and rh table 9 indicates that the estimation results of the vmd bc svm 2 model at huanxian changwu baoji and tianshui stations are better than those of the other two stations the mape and rmse values are less than 12 and 0 7 mm d respectively the results listed in table 10 indicate that high r and nse values exceeding 0 99 and 0 97 respectively were obtained the mape and rmse values were less than 8 and 0 4 respectively in terms of spatial distribution the vmd bc svm models were significantly better than the other models in the wei river basin this indicates that the vmd bc data processing technology proposed in this paper can effectively improve the simulation performance of the svm model overall the vmd bc svm models perform better than the h s and p t empirical models and can be used to estimate the eto in the wei river basin even when meteorological data are scarce 4 discussion in recent decades machine learning and empirical models have been proposed to improve the accuracy and effectiveness of eto estimation niu and feng 2021 kisi et al 2019 estimated the monthly potential eto in the sistan and baluchistan provinces they found that the svm model generated more accurate estimates than the adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system model anfis and gene expression programming gep method tejada et al 2022 also revealed that the svm and elm models showed similar modeling performance and their accuracy was superior to that of the empirical models given the same input requirements in this study the svm and elm generally exhibited similar performance in estimating the daily eto for the two factor and four factors models however the performance of the svm model is slightly better than that of the elm model the svm model has a lower mape for all input combinations than the elm model the results of elm optimization can be easily trapped in the local minimum owing to the random determination of hidden bias and input weights the svm can handle extremely complex problems by mapping inputs into feature spaces through kernel function transformation furthermore svm learning can be expressed as a convex optimization problem it solves the problem wherein the global minimum value cannot be obtained by elm for highly complex meteorological data in some cases single machine learning models cannot provide satisfactory estimation accuracy to resolve this many researchers have proposed hybrid models that introduce data preprocessing techniques to machine learning models data decomposition has been widely used to develop estimation models pammar et al 2017 attempted to explore hybrid modeling using dwt and support vector machine regression svr for evaporation estimation they proved that hybrid dwt svr models are superior to conventional svr models rezaie balf et al 2019 proposed a hybrid model combining eemd and svm to predict monthly evaporation the overall results showed that the eemd has satisfactory application prospects in complex time series prediction the vmd is a more robust and adaptive data preprocessing method than wt and emd thus vmd is used to extract effective features from meteorological series a novel hybrid approach for daily eto estimation using vmd to decompose the original meteorological factors into multiple modes i e imfs is proposed in this study the daily eto estimation accuracy of vmd based model 2 was slightly higher than those of the empirical models this shows that the decomposed modes are more stable and less volatile than the original series therefore the vmd based model is more accurate than the single machine learning model the vmd method improves the ability of the model by reducing the non stationarity of highly complex and strongly nonlinear meteorological data however the performance of vmd based model 4 was worse than that of the single model this indicates that the skewness of the data may have a negative influence on the model although the vmd model decomposes the four meteorological factors into a relatively stable mode the application of data transformation methods to meteorological data can potentially mitigate these problems zhang et al 2017 investigated whether applying different transformations i e bc affects the prediction the study results show that bc leads to performance improvement in prediction models the bc methods have been widely used in various research fields amin et al 2019 wang et al 2021 however the impact of bc methods on model performance has not been comprehensively explored in the field of evapotranspiration this study proves that bc based models are not only superior to the single model but also considerably better than the vmd based models as indicated by our investigation results the bc method can improve the prediction performance it is a power transformation method that reduces the correlation between the unobservable errors in meteorological data and eto to a certain extent the symmetry and variance of data and the strengthening of the correlation between meteorological factors and eto are significantly improved by the bc method consequently the accuracy of model simulation is significantly enhanced the advantages of vmd based and bc based models are demonstrated in this study a novel hybrid data processing technique vmd bc was used to model the svm model for the first time the vmd method decomposes the meteorological factors into more stable modes imfs to solve the impact of unstable sequences on the accuracy of model estimation furthermore bc improved the symmetry and homogeneity of variance in the datasets vmd bc svm is consistently foremost in terms of estimation accuracy indicating that the vmd bc svm model exhibits not only high accuracy but also stable performance the reduction rates of mape for the best vmd bc svm 4 models compared with those for the single svm 4 models in this study testing phase were 34 9 45 6 44 6 and 39 7 at wuqi wugong xiji and xifeng stations respectively table 7 therefore the hybrid models generated by coupling vmd bc and svm are highly desirable when the same meteorological factors were used at the stations the vmd bc svm model performed better than the other machine learning models this highlights the superiority of the vmd bc svm model in dealing with complex and nonlinear relationships between eto and driving meteorological factors hybrid vmd bc data processing can achieve accurate signal separation and maintain time varying characteristics it can also improve homoscedasticity normality and additivity which are suitable for the analysis of nonlinear and non stationary signals therefore the vmd bc svm model is superior to the other methods to the best of our knowledge this hybrid data processing technology vmd bc has never been used in the field of eto estimation in this study the extended method is applied to the field of eto estimation to enrich existing knowledge previous research has solved the problem of non stationary data using decomposed meteorological factors as model inputs luan 2017 qasem et al 2019 however the key driving effects of the decomposed modes imfs of the meteorological factors on eto estimation were not identified it is considered in this study if some modes of the meteorological factors are more effective than the others for estimating eto the high dimensional characteristics of the models render direct modeling complicated therefore the use of effective statistical methods is necessary to select the key modes with high correlation and achieve data dimensionality reduction to improve the running efficiency of the model to determine the key inputs of the model the analysis of the relationship between predictors and response variables is important in this study lasso regression was utilized to reduce the number of input variables and identify the key driving modes i e prediction factors of eto the lasso regression is effective in reducing model complexity by decreasing the considerable variance caused by shrinking some coefficients to zero the modes with regression coefficients exceeding 0 08 could be used as inputs into the two factor model similarly a mode with regression coefficients exceeding 0 02 is selected as the four factor model input the corresponding analysis results are shown in figs 4 and 5 the importance of each modal factor is determined by lasso via compression estimation to select features with high regression coefficients as inputs to the model this is the first time that lasso has been introduced as the modal selection method for eto prediction the performance of the models was evaluated using multiple evaluation indices tables 6 and 7 however the impact of meteorological factors on model performance was not explored the mine can reflect the high dimensional mi between multiple meteorological factors and eto it can also evaluate the model performance in terms of the amount of information fig 7 and table 8 the vmd bc svm model simulation results provide better information than the h s and p t models fig 7 and table 8 the evaluation results of the other six station models figs 8 and 9 tables 9 and 10 also proved the superiority of the vmd bc svm model indicating the model s applicability to the research area thus we propose the hybrid vmd bc svm model as the best choice for estimating eto in regions with scarce meteorological data the estimation performance of the hybrid vmd bc svm and vmd bc elm models compared with those of the h s and p t empirical models was superior because of the ability of the machine learning models to map the eto and meteorological factors better the vmd bc svm model performed better than the other machine learning models tables 7 and 8 clearly indicate that the vmd bc svm model achieves the best performance in terms of mape r rmse and nse for all stations regardless of the input combinations the vmd bc svm model performs better than the corresponding empirical models this study proves that the vmd bc svm model can be used as an alternative to empirical models 5 conclusion an accurate estimation of the daily eto is essential for efficient water resource management and optimal irrigation scheduling particularly because of the limited applicability of the p m model in regions where meteorological data are scarce this paper proposes a hybrid vmd bc svm model for improving the daily eto estimation accuracy in data scarce regions the model is created by integrating two data preprocessing technologies vmd and bc and a modal selection method lasso into the svm the vmd bc svm models were validated using two input combinations the two factor and four factor combinations were compared with those of the h s and p t empirical models for the wei river basin the main conclusions are as follows the hybrid models offer better accuracy and stability than the single and empirical models among them the hybrid vmd bc svm models yielded the best performance for daily eto modeling and can be used to replace the empirical models in estimating the daily eto in data scarce regions the vmd model is a robust and self adaptive data preprocessing method that can be used to extract effective features from a series the original meteorological factors were decomposed into different modes imfs using vmd thereby reducing the complexity and non stationarity of the input meteorological factors this study proves that vmd can improve model estimation the bc method improves data smoothness symmetry and the homogeneity of variance while retaining the information of the original meteorological data therefore bc can effectively reduce the skewness of the data and improve the estimation accuracy of the models a novel hybrid data processing technique vmd bc was developed to model the svm the integration of vmd and bc can achieve accurate signal decomposition while maintaining time varying characteristics and further improving homoscedasticity normality and additivity thus the vmd bc model strengthens the convergence and mapping ability of the svm model the data preprocessing ability of hybrid vmd bc improved the model performance more effectively than the single data preprocessing methods the multiple high dimensional modes generated by vmd can influence the operational efficiency of the model to reduce this effect the key driving modes were selected as the input of the model from the different imfs of meteorological factors using lasso consequently not only is overfitting prevented but the complexity of the model is also reduced by removing some redundant features the hybrid vmd bc svm model developed for the semi arid region of china may not be directly applicable to other climatic regions in the world the recommendation for future research is that the application of the proposed data preprocessing technology vmd bc can be transferable to other regions in this study the modes with high regression coefficients were selected as the model input using only the lasso regression based on the penalty term future studies can explore the potential of various modal identification methods such as the filter and wrapper methods most studies have focused on estimating eto using less amounts of meteorological data however improving the prediction accuracy of eto is also important for this objective a hybrid machine

irrigation scenarios using 15 cm 30 cm and 60 cm soil depths were developed using the zone specific optimized shps in the hydrus 1d model to meet irrigation water demand and reduce water stress the ratio of actual root water uptake arwu and potential root water uptake prwu were calculated to compare improvements in satisfying daily water demand and to reduce the water stress under different irrigation scenarios out of the total irrigation water triggered during growing seasons greater than 61 and 75 in zone 1 was triggered in july 2018 and in may june 2019 respectively however greater than 73 in july 2018 and greater than 72 in may june 2019 were triggered in zone 2 based on the simulations of various irrigation scenarios in hydrus 1d we found that installing sensors at 15 cm or 30 cm can help meet the daily irrigation water demand on time than sensors at 60 cm depth this study discussed the importance of critical water demands due to the distribution of precipitation over the

and climate change are expected to increase freshwater demands fao 2016 maja and ayano 2021 furthermore at the same time more than 40 of the earth s population is already experiencing water scarcity problems kummu et al 2016 approximately 70 of available freshwater withdrawal is for meeting irrigation needs in agricultural production to meet the food demands thus any improvements in the current irrigation practices can help conserve limited water resources and promote sustainable agriculture himanshu et al 2021 fao 2016 depending on climate conditions irrigation water demands vary greatly from arid to humid climate regions o shaughnessy et al 2018 rolle et al 2021 in humid climate regions irrigation is needed due to non uniform rainfall distribution sangha et al 2020 distribution of precipitation over the growing season filho et al 2020 and soil moisture variation within a crop field during a growing season kumar et al 2021b within field soil moisture variation can be due to the variability in soil properties vegetation and topographic gradients fontanet et al 2020 kumar et al 2021b which affects the irrigation rate time and depth during the crop growing period since uniform irrigation does not account for within field variability in soil moisture and applies fixed irrigation amounts over the field it can result in over and under application of water in different parts of a field the water is expensive and limited irrigation needs to be optimized for applying the right amount at the right place and at the right time because of this although currently uniform irrigation is the most common practice kumar et al 2021b farmers are increasingly adopting modern irrigation practices lena et al 2020 for example variable rate irrigation vri based on management zones within a crop field to adopt vri as the best irrigation practice different management zones can be delineated within a field based on variations in crop yield soil type and topography kumar et al 2021a which has the potential to conserve water by meeting zone specific crop water demands liakos et al 2017 lowrance et al 2016 a vri technology can trigger irrigations at zone specific irrigation thresholds depending on plant available water within specific zones which helps to increase irrigation water use efficiency reduce leaching and runoff reduce water stress maximize crop yield and profitability and reduce pressure on freshwater resources evans and sadler 2008 stone et al 2019 yost et al 2019 sui and yan 2017 found increased yield using with vri than uniform irrigation in a humid climate however precise irrigation to meet zone specific crop water demand requires continuous monitoring of soil water dynamics within the zones fontanet et al 2020 reyes et al 2019 in the past ten years sensor based irrigation method has received a lot of attention since this approach provides real time soil water status as soil water content θ or soil water pressure h which can be used for uniform irrigation and vri sensor locations are selected based on variabilities soil topography yield etc in the field detailed information about sensor placement can be found in irmak et al 2012 monitoring soil water dynamics in real time not only improves irrigation timing and depth irmak et al 2010 it also permits adequate water distribution using the vri technique o shaughnessy et al 2018 sharma and irmak 2020 to reduce crop water stress and potential crop yield losses predefined soil water depletion swd methods have been used by irrigation experts to determine irrigation thresholds using h or θ gu et al 2020 where irrigation threshold amount and time are determined by maximum allowable swd in each management zone allen et al 1998 irmak 2016 sui and yan 2017 in sensor based irrigation soil water dynamics in the soil profiles can be explained using knowledge on the soil hydraulic properties shps i e the soil water retention curve swrc and the hydraulic conductivity curve hcc soil hydraulic properties are required to understand root water uptake šimůnek and hopmans 2009 and to determine irrigation thresholds gu et al 2020 wang et al 2017 assuming one swrc and hcc throughout the field does not account for zone specific soil water dynamics and zone specific characteristics in a crop field unfortunately determination of both swrc and hcc and use of them to determine irrigation thresholds is rarely applied in irrigation applications even when these relationships are applied for determining irrigation thresholds investigations that optimize zone specific shps swrc and hcc and quantify their effect on irrigation threshold determination have not been conducted lena et al 2022 previous studies such as leininger et al 2019 recommended a 50 kpa as irrigation threshold for very fine sandy loam textured soil in mississippi and irmak et al 2016 recommended a range from 20 kpa to 25 kpa for fine sandy textured soils and a range from 90 kpa to 110 kpa for silt loam and silty clay loam textured soils in nebraska however these studies used shps based on either laboratory determinations raw using undisturbed soil cores lena et al 2022 or estimated based on soil texture and pedotransfer functions using particle size fractions iqbal et al 2020 these shps were not optimized for observed h or θ in actual field conditions to determine irrigation thresholds also these studies did not consider significance of hcc which is responsible to determine dynamic behavior of soil water movement irrigation scheduling using non optimized shps does not account for the discrepancies between field observations of h or θ such discrepancies can also result in the determination of irrigation thresholds and amounts evett et al 2019 previous studies irmak et al 2016 leininger et al 2019 lena et al 2022 did not consider soil water dynamics in determining the irrigation thresholds the shps obtained based on laboratory experiment lena et al 2022 or soil texture iqbal et al 2020 can show spatial variability in irrigation thresholds these are raw shps and these raw shps do not capture soil water dynamics in field conditions accurately the impact of evaluating optimized shps considering soil water dynamics on determining irrigation thresholds has never been studied which can address the spatial variability in soil water dynamics in field conditions and can result in effective irrigation thresholds in this study we evaluated the impact of raw and optimized shps on determining irrigation thresholds in a delineated field and presented a novel approach of optimizing the zone specific irrigation thresholds this study investigated the difference between uniform irrigation and zone specific irrigation that accounts for zone specific shps both swrc and hcc in a farmer s field we hypothesized that zone specific irrigation thresholds and amounts greatly vary with optimized shps in each zone since field measurements are practically onerous time consuming and include uncertainty in the measurements it makes sense to establish a modeling setup to optimize effective shps for zone specific characterization for more accurate irrigation and agricultural water management therefore for this investigation we selected two different management zones of an irrigated cornfield for each management zone we optimized the shps using measured h with inverse hydrus 1d modeling coupled with the shuffled complex evolution sce ua algorithm based on the optimized model we compared the currently applied irrigation uniform application with many different scenarios to schedule irrigation 2 material and methods 2 1 study area description this research was carried out in a cornfield belonging to a farmer located 34 43 06 46 n and 87 23 13 53 w in the town creek watershed in the tennessee valley region of north alabama usa the study region is classified as subtropical humid cfa köppen climate classification kottek et al 2006 with average annual precipitation of about 140 cm the growing season usually occurs from april to october kumar et al 2021b and distribution of total monthly precipitation over the 2018 and 2019 growing season is shown in fig 1 the annual average precipitation 1951 2017 over the growing period of april to august was 57 cm and the total rainfall received during this period of the 2018 and 2019 growing seasons was 61 cm and 60 cm respectively also a recent study in the southeast usa showed a 14 increment in the annual average of precipitation by 2059 which would alter the time erosivity characteristics and distribution of the precipitation events takhellambam et al 2021 2022 the distribution of precipitation is very important over the growing season and has an impact on irrigation frequency and consequently on crop water demand therefore if the precipitation is received during a high water demand period irrigation amount and frequency will be decreased and if the precipitation is received at the beginning or near the end of the growing season it does not have much impact on irrigation it can be observed that some of the months during the growing seasons have received minimum precipitation in 2018 and 2019 for example july in 2018 and may june in 2019 received the least precipitation over the growing season also during the high water demand period from mid may to mid june 2019 the total precipitation received was only 3 cm although crops might receive enough precipitation at the end of the growing season the time of precipitation is critical to reducing the crop water stress therefore it is important to plan irrigation according to the crop water demand the study field of 120 ha was equipped with a remotely controlled 625 m long reinke center pivot irrigation system reinke manufacturing co inc deshler ne usa with a mid elevation spray application mesa sprinklers fitted with pressure regulators the uniformity testing of the center pivot irrigation system was performed before the growing season with the catch can test dukes and perry 2006 irmak et al 2011 ortiz et al 2021 readers can follow ortiz et al 2021 for detailed and stepwise procedure irrigation was triggered when there was a deficit of about 2 54 cm as the upper limit of irrigation depth in the root zone compared with field capacity the reason to use 2 54 cm as the upper limit was based on the maximum capacity of the center pivot irrigation system for applying irrigation in the field kumar 2022a kumar et al 2022b the total irrigation amount applied by farmers in the field was 6 6 cm and 8 76 cm in 2018 and 2019 growing seasons respectively corn zea mays l cotton gossypium hirsutum l soybean glycine max l merr and winter wheat triticum aes tivum l are the major crops in the region kumar et al 2021b the field was delineated in three irrigation management zones zone 1 zone 2 and zone 3 however we used zone 1 and zone 2 in this study due to contrasting properties in these zones using the management zone analyst mza usda ars columbia mo usa software fridgen et al 2004 based on terrain elevation data collected using a starfire 6000 real time kinematic gps receiver deere and company moline il usa historical yield data collected using yield monitors mounted on a harvester and soil texture a similar approach was adopted to delineate the management zones in cornfields of north alabama kumar et al 2022b central alabama filho et al 2020 and south alabama jiménez et al 2020 for soil texture a disturbed soil sampling campaign was conducted from several locations for soil characterization in the study field at three depths 0 15 cm 15 30 cm and 30 60 cm using the hydrometer method bouyoucos 1962 table 1 the slope was generated using terrain elevation data and it varied from 0 to 10 a topographic wetness index twi was also generated beven and kirkby 1979 and twi varied from 5 11 to 18 two contrasting zones namely zone 1 and zone 2 differing in slope soil twi and crop yield were selected for this study table 1 the zone 1 had lower slope greater twi and greater crop yield as compared to zone 2 which had greater slope lower twi and lower crop yield within the field zone 3 had properties between zone 1 and zone 2 and therefore it was not used in the study since about 95 of corn roots are distributed between 0 and 60 cm soil layer zhou and zhao 2019 an array of three watermark sensors irrometer co riverside ca usa at multiple locations were installed in each zone to monitor zone specific h at 0 15 cm 15 30 cm and 30 60 cm soil depths during the growing season watermark sensors are electrical resistance devices to monitor h in different soil types in crop fields sensors were installed on 01 may 2019 and removed on 11 august 2019 the corn was planted on 28 march 2019 and harvested on 30 august 2019 during the 2018 growing season corn was planted on 10 april 2018 and harvested on 03 september 2018 an automatic weather station vantage pro2 plus davis instruments hayward ca usa was installed near field to record meteorological parameters kumar et al 2021b the groundwater depth below the surface is variable in the region however the annual average

description a numerically approximate one dimensional model hydrus 1d was selected to simulate soil water dynamics in both zones during the growing seasons hydrus 1d has been used as a reliable tool to model water dynamics of variably saturated soils in various field and laboratory conditions mokari et al 2019 šimůnek et al 2016 wyatt et al 2021 hydrus 1d has been used in different scenarios such as rainfed irrigation iqbal et al 2020 furrow irrigation tafteh and sepaskhah 2012 uniform irrigation fontanet et al 2020 and root water uptake studies šimůnek and hopmans 2009 zheng et al 2017 wang et al 2021 the model solves the governing richard s equation by applying a finite element code the one dimensional equation for water flow in an unsaturated flow medium is described by eq 1 1 θ t z k

each zone undisturbed soil core was collected using a sampler ring of stainless steel 5 cm in height and 8 cm in diameter the sampler rings were carefully removed by digging out surrounding soils and stored in a container for transportation the sample cores were saturated for 24 h before the soil water retention measurements using the evaporation method with the hyprop measurement system peters et al 2015 peters and durner 2008 hyprop measurements are limited by the cavitation point of the two tensiometers and for this reason water retention curves can be estimated from saturation until around pf 3 the pf is a logarithmic function of absolute h in cm to determine the dry range of swrcs we used a dew point hygrometer wp4c potentiameter meter group pullman wa usa for detailed information about developing shps readers are suggested to follow lena et al 2021 2022 5 pf log 10 h 2 3 2 dynamic field measurements to input meteorological data the surface water flux precipitation and irrigation minimum and maximum temperatures humidity solar radiations and wind speed were collected from the installed weather station irrigations applied by farmer during the 2018 and 2019 growing seasons were recorded in addition to precipitation for water input data in the model the growth stages were recorded for corn to determine the associated crop coefficient during the growing season irmak 2017 the plant heights and leaf area index lai were also recorded in both zones during the field visits the lai was measured using an lai 2200 plant canopy analyzer li cor environmental lincoln ne usa on the 57th 72th 92th and 128th day after planting during the growing season the lai was measured from four different locations within each zone with five replications for each location morata 2020 2 3 3 initial and boundary conditions the initial conditions were defined in terms of h in the model since this study is a field study and the surface layer was subjected to the atmosphere we defined the upper boundary condition bc as atmospheric bc with surface runoff in the hydrus 1d model the lower bc was set to free drainage boundary at 100 cm soil depth indicating no interaction with the groundwater a spatial discretization of 0 5 cm leading to 201 nodes across the entire soil profile and no hysteresis in soil water retention was considered the observed nodes top center and bottom were defined at the same depths of 15 cm 30 cm and 60 cm where watermark sensors were installed in both zones 2 3 4 root water uptake hydrus 1d simulates root water uptake rwu of a crop during the growing season the rwu i e the sink term s in richard s equation was computed using an equation given by feddes et al 1978 6 s α h β z t p where α h is a dimensionless response function of h 0 α h 1 which accounts for rwu stress β z is normalized water uptake distribution l 1 t p is a potential transpiration rate lt 1 water stress causes rwu reduction α h can be explained as 7 α h 0 h h 1 or h h 4 h h 1 h 2 h 1 h 1 h h 2 1 h 2 h h 3 h h 4 h 3 h 4 h 3 h h 4 where h 1 is called anaerobiosis point i e water uptake considered to be zero close to the saturation h h 1 h 4 is pressure head at the wilting point and water uptake is also considered to be zero when h h 4 maximum rwu happens between h 2 and h 3 and it decreases or increases linearly between the pressure heads h 3 and h 4 or h 1 and h 2 respectively fig 2 since 95 of the corn roots are linearly distributed within the 0 60 cm soil profile zhou and zhao 2019 and for this reason we assumed linear root distribution function to a depth of 60 cm the parameters in wesseling 1991 were selected for the root water uptake of corn in both zones 2 4 inverse modeling to optimize zone specific shps hydrus 1d a reference scenario we used inverse modeling to optimize a single layer 0 100 cm effective shps using h measured at three depths 0 15 cm 15 30 cm and 30 60 cm in both zones due to fairly uniform soil layers and textural homogeneity within the soil depths in each zone we used single layer shps we converted h into pf to perform inverse modeling in hydrus 1d the hydrus 1d model was coupled with the sce ua developed by duan et al 1994 to perform optimization of shps diamantopoulos et al 2012 qu et al 2014 an objective function obj was defined for minimization in the sce ua algorithm 8 obj j 1 nn pf j pf j ˆ x 2 where pf j pf 15 cm pf 30 cm pf 60 cm is a vector of daily observations of h as pf values pf j ˆ pf ˆ 15 cm pf ˆ 30 cm pf ˆ 60 cm a vector that contains daily hydrus 1d predictions of h as pf values x θ r θ s α n k s l is a vector of soil hydraulic parameters used in van genuchten model j is the number of each observation point and nn is the total number of measurements at each soil depth the model was set up from 05 april 2018 30 august 2019 until harvesting the crop from 05 april 2018 until 30 april 2019 the model was trained to set initial conditions to run the simulations for the optimization of shps 2 5 goodness of fit different indices of goodness of fit have been calculated root mean square error rmse index of agreement ia and relative root mean square error rrmse were used

irmak et al 2016 liang et al 2016 to compute irrigation thresholds allen et al 1998 leininger et al 2019 the thresholds at 35 swd can be determined using the following equations 12 h swd θ s θ r θ swd θ r 1 m 1 1 n α 13 θ swd θ fc sdw θ fc θ pwp 14 i swd θ fc θ swd z where h swd is irrigation threshold value as h at 35 swd l θ swd is soil water content at 35 swd l3 l 3 θ fc is soil water content at field capacity l3 l 3 θ pwp is soil water content at permanent wilting point l3 l 3 i swd irrigation amount or depth l z is thickness of soil layer l field capacity at 33 kpa and permanent wilting point at 1500 kpa were used to determine irrigation thresholds and schedule irrigation in this study the precipitation was the only water input variable that was kept in the model we defined these models as no irrigation models ni the trigger irrigation module within the hydrus 1d model was selected to schedule the irrigations using the determined irrigation thresholds and amounts at 35 swd with zone specific optimized shps the irrigation scheduling was performed using the observation nodes at 15 cm node 1 30 cm node 2 and 60 cm node 3 as the hypothetical depth of an installed sensor at each observation node multiple irrigation scenarios were created in each zone as summarized in table 2 we triggered the irrigations on the same day without delay 0lag after one day 1lag after two days 2lag after three days 3lag after four days 4lag and after five days 5lag when irrigation threshold reached table 2 the idea of different irrigation scheduling was to bring the models of irrigation scenarios to the reference model status and reduce water stress or meet potential water requirements ramos et al 2009 2 7 actual root water uptake and irrigation water for various irrigation scenarios we examined actual root water uptake arwu and irrigation applied by different scenarios zheng et al 2017 zhou and zhao 2019 the hydrus 1d model tries to meet every day potential root water uptake prwu and if the water is not available stress function reduces it to arwu the ratios of arwu and prwu for various scenarios were calculated to estimate the water stress in both zones a value close to one shows no water stress in the crop and a value close to zero indicates severe water stress in the crops ramos et al 2009 and inefficient irrigation increasing arwu helps increase crop yield and loss in arwu results in yield reduction ramos et al 2011 3 results and discussion 3 1 inverse hydrus 1d model performance for optimizing shps a single porosity model characterized the shps to satisfy the relation for both zones using hyprop fit software mualem 1976 van genuchten 1980 the shps in zone 1 and zone 2 obtained from hyprop fit software using the data collected from hyprop measurement system are shown in fig 3 and these shps were raw shps these raw shps were used as input parameters in the inverse hydrus 1d model to start the simulations for optimizing zone specific shps the raw shps showed the spatial variability between zone 1 and zone 2 fig 3 both zones had distinct patterns of shps which means invariable shps cannot be assumed throughout the field for irrigation management it was inferred from the raw shps that considering uniform shps within the field can be a flawed irrigation strategy due to zone specific variability assuming uniform shps will trigger irrigation at one threshold and one rate in the entire field which can result in over irrigation in some parts and under irrigation in others it was also implied from these raw shps that we need to consider spatial variability between the zones for better irrigation management and adopt zone specific shps the raw shps did not consider the soil water dynamics within the soil profiles to address the significance of the observed h in each zone and ignored the soil water movement for determining the effective irrigation thresholds although raw shps showed the importance of zone specific shps between the zones the raw shps were not able to simulate field observations of h measured during the growing season this reason signified the need for optimizing zone specific shps to simulate the soil water dynamics in each zone using field observations inverse solution using measured h indicated the importance and need for optimizing the zone specific shps fig 3 in precision agriculture for zone specific irrigation improvements across the field to conserve agricultural water and for the adoption of vri technology the optimized shps obtained using inverse hydrus 1d modeling were different from raw shps obtained from hyprop fit software in the lab using the inverse solution in each zone we found more effective zone specific shps fig 3 which simulated soil water dynamics with good agreement in both zones table 3 the simulated pf values fitted well with measured pf values for all the soil depths using optimized shps in both zones as shown in figs 4 and 5 the hydrus 1d model described relatively well the observed data in all three soil layers in both zones using a single layer zone specific optimized shps the variability in soil water dynamics were due to the attributes considered in delineating management zones for example topographic attributes and soil texture at the beginning of simulations the gap between measured and simulated data can be due to the stabilization issues associated with the watermark sensors in the crop fields irmak et al 2016 according to model testing at multiple locations in zone 1 the model performed best at a 15 30 cm soil depth with the best agreement and minimum error between observed and simulated data followed by 0 15 cm and 30 60 cm table 3 however in zone 2 the observed and simulated data had the best agreement at 0 15 cm with the lowest error among all soil depths in comparison between the two zones zone 1 performed better than zone 2 since the statistical indices were better in zone 1 the variation in the model performances in both zones was due to differences in the shps fig 3 differences in the topographic attributes low slope and high twi in zone 1 and high slope and low twi in zone 2 and differences in root water uptake fig 6 which affected the soil water dynamics in both zones figs 4 and 5 it can also be noticed from the recorded plant height and lai values which were greater in zone 1 and lower in zone 2 the one layer optimized hydrus 1d model is a simplified version using single layer shps of the complex system which can be used to simulate soil water dynamics at all three different layers figs 4 and 5 however comparing previous studies for hydrus 1d model performance using multilayer shps li et al 2014 conducted a study in an irrigated rice field in china and the minimum average rmse achieved was 2 61 cm using the individual retention curves for each layer from 0 to 100 cm at 20 cm increment depth obtained from retention curves retc computer program wyatt et al 2017 reported an rmse ranged from 2 95 to 3 53 as pf higher in deep soil layer in a study to estimate groundwater recharge at four different sites in oklahoma using the hydrus 1d model however these studies did not take all parameters of swrc and hcc θ r θ s α n k s l into account to find optimized shps some underpredictions and over predictions of simulated data compared with observed data during the simulation period can be associated with soil water retention behavior of the fine textured soil iqbal et al 2020 hysteresis effect zhou and zhao 2019 and measurements errors associated with the sensors li et al 2014 mokari et al 2019 mokari et al 2019 reported an ia that varied from 0 44 to 0 73 discrepancies between observed and simulated data in the zones due to lateral leakage and macro pores have also been reported in previous studies akay et al 2008 wang et al 2011 zhang et al 2018 based on the statistics to evaluate the goodness of fit the model performance was evaluated as excellent to optimize zone specific shps since our results were quite consistent and better than previous studies li et al 2014 mokari et al 2019 wyatt et al 2017 using a single layer shps fig 6 shows the actual and potential rwu in both zones simulated using the optimized hydrus 1d model during the growing seasons of corn during the seed germination stage rwu was almost zero and increased with growing stages the different patterns of rwu can be noticed in the 2018 and 2019 growing seasons in both zones the actual rwu gradually increased and reached a maximum of 0 69 cm day in zone 1 and 0 59 cm day in zone 2 around the 86th day after planting in 2018 and 0 82 cm day in zone 1 and 0 70 cm day in zone 2 around the 80th day after planting in the 2019 growing season the variability in rwu in zone 1 and zone 2 was due to differences in shps obtained after optimization for example the slow movement of water in zone 2 compared with zone 1 additionally the terrain properties of both zones indicated the low slope and high twi in zone 1 and high slope and low twi in zone 2 a higher twi created the water accumulation conditions in zone 1 and a higher slope led to sub surface lateral flow in zone 2 which affected the rwu variability in both zones along with the differences in shps kumar 2022a the variability in rwu between two zones affected the crop characteristics as a greater plant height and lai in zone 1 than in zone 2 the rwu results are consistent with previous studies iqbal et al 2020 zhou and zhao 2019 the maximum rwu increased in both zones from 2018 to 2019 growing seasons the rwu increased from 2018 to 2019 due to increased precipitation and increased irrigation in the field during the growing seasons the zone 1 had silty clay loam texture in the soil profile however zone 2 had clay texture the clay texture has maximum water holding capacity and minimum water releasing property çakir and cangir 2021 on the other hand silt type soils have slightly less water holding capacity than clay but have greater water releasing property than clay soils çakir and cangir 2019 2021 çakir and cangir 2021 found the similar results with variable clay contents in the soils in turkey also plant available water field capacity permanent wilting point in the soil profile of zone 1 was 1 6 times greater than zone 2 therefore the arwu was greater in zone 1 than zone 2 in both seasons this variation of rwu in both zones and the differences in zone specific shps had impact on plant characteristics for example the maximum measured average lai was 4 13 cm2 cm 2 and 3 34 cm2 cm 2 in zone 1 and zone 2 respectively on the 92nd day after planting during the 2019 growing season on the same day of lai measurements the plant height was 225 cm and 195 cm in zone 1 and zone 2 respectively these field measurements for plant characteristics explain the zone specific differences in root water uptake and root water uptake is controlled by zone specific shps similar observations have been found in previous studies aggarwal et al 2017 wang et al 2016 3 2 determination of irrigation thresholds and amounts the accurate determination of an irrigation threshold and amount is critical for triggering zone specific irrigation in crop fields table 4 summarized the irrigation thresholds and amounts determined using zone specific optimized shps the irrigation thresholds were optimized to 76 kpa from a raw value of 102 kpa in zone 1 and 59 kpa from 69 kpa in zone 2 the corresponding irrigation amounts were optimized to 2 18 cm in zone 1 and 1 48 cm in zone 2 optimizing zone specific shps optimized the thresholds to trigger irrigation and reduced the irrigation amount to 2 18 cm in zone 1 and 1 48 cm in zone 2 table 4 among a very few studies that report irrigation thresholds irmak et al 2016 suggested a range of irrigation thresholds from 90 kpa to 110 kpa for silt loam to silty clay loam soils in nebraska however the range was not estimated using optimized shps in field conditions and therefore did not hold site specific physical and hydraulic characteristics generally farmers apply irrigation uniformly based on the feel of the soil or looking at the crop during the growing season kumar et al 2021b delineating the irrigation management zones and adopting zone specific irrigation strategies can help avoid water stress and water excess in the crop field irrigation threshold determined using raw shps can mislead the time and amount to trigger the irrigation since it did not simulate soil water dynamics within the zones optimizing the irrigation thresholds to trigger irrigation can help consider effective irrigation rate time and amount during the growing season 3 3 irrigation scheduling and actual root water uptake with different irrigation scenarios the zone specific determined thresholds and amounts using optimized shps were adopted in the hydrus 1d model to develop scenarios of irrigation scheduling among all different irrigation scenarios scenarios with 0lag 1lag 2lag 3lag 4lag and 5lag using the top node 15 cm and center node 30 cm in zone 1 reduced the water stress conditions and achieved an arwu prwu ratio greater or equivalent to the reference scenario fig 7 for both 2018 and 2019 growing seasons the actual irrigations applied in the field were 6 6 cm in 2018 and 8 76 cm in 2019 which were input in the reference model the reference model had the arwu prwu ratios of 0 8 in 2018 and 0 9 in 2019 fig 7 among all the scenarios the maximum irrigation amount applied was 21 8 cm in 2018 and 19 62 in 2019 with 0lag and 1lag using the top node and achieved an arwu prwu ratio greater than 0 97 in both seasons however the minimum irrigation applied was 10 9 cm in 2018 with 5lag and 6 54 cm in 2019 with 0lag 1lag 2lag and 3lag using the bottom node supplementary fig s1 and achieved a minimum arwu prwu ratio of 0 83 in both seasons the distribution of precipitation over the growing seasons is the most critical component to decide the irrigation filho et al 2020 based on total precipitation distribution over the growing seasons the maximum precipitation occurred in the beginning and near the end of growing seasons fig 1 therefore looking at the actual irrigation data applied in the field 71 of actual irrigations were triggered during july 2018 and 100 in may june 2019 the reference model had arwu prwu ratios of 0 7 in july 2018 and 0 8 in may june 2019 out of total irrigations applied by the top and center nodes more than 61 was triggered in july 2018 and more than 75 was triggered in may june 2019 if no irrigation was applied during these periods the crop was water stressed with an awru prwu ratio of 0 44 in july 2018 and 0 68 in may june 2019 due to lack of precipitation in this period fig 1 as an ideal case to adopt an irrigation scenario the top and center nodes with 5lag improved the rwu in plants and performed better than the reference model in 2018 and equivalent to reference model in 2019 in zone 1 the impact of lack of precipitation over the growing seasons and the need for irrigation can be understood with an example of the top node with 5lag irrigation scenario the top node with 5lag scenario applied 15 26 cm and 13 08 cm as total irrigation in 2018 and 2019 growing seasons respectively supplementary fig s1 which was 8 6 cm and 4 26 cm of excess irrigation in 2018 and 2019 respectively applying this excess irrigation water increased the rwu and improved arwu prwu ratio out of 15 26 cm and 13 08 cm of irrigation water 8 72 cm was applied in july 2018 and in may june 2019 it was found that excess irrigation 8 6 cm in 2018 and 4 26 cm in 2019 contributed to the these periods of less precipitation in both growing seasons applying this excess irrigation water improved the arwu prwu ratio in the water stress months july 2018 and may june 2019 and entire growing season fig 7 the top and center nodes in zone 1 can perform well to monitor h and to trigger irrigation with any lag scenario using hydrus 1d irrigation scenarios using the bottom node which was at the 60 cm in zone 1 increased the arwu and improved arwu prwu ratio fig 7 for all irrigation scenarios compared with the reference model in 2018 however the bottom node achieved a minimum arwu prwu ratio of 0 83 in 2019 fig 7 the bottom node triggered minimum irrigation in both growing seasons supplementary fig s1 since soil water pressure did not reach irrigation thresholds frequently using the bottom node to trigger irrigation greater than 60 of the irrigation amount was applied in july and more than 67 was applied may june of 2019 in all the irrigation scenarios using top center and bottom nodes rwu was mostly affected in the middle of growing seasons where minimum precipitation occurred this middle period of growing seasons was critical for the plants which need maximum water uptake for plant growth and better yield production a similar effect of precipitation distribution and the need for irrigation were found by filho et al 2020 in alabama and irmak et al 2012 in nebraska also the excess irrigation occurred during the water stress period of growing season july 2018 and may june 2019 which increased the arwu and consequently awru prwu ratios although farmers trigger irrigation based on the feel of the soil and looking at the crop they end up with over irrigation in some areas and under irrigation in others it will be wise to adopt an irrigation strategy and install the sensors at 15 cm or 30 cm in zone 1 since these depths showed an increased arwu prwu ratio than the reference scenario in zone 2 the top node in 2018 and 2019 except 4lag and 5lag in 2019 and center node in 2018 increased the arwu reduced the water stress and produced a greater arwu prwu ratio fig 8 as compared with the reference model for all irrigation scenarios in zone 2 the center node in zone 2 increased arwu and achieved an arwu prwu ratio greater or equivalent to the reference model fig 8 for all scenarios of 2018 but not in 2019 these models showed improved rwu and reduced the water stress conditions in plants in 2018 growing season the minimum value of arwu prwu ratio using center node to trigger irrigation was 0 86 in 2019 for 3lag 4lag and 5lag scenarios however the bottom node did not practice irrigation in 2019 and triggered less irrigation than the reference scenario in 2018 except 0lag and 1lag supplementary fig s2 the bottom node did not improve the rwu and produced the arwu prwu ratio equivalent to the ni model in both growing seasons fig 8 it was inferred that the bottom node 60 cm cannot be used to monitor h and cannot be used to trigger the irrigation in zone 2 as an ideal case to adopt an irrigation scenario in zone 2 the top node with 1lag and 2lag improved the rwu in both seasons and performed better than the reference model these scenarios improved the arwu prwu ratio to 0 96 in 2018 and 0 94 in 2019 supplementary fig s2 and reduced the water stress in the crop irrigation scenario using top node with 3lag had better arwu prwu ratio in 2018 and equivalent ratio in 2019 compared with the reference scenario the maximum applied irrigation was 13 32 cm with the center node supplementary fig s2 using the 0lag and 1lag scenario in 2018 however minimum irrigation was 0 cm using the bottom node supplementary fig s2 similar to zone 1 most of the irrigations in zone 2 were triggered in july 2018 and in may june 2019 due to the lack of precipitation over the growing seasons fig 1 irrigation scenarios using the top and center nodes triggered greater than 73 of the total irrigation in july 2018 and greater than 72 in may june 2019 without irrigation ni scenarios had the arwu prwu ratio of 0 58 and 0 76 in july 2018 and in may june 2019 respectively similar to the bottom node scenarios which showed the water stress and lack of water in zone 2 for example the top node with the 4lag scenario applied 11 84 cm as the total irrigation in both growing seasons supplementary fig s2 which was 5 24 cm and 3 08 cm of excess irrigation in 2018 and 2019 respectively as compared with reference scenario the applied excess irrigation increased the rwu and improved the arwu prwu ratio out of 11 84 cm of irrigation water 7 4 cm was applied in july 2018 and 8 88 cm in may june 2019 it was found that excess irrigation 5 24 cm in 2018 and 3 08 cm in 2019 contributed to these periods of less precipitation in both growing seasons irrigation scheduling using the top node performed better or equivalent to the reference model for various irrigation scenarios during the growing seasons in zone 2 therefore farmers can adopt an irrigation strategy in zone 2 by installing sensors at 15 cm soil depth to avoid water excess or severe water stress conditions during the growing season the model can achieve maximum rwu and reduce the water stress in both seasons also assuming one irrigation threshold or using laboratory drawn shps for the entire field can be a flawed irrigation management practice optimizing zone specific shps can avoid discrepancies in field observation and result in better irrigation practice our results showed that each zone should be managed differently to improve water use and root water uptake the results showed that optimizing irrigation thresholds can reduce the irrigation amount to be applied and simultaneously can increase the arwu prwu ratio however if the calculated irrigation depth in any zones is greater than the irrigation system capacity or the application rate exceeds the infiltration rate the irrigation depth needs to be reduced while the frequency to irrigate should increase reduction in irrigation depth and increased frequency can simultaneously be achieved by adopting a lower threshold of swd reducing the irrigation depth will provide more freedom to the plant for water uptake and increase the arwu prwu ratio during the growing season the lack of irrigation and water stress causes yield loss at any stage of the crop during the growing season çakir 2004 song et al 2019 therefore meeting water demands by plants using zone specific irrigation practices within a field can reduce the water stress and improve the crop yield during the growing season increasing the actual to potential root water uptake ratio can potentially result in increasing crop yield ramos et al 2009 2011 the advantage of this proposed method is that we can optimize the irrigation thresholds using the modeling approach and data collected in each zone since irrigation thresholds are critical in sensor based irrigation and depend on the accurate determination of shps it is important to consider the soil water dynamics within the zones rather than using raw shps the disadvantage of this method is that we need the field measurements of h or θ to optimize the shps and to determining the effective irrigation thresholds the results obtained in this study can be helpful with the implication to the crop yield models dssat with different crop yield scenarios also the determined irrigation recommendations can be used to trigger irrigation and quantifying crop yield the proposed method of optimizing irrigation thresholds can be used for site specific irrigations in the fields and in the modeling studies it is important to know the correct upper limit of water holding capacity i e field capacity in irrigation management especially for site specific irrigations this static field capacity can be a source of error in this study since we assumed a field capacity of 33 kpa in both zones due to fine textured soils this study best represented the site specific irrigation scenarios therefore additional research is needed to validate the suggested irrigation scenarios incorporating crop yield and implications of the irrigation management scenarios investigated in this study also the impact of zone specific measurement of field capacity can be studied to improve the model and irrigation thresholds in future research 4 conclusions the zones had spatial variability in shps along with the differences in soil texture topographic attributes and crop yield the optimized inverse hydrus 1d model showed the impact on the shape and parameters of shps in both zones determination of irrigation thresholds was highly dependent on zone specific characteristics of shps and important for site specific management of irrigation water the determined irrigation thresholds can be used for efficient vri and other irrigation water management based on our simulations in this study using optimized models the irrigation thresholds of around 80 kpa in zone 1 and 60 kpa in zone 2 can arrive at different times or at the same time during the growing season the results showed conservation of irrigation water when using optimized shps compared with laboratory drawn raw shps in both zones to trigger irrigation due to the lack of water available to the plants especially in the middle of the growing season the crop can suffer from severe water stress farmers can improve site specific irrigation practices in both zones considering spatial variability in shps and 15 cm or 30 cm depths in zone 1 and 15 cm in zone 2 can be used as optimal depths to monitor the soil water pressure to trigger the irrigation improving the arwu prwu ratio by scheduling irrigation when needed can increase the crop yield by meeting the crop water demands on time uniform irrigation or assuming one threshold for irrigation and the use of raw shps within the zones can be flawed irrigation strategies optimizing zone specific shps showed that determining an accurate irrigation threshold in each zone can be effective irrigation practice declaration of competing interest

9284,site specific soil hydraulic properties shps are critical for determining irrigation thresholds and adopting the best irrigation practices in this study we optimized two single layer shps for two management zones namely zone 1 and zone 2 delineated in a crop field using topographic attributes soil texture and historical crop yield to demonstrate the need for zone specific shps the inverse hydrus 1d model was used to optimize a single layer zone specific shps using multilayered observed soil water pressure heads h measured in both zones statistical indices for goodness of fit showed that a single layer shps simulate h during the growing season well the irrigation thresholds and amounts determined using zone specific optimized shps were used to trigger irrigations different irrigation scenarios using 15 cm 30 cm and 60 cm soil depths were developed using the zone specific optimized shps in the hydrus 1d model to meet irrigation water demand and reduce water stress the ratio of actual root water uptake arwu and potential root water uptake prwu were calculated to compare improvements in satisfying daily water demand and to reduce the water stress under different irrigation scenarios out of the total irrigation water triggered during growing seasons greater than 61 and 75 in zone 1 was triggered in july 2018 and in may june 2019 respectively however greater than 73 in july 2018 and greater than 72 in may june 2019 were triggered in zone 2 based on the simulations of various irrigation scenarios in hydrus 1d we found that installing sensors at 15 cm or 30 cm can help meet the daily irrigation water demand on time than sensors at 60 cm depth this study discussed the importance of critical water demands due to the distribution of precipitation over the

and climate change are expected to increase freshwater demands fao 2016 maja and ayano 2021 furthermore at the same time more than 40 of the earth s population is already experiencing water scarcity problems kummu et al 2016 approximately 70 of available freshwater withdrawal is for meeting irrigation needs in agricultural production to meet the food demands thus any improvements in the current irrigation practices can help conserve limited water resources and promote sustainable agriculture himanshu et al 2021 fao 2016 depending on climate conditions irrigation water demands vary greatly from arid to humid climate regions o shaughnessy et al 2018 rolle et al 2021 in humid climate regions irrigation is needed due to non uniform rainfall distribution sangha et al 2020 distribution of precipitation over the growing season filho et al 2020 and soil moisture variation within a crop field during a growing season kumar et al 2021b within field soil moisture variation can be due to the variability in soil properties vegetation and topographic gradients fontanet et al 2020 kumar et al 2021b which affects the irrigation rate time and depth during the crop growing period since uniform irrigation does not account for within field variability in soil moisture and applies fixed irrigation amounts over the field it can result in over and under application of water in different parts of a field the water is expensive and limited irrigation needs to be optimized for applying the right amount at the right place and at the right time because of this although currently uniform irrigation is the most common practice kumar et al 2021b farmers are increasingly adopting modern irrigation practices lena et al 2020 for example variable rate irrigation vri based on management zones within a crop field to adopt vri as the best irrigation practice different management zones can be delineated within a field based on variations in crop yield soil type and topography kumar et al 2021a which has the potential to conserve water by meeting zone specific crop water demands liakos et al 2017 lowrance et al 2016 a vri technology can trigger irrigations at zone specific irrigation thresholds depending on plant available water within specific zones which helps to increase irrigation water use efficiency reduce leaching and runoff reduce water stress maximize crop yield and profitability and reduce pressure on freshwater resources evans and sadler 2008 stone et al 2019 yost et al 2019 sui and yan 2017 found increased yield using with vri than uniform irrigation in a humid climate however precise irrigation to meet zone specific crop water demand requires continuous monitoring of soil water dynamics within the zones fontanet et al 2020 reyes et al 2019 in the past ten years sensor based irrigation method has received a lot of attention since this approach provides real time soil water status as soil water content θ or soil water pressure h which can be used for uniform irrigation and vri sensor locations are selected based on variabilities soil topography yield etc in the field detailed information about sensor placement can be found in irmak et al 2012 monitoring soil water dynamics in real time not only improves irrigation timing and depth irmak et al 2010 it also permits adequate water distribution using the vri technique o shaughnessy et al 2018 sharma and irmak 2020 to reduce crop water stress and potential crop yield losses predefined soil water depletion swd methods have been used by irrigation experts to determine irrigation thresholds using h or θ gu et al 2020 where irrigation threshold amount and time are determined by maximum allowable swd in each management zone allen et al 1998 irmak 2016 sui and yan 2017 in sensor based irrigation soil water dynamics in the soil profiles can be explained using knowledge on the soil hydraulic properties shps i e the soil water retention curve swrc and the hydraulic conductivity curve hcc soil hydraulic properties are required to understand root water uptake šimůnek and hopmans 2009 and to determine irrigation thresholds gu et al 2020 wang et al 2017 assuming one swrc and hcc throughout the field does not account for zone specific soil water dynamics and zone specific characteristics in a crop field unfortunately determination of both swrc and hcc and use of them to determine irrigation thresholds is rarely applied in irrigation applications even when these relationships are applied for determining irrigation thresholds investigations that optimize zone specific shps swrc and hcc and quantify their effect on irrigation threshold determination have not been conducted lena et al 2022 previous studies such as leininger et al 2019 recommended a 50 kpa as irrigation threshold for very fine sandy loam textured soil in mississippi and irmak et al 2016 recommended a range from 20 kpa to 25 kpa for fine sandy textured soils and a range from 90 kpa to 110 kpa for silt loam and silty clay loam textured soils in nebraska however these studies used shps based on either laboratory determinations raw using undisturbed soil cores lena et al 2022 or estimated based on soil texture and pedotransfer functions using particle size fractions iqbal et al 2020 these shps were not optimized for observed h or θ in actual field conditions to determine irrigation thresholds also these studies did not consider significance of hcc which is responsible to determine dynamic behavior of soil water movement irrigation scheduling using non optimized shps does not account for the discrepancies between field observations of h or θ such discrepancies can also result in the determination of irrigation thresholds and amounts evett et al 2019 previous studies irmak et al 2016 leininger et al 2019 lena et al 2022 did not consider soil water dynamics in determining the irrigation thresholds the shps obtained based on laboratory experiment lena et al 2022 or soil texture iqbal et al 2020 can show spatial variability in irrigation thresholds these are raw shps and these raw shps do not capture soil water dynamics in field conditions accurately the impact of evaluating optimized shps considering soil water dynamics on determining irrigation thresholds has never been studied which can address the spatial variability in soil water dynamics in field conditions and can result in effective irrigation thresholds in this study we evaluated the impact of raw and optimized shps on determining irrigation thresholds in a delineated field and presented a novel approach of optimizing the zone specific irrigation thresholds this study investigated the difference between uniform irrigation and zone specific irrigation that accounts for zone specific shps both swrc and hcc in a farmer s field we hypothesized that zone specific irrigation thresholds and amounts greatly vary with optimized shps in each zone since field measurements are practically onerous time consuming and include uncertainty in the measurements it makes sense to establish a modeling setup to optimize effective shps for zone specific characterization for more accurate irrigation and agricultural water management therefore for this investigation we selected two different management zones of an irrigated cornfield for each management zone we optimized the shps using measured h with inverse hydrus 1d modeling coupled with the shuffled complex evolution sce ua algorithm based on the optimized model we compared the currently applied irrigation uniform application with many different scenarios to schedule irrigation 2 material and methods 2 1 study area description this research was carried out in a cornfield belonging to a farmer located 34 43 06 46 n and 87 23 13 53 w in the town creek watershed in the tennessee valley region of north alabama usa the study region is classified as subtropical humid cfa köppen climate classification kottek et al 2006 with average annual precipitation of about 140 cm the growing season usually occurs from april to october kumar et al 2021b and distribution of total monthly precipitation over the 2018 and 2019 growing season is shown in fig 1 the annual average precipitation 1951 2017 over the growing period of april to august was 57 cm and the total rainfall received during this period of the 2018 and 2019 growing seasons was 61 cm and 60 cm respectively also a recent study in the southeast usa showed a 14 increment in the annual average of precipitation by 2059 which would alter the time erosivity characteristics and distribution of the precipitation events takhellambam et al 2021 2022 the distribution of precipitation is very important over the growing season and has an impact on irrigation frequency and consequently on crop water demand therefore if the precipitation is received during a high water demand period irrigation amount and frequency will be decreased and if the precipitation is received at the beginning or near the end of the growing season it does not have much impact on irrigation it can be observed that some of the months during the growing seasons have received minimum precipitation in 2018 and 2019 for example july in 2018 and may june in 2019 received the least precipitation over the growing season also during the high water demand period from mid may to mid june 2019 the total precipitation received was only 3 cm although crops might receive enough precipitation at the end of the growing season the time of precipitation is critical to reducing the crop water stress therefore it is important to plan irrigation according to the crop water demand the study field of 120 ha was equipped with a remotely controlled 625 m long reinke center pivot irrigation system reinke manufacturing co inc deshler ne usa with a mid elevation spray application mesa sprinklers fitted with pressure regulators the uniformity testing of the center pivot irrigation system was performed before the growing season with the catch can test dukes and perry 2006 irmak et al 2011 ortiz et al 2021 readers can follow ortiz et al 2021 for detailed and stepwise procedure irrigation was triggered when there was a deficit of about 2 54 cm as the upper limit of irrigation depth in the root zone compared with field capacity the reason to use 2 54 cm as the upper limit was based on the maximum capacity of the center pivot irrigation system for applying irrigation in the field kumar 2022a kumar et al 2022b the total irrigation amount applied by farmers in the field was 6 6 cm and 8 76 cm in 2018 and 2019 growing seasons respectively corn zea mays l cotton gossypium hirsutum l soybean glycine max l merr and winter wheat triticum aes tivum l are the major crops in the region kumar et al 2021b the field was delineated in three irrigation management zones zone 1 zone 2 and zone 3 however we used zone 1 and zone 2 in this study due to contrasting properties in these zones using the management

historical yield data collected using yield monitors mounted on a harvester and soil texture a similar approach was adopted to delineate the management zones in cornfields of north alabama kumar et al 2022b central alabama filho et al 2020 and south alabama jiménez et al 2020 for soil texture a disturbed soil sampling campaign was conducted from several locations for soil characterization in the study field at three depths 0 15 cm 15 30 cm and 30 60 cm using the hydrometer method bouyoucos 1962 table 1 the slope was generated using terrain elevation data and it varied from 0 to 10 a topographic wetness index twi was also generated beven and kirkby 1979 and twi varied from 5 11 to 18 two contrasting zones namely zone 1 and zone 2 differing in slope soil twi and crop yield were selected for this study table 1 the zone 1 had lower slope greater twi and greater crop yield as compared to zone 2 which had greater slope lower twi and lower crop yield within the field zone 3 had properties between zone 1 and zone 2 and therefore it was not used in the study since about 95 of corn roots are distributed between 0 and 60 cm soil layer zhou and zhao 2019 an array of three

each zone undisturbed soil core was collected using a sampler ring of stainless steel 5 cm in height and 8 cm in diameter the sampler rings were carefully removed by digging out surrounding soils and stored in a container for transportation the sample cores were saturated for 24 h before the soil water retention measurements using the evaporation method with the hyprop measurement system peters et al 2015 peters and durner 2008 hyprop measurements are limited by the cavitation point of the two tensiometers and for this reason water retention curves can be estimated from saturation until around pf 3 the pf is a logarithmic function of absolute h in cm to determine the dry range of swrcs we used a dew point hygrometer wp4c potentiameter meter group pullman wa usa for detailed information about developing shps readers are suggested to follow lena et al 2021 2022 5 pf log 10 h 2 3 2 dynamic field measurements to input meteorological data the surface water flux precipitation and irrigation minimum and maximum temperatures humidity solar radiations and wind speed were collected from the installed weather station irrigations applied by farmer during the 2018 and 2019 growing seasons were recorded in addition to precipitation for water input data in the model the growth stages were recorded for corn to determine the associated crop coefficient during the growing season irmak 2017 the plant heights and leaf area index lai were also recorded in both zones during the field visits the lai was measured using an lai 2200 plant canopy analyzer li cor environmental lincoln ne usa on the 57th 72th 92th and 128th day after planting during the growing season the lai was measured from four different locations within each zone with five replications for each location morata 2020 2 3 3 initial and boundary conditions the initial conditions were defined in terms of h in the model since this study is a field study and the surface layer was subjected to the atmosphere we defined the upper boundary condition bc as atmospheric bc with surface runoff in the hydrus 1d model the lower bc was set to free drainage boundary at 100 cm soil depth indicating no interaction with the groundwater a spatial discretization of 0 5 cm leading to 201 nodes across the entire soil profile and no hysteresis in soil water retention was considered the observed nodes top center and bottom were defined at the same depths of 15 cm 30 cm and 60 cm where watermark sensors were installed in both zones 2 3 4 root water uptake hydrus 1d simulates root water uptake rwu of a crop during the growing season the rwu i e the sink term s in richard s equation was computed using an equation given by feddes et al 1978 6 s α h β z t p where α h is a dimensionless response function of h 0 α h 1 which accounts for rwu stress β z is normalized water uptake distribution l 1 t p is a potential transpiration rate lt 1 water stress causes rwu reduction α h can be explained as 7 α h 0 h h 1 or h h 4 h h 1 h 2 h 1 h 1 h h 2 1 h 2 h h 3 h h 4 h 3 h 4 h 3 h h 4 where h 1 is called anaerobiosis point i e water uptake considered to be zero close to the saturation h h 1 h 4 is pressure head at the wilting point and water uptake is also considered to be zero when h h 4 maximum rwu happens between h 2 and h 3 and it decreases or increases linearly between the pressure heads h 3 and h 4 or h 1 and h 2 respectively fig 2 since 95 of the corn roots are linearly distributed within the 0 60 cm soil profile zhou and zhao 2019 and for this reason we assumed linear root distribution function to a depth of 60 cm the parameters in wesseling 1991 were selected for the root water uptake of corn in both zones 2 4 inverse modeling to optimize zone specific shps hydrus 1d a reference scenario we used inverse modeling to optimize a single layer 0 100 cm effective shps using h measured at three depths 0 15 cm 15 30 cm and 30 60 cm in both zones due to fairly uniform soil layers and textural homogeneity within the soil depths in each zone we used single layer shps we converted h into pf to perform inverse modeling in hydrus 1d the hydrus 1d model was coupled with the sce ua developed by duan et al 1994 to perform optimization of shps diamantopoulos et al 2012 qu et al 2014 an objective function obj was defined for minimization in the sce ua algorithm 8 obj j 1 nn pf j pf j ˆ x 2 where pf j pf 15 cm pf 30 cm pf 60 cm is a vector of daily observations of h as pf values pf j ˆ pf ˆ 15 cm pf ˆ 30 cm pf ˆ 60 cm a vector that contains daily hydrus 1d predictions of h as pf values x

was set up from 05 april 2018 30 august 2019 until harvesting the crop from 05 april 2018 until 30 april 2019 the model was trained to set initial conditions to run the simulations for the optimization of shps 2 5 goodness of fit different indices of goodness of fit have been calculated root mean square error rmse index of agreement ia and relative root mean square error rrmse were used

irmak et al 2016 liang et al 2016 to compute irrigation thresholds allen et al 1998 leininger et al 2019 the thresholds at 35 swd can be determined using the following equations 12 h swd θ s θ r θ swd θ r 1 m 1 1 n α 13 θ swd θ fc sdw θ fc θ pwp 14 i swd θ fc θ swd z where h swd is irrigation threshold value as h at 35 swd l θ swd is soil water content at 35 swd l3 l 3 θ fc is soil water content at field capacity l3 l 3 θ pwp is soil water content at permanent wilting point l3 l 3 i swd irrigation amount or depth l z is thickness of soil layer l field capacity at 33 kpa and permanent wilting point at 1500 kpa were used to determine irrigation thresholds and schedule irrigation in this study the precipitation was the only water input variable that was kept in the model we defined these models as no irrigation models ni the trigger irrigation module within the hydrus 1d model was selected to schedule the irrigations using the determined irrigation thresholds and amounts at 35 swd with zone specific optimized shps the irrigation scheduling was performed using the observation nodes at 15 cm node 1 30 cm node 2 and 60 cm node 3 as the hypothetical depth of an installed sensor at each observation node multiple irrigation scenarios were created in each zone as summarized in table 2 we triggered the irrigations on the same day without delay 0lag after one day 1lag after two days 2lag after three days 3lag after four days 4lag and after five days 5lag when irrigation threshold reached table 2 the idea of different irrigation scheduling was to bring the models of irrigation scenarios to the reference model status and reduce water stress or meet potential water requirements ramos et al 2009 2 7 actual root water uptake and irrigation water for various irrigation scenarios we examined actual root water uptake arwu and irrigation applied by different scenarios zheng et al 2017 zhou and zhao 2019 the hydrus 1d model tries to meet every day potential root water uptake prwu and if the water is not available stress function reduces it to arwu the ratios of arwu and prwu for various scenarios were calculated to estimate the water stress in both zones a value close to one shows no water stress in the crop and a value close to zero indicates severe water stress in the crops ramos et al 2009 and inefficient irrigation increasing arwu helps increase crop yield and loss in arwu results in yield reduction ramos et al 2011 3 results and discussion 3 1 inverse hydrus 1d model performance for optimizing shps a single porosity model characterized the shps to satisfy the relation for both zones using hyprop fit software mualem 1976 van genuchten 1980 the shps in zone 1 and zone 2 obtained from hyprop fit software using the data collected from hyprop measurement system are shown in fig 3 and these shps were raw shps these raw shps were used as input parameters in the inverse hydrus 1d model to start the simulations for optimizing zone specific shps the raw shps showed the spatial variability between zone 1 and zone 2 fig 3 both zones had distinct patterns of shps which means invariable shps cannot be assumed throughout the field for irrigation management it was inferred from the raw shps that considering uniform shps within the field can be a flawed irrigation strategy due to zone specific variability assuming uniform shps will trigger irrigation at one threshold and one rate in the entire field which can result in over irrigation in some parts and under irrigation in others it was also implied from these raw shps that we need to consider spatial variability between the zones for better irrigation management and adopt zone specific shps the raw shps did not consider the soil water dynamics within the soil profiles to address the significance of the observed h in each zone and ignored the soil water movement for determining the effective irrigation thresholds although raw shps showed the importance of zone specific shps between the zones the raw shps were not able to simulate field observations of h measured during the growing season this reason signified the need for optimizing zone specific shps to simulate the soil water dynamics in each zone using field observations inverse solution using measured h indicated the importance and need for optimizing the zone specific shps fig 3 in precision agriculture for zone specific irrigation improvements across the field to conserve agricultural water and for the adoption of vri technology the optimized shps obtained using inverse hydrus 1d modeling were different from raw shps obtained from hyprop fit software in the lab using the inverse solution in each zone we found more effective zone specific shps fig 3 which simulated soil water dynamics with good agreement in both zones table 3 the simulated pf values fitted well with measured pf values for all the soil depths using optimized shps in both zones as shown in figs 4 and 5 the hydrus 1d model described relatively well the observed data in all three soil layers in both zones using a single layer zone specific optimized shps the variability in soil water dynamics were due to the attributes considered in delineating management zones for example topographic attributes and soil texture at the beginning of simulations the gap between measured and simulated data can be due to the stabilization issues associated with the watermark sensors in the crop fields irmak et al 2016 according to model testing at multiple locations in zone 1 the model performed best at a 15 30 cm soil depth with the best agreement and minimum error between observed and simulated data followed by 0 15 cm and 30 60 cm table 3 however in zone 2 the observed and simulated data had the best agreement at 0 15 cm with the lowest error among all soil depths in comparison between the two zones zone 1 performed better than zone 2 since the statistical indices were better in zone 1 the variation in the model performances in both zones was due to differences in the shps fig 3 differences in the topographic attributes low slope and high twi in zone 1 and high slope and low twi in zone 2 and differences in root water uptake fig 6 which affected the soil water dynamics in both zones figs 4 and 5 it can also be noticed from the recorded plant height and lai values which were greater in zone 1 and lower in zone 2 the one layer optimized hydrus 1d model is a simplified version using single layer shps of the complex system which can be used to simulate soil water dynamics at all three different layers figs 4 and 5 however comparing previous studies for hydrus 1d model performance using multilayer shps li et al 2014 conducted a study in an irrigated rice field in china and the minimum average rmse achieved was 2 61 cm using the individual retention curves for each layer from 0 to 100 cm at 20 cm increment depth obtained from retention curves retc computer program wyatt et al 2017 reported an rmse ranged from 2 95 to 3 53 as pf higher in deep soil layer in a study to estimate groundwater recharge at four different sites in oklahoma using the hydrus 1d model however these studies did not take all parameters of swrc and hcc θ r θ s α n k s l into account to find optimized shps some underpredictions and over predictions of simulated data compared with observed data during the simulation period can be associated with soil water retention behavior of the fine textured soil iqbal et al 2020 hysteresis effect zhou and zhao 2019 and measurements errors associated with the sensors li et al 2014 mokari et al 2019 mokari et al 2019 reported an ia that varied from 0 44 to 0 73 discrepancies between observed and simulated data in the zones due to lateral leakage and macro pores have also been reported in previous studies akay et al 2008 wang et al 2011 zhang et al 2018 based on the statistics to evaluate the goodness of fit the model performance was evaluated as excellent to optimize zone specific shps since our results were quite consistent and better than previous studies li et al 2014 mokari et al 2019 wyatt et al 2017 using a single layer shps fig 6 shows the actual and potential rwu in both zones simulated using the optimized hydrus 1d model during the growing seasons of corn during the seed germination stage rwu was almost zero and increased with growing stages the different patterns of rwu can be noticed in the 2018 and 2019 growing seasons in both zones the actual rwu gradually increased and reached a maximum of 0 69 cm day in zone 1 and 0 59 cm day in zone 2 around the 86th day after planting in 2018 and 0 82 cm day in zone 1 and 0 70 cm day in zone 2 around the 80th day after planting in the 2019 growing season the variability in rwu in zone 1 and zone 2 was due to differences in shps obtained after optimization for example the slow movement of water in zone 2 compared with zone 1 additionally the terrain properties of both zones indicated the low slope and high twi in zone 1 and high slope and low twi in zone 2 a higher twi created the water accumulation conditions in zone 1 and a higher slope led to sub surface lateral flow in zone 2 which affected the rwu variability in both zones along with the differences in shps kumar 2022a the variability in rwu between two zones affected the crop characteristics as a greater plant height and lai in zone 1 than in zone 2 the rwu results are consistent with previous studies iqbal et al 2020 zhou and zhao 2019 the maximum rwu increased in both zones from 2018 to 2019 growing seasons the rwu increased from 2018 to 2019 due to increased precipitation and increased irrigation in the field during the growing seasons the zone 1 had silty clay loam texture in the soil profile however zone 2 had clay texture the clay texture has maximum water holding capacity and minimum water releasing property çakir and cangir 2021 on the other hand silt type soils have slightly less water holding capacity than clay but have greater water releasing property than clay soils çakir and cangir 2019 2021 çakir and cangir 2021 found the similar results with variable clay contents in the soils in turkey also plant available water field capacity permanent wilting point in the soil profile of zone 1 was 1 6 times greater than zone 2 therefore the arwu was greater in zone 1 than zone 2 in both seasons this variation of rwu in both zones and the differences in zone specific shps had impact on plant characteristics for example the maximum measured average lai was 4 13 cm2 cm 2 and 3 34 cm2 cm 2 in zone 1 and zone 2 respectively on the 92nd day after planting during the 2019 growing season on the same day of lai measurements the plant height was 225 cm and 195 cm in zone 1 and zone 2 respectively these field measurements for plant characteristics explain the zone specific differences in root water uptake and root water uptake is controlled by zone specific shps similar observations have been found in previous studies aggarwal et al 2017 wang et al 2016 3 2 determination of irrigation thresholds and amounts the accurate determination of an irrigation threshold and amount is critical for triggering zone specific irrigation in crop fields table 4 summarized the irrigation thresholds and amounts determined using zone specific optimized shps the irrigation thresholds were optimized to 76 kpa from a raw value of 102 kpa in zone 1 and 59 kpa from 69 kpa in zone 2 the corresponding irrigation amounts were optimized to 2 18 cm in zone 1 and 1 48 cm in zone 2 optimizing zone specific shps optimized the thresholds to trigger irrigation and reduced the irrigation amount to 2 18 cm in zone 1 and 1 48 cm in zone 2 table 4 among a very few studies that report irrigation thresholds irmak et al 2016 suggested a range of irrigation thresholds from 90 kpa to 110 kpa for silt loam to silty clay loam soils in nebraska however the range was not estimated using optimized shps in field conditions and therefore did not hold site specific physical and hydraulic characteristics generally farmers apply irrigation uniformly based on the feel of the soil or looking at the crop during the growing season kumar et al 2021b delineating the irrigation management zones and adopting zone specific irrigation strategies can help avoid water stress and water excess in the crop field irrigation threshold determined using raw shps can mislead the time and amount to trigger the irrigation since it did not simulate soil water dynamics within the zones optimizing the irrigation thresholds to trigger irrigation can help consider effective irrigation rate time and amount during the growing season 3 3 irrigation scheduling and actual root water uptake with different irrigation scenarios the zone specific determined thresholds and amounts using optimized shps were adopted in the hydrus 1d model to develop scenarios of irrigation scheduling among all different irrigation scenarios scenarios with 0lag 1lag 2lag 3lag 4lag and 5lag using the top node 15 cm and center node 30 cm in zone 1 reduced the water stress conditions and achieved an arwu prwu ratio greater or equivalent to the reference scenario fig 7 for both 2018 and 2019 growing seasons the actual irrigations applied in the field were 6 6 cm in 2018 and 8 76 cm in 2019 which were input in the reference model the reference model had the arwu prwu ratios of 0 8 in 2018 and 0 9 in 2019 fig 7 among all the scenarios the maximum irrigation amount applied was 21 8 cm in 2018 and 19 62 in 2019 with 0lag and 1lag using the top node and achieved an arwu prwu ratio greater than 0 97 in both seasons however the minimum irrigation applied was 10 9 cm in 2018 with 5lag and 6 54 cm in 2019 with 0lag 1lag 2lag and 3lag using the bottom node supplementary fig s1 and achieved a minimum arwu prwu ratio of 0 83 in both seasons the distribution of precipitation over the growing seasons is the most critical component to decide the irrigation filho et al 2020 based on total precipitation distribution over the growing seasons the maximum precipitation occurred in the beginning and near the end of growing seasons fig 1 therefore looking at the actual irrigation data applied in the field 71 of actual irrigations were triggered during july 2018 and 100 in may june 2019 the reference model had arwu prwu ratios of 0 7 in july 2018 and 0 8 in may june 2019 out of total irrigations applied by the top and center nodes more than 61 was triggered in july 2018 and more than 75 was triggered in may june 2019 if no irrigation was applied during these periods the crop was water stressed with an awru prwu ratio of 0 44 in july 2018 and 0 68 in may june 2019 due to lack of precipitation in this period fig 1 as an ideal case to adopt an irrigation scenario the top and center nodes with 5lag improved the rwu in plants and performed better than the reference model in 2018 and equivalent to reference model in 2019 in zone 1 the impact of lack of precipitation over the growing seasons and the need for irrigation can be understood with an example of the top node with 5lag irrigation scenario the top node with 5lag scenario applied 15 26 cm and 13 08 cm as total irrigation in 2018 and 2019 growing seasons respectively supplementary fig s1 which was 8 6 cm and 4 26 cm of excess irrigation in 2018 and 2019 respectively applying this excess irrigation water increased the rwu and improved arwu prwu ratio out of 15 26 cm and 13 08 cm of irrigation water 8 72 cm was applied in july 2018 and in may june 2019 it was found that excess irrigation 8 6 cm in 2018 and 4 26 cm in 2019 contributed to the these periods of less precipitation in both growing seasons applying this excess irrigation water improved the arwu prwu ratio in the water stress months july 2018 and may june 2019 and entire growing season fig 7 the top and center nodes in zone 1 can perform well to monitor h and to trigger irrigation with any lag scenario using hydrus 1d irrigation scenarios using the bottom node which was at the 60 cm in zone 1 increased the arwu and improved arwu prwu ratio fig 7 for all irrigation scenarios compared with the reference model in 2018 however the bottom node achieved a minimum arwu prwu ratio of 0 83 in 2019 fig 7 the bottom node triggered minimum irrigation in both growing seasons supplementary fig s1 since soil water pressure did not reach irrigation thresholds frequently using the bottom node to trigger irrigation greater than 60 of the irrigation amount was applied in july and more than 67 was applied may june of 2019 in all the irrigation scenarios using top center and bottom nodes rwu was mostly affected in the middle of growing seasons where minimum precipitation occurred this middle period of growing seasons was critical for the plants which need maximum water uptake for plant growth and better yield production a similar effect of precipitation distribution and the need for irrigation were found by filho et al 2020 in alabama and irmak et al 2012 in nebraska also the excess irrigation occurred during the water stress period of growing season july 2018 and may june 2019 which increased the arwu and consequently awru prwu ratios although farmers trigger irrigation based on the feel of the soil and looking at the crop they end up with over irrigation in some areas and under irrigation in others it will be wise to adopt an irrigation strategy and install the sensors at 15 cm or 30 cm in zone 1 since these depths showed an increased arwu prwu ratio than the reference scenario in zone 2 the top node in 2018 and 2019 except 4lag and 5lag in 2019 and center node in 2018 increased the arwu reduced the water stress and produced a greater arwu prwu ratio fig 8 as compared with the reference model for all irrigation scenarios in zone 2 the center node in zone 2 increased arwu and achieved an arwu prwu ratio greater or equivalent to the reference model fig 8 for all scenarios of 2018 but not in 2019 these models showed improved rwu and reduced the water stress conditions in plants in 2018 growing season the minimum value of arwu prwu ratio using center node to trigger irrigation was 0 86 in 2019 for 3lag 4lag and 5lag scenarios however the bottom node did not practice irrigation in 2019 and triggered less irrigation than the reference scenario in 2018 except 0lag and 1lag supplementary fig s2 the bottom node did not improve the rwu and produced the arwu prwu ratio equivalent to the ni model in both growing seasons fig 8 it was inferred that the bottom node 60 cm cannot be used to monitor h and cannot be used to trigger the irrigation in zone 2 as an ideal case to adopt an irrigation scenario in zone 2 the top node with 1lag and 2lag improved the rwu in both seasons and performed better than the reference model these scenarios improved the arwu prwu ratio to 0 96 in 2018 and 0 94 in 2019 supplementary fig s2 and reduced the water stress in the crop irrigation scenario using top node with 3lag had better arwu prwu ratio in 2018 and equivalent ratio in 2019 compared with the reference scenario the maximum applied irrigation was 13 32 cm with the center node supplementary fig s2 using the 0lag and 1lag scenario in 2018 however minimum irrigation was 0 cm using the bottom node supplementary fig s2 similar to zone 1 most of the irrigations in zone 2 were triggered in july 2018 and in may june 2019 due to the lack of precipitation over the growing seasons fig 1 irrigation scenarios using the top and center nodes triggered greater than 73 of the total irrigation in july 2018 and greater than 72 in may june 2019 without irrigation ni scenarios had the arwu prwu ratio of 0 58 and 0 76 in july 2018 and in may june 2019 respectively similar to the bottom node scenarios which showed the water stress and lack of water in zone 2 for example the top node with the 4lag scenario applied 11 84 cm as the total irrigation in both growing seasons supplementary fig s2 which was 5 24 cm and 3 08 cm of excess irrigation in 2018 and 2019 respectively as compared with reference scenario the applied excess irrigation increased the rwu and improved the arwu prwu ratio out of 11 84 cm of irrigation water 7 4 cm was applied in july 2018 and 8 88 cm in may june 2019 it was found that excess irrigation 5 24 cm in 2018 and 3 08 cm in 2019 contributed to these periods of less precipitation in both growing seasons irrigation scheduling using the top node performed better or equivalent to the reference model for various irrigation scenarios during the growing seasons in zone 2 therefore farmers can adopt an irrigation strategy in zone 2 by installing sensors at 15 cm soil depth to avoid water excess or severe water stress conditions during the growing season the model can achieve maximum rwu and reduce the water stress in both seasons also assuming one irrigation threshold or using laboratory drawn shps for the entire field can be a flawed irrigation management practice optimizing zone specific shps can avoid discrepancies in field observation and result in better irrigation practice our results showed that each zone should be managed differently to improve water use and root water uptake the results showed that optimizing irrigation thresholds can reduce the irrigation amount to be applied and simultaneously can increase the arwu prwu ratio however if the calculated irrigation depth in any zones is greater than the irrigation system capacity or the application rate exceeds the infiltration rate the irrigation depth needs to be reduced while the frequency to irrigate should increase reduction in irrigation depth and increased frequency can simultaneously be achieved by adopting a lower threshold of swd reducing the irrigation depth will provide more freedom to the plant for water uptake and increase the arwu prwu ratio during the growing season the lack of irrigation and water stress causes yield loss at any stage of the crop during the growing season çakir 2004 song et al 2019 therefore meeting water demands by plants using zone specific irrigation practices within a field can reduce the water stress and improve the crop yield during the growing season increasing the actual to potential root water uptake ratio can potentially result in increasing crop yield ramos et al 2009 2011 the advantage of this proposed method is that we can optimize the irrigation thresholds using the modeling approach and data collected in each zone since irrigation thresholds are critical in sensor based irrigation and depend on the accurate determination of shps it is important to consider the soil water dynamics within the zones rather than using raw shps the disadvantage of this method is that we need the field measurements of h or θ to optimize the shps and to determining the effective irrigation thresholds the results obtained in this study can be helpful with the implication to the crop yield models dssat with different crop yield scenarios also the determined irrigation recommendations can be used to trigger irrigation and quantifying crop yield the proposed method of optimizing irrigation thresholds can be used for site specific irrigations in the fields and in the modeling studies it is important to know the correct upper limit of water holding capacity i e field capacity in irrigation management especially for site specific irrigations this static field capacity can be a source of error in this study since we assumed a field capacity of 33 kpa in both zones due to fine textured soils this study best represented the site specific irrigation scenarios therefore additional research is needed to validate the suggested irrigation scenarios incorporating crop yield and implications of the irrigation management scenarios investigated in this study also the impact of zone specific measurement of field capacity can be studied to improve the model and irrigation thresholds in future research 4 conclusions the zones had spatial variability in shps along with the differences in soil texture topographic attributes and crop yield the optimized inverse hydrus 1d model showed the impact on the shape and parameters of shps in both zones determination of irrigation thresholds was highly dependent on zone specific characteristics of shps and important for site specific management of irrigation water the determined irrigation thresholds can be used for efficient vri and other irrigation water management based on our simulations in this study using optimized models the irrigation thresholds of around 80 kpa in zone 1 and 60 kpa in zone 2 can arrive at different times or at the same time during the growing season the results showed conservation of irrigation water when using optimized shps compared with laboratory drawn raw shps in both zones to trigger irrigation due to the lack of water available to the plants especially in the middle of the growing season the crop can suffer from severe water stress farmers can improve site specific irrigation practices in both zones considering spatial variability in shps and 15 cm or 30 cm depths in zone 1 and 15 cm in zone 2 can be used as optimal depths to monitor the soil water pressure to trigger the irrigation improving the arwu prwu ratio by scheduling irrigation when needed can increase the crop yield by meeting the crop water demands on time uniform irrigation or assuming one threshold for irrigation and the use of raw shps within the zones can be flawed irrigation strategies optimizing zone specific shps showed that determining an accurate irrigation threshold in each zone can be effective irrigation practice declaration of competing interest
