20400,in this study an association rule bayesian networks arbn method is established to investigate the impacts of external factors i e environmental factors and ship factors on human errors the bayesian networks have been structured by mining association rules from historical collision accident records in addition unlike other related studies that have introduced subjective data i e expert knowledge this study tends to build bayesian networks with only objective data i e accident data in order to solve the problem of small sample size during conditional probability table estimating this study constructs an environmental human bayesian network and a ship human bayesian network separately the results reveal that visibility location and time of the day are the main environmental factors affecting the occurrence probability of human errors for more complex scenarios the probability of occurring judgment operation errors in ship collision is 83 under the evidence of spring daytime and sea area among the ship factors gross tonnage ship types and over safe speed show significant effects on occurring human errors large ships are more likely to occur judgment operation errors under the high speed situation from the consequence perspective negligence errors are highly associated with severe collisions keywords human errors ship collisions bayesian network association rules semi data driven small sample 1 introduction with the sustained development of the shipping industry the maritime safety problem has continued to be a matter of concern because of the more complex and higher risk navigating environments caused by the increasing ship density many researchers calimed that collisions defined as a situation where a ship struck or was struck by another ship on the water surface are the most common ship accidents occurring in waters international maritime organization 2002 karahalios 2014 ship collisions usually result in varying degrees of human life loss and property damage costs meanwhile once the collision leads to the oil spill the accident will also cause very serious pollution to the marine environment as deemed by wang and dai 2012 70 80 of ship collisions are related to human errors it is therefore the responsibility of ship owners to implement effective strategies to reduce the occurrence likelihood of human errors which can be achieved by effectively assess the relationship between the external factors and the human errors to date many researchers attempted to improve the successful probability of ship collision avoidance e g qu et al 2011 weng et al 2012 montewka et al 2012 one major focus has been placed on the relationship of collision risk and influencing factors goerlandt 2012 outlined a modular approach to assess ship collision risk ståhlberg 2013 proposed impact scenario models to investigate ship collision risks through a probabilistic risk based design case study in the gulf of finland chai et al 2017 developed a quantitative assessment model to describe the influencing factors related to collision frequency and consequence with the records of ship collisions occurred in hong kong waters wang et al 2020 presented a collision risk assessment framework that combines the estimated ship collision probabilities and consequences many other studies have been conducted to investigate possible human errors in maritime accidents e g nishizaki et al 2012 weng et al 2019 focusing on human and organization factors of maritime accidents human factors analysis and classification system hfacs is a popular choice to describe human impacts on maritime accidents e g chen et al 2013 ugurlu et al 2015 chauvin et al 2013 proposed an improved hfacs to analyze human and organizational factors for different accident types for ship collisions in snow covered waters zhang et al 2019 applied a hfacs sibci model and a fault tree model to identify and classify the collision contributory factors for icebreakers and auxiliary ships however hfacs may be inappropriate for the quantitative impact analysis of human errors during the past decade some other approaches such as the bayesian network e g ung 2019 fan et al 2020 have also been utilized to explore human errors associated with maritime accidents bayesian network has been successfully applied in many intelligent research areas since it was proposed in 1981 hänninen 2012 utilized a bayesian network model to determine the most significant influencing factor for ship collisions zhang et al 2013 incorporated formal safety assessment into bayesian networks to estimate navigational risk of the yangtze river zhang et al 2016 applied machine learning algorithms to develop bn structures and built bayesian network models to verify the correlation between influencing factors and accident consequences in the tianjin port wang et al 2018 analyzed the severity of maritime accidents based on a data driven bayesian network lu et al 2019 proposed a bayesian network risk model for assessing oil spill recovery effectiveness in the ice covered northern baltic sea taking into account the cognitive uncertainty zhang et al 2019 extended the bayesian network with interval probability for the maritime accident modeling dinis et al 2020 utilized a probabilistic approach based on bayesian network to characterize the static risk of ships considering the insufficient vessel collision records available for traditional probabilistic approaches a semi qualitative risk model combined bayesian networks bn and evidential reasoning er approaches was developed by yu et al 2020 to assess the vessel turbine collision risks although the bayesian network has been widely used for the maritime safety analysis there are also some gaps need to be filled in general the conditional probability tables cpt with partially missing scenarios can be supplemented by expert knowledge however this way may lead to significant uncertainties if too much data was lost hänninen 2014 in terms of bn structure modeling some of the studies utilized correlation analysis to build bn structures which can only bring out nondirective relationship between nodes fu et al 2016 the gap of structure modeling can be solved by mining association rules which have been widely used to discover interesting relationships with direction hidden in complex datasets mirabadi and sharifian 2010 montella et al 2012 weng and li 2019 hence the contribution of this study is two fold an association rule based bayesian network arbn is developed to evaluate the occurrence probability of different types of human errors under various scenarios to fully investigate the impact of external factors on human errors with inadequate collision records this study constructed an environmental human bayesian network and a ship human bayesian network separately instead of constructing a comprehensive model the collision consequences caused by different types of human errors were also discussed in this study the results of this study can help shipping companies and maritime authorities to provide specific recommendations for preventing ship collisions caused by human errors 2 methodology bayesian network bn technique is considered as one efficient framework to solve uncertainty problems which has been widely used in intelligent decision making safety assessment pattern recognition etc the traditional bn structure construction normally depends only on subjective content such as logic relationship and expert knowledge which may not take into account the unobserved complex impact between variables on the other hand the full data driven bn structure construction is entirely based on historical accident data without considering the interpretability of the model structure our proposed arbn structure is established according to both objective and subjective content as a semi data driven approach the arbn structure construction process contains the advantages of the two aforementioned ways which is more comprehensive and explainable with historical ship collision data the arbn for human errors can be built by the following process data acquisition bn structure modeling with association rules conditional probability table cpt estimation model validation and model application bn structure modeling and cpt estimating are the two main steps to be described in the following subsections the process of arbn method is summarized in fig 1 2 1 bn structure modeling with association rules in essence the bn structure is a directed acyclic graph dag where the nodes represent random variables and directed arcs imply local conditional dependencies between parent and child nodes jensen and nielsen 2007 modeling a bn structure requires selecting nodes first nodes in dag represent related variables in the system with limited mutually exclusive states the node selection for bn depends on the study purpose which can be determined according to relevant studies and expert knowledge to investigate the mechanism of occurring human errors nodes refer to the crucial elements that may affect the occurrence likelihood of unsafe behaviors of the crew members e g ship factors environmental factors with the certain selected nodes correlation regularity between nodes mining from historical collision data and expert knowledge from previous studies are the mean considerations on connecting nodes with directed arcs some of the studies have been conducted to develop maturing bn structures applicable to ship accidents through expert empirical methods and data analytic methods such as correlation analysis e g mazaheri et al 2016 baksh et al 2017 khan et al 2018 however the correlation analysis commonly used cannot help to determine the direction of the arcs although it can give correlation coefficients between nodes mining association rules is a popular way of discovering directed relationships among variables in databases which may better help to build bn structures for mining association rules let i i 1 i 2 i a and t t 1 t 2 t b be a set of items and a set of transactions respectively each transaction t c contains a subset of the items namely t i an association rule is formed as x y where x y i x y agrawal et al 1993 the itemset x is denoted as the antecedent left hand side lhs while y is called the consequent right hand side rhs of the rule the support supp and the confidence conf are the two measures of significance and interest for association rules the support of an association rule is defined as the proportion of all records that contain x y in the database namely 1 s u p p x t d x t t d the confidence of an association rule is defined as the proportion of all records containing x that contain x y among all records containing namely 2 c o n f x y s u p p x y s u p p x only the rules that satisfied the minimum thresholds of supp and conf are considered lift is another critical indicator to rank and filter the interesting rules which can be calculated as follows 3 l i f t x y s u p p x y s u p p x s u p p y a higher lift normally indicates a stronger association between lhs and rhs x and y in maritime accident data represent itemsets of variables that have impacts on accidents association rules selected by the three measures represent the possible node connection pairs with strong directed correlations it should be noted that it is not necessarily possible or meaningful to construct a fully connected bn for a complex accident representation hänninen 2014 for ensuring the effectiveness of the final bn structure representative variable pairs i e association rules selection can be done according to the expert knowledge from previous studies as seen in fig 1 based on the selected representative rules model structure can thus be constructed according to relative logical relationships and validated by experienced experts therefore the interpretability of our arbn model structure is mainly guaranteed by two aspects which is mining directional variable pairs and connecting these pairs the directional variable pairs excavated from historical accident data by mining association rules can ensure well reflection of the unobserved heterogeneity between variables in the model structure variable pair connection according to logical relationships and expert knowledge can ensure the rationality and explainable of the whole structure 2 2 conditional probability table estimation conditional probability table cpt estimating for bn is based on the bayes theorem which has been proven to be an effective method of propagating occurrence probability information between nodes the process of probability analysis is achieved by combining probability distributions or functions of different nodes e g specific events or properties and updating the probabilities after input new data the bayes theorem can be expressed by the following formula 4 p b a p a b p b p a where p b represents the prior occurrence probability of the hypothesis namely the likelihood that b will be in a particular state prior to considering any other relevant conditional information a p a b is the conditional probability the likelihood of information given the hypothesis to be tested p b a denotes the posterior probability of the hypothesis namely the likelihood of b being in a certain state considering the conditional information a similarly the prior occurrence probability b can be estimated using bayes theorem when conditional information a is a set of a 1 a 2 a j 5 p b a 1 a 2 a j p a 1 a 2 a j b p b p a 1 a 2 a j therefore the bayes rule connects the bn by the use of b and a for instance by assigning the shipping accident consequence to b and influencing factors a 1 a 2 a j the probability of the cause factors are often easier to define given the accident an opposite approach may be adopted to find the probability of occurring human errors given the influencing factors generally the probability of the influencing factor a 1 should be changed to 1 if we already know the existence of the factor namely the evidence the probability of occurring specific type of human errors is then updated likewise if the accident is confirmed the probability of occurring human errors is marked as 1 and the probability of the influencing factor is obtained by updating the bn 2 3 analysis framework for a complex bn structure with too many nodes and directed arcs there may be inadequate maritime accident data for the cpt estimation because each cpt represents multiple scenarios combined by the relative nodes more nodes and directed arcs means more complicated scenarios needed to be considered under the data limited circumstance the inadequate data is called small sample records in this study generally an amount of expert knowledge is needed to fill in the tables this situation brings a huge challenge to the experts because they should fully comprehend ship collision characteristics and mechanisms in the specific water area otherwise this approach could not be carried out without the experts knowledge therefore this study tends to propose a bn analysis procedure based on only objective small sample data without input expert knowledge into the procedure of calculating cpts as shown in fig 2 considering the attribute characteristics of the influencing factors of human errors our case study discusses the impact of environmental factors and ship factors on human errors separately namely an environmental human model and a ship human model based on our proposed arbn method from a perspective of collision consequences a univariate statistical technique is also utilized to construct the relationships between human errors and accident consequences further details can be seen in our case study 3 case study 3 1 data acquisition in this study a total of 506 maritime collision accident records between the years of 2004 and 2014 are obtained from fujian maritime safety administration msa this database recorded detailed information for each collision accident occurred in the southeast water area of china four categories of variables are mainly concerned in this study according to the records which is ship factors environmental factors human factors and collision consequence note that the collision consequence is not considered as one of the bn nodes in this study furthermore in order to fully explore the impact of ship itself on the occurrence likelihood of human errors collisions involving two ships are considered as two independent data samples instead of one record 3 2 bns for human errors 3 2 1 definition of model nodes for bn nodes definition certain discretization should be carried out first to the aforementioned nodes in accordance with the need of cpt estimation as shown in table 1 the final set of nodes in the bn models contain eleven influencing factors that affect ship collision in fujian waters more detailed information with regard to these nodes is listed below a nodes of ship factors four of the eleven factors are taken into account as the nodes of ship factors including navigational status underway moored docked ship type lng lpg cargo ship passenger ship fishing ship engineering ship gross tonnage level 1 level 2 level 3 and over safe speed yes no specifically level 1 refers to the ships with gt less than 500 tons level 2 refers to the ships with gt between 500 tons and 3000 tons while level 3 includes the ships with gt larger than 3000 tons b nodes of environmental factors this type of nodes includes season spring summer autumn and winter time of the day daytime period nighttime period visibility good visibility condition restrict visibility condition and poor visibility condition strong wind wave yes no and accident location sea area port water it should be pointed out that daytime period refers to the time from 08 00 to 20 00 c nodes of human factors six types of exact human errors were recorded in our collected collision accident data including lookout failure underestimate harsh sea state judgment error operation error uncoordinated avoidance and avoidance failure respectively for further analysis human errors that possibly occurred in maritime accidents could be categorized into two groups according to its feature type i human errors for the occurrence of negligence errors and type ii human errors for the occurrence of judgment operation errors rasmussen 1983 weng et al 2019 therefore negligence errors refer to lookout failure and underestimate harsh sea state in this study while judgment error operation error uncoordinated avoidance and the failure of collision avoidance are considered as judgment operation errors namely the nodes of human errors include type i human errors yes no and type ii human errors yes no d consequence the ministry of transport of the people s republic of china has classified the shipping accident consequence into four grades including negligible minor major and catastrophic the classify standard depends on the number of injured or death missing as well as the extent of property and environmental damage caused by the accident the standard division for collision consequence is applied to reflect the relationship between the two human error types and the four severity levels in this study 3 2 2 statistical description of model nodes the statistical distribution for the discretized nodes is presented in fig 3 which can be used to calculate cpts for the bn nodes as shown in fig 3 a the frequency of occurring collision accident is higher in spring and summer which is probably affected by the climate of fujian water area generally the fujian water area has more days of occurring poor visibility in spring while summer is highly associated with strong wind e g typhoon in addition there are more ships collided in nighttime period while there are no significant differences in collision frequencies between port waters and sea area among the historical collision records the majority of accidents happened under good visibility and no strong wind wave conditions which is due to the low frequency of occurring poor visibility or strong wind wave during each year fig 3 b shows that the majority of ships collided during the period of sailing underway which is consistent with the reality it should be pointed out that the most frequent ship type involved in collisions is the cargo ship half of the ships involved in collisions have a gross tonnage of less than 500 tons more importantly over 230 ships involved in collision accidents due to over safe speed in the statistical decade it can be also seen from fig 3 b that the number of collisions leading to major catastrophic consequences still cannot be overlooked as to human errors lookout failure is the most common cause leading to collisions followed by operation error avoidance failure uncoordinated avoidance underestimate harsh sea condition and judgment error as shown in fig 3 c 3 2 3 model structure constructions a series of software packages can be applied to construct bn structures the genie software druzdzel 1999 is used in this study for modeling bn of the ship collisions in the fujian water area the environmental human bn model and ship human bn model are structured according to the results of association rules conducted here as presented in table 1 seven nodes and six nodes are contained in the two bn structures respectively the directed arcs between these nodes are drawn using association rules with lifts above 1 0 expert knowledge and valuable conclusions from related works are also considered to guarantee the rationality of the model structures specifically the apriori algorithm provided by the arules package of the r software is applied to mine association rules based on our collected ship collision data the support and confidence thresholds are set to 0 1 and 0 2 respectively as a result 86 environmental human rules and 50 ship human rules with lifts above 1 0 are generated logical relationships and previous studies on maritime accidents are also inferred to select useful relationships from the obtained association rules e g jin 2014 wang and yang 2018 weng and li 2019 fan et al 2020 part of the selected rules are presented in table 2 importantly some relationships out of the mined association rules are also considered based on the empirical knowledge e g from strong wind wave to type i human errors the final bn structures of the environmental human model and the ship human model are shown in fig 4 3 2 4 cpt estimation a total of 506 collected collision accident records namely 1012 samples are used to determine the probabilities for the nodes specifically 200 of the samples are extracted randomly to be a test dataset each probability of the node is conditional on at least one other node except for the root nodes without parent nodes in bn structures in this case location season time of the day in environmental human bn and navigational status in ship human bn are the root nodes the cpts of the root nodes are filled with marginal probabilities calculated by the corresponding state frequencies from the proposed collision records as shown in table 3 on the basis of the aforementioned calculation method the conditional probabilities for the other nodes i e nodes with parent nodes can be drawn from the proposed collision records directly table 4 and table 5 display the cpts for human error nodes in the two models after calculating the cpts for all the nodes in the bn models the marginal probabilities for the nodes are calculated and shown in fig 5 3 3 model validation 3 3 1 sensitivity analysis as an important aspect of modeling methods the process of model validation can provide reasonable confidence for the produced results in this study a parameter sensitivity analysis psa has been adopted first to validate the performance of the proposed bn models for applying the bn models the human error distributions of corresponding scenarios from evidence can be obtained by updating the conditional probabilities of the corresponding nodes psa can help us to evaluate the extent of output probability variation of child nodes affected by the evidence input of parent nodes suppose h with states h 1 h 1 h m and l with states l 1 l 1 l n are the target node being subjected to sensitivity analysis and the influencing node respectively the probability of the sth state with given evidence ε can be expressed in the form of a linear function shown as follow 6 f x p h h s ε x α s x β s where x is a conditional probability parameter associated with a state l of l α i and β i are real constants representing the slope and the intercept of the linear function respectively the derivative of f x namely α s is treated as the sensitivity value of the sth state of t with respect to state l of l in order to illustrate the overall sensitivity of h the average sensitivity value of node h is calculated as follow 7 s h s 1 m α s m set type i human errors and type ii human errors as the target nodes the results for the maximum absolute sensitivity values for the two bn models can be calculated according to eqs 6 and 7 as shown in tables 6 and 7 from table 6 it is obvious that the locations of the collisions tend to be the most sensitive node for both type i and type ii human errors for type i human errors the sensitivity of other nodes is followed by strong wind wave visibility season and time of the day respectively the sensitivity of other nodes on type ii human errors are followed by time of the day visibility and season respectively table 7 indicates that over safe speed is the most sensitive node for type i human errors while gross tonnage tends to be the most sensitive node for type ii human errors 3 3 2 uncertainty validation for a specific bn model the uncertainty of the model results can be validated by utilizing the strength of evidence aven 2013 generally the validation framework for strength of evidence contains three main aspects data validity judgment validity and model validity aven 2016 goerlandt and reniers 2016 judgment validity mainly used for bn models involved data input from expert knowledge therefore only data validity and model validity are discussed in this subsection data validity consists of data quality validity and data quantity validity maritime accident records collected in this study covered the majority of collisions happened in fujian water area during 2004 2014 which also includes plentiful valuable information with less variable missing problem with limited collision records this study constructs a ship human model and an environmental human model separately to ensure the reliability of cpt estimations the less complicated model structures can guarantee sufficient number of samples for the conditional probability estimation of each scenario model validity mainly consists of theoretical validity and empirical validity since our model building process takes into account both knowledge from given maritime accident data and previous relevant studies the constructed model structures are reasonable and applicable for the fujian water area from the perspective of model results most conclusions can be justified directly or indirectly by previous studies moreover the model results can also be verified by the test dataset which are discussed in the following subsection 3 3 3 scenario validation to confirm the representativeness of our model results we also compare the percentages of human errors from the test dataset with the probabilities estimated by the arbn models four typical scenarios are mainly discussed in this subsection as shown in table 8 for the environmental human model scenario 1 refers to the ship collisions occurred during daytime period in summer at sea waters the percentages of occurred type i human errors and type ii human errors under scenario 1 are 72 2 and 83 3 in test dataset respectively compared with 70 and 82 given by the model results only 2 2 and 1 3 deviations are presented in scenario 1 scenario 2 refers to the ship collisions happened in port water areas under poor visibility conditions the occurred percentages and estimated probabilities under scenario 2 are 62 5 and 69 for type i human error while 31 3 and 40 for type ii human errors it can be seen that the relative relationships between the two human error types of estimated results are basically in accordance with that of occurred percentages according to test dataset for the ship human model scenario 3 refers to the ship collisions involved over speed ships which are less than 500 gt from table 8 it can be also seen that the estimated results are 8 3 and 2 4 higher for type i human errors and type ii human errors respectively in scenario 4 ship collisions involved moored cargo ships with level 2 gt the estimated results are 4 and 1 3 higher for the two human error types in summary the comparison results imply that the estimated probabilities from the proposed model are relatively close to the true situations in the test dataset therefore the arbn approach is considered as an effectively way to depict the regularity of occurring different types of human errors under various scenarios however it should be pointed out that the stability of the proposed method is highly associated with the data volume of the scenario therefore data volume should be another critical consideration in model structure constructions 3 4 impact analysis with evidence input namely changing the probabilities of specific states of nodes to 100 the bn models can help to evaluate probability variations of human errors under different environment or ship conditions this section mainly concerned environmental impact on human errors ship impact on human errors and human errors impact on collision consequence a detailed discussion has been given in the following subsections 3 4 1 environmental impact on human errors fig 6 presents the impact of evidence nodes on the occurrence likelihood of human errors across different human error types in ship collisions from fig 6 a it can be seen that human error probabilities show obvious differentiation situations under different degrees of visibility in our case interestingly restricted visibility brings much higher probabilities of both type i human errors 73 and type ii human errors 75 than the other two visibility levels this result implies that restricted visibility might be the most dangerous situation which can cause the crew members more likely to make mistakes it might because poor visibility will let the crews pay more attention than restricted visibility to deal with the hazardous situation in addition the probability of occurring type i human errors is far higher than that of occurring type ii human errors when a ship sailing under poor visibility conditions as seen in fig 6 a however the relationship is totally the opposite under the good visibility condition consistent with previous studies the high occurrence likelihood of negligence errors under poor visibility is because poor visibility will impact the responding ability of the watch keeper on the bridge and neighboring vessels which may lead them to neglect the potential hazards flohberger 2010 on the other hand judgment operation errors are the more common errors under good visibility conditions similar to the node of visibility fig 6 a also portrays that the node of accident location is also found to have significant effects on the probability of occurring human errors more specifically a ship has a 5 higher probability of occurring negligence errors 71 for type i human errors and a 9 higher probability of occurring judgment operation errors 75 for type ii human errors when setting sea area as evidence compared with the initial probabilities without evidence input on the contrary the occurrence probability is 60 for type i human errors and 58 for type ii human errors this is because the crews are all on standby and normally with pilots on board when a ship sailing in the port waters although port waters have complex hydrological environment the high class of duty on the bridge can significantly reduce the occurrence likelihood of human errors furthermore the occurrence likelihood of type ii human errors is relatively higher than that of type i human errors which is a direct cause leading to ship collisions therefore more attention should be paid when the ships sailing in the open sea which is a critical strategy to improve the navigational safety level consistent with the reality occurring likelihood of human errors is significantly lower when setting strong wind wave as evidence i e 61 for type i human errors and 67 for type ii human errors this result is because the majority of ships are warned to enter safe havens or anchorages prior to strong winds waves which could reduce human errors significantly as evidenced by akhtar and utne 2015 monotonous weather conditions with no strong winds waves can lead to an increased number of human errors because of reducing vigilance in addition the probability of type i human errors drops further to 47 when adding port waters as another evidence while the probability reaches 76 when adding sea area as another evidence the result can be explained by the fact that ships sailing in port waters are more easily to assess sheltered harbors or anchorages after warned by maritime authorities which can help to reduce human errors significantly otherwise ships sailing in open seas can only rely on operation skills of the crew members to ensure navigational safety when they encounter extreme weather therefore it is still necessary to improve the ability of the crews to cope with harsh sea conditions it can be observed from fig 6 a that the occurrence likelihood of type ii human errors is 7 higher during daytime period generally there are fewer watch keepers when ships sailing during daytime period which makes it more difficult for the crews to deal with shipping incidents this reason could increase the probability of occurring judgment operation errors according to the results it is suggested that ships should add more watch keepers during daytime period to prevent ship collisions the probabilities of occurring human errors are similar among different seasons when only consider season factors as evidence input for scenarios with high collision frequencies i e set sea area and daytime as evidence the bn model results show that 83 of collision accidents are caused by type ii human errors in the season of spring while only 70 in winter the possible reason is that spring occurs more extreme weather than winter furthermore cargo transportation demand in fujian water area is normally the highest in spring the heavy workload could cause seafarers to make more mistakes 3 4 2 ship impact on human errors among these ship factors gross tonnage presents the most significant difference in affecting the occurrence likelihood of different types of human errors for instance the probability of occurring judgment operation errors is 79 for ships of more than 3000 gt while that of negligence errors is only 61 as shown in fig 6 b ships of less than 500 gt have a total opposite relationship for the probabilities of the two human error types this regularity can be also seen in the evidence of ship types generally the lookout mission had been taken much more seriously for larger ships than for smaller ships on the other hand the safety awareness of crew members on smaller ships i e fishing ships passenger ships and engineering ships is worse than larger ships i e lng lpgs cargo ships because these seafarers are not compulsory to have a license or other mariner credential furthermore as evidenced by hovdanum et al 2014 more alcohol and fatigue problems had reported for crew members on fishing ships on the contrary crew members on lng lpg have to be more vigilant because these ships normally carry oils or other hazardous liquid goods therefore the lookout mission should be paid more attention to smaller ships to avoid negligence errors more importantly captains of small ships should attach more importance to improve the safety management level of the ships to deal with the high probability of occurring judgment operation errors on larger ships it is necessary to improve the operational skills of the crews fig 6 b also reveals that ship speed may have a great influence on the occurrence likelihood of human errors more specifically the probability of occurring negligence errors is 11 higher than judgment operation errors when ships sailing over safe speed this is because the high speed of ships can significantly reduce the response time of crews which can easily ignore the occurrence of dangerous situations it should be noted that the occurrence likelihood of judgment operation errors can reach 84 when set both over safe speed and gt 3000 as evidence in reality the high speed of large ships increases the difficulties of operating and collision avoidance affected by steerage it is easy to occur avoidance failure in case of incidents that happened due to the poor steerage of larger ships thus the speed of larger ships should be strictly controlled to avoid collisions compared with the underway ships moored docked ships have a slightly higher probability of occurring judgment operation errors which may due to engine delays in handling the emergency 3 4 3 human errors impact on collision consequence the univariate statistical technique ust is one of the popular ways to measure the relationship between two variables to explore the impacts of two human error types on collision consequence we compare the proportion of records involving type i human errors with that involving type ii human errors for different degrees of consequences the relative ratio of different human error types rrhet is proposed to describe the relative effects of human error types on collision consequence the computation of rrhet is expressed as 8 r r h e t p q k n p k n p n q k n q where r r h e t p q k relative ratio between pth type of human errors and qth type of human errors leading to the kth level of collision consequence n is the number of corresponding collision records compared with the qth type of human errors the pth type of human errors is more likely to cause kth level of collisions as r r h e t p q k 1 0 and vice versa fig 7 depicts the rrhet value of the different levels of collision consequence accordingly the subscript p in the numerator indicates type i human errors during calculating the rrhet value as shown in fig 7 the rrhets for catastrophic major and minor collisions are larger than 1 0 especially for major collisions 1 325 conversely the rrhet for negligible is only 0 858 the results indicate that severe collisions are more likely to be associated with type i human errors while non severe collisions are more likely to occur under type ii human errors which is consistent with our previous study results weng et al 2018 according to the relationship between collision severity and human error types one significant conclusion is that maritime authorities and shipping companies should make more efforts to avoid the occurrence of type i human errors combined with the above conclusions we suggested that more crews should be arranged on duty at nighttime period or under low visibility conditions in addition maritime authorities should take measures to enhance safety awareness of crews on small ships especially on fishing ships it is also necessary to strictly supervise the violation of over safe speed to reduce the probability of occurring type i human errors so that may effectively reduce the probability of occurring serious collision accidents 4 conclusions ship collision is one of the most frequent accident types among all types of ship accident according to the ship collision accident data from fujian msa between 2004 and 2014 the human errors of ships that collided in the fujian water area has been fully investigated in this study in order to explore relationships between human errors and environmental ship factors make use of experiences and knowledge from historical accident data this study proposed arbn models to obtain valuable information as an important process model validation has been carried out by three aspects sensitivity validation uncertainty validation and scenario validation in addition we proposed an impact analysis to discuss the occurrence likelihood of human errors under different scenarios the impact of human errors on collision consequence was also measured using a univariate statistical technique the psa results reveal that the location of the collisions tends to be the most sensitive environmental node for both human error types among ship factors over safe speed is the most sensitive node for type i human errors while gross tonnage tends to be the most sensitive node for type ii human errors one important finding from impact analysis is that restricted visibility has the highest probability of occurring human errors the occurrence likelihood of negligence errors is much higher under poor visibility than that of judgment operation errors it is suggested to pay more attention to ship operation when ships sailing under restricted visibility watch keepers should rely on more advanced navigational aids to avoid the head on situation which may help to reduce the high probability of occurring negligence errors crew members are more probable to make mistakes when ships sailing in the open sea area the results also indicate that ships are more likely to occur judgment operation errors during daytime period due to lack of watch keepers the lower probability of occurring negligence errors under strong wind wave condition is because ships are forewarned to enter safe havens or anchorages especially for ships in port waters for the ship factors the results of the ship human bn model indicate that ships are more likely to incur negligence errors under the following situations i over safe speed ii gt 0 500 iii fishing ships iv engineering ships v passenger ships it is suggested that captains should maintain a safe speed during navigating periods higher level of watch keeping should be implemented when ships sailing under a relatively high speed furthermore higher levels of safety education and training should be provided to the crew members of the small ships e g fishing ships engineering ships and passenger ships large ships i e ships with more than 3000 gt have a much higher probability of occurring judgment operation errors due to the poor steerage of these ships considering the higher value and poorer steerage of large ships more advanced hazard scenario prejudgment techniques should better be developed and applied to these ships the univariate statistical analysis results reveal that negligence errors are more likely to be associated with severe collisions therefore the critical strategy to prevent severe collisions is that ship captains should pay more attention and arrange for more seafarers to be on duty overall the results mentioned above can help ship owners and captains to organize their crews to avoid the occurrence of human errors however this study has several aspects that could be further extended firstly our study only investigated the relationship between human errors and accident consequences it is also interesting to discuss the impact of human errors on accident frequencies which may help to explore valuable laws between human errors and accident risks secondly we do not consider the management characteristics on board due to data limitations moreover our empirical analysis merely analyzed the accidents in fujian water area how the external factors effected the occurrence likelihood of human errors is also expected to be related to the spatial heterogeneity i e other water area with different properties credit authorship contribution statement guorong li methodology formal analysis writing original

20400,in this study an association rule bayesian networks arbn method is established to investigate the impacts of external factors i e environmental factors and ship factors on human errors the bayesian networks have been structured by mining association rules from historical collision accident records in addition unlike other related studies that have introduced subjective data i e expert knowledge this study tends to build bayesian networks with only objective data i e accident data in order to solve the problem of small sample size during conditional probability table estimating this study constructs an environmental human bayesian network and a ship human bayesian network separately the results reveal that visibility location and time of the day are the main environmental factors affecting the occurrence probability of human errors for more complex scenarios the probability of occurring judgment operation errors in ship collision is 83 under the evidence of spring daytime and sea area among the ship factors gross tonnage ship types and over safe speed show significant effects on occurring human errors large ships are more likely to occur judgment operation errors under the high speed situation from the consequence perspective negligence errors are highly associated with severe collisions keywords human errors ship collisions bayesian network association rules semi data driven small sample 1 introduction with the sustained development of the shipping industry the maritime safety problem has continued to be a matter of concern because of the more complex and higher risk navigating environments caused by the increasing ship density many researchers calimed that collisions defined as a situation where a ship struck or was struck by another ship on the water surface are the most common ship accidents occurring in waters international maritime organization 2002 karahalios 2014 ship collisions usually result in varying degrees of human life loss and property damage costs meanwhile once the collision leads to the oil spill the accident will also cause very serious pollution to the marine environment as deemed by wang and dai 2012 70 80 of ship collisions are related to human errors it is therefore the responsibility of ship owners to implement effective strategies to reduce the occurrence likelihood of human errors which can be achieved by effectively assess the relationship between the external factors and the human errors to date many researchers attempted to improve the successful probability of ship collision avoidance e g qu et al 2011 weng et al 2012 montewka et al 2012 one major focus has been placed on the relationship of collision risk and influencing factors goerlandt 2012 outlined a modular approach to assess ship collision risk ståhlberg 2013 proposed impact scenario models to investigate ship collision risks through a probabilistic risk based design case study in the gulf of finland chai et al 2017 developed a quantitative assessment model to describe the influencing factors related to collision frequency and consequence with the records of ship collisions occurred in hong kong waters wang et al 2020 presented a collision risk assessment framework that combines the estimated ship collision probabilities and consequences many other studies have been conducted to investigate possible human errors in maritime accidents e g nishizaki et al 2012 weng et al 2019 focusing on human and organization factors of maritime accidents human factors analysis and classification system hfacs is a popular choice to describe human impacts on maritime accidents e g chen et al 2013 ugurlu et al 2015 chauvin et al 2013 proposed an improved hfacs to analyze human and organizational factors for different accident types for ship collisions in snow covered waters zhang et al 2019 applied a hfacs sibci model and a fault tree model to identify and classify the collision contributory factors for icebreakers and auxiliary ships however hfacs may be inappropriate for the quantitative impact analysis of human errors during the past decade some other approaches such as the bayesian network e g ung 2019 fan et al 2020 have also been utilized to explore human errors associated with maritime accidents bayesian network has been successfully applied in many intelligent research areas since it was proposed in 1981 hänninen 2012 utilized a bayesian network model to determine the most significant influencing factor for ship collisions zhang et al 2013 incorporated formal safety assessment into bayesian networks to estimate navigational risk of the yangtze river zhang et al 2016 applied machine learning algorithms to develop bn structures and built bayesian network models to verify the correlation between influencing factors and accident consequences in the tianjin port wang et al 2018 analyzed the severity of maritime accidents based on a data driven bayesian network lu et al 2019 proposed a bayesian network risk model for assessing oil spill recovery effectiveness in the ice covered northern baltic sea taking into account the cognitive uncertainty zhang et al 2019 extended the bayesian network with interval probability for the maritime accident modeling dinis et al 2020 utilized a probabilistic approach based on bayesian network to characterize the static risk of ships considering the insufficient vessel collision records available for traditional probabilistic approaches a semi qualitative risk model combined bayesian networks bn and evidential reasoning er approaches was developed by yu et al 2020 to assess the vessel turbine collision risks although the bayesian network has been widely used for the maritime safety analysis there are also some gaps need to be filled in general the conditional probability tables cpt with partially missing scenarios can be supplemented by expert knowledge however this way may lead to significant uncertainties if too much data was lost hänninen 2014 in terms of bn structure modeling some of the studies utilized correlation analysis to build bn structures which can only bring out nondirective relationship between nodes fu et al 2016 the gap of structure modeling can be solved by mining association rules which have been widely used to discover interesting relationships with direction hidden in complex datasets mirabadi and sharifian 2010 montella et al 2012 weng and li 2019 hence the contribution of this study is two fold an association rule based bayesian network arbn is developed to evaluate the occurrence probability of different types of human errors under various scenarios to fully investigate the impact of external factors on human errors with inadequate collision records this study constructed an environmental human bayesian network and a ship human bayesian network separately instead of constructing a comprehensive model the collision consequences caused by different types of human errors were also discussed in this study the results of this study can help shipping companies and maritime authorities to provide specific recommendations for preventing ship collisions caused by human errors 2 methodology bayesian network bn technique is considered as one efficient framework to solve uncertainty problems which has been widely used in intelligent decision making safety assessment pattern recognition etc the traditional bn structure construction normally depends only on subjective content such as logic relationship and expert knowledge which may not take into account the unobserved complex impact between variables on the other hand the full data driven bn structure construction is entirely based on historical accident data without considering the interpretability of the model structure our proposed arbn structure is established according to both objective and subjective content as a semi data driven approach the arbn structure construction process contains the advantages of the two aforementioned ways which is more comprehensive and explainable with historical ship collision data the arbn for human errors can be built by the following process data acquisition bn structure modeling with association rules conditional probability table cpt estimation model validation and model application bn structure modeling and cpt estimating are the two main steps to be described in the following subsections the process of arbn method is summarized in fig 1 2 1 bn structure modeling with association rules in essence the bn structure is a directed acyclic graph dag where the nodes represent random variables and directed arcs imply local conditional dependencies between parent and child nodes jensen and nielsen 2007 modeling a bn structure requires selecting nodes first nodes in dag represent related variables in the system with limited mutually exclusive states the node selection for bn depends on the study purpose which can be determined according to relevant studies and expert knowledge to investigate the mechanism of occurring human errors nodes refer to the crucial elements that may affect the occurrence likelihood of unsafe behaviors of the crew members e g ship factors environmental factors with the certain selected nodes correlation regularity between nodes mining from historical collision data and expert knowledge from previous studies are the mean considerations on connecting nodes with directed arcs some of the studies have been conducted to develop maturing bn structures applicable to ship accidents through expert empirical methods and data analytic methods such as correlation analysis e g mazaheri et al 2016 baksh et al 2017 khan et al 2018 however the correlation analysis commonly used cannot help to determine the direction of the arcs although it can give correlation coefficients between nodes mining association rules is a popular way of discovering directed relationships among variables in databases which may better help to build bn structures for mining association rules let i i 1 i 2 i a and t t 1 t 2 t b be a set of items and a set of transactions respectively each transaction t c contains a subset of the items namely t i an association rule is formed as x y where x y i x y agrawal et al 1993 the itemset x is denoted as the antecedent left hand side lhs while y is called the consequent right hand side rhs of the rule the support supp and the confidence conf are the two measures of significance and interest for association rules the support of an association rule is defined as the proportion of all records that contain x y in the database namely 1 s u p p x t d x t t d the confidence of an association rule is defined as the proportion of all records containing x that contain x y among all records containing namely 2 c o n f x y s u p p x y s u p p x only the rules that satisfied the minimum thresholds of supp and conf are considered lift is another critical indicator to rank and filter the interesting rules which can be calculated as follows 3 l i f t x y s u p p x y s u p p x s u p p y a higher lift normally indicates a stronger association between lhs and rhs x and y in maritime accident data represent itemsets of variables that have impacts on accidents association rules selected by the three measures represent the possible node connection pairs with strong directed correlations it should be noted that it is not necessarily possible or meaningful to construct a fully connected bn for a complex accident representation hänninen 2014 for ensuring the effectiveness of the final bn structure representative variable pairs i e association rules selection can be done according to the expert knowledge from previous studies as seen in fig 1 based on the selected representative rules model structure can thus be constructed according to relative logical relationships and validated by experienced experts therefore the interpretability of our arbn model structure is mainly guaranteed by two aspects which is mining directional variable pairs and connecting these pairs the directional variable pairs excavated from historical accident data by mining association rules can ensure well reflection of the unobserved heterogeneity between variables in the model structure variable pair connection according to logical relationships and expert knowledge can ensure the rationality and explainable of the whole structure 2 2 conditional probability table estimation conditional probability table cpt estimating for bn is based on the bayes theorem which has been proven to be an effective method of propagating occurrence probability information between nodes the process of probability analysis is achieved by combining probability distributions or functions of different nodes e g specific events or properties and updating the probabilities after input new data the bayes theorem can be expressed by the following formula 4 p b a p a b p b p a where p b represents the prior occurrence probability of the hypothesis namely the likelihood that b will be in a particular state prior to considering any other relevant conditional information a p a b is the conditional probability the likelihood of information given the hypothesis to be tested p b a denotes the posterior probability of the hypothesis namely the likelihood of b being in a certain state considering the conditional information a similarly the prior occurrence probability b can be estimated using bayes theorem when conditional information a is a set of a 1 a 2 a j 5 p b a 1 a 2 a j p a 1 a 2 a j b p b p a 1 a 2 a j therefore the bayes rule connects the bn by the use of b and a for instance by assigning the shipping accident consequence to b and influencing factors a 1 a 2 a j the probability of the cause factors are often easier to define given the accident an opposite approach may be adopted to find the probability of occurring human errors given the influencing factors generally the probability of the influencing factor a 1 should be changed to 1 if we already know the existence of the factor namely the evidence the probability of occurring specific type of human errors is then updated likewise if the accident is confirmed the probability of occurring human errors is marked as 1 and the probability of the influencing factor is obtained by updating the bn 2 3 analysis framework for a complex bn structure with too many nodes and directed arcs there may be inadequate maritime accident data for the cpt estimation because each cpt represents multiple scenarios combined by the relative nodes more nodes and directed arcs means more complicated scenarios needed to be considered under the data limited circumstance the inadequate data is called small sample records in this study generally an amount of expert knowledge is needed to fill in the tables this situation brings a huge challenge to the experts because they should fully comprehend ship collision characteristics and mechanisms in the specific water area otherwise this approach could not be carried out without the experts knowledge therefore this study tends to propose a bn analysis procedure based on only objective small sample data without input expert knowledge into the procedure of calculating cpts as shown in fig 2 considering the attribute characteristics of the influencing factors of human errors our case study discusses the impact of environmental factors and ship factors on human errors separately namely an environmental human model and a ship human model based on our proposed arbn method from a perspective of collision consequences a univariate statistical technique is also utilized to construct the relationships between human errors and accident consequences further details can be seen in our case study 3 case study 3 1 data acquisition in this study a total of 506 maritime collision accident records between the years of 2004 and 2014 are obtained from fujian maritime safety administration msa this database recorded detailed information for each collision accident occurred in the southeast water area of china four categories of variables are mainly concerned in this study according to the records which is ship factors environmental factors human factors and collision consequence note that the collision consequence is not considered as one of the bn nodes in this study furthermore in order to fully explore the impact of ship itself on the occurrence likelihood of human errors collisions involving two ships are considered as two independent data samples instead of one record 3 2 bns for human errors 3 2 1 definition of model nodes for bn nodes definition certain discretization should be carried out first to the aforementioned nodes in accordance with the need of cpt estimation as shown in table 1 the final set of nodes in the bn models contain eleven influencing factors that affect ship collision in fujian waters more detailed information with regard to these nodes is listed below a nodes of ship factors four of the eleven factors are taken into account as the nodes of ship factors including navigational status underway moored docked ship type lng lpg cargo ship passenger ship fishing ship engineering ship gross tonnage level 1 level 2 level 3 and over safe speed yes no specifically level 1 refers to the ships with gt less than 500 tons level 2 refers to the ships with gt between 500 tons and 3000 tons while level 3 includes the ships with gt larger than 3000 tons b nodes of environmental factors this type of nodes includes season spring summer autumn and winter time of the day daytime period nighttime period visibility good visibility condition restrict visibility condition and poor visibility condition strong wind wave yes no and accident location sea area port water it should be pointed out that daytime period refers to the time from 08 00 to 20 00 c nodes of human factors six types of exact human errors were recorded in our collected collision accident data including lookout failure underestimate harsh sea state judgment error operation error uncoordinated avoidance and avoidance failure respectively for further analysis human errors that possibly occurred in maritime accidents could be categorized into two groups according to its feature type i human errors for the occurrence of negligence errors and type ii human errors for the occurrence of judgment operation errors rasmussen 1983 weng et al 2019 therefore negligence errors refer to lookout failure and underestimate harsh sea state in this study while judgment error operation error uncoordinated avoidance and the failure of collision avoidance are considered as judgment operation errors namely the nodes of human errors include type i human errors yes no and type ii human errors yes no d consequence the ministry of transport of the people s republic of china has classified the shipping accident consequence into four grades including negligible minor major and catastrophic the classify standard depends on the number of injured or death missing as well as the extent of property and environmental damage caused by the accident the standard division for collision consequence is applied to reflect the relationship between the two human error types and the four severity levels in this study 3 2 2 statistical description of model nodes the statistical distribution for the discretized nodes is presented in fig 3 which can be used to calculate cpts for the bn nodes as shown in fig 3 a the frequency of occurring collision accident is higher in spring and summer which is probably affected by the climate of fujian water area generally the fujian water area has more days of occurring poor visibility in spring while summer is highly associated with strong wind e g typhoon in addition there are more ships collided in nighttime period while there are no significant differences in collision frequencies between port waters and sea area among the historical collision records the majority of accidents happened under good visibility and no strong wind wave conditions which is due to the low frequency of occurring poor visibility or strong wind wave during each year fig 3 b shows that the majority of ships collided during the period of sailing underway which is consistent with the reality it should be pointed out that the most frequent ship type involved in collisions is the cargo ship half of the ships involved in collisions have a gross tonnage of less than 500 tons more importantly over 230 ships involved in collision accidents due to over safe speed in the statistical decade it can be also seen from fig 3 b that the number of collisions leading to major catastrophic consequences still cannot be overlooked as to human errors lookout failure is the most common cause leading to collisions followed by operation error avoidance failure uncoordinated avoidance underestimate harsh sea condition and judgment error as shown in fig 3 c 3 2 3 model structure constructions a series of software packages can be applied to construct bn structures the genie software druzdzel 1999 is used in this study for modeling bn of the ship collisions in the fujian water area the environmental human bn model and ship human bn model are structured according to the results of association rules conducted here as presented in table 1 seven nodes and six nodes are contained in the two bn structures respectively the directed arcs between these nodes are drawn using association rules with lifts above 1 0 expert knowledge and valuable conclusions from related works are also considered to guarantee the rationality of the model structures specifically the apriori algorithm provided by the arules package of the r software is applied to mine association rules based on our collected ship collision data the support and confidence thresholds are set to 0 1 and 0 2 respectively as a result 86 environmental human rules and 50 ship human rules with lifts above 1 0 are generated logical relationships and previous studies on maritime accidents are also inferred to select useful relationships from the obtained association rules e g jin 2014 wang and yang 2018 weng and li 2019 fan et al 2020 part of the selected rules are presented in table 2 importantly some relationships out of the mined association rules are also considered based on the empirical knowledge e g from strong wind wave to type i human errors the final bn structures of the environmental human model and the ship human model are shown in fig 4 3 2 4 cpt estimation a total of 506 collected collision accident records namely 1012 samples are used to determine the probabilities for the nodes specifically 200 of the samples are extracted randomly to be a test dataset each probability of the node is conditional on at least one other node except for the root nodes without parent nodes in bn structures in this case location season time of the day in environmental human bn and navigational status in ship human bn are the root nodes the cpts of the root nodes are filled with marginal probabilities calculated by the corresponding state frequencies from the proposed collision records as shown in table 3 on the basis of the aforementioned calculation method the conditional probabilities for the other nodes i e nodes with parent nodes can be drawn from the proposed collision records directly table 4 and table 5 display the cpts for human error nodes in the two models after calculating the cpts for all the nodes in the bn models the marginal probabilities for the nodes are calculated and shown in fig 5 3 3 model validation 3 3 1 sensitivity analysis as an important aspect of modeling methods the process of model validation can provide reasonable confidence for the produced results in this study a parameter sensitivity analysis psa has been adopted first to validate the performance of the proposed bn models for applying the bn models the human error distributions of corresponding scenarios from evidence can be obtained by updating the conditional probabilities of the corresponding nodes psa can help us to evaluate the extent of output probability variation of child nodes affected by the evidence input of parent nodes suppose h with states h 1 h 1 h m and l with states l 1 l 1 l n are the target node being subjected to sensitivity analysis and the influencing node respectively the probability of the sth state with given evidence ε can be expressed in the form of a linear function shown as follow 6 f x p h h s ε x α s x β s where x is a conditional probability parameter associated with a state l of l α i and β i are real constants representing the slope and the intercept of the linear function respectively the derivative of f x namely α s is treated as the sensitivity value of the sth state of t with respect to state l of l in order to illustrate the overall sensitivity of h the average sensitivity value of node h is calculated as follow 7 s h s 1 m α s m set type i human errors and type ii human errors as the target nodes the results for the maximum absolute sensitivity values for the two bn models can be calculated according to eqs 6 and 7 as shown in tables 6 and 7 from table 6 it is obvious that the locations of the collisions tend to be the most sensitive node for both type i and type ii human errors for type i human errors the sensitivity of other nodes is followed by strong wind wave visibility season and time of the day respectively the sensitivity of other nodes on type ii human errors are followed by time of the day visibility and season respectively table 7 indicates that over safe speed is the most sensitive node for type i human errors while gross tonnage tends to be the most sensitive node for type ii human errors 3 3 2 uncertainty validation for a specific bn model the uncertainty of the model results can be validated by utilizing the strength of evidence aven 2013 generally the validation framework for strength of evidence contains three main aspects data validity judgment validity and model validity aven 2016 goerlandt and reniers 2016 judgment validity mainly used for bn models involved data input from expert knowledge therefore only data validity and model validity are discussed in this subsection data validity consists of data quality validity and data quantity validity maritime accident records collected in this study covered the majority of collisions happened in fujian water area during 2004 2014 which also includes plentiful valuable information with less variable missing problem with limited collision records this study constructs a ship human model and an environmental human model separately to ensure the reliability of cpt estimations the less complicated model structures can guarantee sufficient number of samples for the conditional probability estimation of each scenario model validity mainly consists of theoretical validity and empirical validity since our model building process takes into account both knowledge from given maritime accident data and previous relevant studies the constructed model structures are reasonable and applicable for the fujian water area from the perspective of model results most conclusions can be justified directly or indirectly by previous studies moreover the model results can also be verified by the test dataset which are discussed in the following subsection 3 3 3 scenario validation to confirm the representativeness of our model results we also compare the percentages of human errors from the test dataset with the probabilities estimated by the arbn models four typical scenarios are mainly discussed in this subsection as shown in table 8 for the environmental human model scenario 1 refers to the ship collisions occurred during daytime period in summer at sea waters the percentages of occurred type i human errors and type ii human errors under scenario 1 are 72 2 and 83 3 in test dataset respectively compared with 70 and 82 given by the model results only 2 2 and 1 3 deviations are presented in scenario 1 scenario 2 refers to the ship collisions happened in port water areas under poor visibility conditions the occurred percentages and estimated probabilities under scenario 2 are 62 5 and 69 for type i human error while 31 3 and 40 for type ii human errors it can be seen that the relative relationships between the two human error types of estimated results are basically in accordance with that of occurred percentages according to test dataset for the ship human model scenario 3 refers to the ship collisions involved over speed ships which are less than 500 gt from table 8 it can be also seen that the estimated results are 8 3 and 2 4 higher for type i human errors and type ii human errors respectively in scenario 4 ship collisions involved moored cargo ships with level 2 gt the estimated results are 4 and 1 3 higher for the two human error types in summary the comparison results imply that the estimated probabilities from the proposed model are relatively close to the true situations in the test dataset therefore the arbn approach is considered as an effectively way to depict the regularity of occurring different types of human errors under various scenarios however it should be pointed out that the stability of the proposed method is highly associated with the data volume of the scenario therefore data volume should be another critical consideration in model structure constructions 3 4 impact analysis with evidence input namely changing the probabilities of specific states of nodes to 100 the bn models can help to evaluate probability variations of human errors under different environment or ship conditions this section mainly concerned environmental impact on human errors ship impact on human errors and human errors impact on collision consequence a detailed discussion has been given in the following subsections 3 4 1 environmental impact on human errors fig 6 presents the impact of evidence nodes on the occurrence likelihood of human errors across different human error types in ship collisions from fig 6 a it can be seen that human error probabilities show obvious differentiation situations under different degrees of visibility in our case interestingly restricted visibility brings much higher probabilities of both type i human errors 73 and type ii human errors 75 than the other two visibility levels this result implies that restricted visibility might be the most dangerous situation which can cause the crew members more likely to make mistakes it might because poor visibility will let the crews pay more attention than restricted visibility to deal with the hazardous situation in addition the probability of occurring type i human errors is far higher than that of occurring type ii human errors when a ship sailing under poor visibility conditions as seen in fig 6 a however the relationship is totally the opposite under the good visibility condition consistent with previous studies the high occurrence likelihood of negligence errors under poor visibility is because poor visibility will impact the responding ability of the watch keeper on the bridge and neighboring vessels which may lead them to neglect the potential hazards flohberger 2010 on the other hand judgment operation errors are the more common errors under good visibility conditions similar to the node of visibility fig 6 a also portrays that the node of accident location is also found to have significant effects on the probability of occurring human errors more specifically a ship has a 5 higher probability of occurring negligence errors 71 for type i human errors and a 9 higher probability of occurring judgment operation errors 75 for type ii human errors when setting sea area as evidence compared with the initial probabilities without evidence input on the contrary the occurrence probability is 60 for type i human errors and 58 for type ii human errors this is because the crews are all on standby and normally with pilots on board when a ship sailing in the port waters although port waters have complex hydrological environment the high class of duty on the bridge can significantly reduce the occurrence likelihood of human errors furthermore the occurrence likelihood of type ii human errors is relatively higher than that of type i human errors which is a direct cause leading to ship collisions therefore more attention should be paid when the ships sailing in the open sea which is a critical strategy to improve the navigational safety level consistent with the reality occurring likelihood of human errors is significantly lower when setting strong wind wave as evidence i e 61 for type i human errors and 67 for type ii human errors this result is because the majority of ships are warned to enter safe havens or anchorages prior to strong winds waves which could reduce human errors significantly as evidenced by akhtar and utne 2015 monotonous weather conditions with no strong winds waves can lead to an increased number of human errors because of reducing vigilance in addition the probability of type i human errors drops further to 47 when adding port waters as another evidence while the probability reaches 76 when adding sea area as another evidence the result can be explained by the fact that ships sailing in port waters are more easily to assess sheltered harbors or anchorages after warned by maritime authorities which can help to reduce human errors significantly otherwise ships sailing in open seas can only rely on operation skills of the crew members to ensure navigational safety when they encounter extreme weather therefore it is still necessary to improve the ability of the crews to cope with harsh sea conditions it can be observed from fig 6 a that the occurrence likelihood of type ii human errors is 7 higher during daytime period generally there are fewer watch keepers when ships sailing during daytime period which makes it more difficult for the crews to deal with shipping incidents this reason could increase the probability of occurring judgment operation errors according to the results it is suggested that ships should add more watch keepers during daytime period to prevent ship collisions the probabilities of occurring human errors are similar among different seasons when only consider season factors as evidence input for scenarios with high collision frequencies i e set sea area and daytime as evidence the bn model results show that 83 of collision accidents are caused by type ii human errors in the season of spring while only 70 in winter the possible reason is that spring occurs more extreme weather than winter furthermore cargo transportation demand in fujian water area is normally the highest in spring the heavy workload could cause seafarers to make more mistakes 3 4 2 ship impact on human errors among these ship factors gross tonnage presents the most significant difference in affecting the occurrence likelihood of different types of human errors for instance the probability of occurring judgment operation errors is 79 for ships of more than 3000 gt while that of negligence errors is only 61 as shown in fig 6 b ships of less than 500 gt have a total opposite relationship for the probabilities of the two human error types this regularity can be also seen in the evidence of ship types generally the lookout mission had been taken much more seriously for larger ships than for smaller ships on the other hand the safety awareness of crew members on smaller ships i e fishing ships passenger ships and engineering ships is worse than larger ships i e lng lpgs cargo ships because these seafarers are not compulsory to have a license or other mariner credential furthermore as evidenced by hovdanum et al 2014 more alcohol and fatigue problems had reported for crew members on fishing ships on the contrary crew members on lng lpg have to be more vigilant because these ships normally carry oils or other hazardous liquid goods therefore the lookout mission should be paid more attention to smaller ships to avoid negligence errors more importantly captains of small ships should attach more importance to improve the safety management level of the ships to deal with the high probability of occurring judgment operation errors on larger ships it is necessary to improve the operational skills of the crews fig 6 b also reveals that ship speed may have a great influence on the occurrence likelihood of human errors more specifically the probability of occurring negligence errors is 11 higher than judgment operation errors when ships sailing over safe speed this is because the high speed of ships can significantly reduce the response time of crews which can easily ignore the occurrence of dangerous situations it should be noted that the occurrence likelihood of judgment operation errors can reach 84 when set both over safe speed and gt 3000 as evidence in reality the high speed of large ships increases the difficulties of operating and collision avoidance affected by steerage it is easy to occur avoidance failure in case of incidents that happened due to the poor steerage of larger ships thus the speed of larger ships should be strictly controlled to avoid collisions compared with the underway ships moored docked ships have a slightly higher probability of occurring judgment operation errors which may due to engine delays in handling the emergency 3 4 3 human errors impact on collision consequence the univariate statistical technique ust is one of the popular ways to measure the relationship between two variables to explore the impacts of two human error types on collision consequence we compare the proportion of records involving type i human errors with that involving type ii human errors for different degrees of consequences the relative ratio of different human error types rrhet is proposed to describe the relative effects of human error types on collision consequence the computation of rrhet is expressed as 8 r r h e t p q k n p k n p n q k n q where r r h e t p q k relative ratio between pth type of human errors and qth type of human errors leading to the kth level of collision consequence n is the number of corresponding collision records compared with the qth type of human errors the pth type of human errors is more likely to cause kth level of collisions as r r h e t p q k 1 0 and vice versa fig 7 depicts the rrhet value of the different levels of collision consequence accordingly the subscript p in the numerator indicates type i human errors during calculating the rrhet value as shown in fig 7 the rrhets for catastrophic major and minor collisions are larger than 1 0 especially for major collisions 1 325 conversely the rrhet for negligible is only 0 858 the results indicate that severe collisions are more likely to be associated with type i human errors while non severe collisions are more likely to occur under type ii human errors which is consistent with our previous study results weng et al 2018 according to the relationship between collision severity and human error types one significant conclusion is that maritime authorities and shipping companies should make more efforts to avoid the occurrence of type i human errors combined with the above conclusions we suggested that more crews should be arranged on duty at nighttime period or under low visibility conditions in addition maritime authorities should take measures to enhance safety awareness of crews on small ships especially on fishing ships it is also necessary to strictly supervise the violation of over safe speed to reduce the probability of occurring type i human errors so that may effectively reduce the probability of occurring serious collision accidents 4 conclusions ship collision is one of the most frequent accident types among all types of ship accident according to the ship collision accident data from fujian msa between 2004 and 2014 the human errors of ships that collided in the fujian water area has been fully investigated in this study in order to explore relationships between human errors and environmental ship factors make use of experiences and knowledge from historical accident data this study proposed arbn models to obtain valuable information as an important process model validation has been carried out by three aspects sensitivity validation uncertainty validation and scenario validation in addition we proposed an impact analysis to discuss the occurrence likelihood of human errors under different scenarios the impact of human errors on collision consequence was also measured using a univariate statistical technique the psa results reveal that the location of the collisions tends to be the most sensitive environmental node for both human error types among ship factors over safe speed is the most sensitive node for type i human errors while gross tonnage tends to be the most sensitive node for type ii human errors one important finding from impact analysis is that restricted visibility has the highest probability of occurring human errors the occurrence likelihood of negligence errors is much higher under poor visibility than that of judgment operation errors it is suggested to pay more attention to ship operation when ships sailing under restricted visibility watch keepers should rely on more advanced navigational aids to avoid the head on situation which may help to reduce the high probability of occurring negligence errors crew members are more probable to make mistakes when ships sailing in the open sea area the results also indicate that ships are more likely to occur judgment operation errors during daytime period due to lack of watch keepers the lower probability of occurring negligence errors under strong wind wave condition is because ships are forewarned to enter safe havens or anchorages especially for ships in port waters for the ship factors the results of the ship human bn model indicate that ships are more likely to incur negligence errors under the following situations i over safe speed ii gt 0 500 iii fishing ships iv engineering ships v passenger ships it is suggested that captains should maintain a safe speed during navigating periods higher level of watch keeping should be implemented when ships sailing under a relatively high speed furthermore higher levels of safety education and training should be provided to the crew members of the small ships e g fishing ships engineering ships and passenger ships large ships i e ships with more than 3000 gt have a much higher probability of occurring judgment operation errors due to the poor steerage of these ships considering the higher value and poorer steerage of large ships more advanced hazard scenario prejudgment techniques should better be developed and applied to these ships the univariate statistical analysis results reveal that negligence errors are more likely to be associated with severe collisions therefore the critical strategy to prevent severe collisions is that ship captains should pay more attention and arrange for more seafarers to be on duty overall the results mentioned above can help ship owners and captains to organize their crews to avoid the occurrence of human errors however this study has several aspects that could be further extended firstly our study only investigated the relationship between human errors and accident consequences it is also interesting to discuss the impact of human errors on accident frequencies which may help to explore valuable laws between human errors and accident risks secondly we do not consider the management characteristics on board due to data limitations moreover our empirical analysis merely analyzed the accidents in fujian water area how the external factors effected the occurrence likelihood of human errors is also expected to be related to the spatial heterogeneity i e other water area with different properties credit authorship contribution statement guorong li methodology formal analysis writing original

dbscan ship route design data mining ais data 1 introduction 1 1 background with the rapid development of the marine industry the marine traffic environment has become increasingly complex and the safety of ship navigation has become a worldwide concern in particular safe voyage planning has taken on key importance voyage planning is an important prerequisite for ensuring the safe navigation of ships and transportation of goods and route design guarantees effective implementation of voyage planning route design must consider various factors such as ship information navigation books port information climate and hydrological environment of the water area excellent route design not only ensures the safety of navigation but also improves the carrying efficiency of ships without such planning ships may experience collisions run aground or suffer other accidents that endanger navigation safety 1 2 literature review traditional route design requires seamen to consult a large number of navigation related books and materials such as ocean passage for the world sailing direction guide to port entry list of lights and fog signals moreover they need to draw the planned route and determine the waypoints via chart operation according to the nature of waypoints they can be divided into departure ports destination ports temporary berthing points and turning points the purpose of traditional route design is to find the turning point of the ship changing course during the voyage at the same time it is necessary to refer to similar previous routes to verify the turning point even for an experienced seaman this task takes considerable time and effort however with the rapid development of information technology automatic route has become a hot topic of scholarly research szlapczynski 2005 used the improved maze algorithm for route design as it is based on the unit grid search the route found by the algorithm is often not the shortest moreover the search efficiency is significantly reduced especially for a complex sea area kang et al 2012 used the rolling horizon heuristic genetic search algorithm to solve the optimal route wu et al 2014 applied ocean dynamic information to route feasibility analysis and to determine the route that can be completed in the shortest time kim et al 2014 proposed a route planning method based on the finite angular rate in a grid map li et al 2007 and zhang et al 2007 used a dynamic grid model to automatically generate ship routes according to safe navigation conditions such as water depth and seaworthiness the abovementioned methods employ a chart to establish ship routes especially in sea areas for which complete and detailed marine information is unavailable this incurs security risks moreover the efficiency of this type of grid optimization method is low and it is difficult to reach a practical level when many routes are feasible it should also be noted that the route is only the shortest for the established grid and not necessary the shortest feasible route from the starting point to the destination according to chapter v of the solas convention from july 1 2002 ships weighing more than 300 gross tons sailing on international routes and ships weighing more than 500 gross tons sailing on domestic routes must be equipped with on board automatic identification system ais equipment ship ais data contains abundant information ais data has proven to be a very valuable data source in the field of ship big data mining ais can provide navigation information such as ship names positions speeds courses types drafts and destination ports by analyzing ais historical trajectory data we can extract ship behavior patterns such as integrated navigation guo et al 2021 ship flow prediction zhou et al 2020 path planning song et al 2019 and route extraction yan et al 2020 the trajectory of a ship often has certain regularity generally speaking a ship s ais historical trajectory data hides its navigation mode ais data is the record of a large number of historical ship trajectories which are composed of points and lines and constitute the traffic information network if we assume that most routes are safe and reliable then the navigation information can be used as a perfect reference for route design duca et al 2017 proposed a route prediction algorithm based on a k nearest neighbor classifier for which historical ais information can be used to understand past ship routes and to predict the position of a ship after a certain time good results were achieved experimentally mao et al 2018 used extreme learning in a machine model whereby trajectories in a database are divided into training and test sets by some specific form of dataset segmentation and the trajectory at a given time point can be predicted the algorithm can effectively predict trajectories within a short period of time zhang et al 2018 determined the connectivity of the turning point according to the ship trajectory constructed a directed route network and used the ant colony algorithm to plan ship routes han and yang 2020 extracted the main channel of a specific sea area from ais historical trajectories built the topological structure of a channel network by retaining the geometric characteristics of the channel and obtained the ship route through the grid channel network naus 2020 processed the ais data into a grid reference system equalized the course over ground cog and speed over ground sog of each grid and used a greedy search strategy to obtain the planned route in the field of intelligent ships the application of neural networks to ship route planning has gradually emerged guo et al 2020 proposed an autonomous path planning model based on a combination of ddpg and artificial potential field he et al 2019 proposed a route generation method based on historical ship tracks wherein ships historical route information are obtained by processing the ais data wen et al 2019 designed a route between specific ports for an automatic ship based on an artificial neural network using a large amount of ais data silveira et al 2019 studied an ais ship route planning strategy based on the dijkstra algorithm compared with the traditional route planning algorithm intelligent algorithms such as neural networks can recycle the historical navigation data for online training and learning to improve the algorithm s accuracy at the same time big data mining methods require a large amount of ship route data if there is too little data the optimal ship route in a certain area cannot be obtained 1 3 motivation although a large number of scholars have studied ship route planning the existing research has the following problems first ocean going shipping lines require a lot of satellite data support moreover if the meteorological factors are not considered the obtained ship route cannot meet the requirements of safe navigation second because coastal shipping lines are less affected by meteorological factors and have a large amount of ais data new requirements for ship speed and course from the perspective of vessel traffic safety management are necessitated however previous studies focused on how to obtain the ship route few articles studied the change of speed especially when a ship enters controlled waters such as channel branches and restricted waters moreover to ensure the safety of ship navigation on duty officers need to consult nautical publications to confirm the ship s speed therefore the motivation of this paper is to build an automatic ship route design system the system proposed herein can fully meet the actual requirements of coastal shipping lines this system can generate a ship route from the starting point to the destination point and can output the speed and course of each turning point the on duty officers can directly input the position and speed of the ship after training the electronic chart display and information system ecdis which can be used for ship navigation and for reducing the workload of chart operation and consulting nautical publications 1 4 contributions based on the abovementioned background it is particularly important to analyze and study marine traffic and to identify methods for quick and accurate completion of optimal path design in a complex navigation environment without relying on fine modeling of the marine environment the main contributions of this paper are as follows 1 an automatic ship route design system is proposed that can design a safe coastal ship route according to the starting point temporary berthing point and terminal point given by the user and the proposed system is used to high and middle latitude coastal seas 2 optimal turning region matching algorithm connecting the turning regions is proposed which calculates the minimum value of the total distance the sru neural network method is used to extract the feature turning points to obtain the recommended coastal route 3 a comparative analysis of ais data on the alaska south coast zone1 and west coast california zone2 shows that the sru based training method has faster convergence speed and higher accuracy than lstm in addition the training results are superimposed on ecdis to verify the effectiveness and reliability of the method the rest of the paper is organized as follows in section 2 automatic ship route design through data preprocessing turn regions clustering and automatic ship routing design are presented the experimental results and comparative analysis of two sea areas are presented in section 3 the last section includes the conclusion and future research directions 2 methodology the main objective of this paper is to automatically generate the recommended routes for different types of ships by analyzing a large amount of ais historical data and using the sru neural network to predict the position speed and course of each feature turning point in this paper the turning point or turning region of all ships with similar size and draft is called feature turning point or feature turning region as shown in fig 1 the automatic ship route design method includes data preprocessing clustering of turning regions optimal routes and verification first dynamic time warping is used to detect the similarity in the trajectories laplacian eigen maps and gaussian kernel algorithm are used to analyze and compress the ais data of these similar trajectories to obtain the ais ship tracking point database second the turning points of the ships are extracted and the fa dbscan algorithm is used to cluster the ais data for similar routes to obtain the turning region in the specific sea area third by calculating the minimum total distance from the start to the end of the turning region the route is automatically connected then the feature turning points of a given type of ship in each turning region are extracted the optimal route is automatically generated using an sru algorithm and the speed and course of each turning point are predicted finally experiments showed that the route obtained in this paper is the optimal route and can be used as a reference for ship navigation during the voyage on duty officers only need to pay attention to the turning point of the route thereby saving a lot of design route work in this paper by mining the ais data we obtain an automatic route algorithm capable of predicting ship speed and course 2 1 data preprocessing 2 1 1 data cleaning due to the influence of the ais equipment and environmental factors ais data quality has many problems such as low availability and signal propagation attenuation due to the high update frequency of dynamic information the amount of data is very large and not all ais data can be used for turning point clustering ais data has a great influence on the clustering effect and neural network training therefore before using it it is necessary to preprocess and delete bad data through data cleaning this mainly comprises of eliminating the following zhou et al 2019 1 incorrect data such as maritime mobile service identify mmsi that does not conform to the records of 9 bit latitude 90 longitude 180 further cog sog and draft is zero 2 abnormal data i e data with large changes in the ship position within a short time interval 3 overlapping data i e data without changes in the ship position over a continuous time such as ais data for berths and anchorage 2 1 2 data compression in this paper we cluster the turning points of similar trajectories the dynamic time warping distance is used to detect trajectories similarity taylor et al 2015 vakanski et al 2012 laplacian eigen maps belkin and niyogi 2001 and kernel density estimation kde sheather et al 1991 are used to process ais data with similar trajectories the purpose of this step is to extract trajectory characteristic points with high similarity 1 d n m d i s t i j min d i 1 j d i j 1 d i 1 j 1 2 d i s t i j ϕ j ϕ i 2 λ j λ i 2 in eq 1 d n m is the cumulative distance between trajectory n and trajectory m and dist i j is the euclidean distance between points ϕ i λ i and ϕ j λ j as shown in eq 2 the similarity of the trajectories can be represented by the matrix s s i j n n 3 s 1 s 12 s 1 j s 1 n s 21 1 s 2 j s 2 n s i 1 1 s i n s n 1 s n 2 s n j 1 in eq 3 s i j s j i i j s i j 1 the regularized laplacian similarity matrix as shown in eq 4 is given by 4 l i d 1 2 d s d 1 2 d i i i 1 n d i i the eigenvector x x 1 x 2 x i x n t of matrix l is calculated where x t represents the characteristics of the trajectory data and the kde of object x is given by eq 5 5 f h x 1 n h i 1 n x x i h in eq 5 k x x i h is the kernel function h 1 05 δ n 1 5 and δ is the standard deviation because the gaussian kernel function has a good anti interference ability for noise in the data the gaussian function is used herein as a kernel function as shown in eq 6 6 k x x i h 1 2 π exp x x i 2 2 h 2 the trajectory density prediction function is 7 f x 1 2 π n h i 1 n exp x x i 2 h 2 here the ais data are based on laplace dimensional reduction and processed using kde with a standard gaussian kernel according to the kde results 65 of the density data is taken as the experimental data all ais data after processing are stored in the ais database as shown in table 1 the ais data include time latitude longitude sog cog heading length width draft ship type and no which represents the number of similar trajectories 2 2 recognition of turning points the ship s route is composed of a time series of points of the ship s position in this section our main aim is to detect the turning points in every trajectory and then use the fuzzy adaptive density based spatial clustering of applications with noise fa dbscan algorithm to cluster the identified turning points to acquire the turning regions although the trajectories of different ships are independent they are similar in the same areas of the sea such as when taking the shortest routes in terms of time or distance according to rule 8b of the international regulations for preventing collision at sea colregs any alteration of course to avoid collision if the circumstances of the case admit must be large enough to be readily apparent to another vessel observing visually or by radar a succession of small alterations of course should be avoided in this paper a 5 course angle change is selected as the threshold for identifying a turning point if the deviation of the course angle of the two routes exceeds 5 it is regarded as turning point from the ais database we can obtain the ship s coordinates ϕ 0 λ 0 ϕ 1 λ 1 ϕ 2 λ 2 at t 0 t 1 and t 2 the course from t 0 to t 1 is course 01 which can be calculated using eqs 8 and 9 8 m p ϕ 7915 70447 lg tan π 4 ϕ 2 1 e sin ϕ 1 e sin ϕ e 2 9 c o u r s e 01 arctan λ 1 λ 0 m p ϕ 1 m p ϕ 0 in eqs 8 and 9 mp ϕ gives the meridian part of latitude ϕ in a mercator chart e gives the first eccentricity of earth s ellipsoid e 0 0066943799013 and λ is the longitude course 12 can be calculated using the same method then the course angle change δ θ 1 can be expressed as 10 δ θ 1 c o u r s e 12 c o u r s e 01 if δ θ 1 is within the threshold in this paper the threshold value is 5 30 as shown in section 3 2 1 then ϕ 1 λ 1 will be marked as a turning point from zhang et al 2018 we have coures 1 in course

coures i out here tp i lat lon sog cog hdg length width draft type course i in coures i out 2 3 clustering turning regions 2 3 1 dbscan clustering algorithm dbscan is a density based clustering algorithm proposed by ester in 1996 ester et al 1996 it uses neighborhood parameters ε minpts to express the compactness of samples and divides spatial points into core points boundary points and noise points where ε is the neighborhood radius and minpts is the core point threshold its core concept is that starting from a selected core point it expands continuously over the region in which the radius equals to ε so as to obtain the maximum region including both core and boundary points any two points in the region have density reachability fig 2 shows the dbscan clustering results when ε 5 and minpts 5 the red black and green dots represent the core points boundary points and noise points respectively in the dbscan algorithm ε and minpts are two important factors affecting the algorithm s clustering quality to reduce the sensitivity of the dbscan algorithm to the parameter setting and ensure the effectiveness of the final clustering results the fa dbscan algorithm is used herein to cluster the turning regions wang et al 2014 2 3 2 fa dbscan clustering algorithm the fa dbscan algorithm first normalizes the data and then adaptively judges the neighborhood radius by calculating the distance between data samples according to the neighborhood radius the density of each data sample is obtained and the cluster center is gradually increased according to the sample density at the same time the current clustering effect is judged using the fuzzy clustering effectiveness index then the optimal cluster number and cluster center are selected finally by minimizing the clustering objective function the clustering results are optimized 2 3 2 1 adaptive neighborhood radius in the turning point data set t p t p 1 t p 2 t p i t p n as the density of turning point tp i i 1 2 n is the number of adjacent turning points within its neighborhood radius m ε t p the turning point density is related to the domain radius to ensure the adaptability of the algorithm the neighborhood radius can be adaptively determined according to eq 12 12 m ε t p min i 1 n max j 1 j i n d t p i t p j where d t p i t p j is the euclidean distance between tp i and tp j 2 3 2 2 cluster center when tp is clustered into k the cluster center o k is given by eq 13 13 o k t p i i arg max b i m ε t p i t p i o where o o 1 o 2 o k 1 represents the selected set of cluster centers and b i m 1 k 1 d o m t p i is the sum of the distances between tp i and the cluster centers in the set o 2 3 2 3 fuzzy clustering effectiveness indices 14 p max d o m o h min d o m o h k m 1 k i 1 n u m i 2 d t p i o m where u m i is the membership degree of the i th i 1 2 n data sample tp i in the mth m 1 2 k class o m and o h represent the mth and hth cluster centers respectively m h d o m o h and d t p i o m are the distances between o m and o h and between tp i and o m respectively 2 3 3 clustering optimization results when tp is clustered into k the effectiveness index p k of the fuzzy clustering is obtained if p k p k 1 τ where τ is a minimum greater than zero then the maximum values of all the current clustering effectiveness indices and the corresponding clustering results can be found directly on the contrary if the number of clusters is k k 1 then the new cluster center is determined according to the sample density the fa dbscan algorithm obtains the density of each turning point region by adaptively determining the neighborhood radius and gradually increasing the cluster center based on the sample density the clustering effect is determined by the fuzzy clustering effectiveness evaluation index the algorithm can realize adaptive clustering without manual intervention 2 4 automatic ship routing design 2 4 1 turning region linkage after clustering using the fa dbscan algorithm many different turning regions tr i are obtained these are turning point datasets containing many different types of ships how to automatically connect these clustered turning regions is the basis of sru network training generally the distance from starting point to turning point keeps increasing therefore an optimal turning region matching algorithm proposed herein as shown in fig 3 the algorithm starts from the position of the starting point to find the optimal turning region after the last turning region is matched the algorithm ends in this algorithm the temporary berthing point is regarded as a feature turning point the turning region connection method is as follows first the turning points for ships of a particular size ship type and draft are extracted from each clustered turning region and the feature turning region dataset tr type i is established we find its center point tr type center i and then the distance between the turning regions of any feature are given as shown in eq 15 15 d d i s tan c e t r t y p e i t r t y p e i k d t r t y p e c e n t e r i t r t y p e c e n t e r i k here d tr type center i tr type center i k is the euclidean distance of the feature turning regions i and i k the speeds and courses of the feature turning region are shown in eqs 16 18 16 t r t y p e s p e e d i x 1 n t r t y p e s p e e d i x n 17 t r t y p e c o u r s e i i n x 1 n t r t y p e c o u r s e i i n x n 18 t r t y p e c o u r s e i o u t x 1 n t r t y p e c o u r s e i o u t x n where x is the number of turning points of a specified type in the feature turning region second we introduce two concepts the distance difference of the feature turning region and the course difference of this region these differences between the first turning region tr i and the next region tr i 1 are calculated and expressed by the total distance of the turning region to simplify the program the course difference between the turning regions is converted into the course distance through eqs 19 and 20 19 d c o u r s e t r i t r i 1 d d i s tan c e t r t y p e i t r t y p e i 1 sin θ 0 θ 90 d d i s tan c e t r t y p e i t r t y p e i 1 sin θ 270 θ 360 90 θ 270 20 θ t r t y p e c o u r s e i o u t t r t y p e c o u r s e i 1 i n where θ is the course difference between tr i and tr i 1 as shown in eq 20 if the course difference between the two regions falls in the range of 90 270 the course distance is set to indicating that the routes in the opposite directions are connected finally the automatic route connection is converted into the minimum value of the total distance d total in the turning region as eq 21 21 d t o t a l d c o u r s e ω c d d i s tan c e ω d here ɷ c and ɷ d are the weights of the course distance and the distance of the turning region respectively ɷ c and ɷ d are set according to the actual situation of the route we opine that course and distance are equally important thus ɷ c ɷ d 0 5 2 4 2 automatic generation of ship route 2 4 2 1 simple recurrent unit artificial neural networks are among the most effective data mining methods in supervised learning they can extract the route information from historical data and predict the ship trajectory as accurately as possible therefore a neural network is used as a prediction tool in this paper compared with the traditional neural network structure namely the feedforward neural network the recurrent neural network rnn offers a higher training efficiency for processing time series data due to the structure of the rnn the input of the current layer is the output of the previous layer thus all rnns are more suitable for time series problems this means that a deep neural network with memory units such as the long short term memory neural network lstm is highly suitable for finding the relationship between ais data with temporal characteristics because the lstm network usually has a deep structure and each layer contains many units it takes a lot of time to train however due to the sequence dependence the training speed of the lstm model is limited to accelerate training we use parallel training processes however because the model state of time t depends on its previous state t i lstm does not support parallelization to eliminate this dependence and improve the route speed an automatic route design algorithm based on simple recurrent units sru is proposed sru performs most of the operations in parallel processing and processes only a few steps serially compared with the rnn variants lstm and graded recurrent unit the unique structure of sru increases the training speed by 10 times tao et al 2017 fig 4 shows the structure and information flow of the srus and the sru model is presented as eqs 22 26 22 y t w t x t 23 f t σ w f x t b f 24 r t σ w r x t b r 25 c t f t c t 1 1 f t w x t 26 h t r t g c t 1 r t x t where x t is the input at time t w and b are the weight and bias respectively f t is the forget gate at time t r t is the reset gate at time t ct and h t are the state and the final output at time t respectively σ and g are the sigmoid and tanh functions respectively is the operation of the matrix w t wf and wr are parameter matrices and bf and br are parameter vectors determined during training the complete structure includes two parts light recurrence and a highway network jiang et al 2018 it can be seen from eqs 22 24 that sru uses a complete drop connection that no longer depends on ht 1 fast output can be achieved through eqs 25 and 26 in the implementation of the sru based automatic route design algorithm we use a highway network component between recursion layers to alleviate gradient disappearance or explosive gradient problems in addition we use an adamax optimizer in the training process kingma and ba 2014 this is an efficient stochastic optimization method that only needs one step and has a low memory requirement to accelerate the recursive calculation the connection between the gates of t is removed therefore parallel training can be enabled for automatic route design 2 4 2 2 data standardization to improve the performance and convergence of sru network training the ais data for training are standardized the processed data conform to the normal distribution their mean value is 0 and their standard deviation is 1 the formula for standardizing the data is as follows 27 x x u σ where x is the standardized data μ is the average value and σ is the standard deviation 2 4 2 3 sru network training the turning region linkage method is used herein to obtain a route connecting the starting point center point of the turning region and the terminal point however the turning points of different types of ships are different in each turning region thus it is unscientific to take the center point tr type center i of the turning region as the feature turning point in this paper the ship route design model is obtained using sru network data such as latitude and longitude speed course and course are stored in the turning point database and these data are used in sru network training to obtain the model structure in the test data set the data of each feature turning region are classified according to the ship type and size during the sru network training the historical ais data of each feature turning region are taken as input variables and the predicted ship position speed and course of the next feature turning region are taken as output variables the output variables can then be compared with the real ais data the input and output variables are shown in tables 2 and 3 equation 28 gives the total error function of sru network training 28 e d i o u t p u t s o u t o b s i o u t p r e i 2 where out obs i is raw data and out pre i is predicted data after clustering using the fa dbscan algorithm multiple turning regions can be obtained the proposed method is not simply to predict turning points but to generate the route speed and course sru network algorithm transforms the problem of turning point prediction into supervised learning and the turning point data longitude and latitude speed and course of the next feature turning region is used for the output of the previous network training in the neural network structure training parameters can be found experimentally the sru network model designed in this paper has five input nodes and four output nodes after many experiments we found that the performance of the sru algorithm is the best when cell number is 36 and train step is 0 01 3 experimental results and comparative analysis 3 1 experimental data wen et al 2019 verified the possibility of obtaining the recommended route between the two ports using the ais clustering method ships sailing along the coast encounter many dangerous targets including shoals shallow water areas and reefs therefore this paper focuses on the coastal routes of ships and selects alaska south coast zone1 and west coast california zone2 for use as experimental areas as shown in fig 5 the two sea areas of the experiment are divided into high and middle latitude regions which include navigational aids or obstacles such as traffic separation channels anchorages islands and shoals the ais trajectory data from january 2017 are shown in table 4 in this paper ships with a length of 100 m or more are selected to verify the rationality and effectiveness of the sru based automatic route algorithm 3 2 results and comparative analysis 3 2 1 turning points the turning points of ships in the experimental sea area are statistically analyzed using the method of 2 2 as shown in fig 6 the ships turning angle difference is mainly concentrated in the range of 5 30 and the proportion exceeding 30 is relatively small therefore 5 δ θ i 30 is set and the recognition effect is shown in fig 7 all the ship turning points identified in fig 7 are stored in the turning point database and the longitude and latitude are extracted and superimposed on ecdis as shown in fig 8 the course changing operations of all ships in the prince william sound traffic lane coastwise traffic lane access channel anchorage and other sea areas have been correctly identified the identified turning points include not only the common ones used in similar routes but also temporary ones corresponding to points where some vessels have moved for collision avoidance route correction and so on these are regarded as noise 3 2 2 turning regions to reduce the influence of noise points on the clustering effect the fa dbscan algorithm is used to cluster the identified turning points to generate different ship turning regions the clustering effect is shown in fig 9 compared with fig 8 the turning points of ships in fig 9 are clustered into different turning regions which are distributed across the traffic separation channel anchorage port and exit areas the temporary turning points of individual ships are regarded as noise and deleted in addition because ships entering and leaving a port need to consider ship collision avoidance and vts traffic flow control this case is outside of the scope of the present paper however it can be seen from fig 9 b that fa dbscan is also suitable for ships entering and leaving a port 3 2 3 ship route if the on duty officer determines the starting point temporary berthing points such as anchorages or ports and terminal point of the ship they can use the method described in section 2 4 1 to automatically connect the corresponding turning region and generate a coastal route the traditional method involves taking the coastal route as the recommended one however in this paper the turning point data of ships with specific parameters such as size type and draft in each turning region of the coastal route is first extracted from the turning point database and then the corresponding sailing times are obtained based on the ships longitude latitude course and speed via sru network analysis different dimensions of oil tankers and cargo ships are selected herein in the experimental sea area to verify the algorithm fig 10 shows the comparison between the automatic and real routes after specifying the starting and ending points due to the lack of original trajectories and the training data of ships at the end point 146 891 59 304 see the eighth turning point in fig 13 c there is a major difference between the predicted ship position and the training ship position of 368 445 000 the predicted routes are classified according to the two directions from south to north and north to south in zone 2 as shown in fig 11 it can be seen from fig 11 a that the port area where the ship with mmsi 477 948 600 enters differs from that of other ships further the predicted and actual trajectories of each ship are basically identical whether in the port area or in the channel the ship with mmsi 564 913 000 in fig 11 b has an abnormal original ais track at the position where the pilot embarks for the ship the pilot s embarking position is random with which the original data has no correlation and this leads to abnormal sru training this deviation is not included in the error statistics therefore there is a large error between the predicted and actual positions at the place where the pilot embarks which can also explain the rationality of the automatic route algorithm in this paper 3 2 4 performance of sru model taking the ship with mmsi 368 445 000 as an example fig 12 a shows the convergence curve of the position excluding course and speed in the prediction feature turning region of cell number 18 it can be seen that after 3000 training cycles the error is reduced to 10 6 fig 12 b and c show the convergence curves of prediction position speed and course after different training times it can be seen that the error is reduced to 10 5 when the number of training cycles is increased from 3000 to 30 000 the training performance is obviously improved but not as accurately as fig 12 a this shows that speed and course prediction have a great influence upon training the neural network the cell number of fig 12 d is increased from 18 to 36 after 20 000 training cycles the prediction error is close to 10 10 which is far lower than that of fig 12 a which only predicts the ship position therefore the parameters tested in this paper are set as follows 20 000 iterations 36 cells the experimental results are shown in tables 5 and 6 the computer configuration is i5 2 500k ddr3 16g nvidia geforce gtx560ti gpu 256g ssd table 5 and fig 13 shows the ship training data extracted from zones 1 and 2 the predicted course of the ship is shown in fig 13 a and d the deviation of lstm and sru is very small the second turning point of ship 368 445 000 and the ninth turning point of ship 303 031 000 are located near valdez channel zone 1 which is approximately 0 8 mile wide with deep water and the speed limit is 6 knots however it can be seen from fig 13 b that the predicted speed of ship 303 031 000 is 8 knots according to chapter 4 of the u s coast pilot 9 the tidal currents in the narrows are too weak and variable to be predicted however it is reported that deep draft tankers maneuvering at the regulated low speed of 6 knots will be affected appreciably by the currents speed adjustments may be necessary to lessen the effect of the currents on deep draft vessels because the draft of ship 303 031 000 is 17 2 m its speed is set at 8 knots to maintain ship operation performance san pedro channel zone 2 is approximately 17 mile wide between the mainland point fermin to point vicente and santa catalina island and the predicted speed is maintained at 12 knots as shown in fig 13 e fig 13 c and f show that the position error of zone1 is larger than that of zone2 because the number of historical data points of zone1 participating in training is less than that of zone2 it can be seen from table 5 that the predicted mileage is less than the ship s actual mileage which indicates that the turning point obtained using this method is more reasonable than the actual turning point for example ship 368 445 000 had no berthing on the actual route as shown in fig 14 the difference between the predicted and actual routes is the smallest and the total mileage is saved by 3 19 ship 309 042 000 saved the total mileage by 5 57 due to deviation from the route as shown in fig 15 therefore routes designed using sru have certain advantages in addition the shortening of the route can help save fuel consumption and reduce the emissions of various wastes to protect the environment through statistical analysis the prediction accuracies of lstm and sru are found to be the same but the speed of the sru is three times faster than that of the lstm indicating that the sru achieves better performance and a faster training speed making it suitable for ais data mining the results show that the sru network route is closer to the actual situation it overcomes the traditional route s disadvantage in being unable to predict the speed and course of the ship at each turning point due to the different drafts of ships the routes differ to improve the safety of ship routes the type dimension and draft of ships are considered herein before designing routes and the routes generated using the automatic route design algorithm based on sru are experimentally verified to confirm that they meet the requirements for safe navigation 4 discussion and conclusion in this paper an automatic route design algorithm for ships based on a big data framework is proposed our method uses ais tracking data to extract the relationship between ship routes and then generates ship routes speeds and courses this paper is based on the analysis of ships trajectories over a certain period of time in a given sea area rather than on analysis of a specific ship s route this method considers the navigational information hidden in a large amount of historical ais data mines this historical navigation information predicts ships speeds and courses in turning regions and successfully generates ships routes which are evaluated in alaska south coast zone1 and west coast california zone2 experiments show that the main advantage of this method is that it considers fully the historical navigation information hidden in a large amount of ais historical data compared with the lstm method the results confirm that sru algorithm has fast convergence speed and high accuracy and that the obtained routes are close to the actual situation which further verifies the effectiveness of the method this method can generate the coastal route and provide the reference speed and course which not only shortens sailing time but also reduces the workload of the on duty officer from the perspective of navigation practice with the aid of ecdis it can provide a lot of marine information and ensure the safe navigation of ships because the algorithm is based on historical ais data many potential factors cannot be ignored on the one hand if the waterway environment changes due to traffic separation rules navigation obstacles and so on the navigational information obtained from historical data cannot meet the real time requirements thus the latest data should be employed when generating automatic routes on the other hand this paper assumes that meteorological conditions remain unchanged over the same period of time and that these conditions are also an important factor affecting ships navigational safety if meteorological conditions are added to the automatic route generation process then the safer ship route will be achieved therefore before the ship sails the on duty officer should inspect the safety of the automatic route according to navigational books and materials during navigation they need to quickly obtain the latest navigational information near the ship route correct the route and ensure safe navigation credit authorship contribution statement

dbscan ship route design data mining ais data 1 introduction 1 1 background with the rapid development of the marine industry the marine traffic environment has become increasingly complex and the safety of ship navigation has become a worldwide concern in particular safe voyage planning has taken on key importance voyage planning is an important prerequisite for ensuring the safe navigation of ships and transportation of goods and route design guarantees effective implementation of voyage planning route design must consider various factors such as ship information navigation books port information climate and hydrological environment of the water area excellent route design not only ensures the safety of navigation but also improves the carrying efficiency of ships without such planning ships may experience collisions run aground or suffer other accidents that endanger navigation safety 1 2 literature review traditional route design requires seamen to consult a large number of navigation related books and materials such as ocean passage for the world sailing direction guide to port entry list of lights and fog signals moreover they need to draw the planned route and determine the waypoints via chart operation according to the nature of waypoints they can be divided into departure ports destination ports temporary berthing points and turning points the purpose of traditional route design is to find the turning point of the ship changing course during the voyage at the same time it is necessary to refer to similar previous routes to verify the turning point even for an experienced seaman this task takes considerable time and effort however with the rapid development of information technology automatic route has become a hot topic of scholarly research szlapczynski 2005 used the improved maze algorithm for route design as it is based on the unit grid search the route found by the algorithm is often not the shortest moreover the search efficiency is significantly reduced especially for a complex sea area kang et al 2012 used the rolling horizon heuristic genetic search algorithm to solve the optimal route wu et al 2014 applied ocean dynamic information to route feasibility analysis and to determine the route that can be completed in the shortest time kim et al 2014 proposed a route planning method based on the finite angular rate in a grid map li et al 2007 and zhang et al 2007 used a dynamic grid model to automatically generate ship routes according to safe navigation conditions such as water depth and seaworthiness the abovementioned methods employ a chart to establish ship routes especially in sea areas for which complete and detailed marine information is unavailable this incurs security risks moreover the efficiency of this type of grid optimization method is low and it is difficult to reach a practical level when many routes are feasible it should also be noted that the route is only the shortest for the established grid and not necessary the shortest feasible route from the starting point to the destination according to chapter v of the solas convention from july 1 2002 ships weighing more than 300 gross tons sailing on international routes and ships weighing more than 500 gross tons sailing on domestic routes must be equipped with on board automatic identification system ais equipment ship ais data contains abundant information ais data has proven to be a very valuable data source in the field of ship big data mining ais can provide navigation information such as ship names positions speeds courses types drafts and destination ports by analyzing ais historical trajectory data we can extract ship behavior patterns such as integrated navigation guo et al 2021 ship flow prediction zhou et al 2020 path planning song et al 2019 and route extraction yan et al 2020 the trajectory of a ship often has certain regularity generally speaking a ship s ais historical trajectory data hides its navigation mode ais data is the record of a large number of historical ship trajectories which are composed of points and lines and constitute the traffic information network if we assume that most routes are safe and reliable then the navigation information can be used as a perfect reference for route design duca et al 2017 proposed a route prediction algorithm based on a k nearest neighbor classifier for which historical ais information can be used to understand past ship routes and to predict the position of a ship after a certain time good results were achieved experimentally mao et al 2018 used extreme learning in a machine model whereby trajectories in a database are divided into training and test sets by some specific form of dataset segmentation and the trajectory at a given time point can be predicted the algorithm can effectively predict trajectories within a short period of time zhang et al 2018 determined the connectivity of the turning point according to the ship trajectory constructed a directed route network and used the ant colony algorithm to plan ship routes han and yang 2020 extracted the main channel of a specific sea area from ais historical trajectories built the topological structure of a channel network by retaining the geometric characteristics of the channel and obtained the ship route through the grid channel network naus 2020 processed the ais data into a grid reference system equalized the course over ground cog and speed over ground sog of each grid and used a greedy search strategy to obtain the planned route in the field of intelligent ships the application of neural networks to ship route planning has gradually emerged guo et al 2020 proposed an autonomous path planning model based on a combination of ddpg and artificial potential field he et al 2019 proposed a route generation method based on historical ship tracks wherein ships historical route information are obtained by processing the ais data wen et al 2019 designed a route between specific ports for an automatic ship based on an artificial neural network using a large amount of ais data silveira et al 2019 studied an ais ship route planning strategy based on the dijkstra algorithm compared with the traditional route planning algorithm intelligent algorithms such as neural networks can recycle the historical navigation data for online training and learning to improve the algorithm s accuracy at the same time big data mining methods require a large amount of ship route data if there is too little data the optimal ship route in a certain area cannot be obtained 1 3 motivation although a large number of scholars have studied ship route planning the existing research has the following problems first ocean going shipping lines require a lot of satellite data support moreover if the meteorological factors are not considered the obtained ship route cannot meet the requirements of safe navigation second because coastal shipping lines are less affected by meteorological factors and have a large amount of ais data new requirements for ship speed and course from the perspective of vessel traffic safety management are necessitated however previous studies focused on how to obtain the ship route few articles studied the change of speed especially when a ship enters controlled waters such as channel branches and restricted waters moreover to ensure the safety of ship navigation on duty officers need to consult nautical publications to confirm the ship s speed therefore the motivation of this paper is to build an automatic ship route design system the system proposed herein can fully meet the actual requirements of coastal shipping lines this system can generate a ship route from the starting point to the destination point and can output the speed and course of each turning point the on duty officers can directly input the position and speed of the ship after training the electronic chart display and information system ecdis which can be used for ship navigation and for reducing the workload of chart operation and consulting nautical publications 1 4 contributions based on the abovementioned background it is particularly important to analyze and study marine traffic and to identify methods for quick and accurate completion of optimal path design in a complex navigation environment without relying on fine modeling of the marine environment the main contributions of this paper are as follows 1 an automatic ship route design system is proposed that can design a safe coastal ship route according to the starting point temporary berthing point and terminal point given by the user and the proposed system is used to high and middle latitude coastal seas 2 optimal turning region matching algorithm connecting the turning regions is proposed which calculates the minimum value of the total distance the sru neural network method is used to extract the feature turning points to obtain the recommended coastal route 3 a comparative analysis of ais data on the alaska south coast zone1 and west coast california zone2 shows that the sru based training method has faster convergence speed and higher accuracy than lstm in addition the training results are superimposed on ecdis to verify the effectiveness and reliability of the method the rest of the paper is organized as follows in section 2 automatic ship route design through data preprocessing turn regions clustering and automatic ship routing design are presented the experimental results and comparative analysis of two sea areas are presented in section 3 the last section includes the conclusion and future research directions 2 methodology the main objective of this paper is to automatically generate the recommended routes for different types of ships by analyzing a large amount of ais historical data and using the sru neural network to predict the position speed and course of each feature turning point in this paper the turning point or turning region of all ships with similar size and draft is called feature turning point or feature turning region as shown in fig 1 the automatic ship route design method includes data preprocessing clustering of turning regions optimal routes and verification first dynamic time warping is used to detect the similarity in the trajectories laplacian eigen maps and gaussian kernel algorithm are used to analyze and compress the ais data of these similar trajectories to obtain the ais ship tracking point database second the turning points of the ships are extracted and the fa dbscan algorithm is used to cluster the ais data for similar routes to obtain the turning region in the specific sea area third by calculating the minimum total distance from the start to the end of the turning region the route is automatically connected then the feature turning points of a given type of ship in each turning region are extracted the optimal route is automatically generated using an sru algorithm and the speed and course of each turning point are predicted finally experiments showed that the route obtained in this paper is the optimal route and can be used as a reference for ship navigation during the voyage on duty officers only need to pay attention to the turning point of the route thereby saving a lot of design route work in this paper by mining the ais data we obtain an automatic route algorithm capable of predicting ship speed and course 2 1 data preprocessing 2 1 1 data cleaning due to the influence of the ais equipment and environmental factors ais data quality has many problems such as low availability and signal propagation attenuation due to the high update frequency of dynamic information the amount of data is very large and not all ais data can be used for turning point clustering ais data has a great influence on the clustering effect and neural network training therefore before using it it is necessary to preprocess and delete bad data through data cleaning this mainly comprises of eliminating the following zhou et al 2019 1 incorrect data such as maritime mobile service identify mmsi that does not conform to the records of 9 bit latitude 90 longitude 180 further cog sog and draft is zero 2 abnormal data i e data with large changes in the ship position within a short time interval 3 overlapping data i e data without changes in the ship position over a continuous time such as ais data for berths and anchorage 2 1 2 data compression in this paper we cluster the turning points of similar trajectories the dynamic time warping distance is used to detect trajectories similarity taylor et al 2015 vakanski et al 2012 laplacian eigen maps belkin and niyogi 2001 and kernel density estimation kde sheather et al 1991 are used to process ais data with similar trajectories the purpose of this step is to extract trajectory characteristic points with high similarity 1 d n m d i s t i j min d i 1 j d i j 1 d i 1 j 1 2 d i s t i j ϕ j ϕ i 2 λ j λ i 2 in eq 1 d n m is the cumulative distance between trajectory n and trajectory m and dist i j is the euclidean distance between points ϕ i λ i and ϕ j λ j as shown in eq 2 the similarity of the trajectories can be represented by the matrix s s i j n n 3 s 1 s 12 s 1 j s 1 n s 21 1 s 2 j s 2 n s i 1 1 s i n s n 1 s n 2 s n j 1 in eq 3 s i j s j i i j s i j 1 the regularized laplacian similarity matrix as shown in eq 4 is given by 4 l i d 1 2 d s d 1 2 d i i i 1 n d i i the eigenvector x x 1 x 2 x i x n t of matrix l is calculated where x t represents the characteristics of the trajectory data and the kde of object x is given by eq 5 5 f h x 1 n h i 1 n x x i h in eq 5 k x x i h is the kernel function h 1 05 δ n 1 5 and δ is the standard deviation because the gaussian kernel function has a good anti interference ability for noise in the data the gaussian function is used herein as a kernel function as shown in eq 6 6 k x x i h 1 2 π exp x x i 2 2 h 2 the trajectory density prediction function is 7 f x 1 2 π n h i 1 n exp x x i 2 h 2 here the ais data are based on laplace dimensional reduction and processed using kde with a standard gaussian kernel according to the kde results 65 of the density data is taken as the experimental data all ais data after processing are stored in the ais database as shown in table 1 the ais data include time latitude longitude sog cog heading length width draft ship type and no which represents the number of similar trajectories 2 2 recognition of turning points the ship s route is composed of a time series of points of the ship s position in this section our main aim is to detect the turning points in every trajectory and then use the fuzzy adaptive density based spatial clustering of applications with noise fa dbscan algorithm to cluster the identified turning points to acquire the turning regions although the trajectories of different ships are independent they are similar in the same areas of the sea such as when taking the shortest routes in terms of time or distance according to rule 8b of the international regulations for preventing collision at sea colregs any alteration of course to avoid collision if the circumstances of the case admit must be large enough to be readily apparent to another vessel observing visually or by radar a succession of small alterations of course should be avoided in this paper a 5 course angle change is selected as the threshold for identifying a turning point if the deviation of the course angle of the two routes exceeds 5 it is regarded as turning point from the ais database we can obtain the ship s coordinates ϕ 0 λ 0 ϕ 1 λ 1 ϕ 2 λ 2 at t 0 t 1 and t 2 the course from t 0 to t 1 is course 01 which can be calculated using eqs 8 and 9 8 m p ϕ 7915 70447 lg tan π 4 ϕ 2 1 e sin ϕ 1 e sin ϕ e 2 9 c o u r s e 01 arctan λ 1 λ 0 m p ϕ 1 m p ϕ 0 in eqs 8 and 9 mp ϕ gives the meridian part of latitude ϕ in a mercator chart e gives the first eccentricity of earth s ellipsoid e 0 0066943799013 and λ is the longitude course 12 can be calculated using the same method then the course angle change δ θ 1 can be expressed as 10 δ θ 1 c o u r s e 12 c o u r s e 01 if δ θ 1 is within the threshold in this paper the threshold value is 5 30 as shown in section 3 2 1 then ϕ 1 λ 1 will be marked as a turning point from zhang et al 2018 we have coures 1 in course

coures i out here tp i lat lon sog cog hdg length width draft type course i in coures i out 2 3 clustering turning regions 2 3 1 dbscan clustering algorithm dbscan is a density based clustering algorithm proposed by ester in 1996 ester et al 1996 it uses neighborhood parameters ε minpts to express the compactness of samples and divides spatial points into core points boundary points and noise points where ε is the neighborhood radius and minpts is the core point threshold its core concept is that starting from a selected core point it expands continuously over the region in which the radius equals to ε so as to obtain the maximum region including both core and boundary points any two points in the region have density reachability fig 2 shows the dbscan clustering results when ε 5 and minpts 5 the red black and green dots represent the core points boundary points and noise points respectively in the dbscan algorithm ε and minpts are two important factors affecting the algorithm s clustering quality to reduce the sensitivity of the dbscan algorithm to the parameter setting and ensure the effectiveness of the final clustering results the fa dbscan algorithm is used herein to cluster the turning regions wang et al 2014 2 3 2 fa dbscan clustering algorithm the fa dbscan algorithm first normalizes the data and then adaptively judges the neighborhood radius by calculating the distance between data samples according to the neighborhood radius the density of each data sample is obtained and the cluster center is gradually increased according to the sample density at the same time the current clustering effect is judged using the fuzzy clustering effectiveness index then the optimal cluster number and cluster center are selected finally by minimizing the clustering objective function the clustering results are optimized 2 3 2 1 adaptive neighborhood radius in the turning point data set t p t p 1 t p 2 t p i t p n as the density of turning point tp i i 1 2 n is the number of adjacent turning points within its neighborhood radius m ε t p the turning point density is related to the domain radius to ensure the adaptability of the algorithm the neighborhood radius can be adaptively determined according to eq 12 12 m ε t p min i 1 n max j 1 j i n d t p i t p j where d t p i t p j is the euclidean distance between tp i and tp j 2 3 2 2 cluster center when tp is clustered into k the cluster center o k is given by eq 13 13 o k t p i i arg max b i m ε t p i t p i o where o o 1 o 2 o k 1 represents the selected set of cluster centers and b i m 1 k 1 d o m t p i is the sum of the distances between tp i and the cluster centers in the set o 2 3 2 3 fuzzy clustering effectiveness indices 14 p max d o m o h min d o m o h k m 1 k i 1 n u m i 2 d t p i o m where u m i is the membership degree of the i th i 1 2 n data sample tp i in the mth m 1 2 k class o m and o h represent the mth and hth cluster centers respectively m h d o m o h and d t p i o m are the distances between o m and o h and between tp i and o m respectively 2 3 3 clustering optimization results when tp is clustered into k the effectiveness index p k of the fuzzy clustering is obtained if p k p k 1 τ where τ is a minimum greater than zero then the maximum values of all the current clustering effectiveness indices and the corresponding clustering results can be found directly on the contrary if the number of clusters is k k 1 then the new cluster center is determined according to the sample density the fa dbscan algorithm obtains the density of each turning point region by adaptively determining the neighborhood radius and gradually increasing the cluster center based on the sample density the clustering effect is determined by the fuzzy clustering effectiveness evaluation index the algorithm can realize adaptive clustering without manual intervention 2 4 automatic ship routing design 2 4 1 turning region linkage after clustering using the fa dbscan algorithm many different turning regions tr i are obtained these are turning point datasets containing many different types of ships how to automatically connect these clustered turning regions is the basis of sru network training generally the distance from starting point to turning point keeps increasing therefore an optimal turning region matching algorithm proposed herein as shown in fig 3 the algorithm starts from the position of the starting point to find the optimal turning region after the last turning region is matched the algorithm ends in this algorithm the temporary berthing point is regarded as a feature turning point the turning region connection method is as follows first the turning points for ships of a particular size ship type and draft are extracted from each clustered turning region and the feature turning region dataset tr type i is established we find its center point tr type center i and then the distance between the turning regions of any feature are given as shown in eq 15 15 d d i s tan c e t r t y p e i t r t y p e i k d t r t y p e c e n t e r i t r t y p e c e n t e r i k here d tr type center i tr type center i k is the euclidean distance of the feature turning regions i and i k the speeds and courses of the feature turning region are shown in eqs 16 18 16 t r t y p e s p e e d i x 1 n t r t y p e s p e e d i x n 17 t r t y p e c o u r s e i i n x 1 n t r t y p e c o u r s e i i n x n 18 t r t y p e c o u r s e i o u t x 1 n t r t y p e c o u r s e i o u t x n where x is the number of turning points of a specified type in the feature turning region second we introduce two concepts the distance difference of the feature turning region and the course difference of this region these differences between the first turning region tr i and the next region tr i 1 are calculated and expressed by the total distance of the turning region to simplify the program the course difference between the turning regions is converted into the course distance through eqs 19 and 20 19 d c o u r s e t r i t r i 1 d d i s tan c e t r t y p e i t r t y p e i 1 sin θ 0 θ 90 d d i s tan c e t r t y p e i t r t y p e i 1 sin θ 270 θ 360 90 θ 270 20 θ t r t y p e c o u r s e i o u t t r t y p e c o u r s e i 1 i n where θ is the course difference between tr i and tr i 1 as shown in eq 20 if the course difference between the two regions falls in the range of 90 270 the course distance is set to indicating that the routes in the opposite directions are connected finally the automatic route connection is converted into the minimum value of the total distance d total in the turning region as eq 21 21 d t o t a l d c o u r s e ω c d d i s tan c e ω d here ɷ c and ɷ d are the weights of the course distance and the distance of the turning region respectively ɷ c and ɷ d are set according to the actual situation of the route we opine that course and distance are equally important thus ɷ c ɷ d 0 5 2 4 2 automatic generation of ship route 2 4 2 1 simple recurrent unit artificial neural networks are among the most effective data mining methods in supervised learning they can extract the route information from historical data and predict the ship trajectory as accurately as possible therefore a neural network is used as a prediction tool in this paper compared with the traditional neural network structure namely the feedforward neural network the recurrent neural network rnn offers a higher training efficiency for processing time series data due to the structure of the rnn the input of the current layer is the output of the previous layer thus all rnns are more suitable for time series problems this means that a deep neural network with memory units such as the long short term memory neural network lstm is highly suitable for finding the relationship between ais data with temporal characteristics because the lstm network usually has a deep structure and each layer contains many units it takes a lot of time to train however due to the sequence dependence the training speed of the lstm model is limited to accelerate training we use parallel training processes however because the model state of time t depends on its previous state t i lstm does not support parallelization to eliminate this dependence and improve the route speed an automatic route design algorithm based on simple recurrent units sru is proposed sru performs most of the operations in parallel processing and processes only a few steps serially compared with the rnn variants lstm and graded recurrent unit the unique structure of sru increases the training speed by 10 times tao et al 2017 fig 4 shows the structure and information flow of the srus and the sru model is presented as eqs 22 26 22 y t w t x t 23 f t σ w f x t b f 24 r t σ w r x t b r 25 c t f t c t 1 1 f t w x t 26 h t r t g c t 1 r t x t where x t is the input at time t w and b are the weight and bias respectively f t is the forget gate at time t r t is the reset gate at time t ct and h t are the state and the final output at time t respectively σ and g are the sigmoid and tanh functions respectively is the operation of the matrix w t wf and wr are parameter matrices and bf and br are parameter vectors determined during training the complete structure includes two parts light recurrence and a highway network jiang et al 2018 it can be seen from eqs 22 24 that sru uses a complete drop connection that no longer depends on ht 1 fast output can be achieved through eqs 25 and 26 in the implementation of the sru based automatic route design algorithm we use a highway network component between recursion layers to alleviate gradient disappearance or explosive gradient problems in addition we use an adamax optimizer in the training process kingma and ba 2014 this is an efficient stochastic optimization method that only needs one step and has a low memory requirement to accelerate the recursive calculation the connection between the gates of t is removed therefore parallel training can be enabled for automatic route design 2 4 2 2 data standardization to improve the performance and convergence of sru network training the ais data for training are standardized the processed data conform to the normal distribution their mean value is 0 and their standard deviation is 1 the formula for standardizing the data is as follows 27 x x u σ where x is the standardized data μ is the average value and σ is the standard deviation 2 4 2 3 sru network training the turning region linkage method is used herein to obtain a route connecting the starting point center point of the turning region and the terminal point however the turning points of different types of ships are different in each turning region thus it is unscientific to take the center point tr type center i of the turning region as the feature turning point in this paper the ship route design model is obtained using sru network data such as latitude and longitude speed course and course are stored in the turning point database and these data are used in sru network training to obtain the model structure in the test data set the data of each feature turning region are classified according to the ship type and size during the sru network training the historical ais data of each feature turning region are taken as input variables and the predicted ship position speed and course of the next feature turning region are taken as output variables the output variables can then be compared with the real ais data the input and output variables are shown in tables 2 and 3 equation 28 gives the total error function of sru network training 28 e d i o u t p u t s o u t o b s i o u t p r e i 2 where out obs i is raw data and out pre i is predicted data after clustering using the fa dbscan algorithm multiple turning regions can be obtained the proposed method is not simply to predict turning points but to generate the route speed and course sru network algorithm transforms the problem of turning point prediction into supervised learning and the turning point data longitude and latitude speed and course of the next feature turning region is used for the output of the previous network training in the neural network structure training parameters can be found experimentally the sru network model designed in this paper has five input nodes and four output nodes after many experiments we found that the performance of the sru algorithm is the best when cell number is 36 and train step is 0 01 3 experimental results and comparative analysis 3 1 experimental data wen et al 2019 verified the possibility of obtaining the recommended route between the two ports using the ais clustering method ships sailing along the coast encounter many dangerous targets including shoals shallow water areas and reefs therefore this paper focuses on the coastal routes of ships and selects alaska south coast zone1 and west coast california zone2 for use as experimental areas as shown in fig 5 the two sea areas of the experiment are divided into high and middle latitude regions which include navigational aids or obstacles such as traffic separation channels anchorages islands and shoals the ais trajectory data from january 2017 are shown in table 4 in this paper ships with a length of 100 m or more are selected to verify the rationality and effectiveness of the sru based automatic route algorithm 3 2 results and comparative analysis 3 2 1 turning points the turning points of ships in the experimental sea area are statistically analyzed using the method of 2 2 as shown in fig 6 the ships turning angle difference is mainly concentrated in the range of 5 30 and the proportion exceeding 30 is relatively small therefore 5 δ θ i 30 is set and the recognition effect is shown in fig 7 all the ship turning points identified in fig 7 are stored in the turning point database and the longitude and latitude are extracted and superimposed on ecdis as shown in fig 8 the course changing operations of all ships in the prince william sound traffic lane coastwise traffic lane access channel anchorage and other sea areas have been correctly identified the identified turning points include not only the common ones used in similar routes but also temporary ones corresponding to points where some vessels have moved for collision avoidance route correction and so on these are regarded as noise 3 2 2 turning regions to reduce the influence of noise points on the clustering effect the fa dbscan algorithm is used to cluster the identified turning points to generate different ship turning regions the clustering effect is shown in fig 9 compared with fig 8 the turning points of ships in fig 9 are clustered into different turning regions which are distributed across the traffic separation channel anchorage port and exit areas the temporary turning points of individual ships are regarded as noise and deleted in addition because ships entering and leaving a port need to consider ship collision avoidance and vts traffic flow control this case is outside of the scope of the present paper however it can be seen from fig 9 b that fa dbscan is also suitable for ships entering and leaving a port 3 2 3 ship route if the on duty officer determines the starting point temporary berthing points such as anchorages or ports and terminal point of the ship they can use the method described in section 2 4 1 to automatically connect the corresponding turning region and generate a coastal route the traditional method involves taking the coastal route as the recommended one however in this paper the turning point data of ships with specific parameters such as size type and draft in each turning region of the coastal route is first extracted from the turning point database and then the corresponding sailing times are obtained based on the ships longitude latitude course and speed via sru network analysis different dimensions of oil tankers and cargo ships are selected herein in the experimental sea area to verify the algorithm fig 10 shows the comparison between the automatic and real routes after specifying the starting and ending points due to the lack of original trajectories and the training data of ships at the end point 146 891 59 304 see the eighth turning point in fig 13 c there is a major difference between the predicted ship position and the training ship position of 368 445 000 the predicted routes are classified according to the two directions from south to north and north to south in zone 2 as shown in fig 11 it can be seen from fig 11 a that the port area where the ship with mmsi 477 948 600 enters differs from that of other ships further the predicted and actual trajectories of each ship are basically identical whether in the port area or in the channel the ship with mmsi 564 913 000 in fig 11 b has an abnormal original ais track at the position where the pilot embarks for the ship the pilot s embarking position is random with which the original data has no correlation and this leads to abnormal sru training this deviation is not included in the error statistics therefore there is a large error between the predicted and actual positions at the place where the pilot embarks which can also explain the rationality of the automatic route algorithm in this paper 3 2 4 performance of sru model taking the ship with mmsi 368 445 000 as an example fig 12 a shows the convergence curve of the position excluding course and speed in the prediction feature turning region of cell number 18 it can be seen that after 3000 training cycles the error is reduced to 10 6 fig 12 b and c show the convergence curves of prediction position speed and course after different training times it can be seen that the error is reduced to 10 5 when the number of training cycles is increased from 3000 to 30 000 the training performance is obviously improved but not as accurately as fig 12 a this shows that speed and course prediction have a great influence upon training the neural network the cell number of fig 12 d is increased from 18 to 36 after 20 000 training cycles the prediction error is close to 10 10 which is far lower than that of fig 12 a which only predicts the ship position therefore the parameters tested in this paper are set as follows 20 000 iterations 36 cells the experimental results are shown in tables 5 and 6 the computer configuration is i5 2 500k ddr3 16g nvidia geforce gtx560ti gpu 256g ssd table 5 and fig 13 shows the ship training data extracted from zones 1 and 2 the predicted course of the ship is shown in fig 13 a and d the deviation of lstm and sru is very small the second turning point of ship 368 445 000 and the ninth turning point of ship 303 031 000 are located near valdez channel zone 1 which is approximately 0 8 mile wide with deep water and the speed limit is 6 knots however it can be seen from fig 13 b that the predicted speed of ship 303 031 000 is 8 knots according to chapter 4 of the u s coast pilot 9 the tidal currents in the narrows are too weak and variable to be predicted however it is reported that deep draft tankers maneuvering at the regulated low speed of 6 knots will be affected appreciably by the currents speed adjustments may be necessary to lessen the effect of the currents on deep draft vessels because the draft of ship 303 031 000 is 17 2 m its speed is set at 8 knots to maintain ship operation performance san pedro channel zone 2 is approximately 17 mile wide between the mainland point fermin to point vicente and santa catalina island and the predicted speed is maintained at 12 knots as shown in fig 13 e fig 13 c and f show that the position error of zone1 is larger than that of zone2 because the number of historical data points of zone1 participating in training is less than that of zone2 it can be seen from table 5 that the predicted mileage is less than the ship s actual mileage which indicates that the turning point obtained using this method is more reasonable than the actual turning point for example ship 368 445 000 had no berthing on the actual route as shown in fig 14 the difference between the predicted and actual routes is the smallest and the total mileage is saved by 3 19 ship 309 042 000 saved the total mileage by 5 57 due to deviation from the route as shown in fig 15 therefore routes designed using sru have certain advantages in addition the shortening of the route can help save fuel consumption and reduce the emissions of various wastes to protect the environment through statistical analysis the prediction accuracies of lstm and sru are found to be the same but the speed of the sru is three times faster than that of the lstm indicating that the sru achieves better performance and a faster training speed making it suitable for ais data mining the results show that the sru network route is closer to the actual situation it overcomes the traditional route s disadvantage in being unable to predict the speed and course of the ship at each turning point due to the different drafts of ships the routes differ to improve the safety of ship routes the type dimension and draft of ships are considered herein before designing routes and the routes generated using the automatic route design algorithm based on sru are experimentally verified to confirm that they meet the requirements for safe navigation 4 discussion and conclusion in this paper an automatic route design algorithm for ships based on a big data framework is proposed our method uses ais tracking data to extract the relationship between ship routes and then generates ship routes speeds and courses this paper is based on the analysis of ships trajectories over a certain period of time in a given sea area rather than on analysis of a specific ship s route this method considers the navigational information hidden in a large amount of historical ais data mines this historical navigation information predicts ships speeds and courses in turning regions and successfully generates ships routes which are evaluated in alaska south coast zone1 and west coast california zone2 experiments show that the main advantage of this method is that it considers fully the historical navigation information hidden in a large amount of ais historical data compared with the lstm method the results confirm that sru algorithm has fast convergence speed and high accuracy and that the obtained routes are close to the actual situation which further verifies the effectiveness of the method this method can generate the coastal route and provide the reference speed and course which not only shortens sailing time but also reduces the workload of the on duty officer from the perspective of navigation practice with the aid of ecdis it can provide a lot of marine information and ensure the safe navigation of ships because the algorithm is based on historical ais data many potential factors cannot be ignored on the one hand if the waterway environment changes due to traffic separation rules navigation obstacles and so on the navigational information obtained from historical data cannot meet the real time requirements thus the latest data should be employed when generating automatic routes on the other hand this paper assumes that meteorological conditions remain unchanged over the same period of time and that these conditions are also an important factor affecting ships navigational safety if meteorological conditions are added to the automatic route generation process then the safer ship route will be achieved therefore before the ship sails the on duty officer should inspect the safety of the automatic route according to navigational books and materials during navigation they need to quickly obtain the latest navigational information near the ship route correct the route and ensure safe navigation credit authorship contribution statement

20402,the naval surface warfare center carderock division nswccd model 5365 r v athena was chosen to facilitate the detailed comparison of experiments and simulations of a semi planing hull in calm water and waves this paper focuses on the comparison of the calm water experimental results from three different tests with four simulation predictions from two computational codes the comparisons show differences with the same order of magnitude as comparisons of experimental and simulation with large displacement vessels the mxn order level analysis has shown that the scatter in the data between the three experiments dominates the experimental uncertainty in the semi planing regime the n version analysis of the four simulations shows that the scatter in results for both the experiments and the simulations drives the state of the art uncertainty the resistance trim and sinkage was validated at a variety of speeds for individual codes and the simulation mean this study has shown the importance of experimental setup and the initial conditions of numerical simulations when comparing experimental and numerical simulation results the errors due to the hydrostatic setup and the transom radius proved to be a contributor to the error between the experiments and simulations keywords semi planing calm water resistance experiment simulation model test 1 introduction 1 1 background the current study of a semi planing hull in calm water is the first step towards a better physical understanding of the structural response of a semi planing hull and a planing hull in a seaway current structural design methods such hull forms rely heavily on empiricism and many decades of historical data from early generation hull designs allen and jones 1978 american bureau of shipping 2017 these methods have been employed reliably for a number of years however an unknown level of conservatism likely exists that may limit the weight reduction possibilities through structural optimization follow on studies as part of this program study the hydrodynamic response of a hull in a seaway and culminate with the study of the structural response of a hull in a seaway judge et al 2019a 2019b weil et al 2018 diez et al 2020 some preliminary calm water comparisons between experiments and simulations of a planing hull have shown difficulties in predicting planing behaviors at high speeds fu et al 2014 presented comparisons of experiment and simulations for a planing hull operating in calm water and waves the calm water comparisons showed the trim being under predicted de luca et al 2016 conducted a similar study of planing hulls and also emphasized the need for improvement of the numerical models based on the difficulty of predicting the planing behaviors at high speed it was decided to study the dynamics of a semi planing hull in a seaway the forces on a semi planing hull is a mix of hydrostatic and hydrodynamic with the hydrodynamic forces becoming more dominant at higher speeds the gothenburg 2010 workshop larsson et al 2014 has shown that computational fluid dynamics cfd can predict resistance and motions of displacement hulls in a seaway where hydrostatic forces dominate less attention has been given to semi and planing hull experimental and cfd assessment therefore the performance characteristics are not fully documented and the physics are less understood subsequent research focused on both planing generic prismatic planing hull gpph and semi planing r v athena further study of the planing hull continued concurrently with the semi planing hull study mousaviraad et al 2015 presented preliminary studies for the current project which investigated hydrodynamic performance on high speed planing hulls in calm water and waves for both deep and shallow water conditions lee et al 2017 provided preliminary calm water comparisons for cfdship iowa and star ccm with the experimental measurements of an 8 foot planing craft model the culmination of the calm water model testing and simulations of gpph is presented in judge et al 2019a the subject of the research herein was the semi planing hull r v athena for which much less research has been conducted semi planing hulls have been used in various military and commercial applications for large high speed craft such as patrol boats and passenger ferries there have been a number of systematic series model tests yeh 1965 bailey 1976 compton 1986 and grigoropoulos and loukakis 2012 conducted to explore the design space of semi planing hulls due to the popularity of this type of hull form the results of the systematic series are used to assist in sizing semi planing hulls during preliminary design radojcic used regression analysis to generate predictions of any semi planing hull within the bounds of the national physical laboratory npl radojcic et al 1997 and national university of athens ntua radojcic et al 2001 systematic series cfd simulations of semi planing hulls are limited sakamoto et al 2007 conducted cfd resistance simulations of a high speed ship and a number of cfd simulations have been conducted with the r v athena the semi planing hull r v athena was chosen to facilitate the public release of experimental results for validation of computational tools the hull was also chosen for the extensive historical comparisons between experiments and simulations in particular the ittc water jet testing campaign and many nswccd athena experiments were used for code development and verification and validation v v studies for cfdship iowa bow wave breaking fu et al 2005 wilson et al 2006 full scale boundary layer and wake day et al 1980 bhushan et al 2009 resistance and propulsion jenkins 1984 crook and hurwitz 1981 xing et al 2008 full scale wetted transom fu and fullerton 2006 bhushan et al 2012 sadat hosseini 2014 and forward speed diffraction ratcliffe et al 2007 2008 2008 the current study expands the experimental data set of the r v athena by testing the model free to pitch and heave in calm water regular and irregular waves the calm water experimental data is useful for comparison with previous model tests to ensure repeatability the calm water data is also useful in determining if the accuracy of the prediction capability of the cfd before simulating the model in waves the r v athena was tested at nswccd for the current study on two different dates this paper presents the comparisons between experiments and simulations for calm water the comparisons between experiments and simulations for slamming in regular and irregular waves is covered in a following paper lee et al 2021 1 2 approach these model tests were designed to provide a cfd validation data set for semi planing craft the cfd predictions were evaluated in their ability to predict calm water performance the measurements made during testing include resistance sinkage and trim measurements for the model in calm water over a range of speeds the calm water model tests of this study focused on capturing accurate resistance sinkage and trim measurements while the model tests of other studies included wave cuts for flow field comparisons the cfd of this study and simulations of other studies focused on ability to predict the most important calm water design variables while simulations have focused on other aspects of simulation physics the approach is unique since it includes multiple realizations for both the experiments and the simulations i e mxn order level testing stern et al 2005 and n version v v stern et al 2017 the experiments and cfd using star ccm were conducted at nswccd and the cfd using cfdship iowa was conducted at the university of iowa 2 experimental methods the calm water experiments presented in this paper include the two calm water tests completed in 2015 and 2014 for the current study and the 2007 calm water test completed by ratcliffe et al 2007 2 1 hull form the r v athena was a converted pg 84 asheville class patrol gunboat with a semi planing hull form the body plan of the r v athena is shown in fig 1 2 2 setup measurements for all three tests were performed in the deep water basin at nswccd using towing carriage 2 the basin is approximately 574 m long 15 53 m wide and 6 7m deep carriage 2 has a maximum towing speed of 10 29 m s in november 2014 the model was towed from the same forward location as the previous tests jenkins 1984 ratcliffe et al 2007 and in july 2015 it was towed at the center of gravity cg to follow the current nswccd test procedures for semi planing hulls and to simplify the comparison with simulations 2 3 resistance the resistance measurement was acquired through two separate dynamometers mounted on the model the main dynamometer was attached to the model above the tow point and measured the resistance in an earth fixed orientation during testing there was an additional dynamometer mounted at the model s stern and connected to a grasshopper fixture the grasshopper fixture is a balanced flexible arm which is designed to apply minimal vertical forces and is used to restrict yaw motions of the model because this additional fixture can absorb some of the resistance the dynamometer measured forces exerted on the fixture to determine the total resistance on the model since the dynamometer was installed below the grasshopper fixture the forces exerted on the fixture were measured in the body fixed orientation these body fixed forces were transformed to an earth fixed orientation before used to calculate the resistance on the model no data filtering or windowing was used for the resistance in the interest of brevity not all terms in the following equations are defined in the body of this article but definitions can be found in section 8 the equation to calculate total resistance rt for this experiment is 1 r t f x f w d f x a f t cos τ f z a f t sin τ the resistance was non dimensionalized as the total resistance coefficient 2 c t r t 1 2 ρ s 0 v 2 2 4 sinkage and trim two string potentiometers string pots were used to measure vertical displacement of the model at the bow and the stern in 2014 and 2007 and a third string pot was added in 2015 to directly measure the heave at the tow post table 1 shows the location of the string pots and the uncertainty of their location the bow and stern string pot measurements provided running trim angle the equation to calculate the running trim angle from the initial conditions was 3 τ asin σ f s p σ a s p l s p the sinkage at the lcg was calculated using the string pot at the tow post the equation to calculate the sinkage from initial conditions was 4 σ l c g σ t p l t p l c g sin τ the sinkage is non dimensionalized by the length between perpendiculars this calculated sinkage and running trim are reported as the changes from the floating static condition which does not include the initial tow post position below the waterline nor the hydrostatic trim angle no data filtering or windowing was used for the sinkage or the trim 2 5 test conditions the r v athena model was tested in calm water at a variety of speeds the target test conditions are listed in table 2 the calm water speeds in 2014 were a subset of the speeds from previous model tests ratcliffe et al 2007 an additional higher speed was added to upper end in 2015 to try to capture the transition from semi planing to planing 2 6 mass properties table 3 shows the as tested model scale particulars for all three tests and the differences in particulars between the 2015 and 2014 tests the most important difference is the tow point locations the tow point for 2015 is moved back from the forward location in 2014 and 2007 to a location as close as possible to the lcg the tow point used in the 2007 and 2014 test was the same tow point used in the original 1984 test of r v athena model 5365 the test report of the 1984 test does not give any further details on the selection of the location the 1984 test used a secondary tow post at the transom similar to the current tests and it could be postulated that the engineers of the original test wanted to maximize the yaw restraint by having the tow posts as far apart as possible the original reason to keep the tow point for the 2007 and 2014 test was to allow for comparison with the 1984 test the 1984 test was with a skeg and the 2007 and 2014 test was without the skeg therefore the tow point for the 2015 test was moved to the more current location for towing models the longitudinal center of gravity and the 2015 test was compared to the bare hull tests of 2007 and 2014 3 computational methods predictions of athena in calm water were performed using two different computational codes the research code cfdship iowa and the commercial code star ccm table 4 shows a comparison of the major attributes of the two computational codes and the domain setup cfdship iowa v4 5 is an incompressible unsteady reynold averaged navier stokes urans discrete event simulation des solver single phase level set approach is used for the free surface blended k ε k ω for turbulence model and curvilinear dynamic overset grids for 6dof ship motions incompressibility is enforced by a strong pressure velocity coupling achieved using either pressure implicit with splitting of operator piso or projection algorithms the fluid flow equations are solved in an inertial coordinate system either fixed to a ship or other frame moving at constant speed or in the earth system the rigid body equations are solved in the ship system the convergence criteria for cfdship iowa required that the residuals in all the flow variables drop at least two orders of magnitude at each time step before the simulation advances to the next time step this was achieved after 3 to 5 nonlinear sub iterations the running mean and running root mean squared values for resistance pitch and heave were converged asymptotically star ccm v 12 is a urans solver using the volume of fluid vof approach for the free surface the vof approach assumes that the grid cells near the free surface are filled with both air and water and within each grid cell the vof pressure velocity and gravitational force acting on the fluid is calculated the ocean waves and the free surface are tracked by using the vof values in the domain within each time step continuity momentum turbulence and vof terms were reduced at least one order of magnitude for star ccm the resistance pitch and heave were converged asymptotically or reached a steady state of small oscillations 3 1 numerical sensitivity 3 1 1 geometry two database geometries were provided for cfd simulations initially a geometry with sharp transom ig1 was provided cfdship iowa studies showed that small changes in transom curvature significantly affects the solutions at high speeds the tested model was examined by nswccd and the radius of the transom curvature was measured to be r 0 5 mm an updated database geometry ig2 was then gridded and used for the proceeding simulations fig 2 shows a view of the transom with the keel at the bottom and transom curvature on the trailing edge of the hull table 5 quantifies the sensitivity of cfdship iowa solutions to the transom sharpness where r 0 00 indicates a completely sharp transom and r 0 5 mm indicates a slightly rounded transom geometry with a roundness radius of about 0 5 mm the differences between the two simulation results are indicated by δs and the simulation error values compared to the experimental data are provided for both geometries the 2014 test data summarized in table 5 shows that solutions at high speeds are very sensitive to small geometry variations although no experimental data are available to confirm when comparing results between actual transom curvature of r 0 5 mm and numerically modeled sharp transom the resistance remains unchanged and sinkage and trim increase i e rise up and bow up respectively for average trim results δe error e s x is almost same as δs where δ refers to the difference between the e and s for the without and with transom curvature conditions therefore transom geometry roundedness accuracy is very important to decrease uncertainty in the results 3 1 2 hydrostatics cfdship iowa hydrostatic setup sensitivity studies were carried out to investigate the effects of hydrostatic setup conditions on cfd solutions at high fr the differences in the hydrostatic setup based on the 2014 test configuration are summarized in table 6 nswccd initially set the model by displacement δ and the marked design waterline with a τs 0 deg it was later discovered that the marked waterline was not τs 0 deg but rather τs 0 2 deg the model geometry was examined by nswccd as described above to confirm initial displacement and trim and it was confirmed that cfd should be set using displacement and lcg to achieve the proper initial conditions final hydrostatic computations for both the 2014 and 2015 tests were carried out by both carderock and cfdship iowa as shown in table 7 and are in good agreement the rest of the results including grid v v studies and the conclusions are based on the simulations with the model set by δ and lcg 3 2 numerical uncertainty 3 2 1 grid design and uncertainty cfdship iowa grid conditions were summarized in table 8 initially a very coarse single block boundary layer bl grid with 5 2 million m total grid points with transom curvature of r 4 5 mm was used this grid was previously designed by sadat hosseini 2014 for urans simulations of transom wave field straight ahead and turning studies at low fr 0 21 0 25 for further study a two part grid was generated with a coarse background grid for the outer parts of the flow and a refined grid was overset on the background grid in areas to best capture the flow features the same cartesian background grid with 2 9m grid points was used for all the grid designs the domain size extended to 1 0 x lbp 5 0 one ship length forward of the hull to five ship lengths aft of the hull 1 6 y lbp 1 6 1 0 z lbp 0 44 symmetry boundary condition was used at y 0 far field at the bottom and top boundaries inlet and exit for in and out flows and far field for the side boundary an overset grid design was then carefully created using locally refined bl blocks at spray root chine and transom to best capture the semi planing flow features at the present high froude number simulations fig 3 shows the details of the overset grid design at the transom on the left and the bow on the right cfdship iowa does not use wall function models for near wall turbulence to achieve a wall resolved solution all the cfdship bl grids were designed to achieve y 1 in this approach the boundary layer flow is accurately captured and turbulence near the hull is effectively modeled a systematic grid study refinement ratio r 2 with the overset bl design was designed to determine cfd grid uncertainty ug with 11 8m grid points for coarse 23 6m for medium and 30 8m for fine grids the refined grids had increased resolution of the spray root chine and transom curvature the grids were built with both a sharp and a r 0 5 mm transom radius the medium grid was used for sensitivity studies for hydrostatic setup and transom curvature and the coarse grid was used for a grid sensitivity study via comparison with the 5 2m grid in all cases using the 2014 setup and validation data cfdship grid design sensitivity studies are summarized in table 9 for overset bl compared to single block bl resistance remains unchanged and sinkage and trim increase i e rise up and bow up respectively for trim average error decreases from 15 22 x to 7 65 x and for sinkage average error decreases from 34 83 x to 32 58 x the δe e difference between the overset bl and single block bl grids showed that a high quality grid design was important to decrease uncertainty in the results with improved overset grid design the bottom pressure near the transom changes the area of the high pressure region at stern became smaller inducing the bow up effect 3 2 2 verification cfdship iowa verification and validation v v studies followed the detailed procedures explained in xing and stern 2010 the summary of the cfdship iowa grid verification studies are presented in table 10 verification was conducted for the 2014 setup for fr 0 43 0 62 and 0 84 the iterative uncertainty ui or the uncertainty of the value within the simulation calculations values are reported for the solution with the fine grid as percent of the fine solution s1 ui values were larger for fr 0 84 and relatively small for fr 0 62 and 0 43 grid studies achieved monotonic convergence for all variables the grid verification was satisfactory since p values were close to 1 0 meaning the numerical solutions were in the asymptotic range p is the ratio of the order of accuracy from the richardson extrapolation to the theoretical order of accuracy the numerical solutions are in the asymptotic range when the two order of accuracies are equal ug ui values were small less than 1 0 for fr 0 84 while for lower fr the ui values were at least one order of magnitude smaller than ug usn values were small between 0 6 s1 and 1 8 s1 except for σ at fr 0 43 for which usn 6 2 s1 since s1 is near zero therefore the simulation reached constant predicted values as the grid became more refined overall changes due to grid were too small further grid studies with larger refinement ratio r 2 0 or larger and perhaps coarser grids may need to be considered in the future 4 results and discussion 4 1 analysis of experiments the data was analyzed using mxn order level testing stern et al 2005 the 2015 2014 and the 2007 tests were each considered different realizations of the same test m the n order level analysis included the experimental results x for all three tests i along with the bias b x i precision p x i and total u x i uncertainties for both the 2014 and 2015 test the breakdown of bias uncertainties for each variable in the data reduction equations were shown in lee et al 2017 using the coleman and steele 1999 method the n order level analysis was not conducted for the 2007 test as the bias and precision uncertainties were not reported the mxn order level analysis included the mean facility result x standard deviation of the mean facility result std x i the bias b x precision p x the total u x uncertainty of the mean facility result and the total experimental uncertainty for each test u x i m the mean facility result x was defined as 5 x 1 m i 1 m x i the bias uncertainty of the mean facility result b x was defined as 6 b x 1 n i 1 m u x i 2 the standard deviation of the mean facility result σ

each test u x i m was defined as 11 u x i m u x i 2 p x i m 2 the experimental results were tested to determine if there was a bias in the experiment the difference between the individual experimental results xi and the mean facility result x was defined as 12 d i x i x the uncertainty u d i was defined as the root sum squared of the uncertainties of xi and x 13 u d i u x i 2 u x 2 all three tests were state of the art d i u d i so no facility bias was included in the mxn order level analysis since the tow post was at the same forward location for the 2014 and 2007 the difference between the 2014 and 2007 experimental results d2014 2007 was also calculated figs 4 6 shows the resistance trim and sinkage for the three tests and the mean with the error bars showing the uncertainty of the mean from the mxn order level analysis table 11 table 12 and table 13 summarize the mxn order level analysis of the resistance sinkage and trim for the speeds that were tested all three years for each of the speeds the average total uncertainties and differences w presented along with the values for each year the average total uncertainties and differences of all the speeds the three lowest speeds and the three highest speeds were also calculated the three lowest speeds were evaluated because the recorded longitudinal wave cuts aft of the transom measured from the 2007 test showed that the transom was wetted at these speeds ratcliffe et al 2007 the three highest speeds were evaluated because the hull is transitioning from displacement mode to semi planing mode at these speeds the data is presented as both a percentage of the experimental value x and as a percentage of the dynamic range of the data dr for the final averages for validation at a single condition x was usually used unless x was nearly zero for validation over a range of conditions both x and dr are of interest for the evaluation of trends because x weights the error for small x values and dr weights the errors for large x values as a result the final averages are also presented as a percentage of the dynamic range because at the displacement hull speeds the sinkage trim and sinkage experimental values are small for resistance the trends look similar between the three tests fig 4 the additional speeds tested in 2015 and 2007 provided increased fidelity of the resistance curve the fr 0 36 test run shows a slight hump in the resistance that is indicative of the hull starting to transition from displacement to semi planing mode the precision uncertainty dominated the total uncertainty of the resistance for the 2014 test longer wait time between runs and additional repeat runs were implemented in the 2015 test based on the 2014 test results the precision uncertainty of the 2015 test was greatly reduced and therefore the bias uncertainty dominated the total uncertainty the bias uncertainty was nearly the same for both the 2015 and 2014 tests and therefore the total uncertainty was less for the 2015 test than the 2014 test the total uncertainty for the 2014 and 2007 tests were nearly constant across the speed range the larger total uncertainties at the low speed could be due to the unsteady transom flow at the displacement speeds at fr 0 21 0 29 and 0 83 the 2014 resistance was higher than the 2015 and 2007 resistance at fr 0 62 the 2015 resistance was lower than the 2014 and 2007 resistance these differences caused a higher standard deviation of the mean facility results and therefore the precision uncertainty of the mean dominated the total uncertainty of the mean result and the total experimental uncertainty of each test at those speeds for nearly all the conditions the total experimental uncertainty of each test was greater than the total uncertainty of the mean result showing that the standard deviation of the mean was a large driver of the total uncertainty averaged over all the froude numbers the total experimental uncertainty for each test u x i m was about twice the total uncertainty u x i the large total uncertainty and the standard deviation between the tests made it difficult to identify any facility bias as all three tests were considered state of the art with the differences between the experiments falling within the uncertainty the difference between the 2014 and 2017 test was the same order of magnitude as the total uncertainties which means the tow post location does not have a significant effect on the resistance when looking at the resistance as dr the averages were slightly lower than when using x based on the mxn order level analysis the mean facility results and the total uncertainty of the mean facility results should be used for cfd validation of the resistance for trim the trends look similar for all three tests fig 5 there is little dynamic trim at the low speeds and then there is a sharp rise in the dynamic trim the hull transitions from displacement to semi planing the additional fr 0 36 test run shows that the increase in trim starts at a slower speed than measured in 2014 the decrease in dynamic trim at the fr 1 0 test run shows that the hull is starting to transition from semi planing to fully planing the total trim uncertainties for the 2015 test are dominated by precision uncertainties but are mostly smaller than the precision uncertainties for the 2014 test the small bias uncertainties for trim are attributed to the very small bias sensitivity coefficients that are proportional to reciprocal of potentiometer separation distance i e b trim 1 l sp this small bias sensitivity is analogous to a using a longer pendulum length similar to the model s long potentiometer separation to provide a higher angular resolution the precision uncertainty has been reduced for the 2015 test by increasing the number of repeat runs and increasing the time between runs to let the tank settle for trim the bias uncertainty was smaller in 2014 than in 2015 the trim for the 2014 test was lower than the 2015 and 2007 tests at the three highest speeds this lead to a larger standard deviation of the mean total uncertainty of the mean and total experimental uncertainty at the three highest speeds the total experimental uncertainty of each test was greater than the total uncertainty of the mean result showing that the standard deviation of the mean was a large driver of the total uncertainty the difference between the 2014 and 2017 test was the same order of magnitude as the total uncertainties which means the tow post location did not have a significant effect on the trim when looking at the trim as dr the average for the low speeds and all the speeds were significantly lower than when using x this was due to the nearly zero trim of the hull at displacement speeds based on the mxn order level analysis the mean facility results and the total uncertainty of the mean facility results should be used for cfd validation of the trim for sinkage the trends look similar for all three tests fig 6 as speed increased the hull sank deeper into the water at approximately fr 0 43 3 2 m s the hull had sunk the farthest and started to rise out of the water this showed that the hull was transitioning to the semi planing regime and the hydrodynamic forces were becoming more dominant the rise of the hull to above the static sinkage at the fr 1 0 7 5 m s test run showed that the hull was starting to transition from the semi planing to fully planing regime the experimental values for sinkage were presented for all three years at the reference point of the lcg for the 2015 test the bias uncertainty dominated the precision uncertainty for both tests even though the same sensors were used to measure trim and sinkage the sinkage did not get the benefit of the small bias sensitivity coefficients the bias uncertainty was nearly constant for the 2015 test while the precision uncertainty increased in the 2015 test the sinkage for the 2014 test was higher than the 2015 and 2007 tests at the lowest speed and the sinkage for the 2014 test was lower than the 2015 and 2007 tests at the two highest speeds this led to a large standard deviation of the mean at those speeds the total experimental uncertainty of each test was greater than the total uncertainty of the mean result showing that the standard deviation of the mean was a large driver of the total uncertainty the difference between the 2014 and 2017 test was the same order of magnitude as the total uncertainties which means the tow post location does not have a significant effect on the sinkage when looking at the heave as dr the average was significantly lower than when using x this was due to the nearly zero heave of the hull at displacement and high speeds based on the mxn order level analysis the mean facility results and the total uncertainty of the mean facility results should be used for cfd validation of the sinkage the mxn order level analysis has shown that the scatter in the data between the three tests dominates the experimental uncertainty even though the uncertainty increased for the mxn order level vs n order level analysis the uncertainty is reasonable and the data set can be used for comparisons with numerical simulations uncertainty in the experimental resistance over the entire speed range of 7 80 x was reasonable for full scale powering predictions based on experience and uncertainty from other model tests this uncertainty reduces in the semi planing regime to 2 60 x the uncertainty in the resistance due to the unsteady transom flow contributes to the increased total uncertainty over the entire speed range for sinkage and trim the uncertainties are large at the low speeds displacement regime due to the unsteady transom flow and the small measured values since the hull has not moved significantly the uncertainties in the sinkage and trim while acceptable are larger than desirable the purpose of the model test was for resistance prediction and at displacement speeds the trim and sinkage are of secondary importance as the hull transitions from the displacement regime to the semi planing regime the trim and sinkage become important factors in the resulting resistance the mean facility result x and the uncertainty in the mean facility result u x for resistance trim and sinkage will be used as the experimental result and the experimental uncertainty for comparisons with simulations for two reasons the tow post location does not have a significant effect on the results and the main source of experimental uncertainty is in the scatter between the three tests 4 2 cfd comparisons with experiments an n version verification and validation analysis was conducted following the method of stern et al 2017 the cfdship iowa and star ccm simulations for both 2014 and 2015 led to four individual simulations the star ccm 2014 simulation was conducted using the sharp transom geometry while the three other simulations used the curved transom geometry the numerical uncertainty for the three highest speeds from the cfdship iowa simulations was not used in the n version analysis for two reasons first the numerical uncertainty was only calculated for three out of the twenty eight simulations second the numerical uncertainty was small compared to the standard deviation of the simulation data the n version verification included the simulation results s for all four simulations i along with the average simulation result s the n version validation included the error between the experiments and the simulation ei along with the average error e the standard deviation of the mean error std e the average absolute error e the absolute error standard deviation std e the individual uncertainty of the state of the art u soa i and the uncertainty of the state of the art for the simulation mean usoa the average simulation result s was defined as 14 s 1 n i 1 n s i the error ei was defined as 15 e i x s i the absolute error standard deviation σ e was defined as 16 s t d e 1 n 1 i 1 n e i e 2 the precision uncertainty of the individual code state of the art p e i was defined as 17 p e i 2 s t d e the precision uncertainty of the mean code state of the art p e was defined as 18 p e 2 s t d e n the individual uncertainty of the state of the art u soa i was defined as 19 u s o a i u x 2 p e i 2 u

is considered n version validated if 22 e u s o a fig 7 fig 8 and fig 9 are plots of the resistance trim and sinkage respectively the experimental mean with uncertainty of the state of the art u soa error bars and the simulation mean are plotted with dashed lines to show the trends each of the four simulations are also plotted with open shapes fig 7 shows that the trends of the experimental mean and the simulation mean have the same trend and nearly the same value at the high speeds the cfdship iowa simulations were higher at the low speeds this could possibly be caused by the attached flow of the wetted transom at low speeds table 14 shows the resistance verification and validation the large absolute error standard deviation σ e at the low speeds drives the uncertainty of the state of the art u soa to be large the standard deviation of the experiment and the standard deviation of the mean error equally contribute to the uncertainty of the state of the art at the high speeds cfdship iowa 2015 and star ccm 2015 are validated for all but one speed star ccm 2014 is validated at the lower speeds while cfdship iowa 2014 is validated at the higher speeds the validation analysis shows that the mean resistance is validated at fr 0 29 0 43 and 0 83 the absolute error and the uncertainty of the state of the art are larger at fr less than 0 25 and are smaller at the higher speeds overall the results shows that simulations can predict the resistance of semi planing hulls fig 8 shows that the simulations slightly under predict the trim at high speeds table 15 shows the trim verification and validation the uncertainties as x are large at the low speeds because the hydrostatic forces are dominating there is little change in trim and there is turbulent flow at the wetted transom the absolute error standard deviation drives the uncertainty of the state of the art at low speeds the uncertainties at low speeds are more reasonable when viewed as dr due to the larger trim angle as the hull transitions into the semi planing regime the experimental uncertainty and the absolute error standard deviation equally contribute to the uncertainty of the state of the art at the high speeds star ccm 2015 is validated at all the speeds the other simulations are validated for about half the speeds the validation analysis shows that the mean trim was not validated at any speed the absolute error and the uncertainty of the state of the art are large at fr less than 0 25 and are smaller at the higher speeds overall the results shows that simulations can predict the trim of semi planing hulls fig 9 shows that the simulation predicts slightly higher sinkage than the experiment table 16 shows the sinkage verification and validation the uncertainties as x are large at the low and high speeds due to the small values for sinkage the uncertainties are more reasonable when viewed as dr due to the sinkage reaching a maximum as the hull transitions into the semi displacement regime the experimental uncertainty and the absolute error standard deviation equally contribute to the uncertainty of the state of the art cfdship iowa for both years was validated at all the speed except fr 0 43 star ccm 2015 was validated at all the speeds except the highest speed and star ccm 2014 was validated at most of the speed the validation analysis shows that the mean trim was validated at all the speeds except at fr 0 43 and 0 81 overall the results show that simulations can predict the sinkage of semi planing hulls the simulations were able to capture the physics of a semi planing hull in the semi planing hull regime the simulations were able to predict the sinking of the hull at the higher displacement speeds where hydrodynamic forces dominate the simulations predicted the increase of the sinkage as the hydrodynamic forces started supporting the hull the simulations also correctly captured the hull rising above the initial sinkage at the highest speed showing the transition into full planing the simulations correctly showed that the hydrostatic forces dominated at low speeds with the near zero trim at the displacement speeds the simulations predicted the increase in trim in the semi displacement regime showing the hydrostatic lift as the hull vessel begins to climb the back face of the bow wave the simulations predicted the peak in the trim and the reduction of the trim in the semi planing regime as the hydrodynamic forces start to dominate the correct prediction of the hydrodynamic forces acting on the hull lead to a very good prediction of the resistance at the semi planing speeds 4 3 comparison summary a summary of the simulation validation analysis and the cfdship iowa calm water sensitivity studies are presented in table 17 the studies show that resistance has a sensitivity to the hydrostatic setup and does not have a sensitivity to the transom curvature for trim and sinkage the hydrostatic setup and transom curvature are contributors to the overall error the mean error and experimental uncertainty for resistance sinkage and trim from the r v athena test was compared to the model 5415 results from the 2010 gothenburg workshop larsson et al 2017 at a froude number of about 0 4 table 18 the mean error and experimental uncertainty for resistance was slightly lower for r v athena than model 5415 and slightly higher for trim though both were on the same order of magnitude the mean error and experimental uncertainty for sinkage and trim were higher for r v athena but are reasonable the r v athena was also compared to the ntua double chine series grigoropoulos and loukakis 2012 the r v athena and the ntua hull form are both semi planing hull designs while the r v athena has a round bilge and the ntua has two chines the comparison between the two hull forms was conducted to put the research on the r v athena in the context of other semi planing hulls the r v athena has a volume of displacement coefficient c d l v 0 1 l w l 3 of 2 11 and a length to beam ratio of 6 8 the ntua condition used for comparison had a cdl of 2 23 and a length to beam ratio of 7 figs 10 12 shows the total resistance coefficient the trim and the heave comparisons the total resistance coefficient was higher for the ntua than for the r v athena this is most likely due to the higher displacement of the ntua hull the trim showed the same trend for both hulls with the ntua trim being offset higher than the r v athena the sinkage in the displacement regime for both hulls was the same for both hulls above fr 0 4 the semi planing regime the ntua started to rise faster than the r v athena with increasing speed 5 conclusions this study has shown that simulations can be used for calm water predictions and the next step will be taken to simulate the semi planing hull in waves the mxn order level analysis has shown that the scatter in the data between the three experiments dominates the experimental uncertainty at the higher speeds the uncertainties are small enough to be used for comparisons with simulations and for powering predictions in a detailed craft design the analysis showed that the difference in the results based on the tow post location was within the noise of the other experimental uncertainties the n version analysis of the four simulations shows that the scatter in results for both the experiments and the simulations drives the state of the art uncertainty the resistance trim and sinkage was validated at a variety of speeds for individual codes and the simulation mean both codes showed the capability to predict design variables using similar setups grid sizes etc this shows that the simulations can be used for powering predictions in craft design the large error and uncertainty is most likely due to the wetted transom as the simulations show the transom wetted at speeds below fr 0 25 where the error and uncertainty is the largest unlike displacement hulls at displacement speeds the wetted transom of a semi planing hull at displacement speeds exhibited a very turbulent flow bhushan et al 2012 have shown that much finer grieds and des are required for accurate resolution predictions of wetted transom flow this study has shown the importance of experimental setup and the initial conditions of numerical simulations when comparing experimental and numerical simulation results the errors due to the hydrostatic setup proved to be a contributor to the overall error this means that the loading condition of a craft design must be well known before experiments or simulations are run to ensure that the predictions are accurate more care in the experimental setup is needed to try to reduce the experimental uncertainty for sinkage and trim the transom radius had an impact on the error in trim and sinkage credit authorship contribution statement evan j lee conceptualization methodology investigation validation investigation

20402,the naval surface warfare center carderock division nswccd model 5365 r v athena was chosen to facilitate the detailed comparison of experiments and simulations of a semi planing hull in calm water and waves this paper focuses on the comparison of the calm water experimental results from three different tests with four simulation predictions from two computational codes the comparisons show differences with the same order of magnitude as comparisons of experimental and simulation with large displacement vessels the mxn order level analysis has shown that the scatter in the data between the three experiments dominates the experimental uncertainty in the semi planing regime the n version analysis of the four simulations shows that the scatter in results for both the experiments and the simulations drives the state of the art uncertainty the resistance trim and sinkage was validated at a variety of speeds for individual codes and the simulation mean this study has shown the importance of experimental setup and the initial conditions of numerical simulations when comparing experimental and numerical simulation results the errors due to the hydrostatic setup and the transom radius proved to be a contributor to the error between the experiments and simulations keywords semi planing calm water resistance experiment simulation model test 1 introduction 1 1 background the current study of a semi planing hull in calm water is the first step towards a better physical understanding of the structural response of a semi planing hull and a planing hull in a seaway current structural design methods such hull forms rely heavily on empiricism and many decades of historical data from early generation hull designs allen and jones 1978 american bureau of shipping 2017 these methods have been employed reliably for a number of years however an unknown level of conservatism likely exists that may limit the weight reduction possibilities through structural optimization follow on studies as part of this program study the hydrodynamic response of a hull in a seaway and culminate with the study of the structural response of a hull in a seaway judge et al 2019a 2019b weil et al 2018 diez et al 2020 some preliminary calm water comparisons between experiments and simulations of a planing hull have shown difficulties in predicting planing behaviors at high speeds fu et al 2014 presented comparisons of experiment and simulations for a planing hull operating in calm water and waves the calm water comparisons showed the trim being under predicted de luca et al 2016 conducted a similar study of planing hulls and also emphasized the need for improvement of the numerical models based on the difficulty of predicting the planing behaviors at high speed it was decided to study the dynamics of a semi planing hull in a seaway the forces on a semi planing hull is a mix of hydrostatic and hydrodynamic with the hydrodynamic forces becoming more dominant at higher speeds the gothenburg 2010 workshop larsson et al 2014 has shown that computational fluid dynamics cfd can predict resistance and motions of displacement hulls in a seaway where hydrostatic forces dominate less attention has been given to semi and planing hull experimental and cfd assessment therefore the performance characteristics are not fully documented and the physics are less understood subsequent research focused on both planing generic prismatic planing hull gpph and semi planing r v athena further study of the planing hull continued concurrently with the semi planing hull study mousaviraad et al 2015 presented preliminary studies for the current project which investigated hydrodynamic performance on high speed planing hulls in calm water and waves for both deep and shallow water conditions lee et al 2017 provided preliminary calm water comparisons for cfdship iowa and star ccm with the experimental measurements of an 8 foot planing craft model the culmination of the calm water model testing and simulations of gpph is presented in judge et al 2019a the subject of the research herein was the semi planing hull r v athena for which much less research has been conducted semi planing hulls have been used in various military and commercial applications for large high speed craft such as patrol boats and passenger ferries there have been a number of systematic series model tests yeh 1965 bailey 1976 compton 1986 and grigoropoulos and loukakis 2012 conducted to explore the design space of semi planing hulls due to the popularity of this type of hull form the results of the systematic series are used to assist in sizing semi planing hulls during preliminary design radojcic used regression analysis to generate predictions of any semi planing hull within the bounds of the national physical laboratory npl radojcic et al 1997 and national university of athens ntua radojcic et al 2001 systematic series cfd simulations of semi planing hulls are limited sakamoto et al 2007 conducted cfd resistance simulations of a high speed ship and a number of cfd simulations have been conducted with the r v athena the semi planing hull r v athena was chosen to facilitate the public release of experimental results for validation of computational tools the hull was also chosen for the extensive historical comparisons between experiments and simulations in particular the ittc water jet testing campaign and many nswccd athena experiments were used for code development and verification and validation v v studies for cfdship iowa bow wave breaking fu et al 2005 wilson et al 2006 full scale boundary layer and wake day et al 1980 bhushan et al 2009 resistance and propulsion jenkins 1984 crook and hurwitz 1981 xing et al 2008 full scale wetted transom fu and fullerton 2006 bhushan et al 2012 sadat hosseini 2014 and forward speed diffraction ratcliffe et al 2007 2008 2008 the current study expands the experimental data set of the r v athena by testing the model free to pitch and heave in calm water regular and irregular waves the calm water experimental data is useful for comparison with previous model tests to ensure repeatability the calm water data is also useful in determining if the accuracy of the prediction capability of the cfd before simulating the model in waves the r v athena was tested at nswccd for the current study on two different dates this paper presents the comparisons between experiments and simulations for calm water the comparisons between experiments and simulations for slamming in regular and irregular waves is covered in a following paper lee et al 2021 1 2 approach these model tests were designed to provide a cfd validation data set for semi planing craft the cfd predictions were evaluated in their ability to predict calm water performance the measurements made during testing include resistance sinkage and trim measurements for the model in calm water over a range of speeds the calm water model tests of this study focused on capturing accurate resistance sinkage and trim measurements while the model tests of other studies included wave cuts for flow field comparisons the cfd of this study and simulations of other studies focused on ability to predict the most important calm water design variables while simulations have focused on other aspects of simulation physics the approach is unique since it includes multiple realizations for both the experiments and the simulations i e mxn order level testing stern et al 2005 and n version v v stern et al 2017 the experiments and cfd using star ccm were conducted at nswccd and the cfd using cfdship iowa was conducted at the university of iowa 2 experimental methods the calm water experiments presented in this paper include the two calm water tests completed in 2015 and 2014 for the current study and the 2007 calm water test completed by ratcliffe et al 2007 2 1 hull form the r v athena was a converted pg 84 asheville class patrol gunboat with a semi planing hull form the body plan of the r v athena is shown in fig 1 2 2 setup measurements for all three tests were performed in the deep water basin at nswccd using towing carriage 2 the basin is approximately 574 m long 15 53 m wide and 6 7m deep carriage 2 has a maximum towing speed of 10 29 m s in november 2014 the model was towed from the same forward location as the previous tests jenkins 1984 ratcliffe et al 2007 and in july 2015 it was towed at the center of gravity cg to follow the current nswccd test procedures for semi planing hulls and to simplify the comparison with simulations 2 3 resistance the resistance measurement was acquired through two separate dynamometers mounted on the model the main dynamometer was attached to the model above the tow point and measured the resistance in an earth fixed orientation during testing there was an additional dynamometer mounted at the model s stern and connected to a grasshopper fixture the grasshopper fixture is a balanced flexible arm which is designed to apply minimal vertical forces and is used to restrict yaw motions of the model because this additional fixture can absorb some of the resistance the dynamometer measured forces exerted on the fixture to determine the total resistance on the model since the dynamometer was installed below the grasshopper fixture the forces exerted on the fixture were measured in the body fixed orientation these body fixed forces were transformed to an earth fixed orientation before used to calculate the resistance on the model no data filtering or windowing was used for the resistance in the interest of brevity not all terms in the following equations are defined in the body of this article but definitions can be found in section 8 the equation to calculate total resistance rt for this experiment is 1 r t f x f w d f x a f t cos τ f z a f t sin τ the resistance was non dimensionalized as the total resistance coefficient 2 c t r t 1 2 ρ s 0 v 2 2 4 sinkage and trim two string potentiometers string pots were used to measure vertical displacement of the model at the bow and the stern in 2014 and 2007 and a third string pot was added in 2015 to directly measure the heave at the tow post table 1 shows the location of the string pots and the uncertainty of their location the bow and stern string pot measurements provided running trim angle the equation to calculate the running trim angle from the initial conditions was 3 τ asin σ f s p σ a s p l s p the sinkage at the lcg was calculated using the string pot at the tow post the equation to calculate the sinkage from initial conditions was 4 σ l c g σ t p l t p l c g sin τ the sinkage is non dimensionalized by the length between perpendiculars this calculated sinkage and running trim are reported as the changes from the floating static condition which does not include the initial tow post position below the waterline nor the hydrostatic trim angle no data filtering or windowing was used for the sinkage or the trim 2 5 test conditions the r v athena model was tested in calm water at a variety of speeds the target test conditions are listed in table 2 the calm water speeds in 2014 were a subset of the speeds from previous model tests ratcliffe et al 2007 an additional higher speed was added to upper end in 2015 to try to capture the transition from semi planing to planing 2 6 mass properties table 3 shows the as tested model scale particulars for all three tests and the differences in particulars between the 2015 and 2014 tests the most important difference is the tow point locations the tow point for 2015 is moved back from the forward location in 2014 and 2007 to a location as close as possible to the lcg the tow point used in the 2007 and 2014 test was the same tow point used in the original 1984 test of r v athena model 5365 the test report of the 1984 test does not give any further details on the selection of the location the 1984 test used a secondary tow post at the transom similar to the current tests and it could be postulated that the engineers of the original test wanted to maximize the yaw restraint by having the tow posts as far apart as possible the original reason to keep the tow point for the 2007 and 2014 test was to allow for comparison with the 1984 test the 1984 test was with a skeg and the 2007 and 2014 test was without the skeg therefore the tow point for the 2015 test was moved to the more current location for towing models the longitudinal center of gravity and the 2015 test was compared to the bare hull tests of 2007 and 2014 3 computational methods predictions of athena in calm water were performed using two different computational codes the research code cfdship iowa and the commercial code star ccm table 4 shows a comparison of the major attributes of the two computational codes and the domain setup cfdship iowa v4 5 is an incompressible unsteady reynold averaged navier stokes urans discrete event simulation des solver single phase level set approach is used for the free surface blended k ε k ω for turbulence model and curvilinear dynamic overset grids for 6dof ship motions incompressibility is enforced by a strong pressure velocity coupling achieved using either pressure implicit with splitting of operator piso or projection algorithms the fluid flow equations are solved in an inertial coordinate system either fixed to a ship or other frame moving at constant speed or in the earth system the rigid body equations are solved in the ship system the convergence criteria for cfdship iowa required that the residuals in all the flow variables drop at least two orders of magnitude at each time step before the simulation advances to the next time step this was achieved after 3 to 5 nonlinear sub iterations the running mean and running root mean squared values for resistance pitch and heave were converged asymptotically star ccm v 12 is a urans solver using the volume of fluid vof approach for the free surface the vof approach assumes that the grid cells near the free surface are filled with both air and water and within each grid cell the vof pressure velocity and gravitational force acting on the fluid is calculated the ocean waves and the free surface are tracked by using the vof values in the domain within each time step continuity momentum turbulence and vof terms were reduced at least one order of magnitude for star ccm the resistance pitch and heave were converged asymptotically or reached a steady state of small oscillations 3 1 numerical sensitivity 3 1 1 geometry two database geometries were provided for cfd simulations initially a geometry with sharp transom ig1 was provided cfdship iowa studies showed that small changes in transom curvature significantly affects the solutions at high speeds the tested model was examined by nswccd and the radius of the transom curvature was measured to be r 0 5 mm an updated database geometry ig2 was then gridded and used for the proceeding simulations fig 2 shows a view of the transom with the keel at the bottom and transom curvature on the trailing edge of the hull table 5 quantifies the sensitivity of cfdship iowa solutions to the transom sharpness where r 0 00 indicates a completely sharp transom and r 0 5 mm indicates a slightly rounded transom geometry with a roundness radius of about 0 5 mm the differences between the two simulation results are indicated by δs and the simulation error values compared to the experimental data are provided for both geometries the 2014 test data summarized in table 5 shows that solutions at high speeds are very sensitive to small geometry variations although no experimental data are available to confirm when comparing results between actual transom curvature of r 0 5 mm and numerically modeled sharp transom the resistance remains unchanged and sinkage and trim increase i e rise up and bow up respectively for average trim results δe error e s x is almost same as δs where δ refers to the difference between the e and s for the without and with transom curvature conditions therefore transom geometry roundedness accuracy is very important to decrease uncertainty in the results 3 1 2 hydrostatics cfdship iowa hydrostatic setup sensitivity studies were carried out to investigate the effects of hydrostatic setup conditions on cfd solutions at high fr the differences in the hydrostatic setup based on the 2014 test configuration are summarized in table 6 nswccd initially set the model by displacement δ and the marked design waterline with a τs 0 deg it was later discovered that the marked waterline was not τs 0 deg but rather τs 0 2 deg the model geometry was examined by nswccd as described above to confirm initial displacement and trim and it was confirmed that cfd should be set using displacement and lcg to achieve the proper initial conditions final hydrostatic computations for both the 2014 and 2015 tests were carried out by both carderock and cfdship iowa as shown in table 7 and are in good agreement the rest of the results including grid v v studies and the conclusions are based on the simulations with the model set by δ and lcg 3 2 numerical uncertainty 3 2 1 grid design and uncertainty cfdship iowa grid conditions were summarized in table 8 initially a very coarse single block boundary layer bl grid with 5 2 million m total grid points with transom curvature of r 4 5 mm was used this grid was previously designed by sadat hosseini 2014 for urans simulations of transom wave field straight ahead and turning studies at low fr 0 21 0 25 for further study a two part grid was generated with a coarse background grid for the outer parts of the flow and a refined grid was overset on the background grid in areas to best capture the flow features the same cartesian background grid with 2 9m grid points was used for all the grid designs the domain size extended to 1 0 x lbp 5 0 one ship length forward of the hull to five ship lengths aft of the hull 1 6 y lbp 1 6 1 0 z lbp 0 44 symmetry boundary condition was used at y 0 far field at the bottom and top boundaries inlet and exit for in and out flows and far field for the side boundary an overset grid design was then carefully created using locally refined bl blocks at spray root chine and transom to best capture the semi planing flow features at the present high froude number simulations fig 3 shows the details of the overset grid design at the transom on the left and the bow on the right cfdship iowa does not use wall function models for near wall turbulence to achieve a wall resolved solution all the cfdship bl grids were designed to achieve y 1 in this approach the boundary layer flow is accurately captured and turbulence near the hull is effectively modeled a systematic grid study refinement ratio r 2 with the overset bl design was designed to determine cfd grid uncertainty ug with 11 8m grid points for coarse 23 6m for medium and 30 8m for fine grids the refined grids had increased resolution of the spray root chine and transom curvature the grids were built with both a sharp and a r 0 5 mm transom radius the medium grid was used for sensitivity studies for hydrostatic setup and transom curvature and the coarse grid was used for a grid sensitivity study via comparison with the 5 2m grid in all cases using the 2014 setup and validation data cfdship grid design sensitivity studies are summarized in table 9 for overset bl compared to single block bl resistance remains unchanged and sinkage and trim increase i e rise up and bow up respectively for trim average error decreases from 15 22 x to 7 65 x and for sinkage average error decreases from 34 83 x to 32 58 x the δe e difference between the overset bl and single block bl grids showed that a high quality grid design was important to decrease uncertainty in the results with improved overset grid design the bottom pressure near the transom changes the area of the high pressure region at stern became smaller inducing the bow up effect 3 2 2 verification cfdship iowa verification and validation v v studies followed the detailed procedures explained in xing and stern 2010 the summary of the cfdship iowa grid verification studies are presented in table 10 verification was conducted for the 2014 setup for fr 0 43 0 62 and 0 84 the iterative uncertainty ui or the uncertainty of the value within the simulation calculations values are reported for the solution with the fine grid as percent of the fine solution s1 ui values were larger for fr 0 84 and relatively small for fr 0 62 and 0 43 grid studies achieved monotonic convergence for all variables the grid verification was satisfactory since p values were close to 1 0 meaning the numerical solutions were in the asymptotic range p is the ratio of the order of accuracy from the richardson extrapolation to the theoretical order of accuracy the numerical solutions are in the asymptotic range when the two order of accuracies are equal ug ui values were small less than 1 0 for fr 0 84 while for lower fr the ui values were at least one order of magnitude smaller than ug usn values were small between 0 6 s1 and 1 8 s1 except for σ at fr 0 43 for which usn 6 2 s1 since s1 is near zero therefore the simulation reached constant predicted values as the grid became more refined overall changes due to grid were too small further grid studies with larger refinement ratio r 2 0 or larger and perhaps coarser grids may need to be considered in the future 4 results and discussion 4 1 analysis of experiments the data was analyzed using mxn order level testing stern et al 2005 the 2015 2014 and the 2007 tests were each considered different realizations of the same test m the n order level analysis included the experimental results x for all three tests i along with the bias b x i precision p x i and total u x i uncertainties for both the 2014 and 2015 test the breakdown of bias uncertainties for each variable in the data reduction equations were shown in lee et al 2017 using the coleman and steele 1999 method the n order level analysis was not conducted for the 2007 test as the bias and precision uncertainties were not reported the mxn order level analysis included the mean facility result x standard deviation of the mean facility result std x i the bias b x precision p x the total u x uncertainty of the mean facility result and the total experimental uncertainty for each test u x i m the mean facility result x was defined as 5 x 1 m i 1 m x i the bias uncertainty of the mean facility result b x was defined as 6 b x 1 n i 1 m u x i 2 the standard deviation of the mean facility result σ x i was defined as 7 s t d x i 2 1 m 1 i 1 m x i x 2 the precision uncertainty of the mean facility result p x was defined as 8 p x 2 s t d x i m the precision uncertainty of the mxn order level analysis for each test p x i m was defined as 9 p x i m 2 s t d x i the total uncertainty of the mean facility result u x was defined as 10 u x b x 2 p x 2 the mxn total experimental uncertainty for each test u x i m was defined as 11 u x i m u x i 2 p x i m 2 the experimental results were tested to determine if there was a bias in the experiment the difference between the individual experimental results xi and the mean facility result x was defined as 12 d i x i x the uncertainty u d i was defined as the root sum squared of the uncertainties of xi and x 13 u d i u x i 2 u x 2 all three tests were state of the art d i u d i so no facility bias was included in the mxn order level analysis since the tow post was at the same forward location for the 2014 and 2007 the difference between the 2014 and 2007 experimental results d2014 2007 was also calculated figs 4 6 shows the resistance trim and sinkage for the three tests and the mean with the error bars showing the uncertainty of the mean from the mxn order level analysis table 11 table 12 and table 13 summarize the mxn order level analysis of the resistance sinkage and trim for the speeds that were tested all three years for each of the speeds the average total uncertainties and differences w presented along with the values for each year the average total uncertainties and differences of all the speeds the three lowest speeds and the three highest speeds were also calculated the three lowest speeds were evaluated because the recorded longitudinal wave cuts aft of the transom measured from the 2007 test showed that the transom was wetted at these speeds ratcliffe et al 2007 the three highest speeds were evaluated because the hull is transitioning from displacement mode to semi planing mode at these speeds the data is presented as both a percentage of the experimental value x and as a percentage of the dynamic range of the data dr for the final averages for validation at a single condition x was usually used unless x was nearly zero for validation over a range of conditions both x and dr are of interest for the evaluation of trends because x weights the error for small x values and dr weights the errors for large x values as a result the final averages are also presented as a percentage of the dynamic range because at the displacement hull speeds the sinkage trim and sinkage experimental values are small for resistance the trends look similar between the three tests fig 4 the additional speeds tested in 2015 and 2007 provided increased fidelity of the resistance curve the fr 0 36 test run shows a slight hump in the resistance that is indicative of the hull starting to transition from displacement to semi planing mode the precision uncertainty dominated the total uncertainty of the resistance for the 2014 test longer wait time between runs and additional repeat runs were implemented in the 2015 test based on the 2014 test results the precision uncertainty of the 2015 test was greatly reduced and therefore the bias uncertainty dominated the total uncertainty the bias uncertainty was nearly the same for both the 2015 and 2014 tests and therefore the total uncertainty was less for the 2015 test than the 2014 test the total uncertainty for the 2014 and 2007 tests were nearly constant across the speed range the larger total uncertainties at the low speed could be due to the unsteady transom flow at the displacement speeds at fr 0 21 0 29 and 0 83 the 2014 resistance was higher than the 2015 and 2007 resistance at fr 0 62 the 2015 resistance was lower than the 2014 and 2007 resistance these differences caused a higher standard deviation of the mean facility results and therefore the precision uncertainty of the mean dominated the total uncertainty of the mean result and the total experimental uncertainty of each test at those speeds for nearly all the conditions the total experimental uncertainty of each test was greater than the total uncertainty of the mean result showing that the standard deviation of the mean was a large driver of the total uncertainty averaged over all the froude numbers the total experimental uncertainty for each test u x i m was about twice the total uncertainty u x i the large total uncertainty and the standard deviation between the tests made it difficult to identify any facility bias as all three tests were considered state of the art with the differences between the experiments falling within the uncertainty the difference between the 2014 and 2017 test was the same order of magnitude as the total uncertainties which means the tow post location does not have a significant effect on the resistance when looking at the resistance as dr the averages were slightly lower than when using x based on the mxn order level analysis the mean facility results and the total uncertainty of the mean facility results should be used for cfd validation of the resistance for trim the trends look similar for all three tests fig 5 there is little dynamic trim at the low speeds and then there is a sharp rise in the dynamic trim the hull transitions from displacement to semi planing the additional fr 0 36 test run shows that the increase in trim starts at a slower speed than measured in 2014 the decrease in dynamic trim at the fr 1 0 test run shows that the hull is starting to transition from semi planing to fully planing the total trim uncertainties for the 2015 test are dominated by precision uncertainties but are mostly smaller than the precision uncertainties for the 2014 test the small bias uncertainties for trim are attributed to the very small bias sensitivity coefficients that are proportional to reciprocal of potentiometer separation distance i e b trim 1 l sp this small bias sensitivity is analogous to a using a longer pendulum length similar to the model s long potentiometer separation to provide a higher angular resolution the precision uncertainty has been reduced for the 2015 test by increasing the number of repeat runs and increasing the time between runs to let the tank settle for trim the bias uncertainty was smaller in 2014 than in 2015 the trim for the 2014 test was lower than the 2015 and 2007 tests at the three highest speeds this lead to a larger standard deviation of the mean total uncertainty of the mean and total experimental uncertainty at the three highest speeds the total experimental uncertainty of each test was greater than the total uncertainty of the mean result showing that the standard deviation of the mean was a large driver of the total uncertainty the difference between the 2014 and 2017 test was the same order of magnitude as the total uncertainties which means the tow post location did not have a significant effect on the trim when looking at the trim as dr the average for the low speeds and all the speeds were significantly lower than when using x this was due to the nearly zero trim of the hull at displacement speeds based on the mxn order level analysis the mean facility results and the total uncertainty of the mean facility results should be used for cfd validation of the trim for sinkage the trends look similar for all three tests fig 6 as speed increased the hull sank deeper into the water at approximately fr 0 43 3 2 m s the hull had sunk the farthest and started to rise out of the water this showed that the hull was transitioning to the semi planing regime and the hydrodynamic forces were becoming more dominant the rise of the hull to above the static sinkage at the fr 1 0 7 5 m s test run showed that the hull was starting to transition from the semi planing to fully planing regime the experimental values for sinkage were presented for all three years at the reference point of the lcg for the 2015 test the bias uncertainty dominated the precision uncertainty for both tests even though the same sensors were used to measure trim and sinkage the sinkage did not get the benefit of the small bias sensitivity coefficients the bias uncertainty was nearly constant for the 2015 test while the precision uncertainty increased in the 2015 test the sinkage for the 2014 test was higher than the 2015 and 2007 tests at the lowest speed and the sinkage for the 2014 test was lower than the 2015 and 2007 tests at the two highest speeds this led to a large standard deviation of the mean at those speeds the total experimental uncertainty of each test was greater than the total uncertainty of the mean result showing that the standard deviation of the mean was a large driver of the total uncertainty the difference between the 2014 and 2017 test was the same order of magnitude as the total uncertainties which means the tow post location does not have a significant effect on the sinkage when looking at the heave as dr the average was significantly lower than when using x this was due to the nearly zero heave of the hull at displacement and high speeds based on the mxn order level analysis the mean facility results and the total uncertainty of the mean facility results should be used for cfd validation of the sinkage the mxn order level analysis has shown that the scatter in the data between the three tests dominates the experimental uncertainty even though the uncertainty increased for the mxn order level vs n order level analysis the uncertainty is reasonable and the data set can be used for comparisons with numerical simulations uncertainty in the experimental resistance over the entire speed range of 7 80 x was reasonable for full scale powering predictions based on experience and uncertainty from other model tests this uncertainty reduces in the semi planing regime to 2 60 x the uncertainty in the resistance due to the unsteady transom flow contributes to the increased total uncertainty over the entire speed range for sinkage and trim the uncertainties are large at the low speeds displacement regime due to the unsteady transom flow and the small measured values since the hull has not moved significantly the uncertainties in the sinkage and trim while acceptable are larger than desirable the purpose of the model test was for resistance prediction and at displacement speeds the trim and sinkage are of secondary importance as the hull transitions from the displacement regime to the semi planing regime the trim and sinkage become important factors in the resulting resistance the mean facility result x and the uncertainty in the mean facility result u x for resistance trim and sinkage will be used as the experimental result and the experimental uncertainty for comparisons with simulations for two reasons the tow post location does not have a significant effect on the results and the main source of experimental uncertainty is in the scatter between the three tests 4 2 cfd comparisons with experiments an n version verification and validation analysis was conducted following the method of stern et al 2017 the cfdship iowa and star ccm simulations for both 2014 and 2015 led to four individual simulations the star ccm 2014 simulation was conducted using the sharp transom geometry while the three other simulations used the curved transom geometry the numerical uncertainty for the three highest speeds from the cfdship iowa simulations was not used in the n version analysis for two reasons first the numerical uncertainty was only calculated for three out of the twenty eight simulations second the numerical uncertainty was small compared to the standard deviation of the simulation data the n version verification included the simulation results s for all four simulations i along with the average simulation result s the n version validation included the error between the experiments and the simulation ei along with the average error e the standard deviation of the mean error std e the average absolute error e the absolute error standard deviation std e the individual uncertainty of the state of the art u soa i and the uncertainty of the state of the art for the simulation mean usoa the average simulation result s was defined as 14 s 1 n i 1 n s i the error ei was defined as 15 e i x s i the absolute error standard deviation σ e was defined as 16 s t d e 1 n 1 i 1 n e i e 2 the precision uncertainty of the individual code state of the art p e i was defined as 17 p e i 2 s t d e the precision uncertainty of the mean code state of the art p e was defined as 18 p e 2 s t d e n the individual uncertainty of the state of the art u soa i was defined as 19 u s o a i u x 2 p e i 2 u

is considered n version validated if 22 e u s o a fig 7 fig 8 and fig 9 are plots of the resistance trim and sinkage respectively the experimental mean with uncertainty of the state of the art u soa error bars and the simulation mean are plotted with dashed lines to show the trends each of the four simulations are also plotted with open shapes fig 7 shows that the trends of the experimental mean and the simulation mean have the same trend and nearly the same value at the high speeds the cfdship iowa simulations were higher at the low speeds this could possibly be caused by the attached flow of the wetted transom at low speeds table 14 shows the resistance verification and validation the large absolute error standard deviation σ e at the low speeds drives the uncertainty of the state of the art u soa to be large the standard deviation of the experiment and the standard deviation of the mean error equally contribute to the uncertainty of the state of the art at the high speeds cfdship iowa 2015 and star ccm 2015 are validated for all but one speed star ccm 2014 is validated at the lower speeds while cfdship iowa 2014 is validated at the higher speeds the validation analysis shows that the mean resistance is validated at fr 0 29 0 43 and 0 83 the absolute error and the uncertainty of the state of the art are larger at fr less than 0 25 and are smaller at the higher speeds overall the results shows that simulations can predict the resistance of semi planing hulls fig 8 shows that the simulations slightly under predict the trim at high speeds table 15 shows the trim verification and validation the uncertainties as x are large at the low speeds because the hydrostatic forces are dominating there is little change in trim and there is turbulent flow at the wetted transom the absolute error standard deviation drives the uncertainty of the state of the art at low speeds the uncertainties at low speeds are more reasonable when viewed as dr due to the larger trim angle as the hull transitions into the semi planing regime the experimental uncertainty and the absolute error standard deviation equally contribute to the uncertainty of the state of the art at the high speeds star ccm 2015 is validated at all the speeds the other simulations are validated for about half the speeds the validation analysis shows that the mean trim was not validated at any speed the absolute error and the uncertainty of the state of the art are large at fr less than 0 25 and are smaller at the higher speeds overall the results shows that simulations can predict the trim of semi planing hulls fig 9 shows that the simulation predicts slightly higher sinkage than the experiment table 16 shows the sinkage verification and validation the uncertainties as x are large at the low and high speeds due to the small values for sinkage the uncertainties are more reasonable when viewed as dr due to the sinkage reaching a maximum as the hull transitions into the semi displacement regime the experimental uncertainty and the absolute error standard deviation equally contribute to the uncertainty of the state of the art cfdship iowa for both years was validated at all the speed except fr 0 43 star ccm 2015 was validated at all the speeds except the highest speed and star ccm 2014 was validated at most of the speed the validation analysis shows that the mean trim was validated at all the speeds except at fr 0 43 and 0 81 overall the results show that simulations can predict the sinkage of semi planing hulls the simulations were able to capture the physics of a semi planing hull in the semi planing hull regime the simulations were able to predict the sinking of the hull at the higher displacement speeds where hydrodynamic forces dominate the simulations predicted the increase of the sinkage as the hydrodynamic forces started supporting the hull the simulations also correctly captured the hull rising above the initial sinkage at the highest speed showing the transition into full planing the simulations correctly showed that the hydrostatic forces dominated at low speeds with the near zero trim at the displacement speeds the simulations predicted the increase in trim in the semi displacement regime showing the hydrostatic lift as the hull vessel begins to climb the back face of the bow wave the simulations predicted the peak in the trim and the reduction of the trim in the semi planing regime as the hydrodynamic forces start to dominate the correct prediction of the hydrodynamic forces acting on the hull lead to a very good prediction of the resistance at the semi planing speeds 4 3 comparison summary a summary of the simulation validation analysis and the cfdship iowa calm water sensitivity studies are presented in table 17 the studies show that resistance has a sensitivity to the hydrostatic setup and does not have a sensitivity to the transom curvature for trim and sinkage the hydrostatic setup and transom curvature are contributors to the overall error the mean error and experimental uncertainty for resistance sinkage and trim from the r v athena test was compared to the model 5415 results from the 2010 gothenburg workshop larsson et al 2017 at a froude number of about 0 4 table 18 the mean error and experimental uncertainty for resistance was slightly lower for r v athena than model 5415 and slightly higher for trim though both were on the same order of magnitude the mean error and experimental uncertainty for sinkage and trim were higher for r v athena but are reasonable the r v athena was also compared to the ntua double chine series grigoropoulos and loukakis 2012 the r v athena and the ntua hull form are both semi planing hull designs while the r v athena has a round bilge and the ntua has two chines the comparison between the two hull forms was conducted to put the research on the r v athena in the context of other semi planing hulls the r v athena has a volume of displacement coefficient c d l v 0 1 l w l 3 of 2 11 and a length to beam ratio of 6 8 the ntua condition used for comparison had a cdl of 2 23 and a length to beam ratio of 7 figs 10 12 shows the total resistance coefficient the trim and the heave comparisons the total resistance coefficient was higher for the ntua than for the r v athena this is most likely due to the higher displacement of the ntua hull the trim showed the same trend for both hulls with the ntua trim being offset higher than the r v athena the sinkage in the displacement regime for both hulls was the same for both hulls above fr 0 4 the semi planing regime the ntua started to rise faster than the r v athena with increasing speed 5 conclusions this study has shown that simulations can be used for calm water predictions and the next step will be taken to simulate the semi planing hull in waves the mxn order level analysis has shown that the scatter in the data between the three experiments dominates the experimental uncertainty at the higher speeds the uncertainties are small enough to be used for comparisons with simulations and for powering predictions in a detailed craft design the analysis showed that the difference in the results based on the tow post location was within the noise of the other experimental uncertainties the n version analysis of the four simulations shows that the scatter in results for both the experiments and the simulations drives the state of the art uncertainty the resistance trim and sinkage was validated at a variety of speeds for individual codes and the simulation mean both codes showed the capability to predict design variables using similar setups grid sizes etc this shows that the simulations can be used for powering predictions in craft design the large error and uncertainty is most likely due to the wetted transom as the simulations show the transom wetted at speeds below fr 0 25 where the error and uncertainty is the largest unlike displacement hulls at displacement speeds the wetted transom of a semi planing hull at displacement speeds exhibited a very turbulent flow bhushan et al 2012 have shown that much finer grieds and des are required for accurate resolution predictions of wetted transom flow this study has shown the importance of experimental setup and the initial conditions of numerical simulations when comparing experimental and numerical simulation results the errors due to the hydrostatic setup proved to be a contributor to the overall error this means that the loading condition of a craft design must be well known before experiments or simulations are run to ensure that the predictions are accurate more care in the experimental setup is needed to try to reduce the experimental uncertainty for sinkage and trim the transom radius had an impact on the error in trim and sinkage credit authorship contribution statement evan j lee conceptualization methodology investigation validation investigation

20403,the double stepped design of lifting surfaces planing in water has been seen to benefit the calm water performance by distributing forces over the washed area the unsteady motion of such surfaces in waves however is not well understood it is not clear how steps can influence the response of a planing vessel operating in waves in the presented research this problem is analyzed by developing a model which is established using a 2d t framework meanwhile a cfd set up is also designed to numerically replicate the motion of double stepped planing hulls subjected to gravity waves it is demonstrated the results of both models agree performing mathematical simulations it is demonstrated that a double stepped design can decrease the heave and pitch responses of the vessel in the resonance zone more importantly mathematical data confirms that wave induced motions of a vessel are highly sensitive to the heights of steps a vessel with a shorter front step has smaller vertical responses especially over the resonance zone while it may have larger vertical acceleration at high speeds this is caused by the larger washed area of the middle surface which can increase damping forces while it allows larger wave forces to impact the vessel keywords double stepped planing hull seakeeping wave induced motions mathematical simulation cfd simulation abbreviations amg algebraic

1900s among different types of designs planing hulls have always been considered as one of the popular hullforms that can well operate at high speeds these vessels have been used for high speed operations in the sea since the early 20 century in the late 1950s and early 1960s a new generation of planing hulls emerged savitsky 1985 a step which leads the water flow to be separated from it was proposed to be added to their bottom fig 1 at the first stage such a design was found to be very interesting and attracted the attentions of different groups of boat designers a set of papers and reports including the calm water performance of these hulls were published in 1960s 1980s e g clement and pope 1961 clement and desty 1980 but it was eventually reported that due to the unbalanced distribution of hydrodynamic pressure over the wetted surface of a single stepped boat the occurrence probability of instability may be intensified at high speeds the problem with the instability of single stepped boats slowed down their applications in coastal seas in the early 2000s a new design approach for stepped boats was suggested instead of one two transverse steps were used on the bottom which on the whole were seen to modify the pressure distribution over the entire length of boats this type of design which is known as double stepped hullform was seen to lead to smaller resistance force and trim angle the angle between baseline and calm water line the good performance of this type of vessel attracted renewed attention of boat designers there is an accumulative series of research analyzing their performance in calm water conditions confirming their satisfactory performance in a smooth sea the steady planing problem of the double stepped planing hulls has been well understood experimental studies have been performed taunton et al 2010 lee et al 2014 numerical and mathematical approaches have also been used to model their calm water performance veysi and ghassemi 2016 de marco et al 2017 dashtimanesh et al 2018 niazmand bilandi et al 2018 niazmand bilandi et al 2019a esfandiari et al 2019 du et al 2019 hydrodynamic of double stepped planing hulls in waves however is unclear the steps lead to ventilation areas and distribute forces over the bottom of the vessel garland and maki 2012 added mass and damping forces moments of the middle body are expected to be scant compared to the front and rear surfaces as the middle surface is nearly dry compared to a stepless design the performance of a double stepped body in waves can be different to understand the effects of steps on the performance of planing hulls exposed to water waves their dynamic motion should be modeled the dynamic of ships in waves also known as seakeeping has been modeled by many researchers since the early 1950s ideal flow assumption zero viscosity hypothesis and the linear potential theory are used to model the problem using these assumptions radiation along with diffraction problems emerge solutions to these problems give the added mass damping force and exciting force at different frequencies the linear theory and these two problems are well explained in newman 1977 radiation and diffraction problems have been seen to be solved in the frequency domain by applying different analytical methods laplace equation governs domain which represents the continuity equations for an incompressible fluid flow with zero viscosity depending on the physics of the problem different methods including eigenfunction matching multiploe methods green integration among others can be used a very deep overview of these methods is presented in linton and mciver 2001 for the case of ships the strip theory can also be used salvesen et al 1970 ogilvie and tuck 1969 which utilizes the sectional damping and added mass coefficients of ship section those which can be computed by using lewis section the radiation problem related to a two dimensional cylinder is solved and then is mapped to the sections of the ship this method has been seen to be valid for the case of displacement hulls for the case of a planing hull advancing in water waves some difficulties emerge since the vessel positions itself at a non zero dynamic trim angle and the centre of gravity cg locates at a different level compared to zero speed condition hydrodynamic pressure turns into an important contributor to the generation of fluid forces in this case the linear potential assumption can lead to different physics which is far from what happens in reality and classical frequency dependent added mass and damping coefficients may not be consistent with real physics simply stated the response of the vessel in the vertical direction is expected to be high and it starts to oscillate leading to large variation in the wetted area of the vessel in this situation added mass and damping coefficients are likely to be response dependent which is different from the classical linear theory definition therefore non linear based models can have been more accurate in this case zarnick 1978 developed a nonlinear model for the mathematical replication of the motion of planing hulls in waves the problem was solved in the time domain while another time scale was used to model the motion of the sections of the boat i e the sectional motions of the boat were modeled through a qusie steady approach the sectional forces were found using added mass forces the model gave response dependent added mass forces and exciting forces it was seen that it can simulate the motion of vessels with a high level of accuracy the model is also known as the 2d t method the application of zarnick s model was later extended to other planing motions such as steady performance and asymmetric drift motions where the model was expected to be consistent with real physics to a higher level xu et al 1999 sebastiani et al 2008 ghadimi et al 2016 dashtimanesh et al 2019 the reason was that zarnick s model assumes that sectional forces emerge from the added mass forces and the frequency of fluid motion around the section is infinite the model has been seen to be used for modeling of the maneuvering motion of planning hulls and acceptable performance of the model is reported while its accuracy is still required to be modified tavakoli and dashtimanesh 2019 in the recent year the 2d t method is used to simulate steady performance of the double stepped planing hulls niazmand bilandi et al 2020 this model is developed by assuming that the water separation from step follows the transom wave theories the general idea comes from the work of savitsky and morabito 2010 who formulated the transom wave in the lee of the vessel aiming to provide a non sophisticated formulation for performance prediction of stepped planing hulls niazmand bilandi et al 2020 used this idea by simplifying it they assumed that the transom wave has a linear shape as the water flowing toward the lifting surface behind the step travels a relatively small distance in such a condition the steep waves cannot be developed and a linear shape can be assumed for the water flow separated from the step it has been observed that it has a great level of accuracy but no mathematical model has been developed for the unsteady motion of double stepped hulls subjected to water waves while there is a pressing need to simulate seakeeping of these hulls as explained earlier meanwhile the computational fluid dynamics cfd has been applied for simulation of seakeeping of ships and boats in the last two decades it has been reported that cfd models can predict the response of the ships boats exposed to water waves with reliable accuracy cfd models solve turbulent viscous flow around ships boats allowing us to model high order phenomena such as turbulent dissipation emerging during the mutual interaction between water waves and ships e g in huang et al 2020 of course such a phenomenon cannot be easily modeled through mathematical modeling as many simplifications occur when these models are developed while cfd models are very popular and accurate they are time consuming they are not recommended to be used in the case a boat ship has not been designed they are better to be utilized in the last stages of the design of a ship the comparison between mathematical and cfd models can let us know how their results can differ for the case of double stepped planing hulls experimental tests highlighting their seakeeping in head sea condition lacks at the current stage therefore cfd models can be used to model their problem and their results can be compared against those of 2d t model of course such a comparison cannot be considered as a validation study but it can provide important messages regarding the performance of both models low differences between their results can show that they both are performing well enough to be used for improving our understanding of the problem the present paper aims to fill the gap in modeling of planing motion of stepped surfaces in water waves by offering two models including a nonlinear mathematical model and a cfd one the mathematical model is established by extending the zarnick s method for double stepped planing hulls the cfd model is developed based on a finite volume method and an overset technique which is applied to model the rigid body motion the 2d t model and an example of the cfd set up that can be used to simulate vertical motions of a double stepped planing hull were previously presented in a conference proceeding niazmand bilandi et al 2019 but the details of the 2d t model and the way that it is developed were not presented in addition the presented results were restricted to one forcing condition and one design in the present research the 2d t model is explained in detail moreover a wide range of results is presented which provides us with an understanding regarding the effects of step on the vertical motion of double stepped planing hulls advancing in waves the present paper is outlined as follows the mathematical model and cfd model are respectively presented in sections 2 and 3 the validity of models in replication of the steady performance of the vessel in calm water is evaluated in section 4 a comparison between the results of cfd and the mathematical model is presented in section 5 results of the paper are presented in section 6 and it is shown how a double stepped design can affect the dynamic response of a planing vessel in waves section 7 includes the concluding remarks 2 the 2dof mathematical model 2 1 formulating the dynamic motion consider a hard chine vessel with two bottom steps operates at planing regime which is identified as fr b 2 0 here fr b u g b 1 and represents beam froude number u is the speed of the vessel b is its beam and g is the gravity acceleration the water surface the interface between water and air may have elevation i e water waves can exist assume that water waves are monochromatic unidirectional and propagate toward the boat with an encounter angle of π the angle between wave direction and boat speed is defined as the encounter angle the boat is supposed to perform in an open sea condition i e the spatial domain is not bounded at all the water depth is assumed to be deep enough to satisfy a deep water wave condition surface waves are assumed to be linear and no wave breaking and modulation instability occur i e linear wave theory also known as airy theory governs the surface waves the water surface elevation at any point therefore obeys 1 ζ a cos κ x ω t ε in eq 1 a is the amplitude of wave ω 2 π t is the wave angular frequency κ 2 π λ is the wave number and ε is the phase shift of the wave t is the wave period and λ is the wave number κ is found using the deep water dispersion equation given by 2 κ g 1 ω 2 heave and pitch motions are assumed to be induced by water waves sway and yaw motions are assumed to be scant and are neglected no roll motion is also allowed assuming that thrust force passes through the cg of the vessel motion equations can be formulated as 3 m z f z w i θ m θ in eq 3 m and i are mass and pitch inertia of the vessel f z and m θ respectively refer to vertical force and pitching moment generated by fluid flow w is the weight force eq 3 shows the relative motion of a body frame attached to cg of the vessel with respect to a hydrodynamic frame which advances with the vessel and never has any oscillations both frames are right handed and are positive downward both of these coordinate systems are shown in fig 2 2 2 model development the body of a double stepped planing hull consists of three lifting surface including front corresponding to x x s 1 x b middle x x s 2 x s 1 and rear x x t x s 2 surfaces x s 1 and x s 2 respectively refer to the longitudinal positions of the front and rear steps in body frame x b and x t refer to the longitudinal positions of the bow and transom in the aforementioned frame the length of each planing surfaces is found as 4 l 1 x b x s 1 5 l 2 x s 1 x s 2 6 l 3 x s 2 x t it is hypothesized that heave force and the pitching moment acting on the body of the double stepped planing hull can be divided into three components each of which separately acts on one of aforementioned lifting surfaces therefore the fluid vertical and angular forces are re written as 7 f z i 1 3 f z i m θ i 1 3 m θ i in eq 7 f z i and m θ i respectively denote the heaving and pitching forces acting on a single planing surface it is hypothesized that water flowing toward the surface behind each step tends to travel linearly the schematic of this assumption is drawn in fig 3 this assumption is known as the linear transom wave theory and has been observed to be relatively true for the case of double stepped planing hulls when water partiality washes the planing surfaces dashtimanesh et al 2018 following this theory the ventilation area corresponding to each planing surface identified with i may be written as 8 l v i h s i 1 tan θ θ i i 2 3 here h s i 1 is the height of each step θ is the pitch angle and θ i is the local pitch angle note that the basis of assumption made to compute the wetted area behind step can be found in the work of savitsky and morabito 2010 they hypothesized that the profile of the water surface behind a step is similar to that of a transom wave they performed a series of experimental tests and reported non sophisticated equations to compute the water surface profile in the present research their hypothesis is simplified and the transom wave is assumed to have a linear shape the reason for such a simplification is that the wetted surface of each planing surface is small and thus the developed transom wave is not steep 2 2 1 sectional forces the sectional forces of the vessel are found using the 2d t model a water entry problem is used to replicate the planing motion at any time step to understand this method it is required to view the problem from an observation plane locating in the path of the vessel as shown in upper panel of fig 4 this theory can also be used for the double stepped hulls by assuming that three water entry problems occur as displayed in lower panel of fig 4 consider that a wedge section enters water hydrodynamic force acting on a section is assumed to be generated by momentum variation and cross drag flow payne 1995 which is given by 9 f d t a v c c d ρ c v 2 here d t is the material derivative a is the added mass of the section v is the relative vertical speed of the section c c d is the cross ﬂow drag coefficient c is half wetted beam for of each section and ρ is the fluid density the first term of eq 9 found using a lagrangian approach can be expanded as 10 d t a v a v v a u x a v here u is the relative longitudinal speed of a section the method for computation of added mass and watted length of section is explained in appendix a overall the above equations show that sectional forces are found using momentum variation which depends on the instant added mass of the section the added mass of the section is computed by utilizing the solution of a water entry problem i e a radiation problem with an infinite frequency known as wagner solution is applied and then added mass of the section is formulated such a hypothesis might not fit with the real physics when a vessel oscillates in any direction fluid motion around any section of it is likely to oscillate with the same frequency but such an inconsistency has been found not to be a big worry as the water entry problem has been reported to have proper accuracy in computation of the sectional forces of a boat advancing in waves the relative local speeds of any section of the vessel are computed by using the heave speed of the boat z pitch rate θ vertical velocity of the free surface and boat speed u as 11 v z w z cos θ θ j u sin θ θ j θ ξ 12 u u cos θ θ j z w z sin θ θ j here w z is the vertical speed of the fluid motion caused by the water waves to find more accurate sectional force it is also assumed that gravity can generate buoyant forces which can be calculated by 13 f h s 2 d 0 5 2 ρ g c h w x here the product of c and h w x gives the sectional wetted area here h w x is the sectional water depth that varies locally g is the gravity acceleration constant this wetted area includes the additional area caused by water pile up known as wagner condition sectional forces are used to derive equations for heave force and pitch moment later 2 2 2 hydrodynamic forces acting on the body hydrodynamic force acting on a single planing surface is computed separately to do so it is needed to integrate forces of sections over the length of the surface sectional force contains momentum variation cross drag and buoyant forces as shown earlier equations 14 gives the integration of sectional forces in heave direction as follows 14 f z i l i t i x d t a v c c d ρ c v 2 d x cos θ θ j l i t i x f h s 2 d d x i 1 2 3 in this equation t i is the transom modification function the upper and lower limits of integration have been presented in eqs 4 through 6 note that the direction of buoyant force is different from that of the sectional forces computed by 13 the transom and steps are all hypothesized to modify the sectional forces i e the kutta condition governs at steps and transom and thus forces should converge zero at related sections a transom modification function can be implemented to serve this aim mathematically this function will be presented later by computing the moment of sectional forces with respect to centre of gravity the pitching moment of each single surface is formulated as 15 m θ i l i t i x d t a v c c d ρ c v 2 x d x l i t i x f h s 2 d x d x i 1 2 3 the effects of transom on sectional forces are activated by using a tangent hyperbolic function this function gives a value of zero as x x t i and also converges 1 0 as x such a behaviour agrees with the real physics the aforementioned function was proposed by garme 2005 and is given by 16 t i x tanh 2 5 c x x t i i 1 2 3 here c is a coefficient that determines the location at which transom effects emerge this coefficient is a function of beam froude number and approaches as fr c is recommended to be found by garme 2005 17 c 0 34 b fr b i 1 2 3 for more technical information regarding eqs 16 and 17 and the way they have been formulated please refer to garme 2005 the effects of transom function on sectional forces appear at different stations that are given by 18 x t i x s i i 1 2 19 x t i x t i 3 the equations for three dimensional forces can be developed by summing the sectional forces integration of the 2d forces over the entire length of each planing surface gives the three dimensional force thus the three dimensional heave force of each lifting surface is formulated as 20 f z i m i cos θ θ i z m i θ m i θ z cos θ θ i u cos θ θ j f z i ① f z i ② f z i ③ f z i ④ f z i ⑤ f z i ⑥ f z i ⑦ cos θ θ i l i t i x f h s d x i 1 2 3 by using the same approach the pitching moment generated by the water flow is formulated as 21 m θ i m i cos θ θ j z m i θ m i θ z sin θ θ j u cos θ θ j m θ i ① m θ i ② m θ i ③ m θ i ④ m θ i ⑤ m θ i ⑥ m θ i ⑦ l i t i x f h s 2 d x d x i 1 2 3 note that the force and moment presented in equations 20 and 21 are three dimensional and formulated by the expansion of the two dimensional forces each of the above equations contains several terms the first three terms indicate the added mass contribution in the body frame these terms are a result of integration of sectional added mass terms are shown with m i the fourth terms in equations 20 and 21 are products of added mass force and velocities which is an absolute nonlinear term some terms are shown by superscripts bounded in a circle these terms refer to the forces moments generated by integration of the added mass rate along with cross drag force formulations for these terms are all presented in appendix b note that terms that are indicated with ① ④ are wave forces and others refer to response dependent damping forces moments last terms in both equations are the buoyant forces moments these terms represent the stiffness mechanism contribution to total forces moments acting on the vessel advancing in waves note that it was previously described that forces are in vertical direction added mass forces moments that are shown with m are given by 22 m i l i t i x a d x i 1 2 3 23 m i l i t i x a x d x i 1 2 3 24 m i l i t i x a x 2 d x i 1 2 3 2 2 3 motion equations the movement of the boat is formulated using the rigid body law as explained earlier forces are substituted in the motion equation and give a set of differential equations as 25 m a z z z a z θ θ f z w a θ z z i a θ θ θ m θ here the summation of m terms are defined as the added mass coefficients and are extracted from the fluid forces and transferred to the left hand side of both equations which helps us to simulate the problem over the time domain added mass terms are shown with a z z a z θ a θ z and a θ θ equation 25 governs the motion of the vessel advancing in waves and is needed to be solved over the time the rest of the forces are kept in the right hand side of the equations and are formulated as 26 f z i 1 3 f z i a z z z a z θ θ m θ i 1 3 m θ i a θ z z a θ θ θ added mass coefficients are given by 27 a z z i 1 3 m i cos 2 θ θ i 28 a z θ i 1 3 m i cos θ θ i 29 a θ z i 1 3 m i cos θ θ i 30 a θ θ i 1 3 m i equations 28 and 29 present a z θ and a θ z the instant values of these two added mass terms are equal it important to note that the added mass terms are influenced by the response of the vessel simply stated they are time dependent and are different from the classical added mass coefficients formulated in linear theory moreover it should be noted that the force and moment identified with a superscript contain damping restoring and non linear mechanisms the formulation developed for added mass coefficients and forces show that the developed model treats the problem by considering non linearities of the fluid motion under such an assumption the problem is not solved in the frequency domain instead it is solved over the time which will be explained the motion equation of double stepped planing hull can be is re written in a vector form as 31 m x f where m is the mass matrix and x z t θ t is the displacement vector f is the force vector the mass matrix and force vector are defined as 32 m m a z z a z θ a θ z i a θ θ at any time interval the acceleration vector is found as 33 x m 1 f using acceleration vector velocity vector x and displacement vector x are computed as 34 x x dt 35 x x dt in each time step there will be a phase lag between waves and the motion of the vessel but the phase lag of the vessel is not of interest in the present research and we will not present the related data in the case that the wave height is set to be zero the steady motion of the vessel is replicated the vessel reaches the dynamic equilibrium in this condition the vertical force generated by fluid equals the weight force in addition the pitching moment is zero as the center of pressure settles at cg 2 2 4 drag forces the drag force is assumed not to have any contribution in vertical motions of the vessel it is hypothesized that this force is only generated by water flow and air drag is assumed to be nil three different components are assumed to cause the drag acting on the bottom of the vessel as 36 d d f d p d s here d f is the frictional drag that is generated by the shear stresses near the wall of the vessel d p is the drag force that is induced by the hydrodynamic pressure note that for the case of a planing surface pressure distribution in longitudinal direction is not symmetric at all and it is expected that pressure generates a large amount of force d s is the spray drag that is common to occur in the bow of planing surfaces as an amount of water jet flows toward the bow of the vessel leading to generation of spray the idea used for computation of hydrodynamic forces is also used to compute the drag forces i e drag force acting on each planing surface is computed separately and then the total drag forces are computed drag forces are found by 37 d f i 1 3 d f i 38 d p i 1 3 d p i 39 d s i 1 3 d s i the frictions drag force of each planing surface denoted with d is computed by using the ittc recommendation ittc 1978 as 40 d f i 0 5 c f δ c f ρ u 2 s i where c f is the frictional drag coefficients and δ c f is the additional friction coefficient due to roughness of the surface s i is the area washed by water wetted area of each planing surface is computed by 41 s i 2 b cos β β j the frictional drag coefficient is found by 42 c f 0 075 logr e 2 2 where r e is the reynolds number reynolds number of the whole planing vessel is used for each planing surface as 43 r e ν 1 u l k here ν is the kinematic viscosity of water l k is the total summation of the keel length washed by water and the ventilation areas given by 44 l k i 1 3 l k i i 2 3 l v i keel wetted length of each surface can be computed by 45 l k i x k i x t i d x the drag force generated by pressure is found as 46 d p i l i t i x d t a v c c d 0 5 ρ c v 2 d x sin θ θ i i 1 2 3 the spray drag acting on each planing surface is computed by 47 d s i f i cos γ i i 1 2 3 where f i is given by 48 f i c f 0 5 ρ v 2 b 2 4 sin γ i cos β β i i 1 2 3 γ i is the angle between the whisker spray edge and the keel line in waterplane area given by 49 γ i tan 1 π tan θ θ i 2 tan β β i i 1 2 3 here β i is the local effective deadrise angle the formulations presented for computation of the spray drag are all taken from savitsky et al 2007 3 the numerical model consider a three dimensional spatial domain with a cartesian right handed coordinate system of oxyz the vessel is assumed to be exposed to waves in this domain which is spanned within x o x x i y l y y r and h z h a a schematic showing this domain and the vessel is presented in fig 5 the velocity field in the whole domain is presented by v x t v x x t v y x t v z x t t which may vary over the time consider that fluid around the vessel which can contain the mixture of water and air is viscous and also incompressible continuity of the mass flow and momentum conservation hold the domain in this condition hence reynolds averaged navier stokes equations rans govern the motion of fluid at any point in the fluid domain as 50 v 0 51 t ρ v ρ vv μ v p f b v μ in y y b here ρ is the density of the mixture of the air and water p in the above equations refer to the pressure also μ is the dynamic viscosity of the air water mixture the fluid flow is assumed to be turbulent and turbulent viscosity is expected to affect the shear stresses and thus the velocity field a k ϵ model is used for this aim details of the turbulent model are explained in appendix c the two phase flow is modeled using a volume fraction method a fraction shown by γ is defined which represents the fraction of water over air at any point a conservation equation governs on this fraction in the whole domain as 52 t γ ρ v γ 0 in y y b viscosity and density of the fluid in every point of the domain are found locally as 53 μ 1 γ μ air μ water 54 ρ 1 γ ρ air ρ water a numerical wave maker is prescribed at x x f that generates surface waves as 55 ζ x f t a exp i ω t which propagate toward the vessel where i 1 water waves are expected to follow the linear water wave theory as they are set to have gentle steepness waves propagate toward the left end of domain and are damped at λ o and λ l in λ l order to stop any reflection of wave energy from boundaries of the domain this forcing conditions replicates a head sea wave condition which is modeled in the present research water and air are prescribed to flow toward the boat from λ i with a velocity of u also flow with velocity of u is also set on λ l which provides and open water condition around the vessel the zero gradient pressure and zero gradient velocity govern on every point of λ o which matches with an outlet boundary condition on the walls of the boat a no slip condition is satisfied i e u x λ b d t λ b as the vessel has no yaw and sway motion and also is not heeled the fluid motion is expected to be symmetry with respect to the xz plane therefore a symmetry boundary shown by λ s is defined which accelerates the simulations and reduces the storage of data as well the upper patch of the domain λ u is set to act as an inlet with a constant velocity being equal to that of the vessel this provides a perfect open sea condition all the aforementioned boundaries conditions are summarized in table 1 motion equations can be solved using rigid body equations over the time the force f and moment m vectors acting on the planing body are computed as 56 f λ b p σ n d λ b 57 m λ b p σ n r d λ b here σ is the normal stress tensor n is the normal vector and r is the distance vector the solution of a rigid body dynamic equations provides the values of instant heave and pitch of the solid body over the time all the presented equations including the fluid and rigid body motions are solved by using a cfd code starccm star ccm 2011 an implicit approach is used for decomposing the unsteady terms the temporal terms are discretized by applying a 2nd order method the convection terms are decomposed by embarking a 2nd order method the gradient discretization is performed through hybrid least squares lsq approach the fluid equations are numerically solved by using a simple semi implicit method for pressure linked equations algorithm the algebraic system of equations is numerically solved by applying an agm algebraic multi grid method the two phase flow is solved by using the vof method as explained earlier the convection of the vof is modeled by using an hric high resolution interface capturing method the dynamic response of the rigid body is solved by employing a dfbi dynamic fluid body interaction planar motion carriage framework the mesh motion is treated with an overset technique the rigid body is placed in a region which moves with the planing vessel therefore no re meshing or deformation of the cells occurs over time an interpolation between the background region and the overset region is performed by utilizing a linear method the computation grid is generated by using the toolbox of the cfd code starccm star ccm 2011 as well the strategy for grid design is based on the previous numerical researches highlighting the wave ship wave structure interaction examples can be found in tezdogan et al 2015 mousaviraad et al 2015 and huang et al 2019 cells are set to be fine near the free surface and the hull surface where fluid is expected to be strongly turbulent and shear stresses should be computed with a high level of accuracy higher resolution is applied for the cells covering the wake of the vessel to ensure that the wake effects are captured and modeled properly since an overset method is used for dynamic simulations cells are not deformable at all a layout of the mesh used for the simulation of the problem is shown in fig 6 please note that it is ensured that the wave height locates in about 20 cells different grids are generated using a mesh refinement ratio of 2 the summary of these grids is shown in table 2 a mesh sensitive study is performed and it is found that g3 can be used for numerical replication of the problem the summary of the mesh sensitive study is presented in appendix d also the accuracy of the model in the generation of gravity waves is evaluated in appendix e a personal computer pc equipped with a 3 1 ghz intel 12 processors and 36 gb memory is used to run simulations each simulation is run over 60 000 time steps every single simulation required nearly 100 h on the machine 4 case conditions mathematical and numerical simulations are performed for two sets of planing models these models are designed and presented in two of the previous research taunton et al 2010 lee et al 2014 highlighting performance of stepped planing hulls effects of step and their location on the resistance and running attitude of planing hulls are evaluated and discussed in the related papers the first planing model set is designed at the university of southampton by taunton et al 2010 effects of two steps on the performance of a planing model were studied and it was observed that two steps can highly decrease the resistance of the vessel the stepless and double stepped boats are named as models c and c2 respectively both vessels have similar body plans and are 2 m long but one has two transverse steps located at 0 158l and 0 31l the mean deadrise angle of these vessels is 22 5 which is the most common deadrise angle used for planing hulls performing in the real sea body plans of the models are shown in fig 7 and their dimensions as well as other principal characteristics are listed in table 3 dynamic motions of models c and c2 are simulated in the head sea condition in the present research by applying both cfd and 2d t models a comparison between the obtained results can be very helpful in verifying the accuracy level of the 2d t model in addition dynamic responses of model c and c2 are compared against each other this can improve our understanding of the effects of steps on the movement of a planing craft in waves the second planing model set is designed in virginia tech in the early 2010s the related hulls are developed to study the effects of step height on the performance of a double stepped planing surface two models including case 4 and case 6 are selected to be studied in the present research the first mode case 4 has two steps with different heights of 0 007b and 0 021b the second one named case 6 has two steps with similar heights of 0 014b a comparison between dynamic responses of cases 4 and 6 can increase our understanding of the influence of the step height on the dynamic response of a double stepped planing craft in waves details of these two models are also presented in table 3 the body lines corresponding to these models are shown in fig 7 the wave forcing condition used in the current research is also presented in table 4 waves cover a wide range of wavelengths that can provide us with rao plots all waves are set to have gentle steepness these forcing conditions are selected from the research of begovic et al 2014 who studied the unsteady motion of warped planing hulls 5 calm water performance tests a validation study before performing a study on dynamic responses calm water performance of the different hulls are computed using cfd and 2d t methods aiming to check their validity in computing hydrodynamic forces and the equilibrium condition of the double stepped vessels in calm water condition it is very important to note that there is no experimental work highlighting the dynamic of double stepped craft advancing in planing regime therefore we have first validated both cfd and 2d t methods in modeling the calm water performance then we have compared dynamic motion results computed by these two models against each other in the next section the calm water experiments are performed by setting waves to have a steepness of zero in both models thus the water surface will be in equilibrium condition the boat has heave and pitch motions both of which converge to steady values steady heave and pitch give dynamic trim angle and cg rise up of the vessel 5 1 calm water tests for models c and c2 a sample of the calm water tests of model c and c2 at froude number of 4 77 is shown in fig 8 as seen initial values are set for heave and pitch and then simulations are run over time up to the time they converge both cfd and 2d t results are observed to provide results close to experimental data dashed red line as mentioned earlier steady planing simulations are run for every single froude numbers to model the calm water operation of model c2 i e similar to what is presented in fig 8 the motion of the model c2 in a calm water condition is run for all speeds and the data is found the summary of simulations is presented in fig 9 trim angle and resistance of the vessel are both presented trim angle of the vessel is expected to reach small values at high beam froude numbers i e fr 4 both cfd and 2d t models are seen to follow this behavior at small froude numbers a peak in trim angle vs fr plot can be seen cfd model can well capture this peak but 2d t method is not able to do so there might be some reasons for this fact the most probable one is the low speed of the vessel which can affect the validity of the 2d t model at such a speed for instance the transom might not get fully dried and the ventilation may not follow the linear wake theory also the 2d t theory is expected to have better accuracy at higher speed where the solution of the infinity frequency water penetration assumption used for commutation of sectional forces is likely to be consistent with the physics of the motion computed values for the drag are also presented in figure the drag force becomes larger by the increase in froude number as it should cfd and 2d t model are seen to provide data with good accuracy both of these methods however can slightly over predict the drag force at very high speed note that the cfd results have been previously presented in niazmand bilandi et al 2020 as the same set up was used here it should be clarified that the cfd setup used in the present research is an extension of what was performed in niazmand bilandi et al 2020 the key difference between the cfd set up used here and the one used in the previous research is the ability of the present set up in modeling of the wave induced simulations the data presented in this sub section is related to the calm water performance operation and thus the extended set up which is able to model the wave induced motion of the vessel is not run for this case therefore the data of the previous research is plotted in fig 9 please note that the cfd results that are presented in section 6 and also appendix f are run with the cfd set up designed in the present research all of the results in section 6 are related to wave induced motions of a double stepped planing hull 5 2 calm water tests for cases 4 and 6 trim angle and drag force of cases 4 and 6 are also simulated by using the steady simulations of the 2d t model the cfd simulations of the wave induced motions are only performed for model c2 the results of which are presented in section 6 the reason is that cfd simulations need a long time to be performed which is nearly 100 h this time is much longer compared to the time the mathematical model is run in addition the set up for the cfd model is designed to provide some additional data which can be used for evaluating the behavior of the developed mathematical model as it was mentioned earlier there is no experimental data highlighting seakeeping of stepped planing hulls hence cfd runs are performed to evaluate the differences between the results of cfd and 2d t model in the computation of wave induced motions of the vessel which are present in section 6 to sum cfd simulations are not run for cases 4 and 6 the computed values are compared against experimentally measured data the computed trim angle is seen to be close to the experimental data but it diverges from experiments at the highest speed for the case 6 this divergence is not significant overall 2d t method has seen to have reasonable accuracy level in modeling of the steady performance of the case 4 and case 6 the steady heave values computed by both cfd and 2d t models are seen to follow each other some differences might be caused by the errors in the prediction of the trim angle as it was seen the trim angle was under predicted so the vessel settles down at a lower height to establish the balance between the weight and fluid vertical force the related data is shown in fig 10 2d t model is again seen to follow the experimentally measured drag forces there are still some over predictions which are seen to be greater for case 6 to summarize the 2d t model is seen to provide a reasonable level of accuracy in computation of the performance of the cases 4 and 6 there are some errors the source of which can be studied in future 6 cfd vs mathematical model in the previous section both models were used to reproduce the steady performance of double stepped planing hulls advancing in still water runs were performed over the time to evaluate their accuracy level in prediction of the steady performance the accuracy level of both methods were observed to be promising in this section the results of cfd and 2d t models in replication of unsteady planing motion are compared against each other as mentioned earlier no experimental based published paper report highlighting regular wave effects on stepped planing surfaces is available therefore it is attempted to compare the results obtained by cfd and 2d t against each other to verify that both methods can work relatively accurate but one point should be mentioned here the present simulations are performed for the case of double stepped planing hulls the accuracy of the 2d t model in simulation of wave induced motions of stepless boats has been previously observed in a wide range of studies in addition another version of the present cfd model which was designed to model wave induced motions of a stepless boat was previously tested by the authors motions of a hard chine vessel operating in regular waves was modeled replicated by cfd and 2d t model the results were presented in tavakoli et al 2020 note that the cfd set up used in the related paper was different from the one used here the difference was the mesh structure around the vessel which was particular to a stepless boat so it can be concluded that an early version of the present cfd set up has been previously seen to compute the vertical motions of stepless boat advancing in waves with a fair level of accuracy model c2 is tested in all forcing conditions at two beam froude numbers of 2 94 and 3 83 heave and pitch response along vertical acceleration at cg are sampled at each time step the data are presented in this section fig 11 shows the heave response of the model c2 two panels are displayed showing the heave rao at two beam froude numbers of 2 94 and 3 83 the wavelengths ranging from 2l to 4l are marked with gray color as they can cause the highest response and are of interest in the present research the reference line referring to wave amplitude is also plotted the dashed red line if the plotted data is below the line it imposes that rigid body motions are smaller than that of the waves otherwise it signifies that the rigid body motion is greater compared to wave motion as observed both cfd and 2d t model predict that heave resonance occurs at the marked area at wavelengths larger than 2 0 2d t model has seen to compute weaker heave response the inconsistency between two models can cause such a difference the cfd model can compute water fluid oscillation around the sections but 2d t model do not consider oscillation for fluid flow instead it assumes that water and solid body mutually interact with a very high frequency it can lead to smaller sectional forces as the waves become longer inasmuch as gravity effects becomes more significant it is interesting to note that authors have seen such a difference between cfd and 2d t results in stimulation of heave response of a stepless boat readers who are interested are invited to find related technical discussions in tavakoli et al 2020 pitch response of model c2 is presented in fig 12 the dashed red line shows the reference line referring to the wave steepness it can be seen that both cfd and 2d t models capture a reassurance at a wavelength being between 2l and 4l at speed of 6 25 m s at the higher speed it can be seen that both models predict that the pitch response converges a constant value as wavelengths becomes longer than 2l again the cfd model predicts higher values the possible reason for the differences between the results of the two models is assumptions made for each of them the 2d t model neglects the gravity and computes sectional forces for an infinite frequency this might lead to larger damping forces and smaller exciting forces especially over the resonance zone where motions are significant vertical acceleration of model c2 at its cg is computed by both methods the related data is shown in fig 13 both models have predicted that vertical acceleration can reach higher values at resonance zone but 2d t model gives large values for vertical accelerations induced by short waves e g 1l such a difference can be attributed to the method by which forces are computed it has been previously observed that when waves are short 2d t model might compute negative sectional forces that can lead to large variation of vertical force in a single cycle which consequences in larger vertical accelerations compared with what is computed by cfd technical information can be found in tavakoli et al 2020 moreover note that the mathematical model neglects the contribution of viscous forces as well when the bow of the vessel re enters water viscous pressure can also contribute huang et al 2021 this can also be another reason for larger vertical acceleration that the 2d t model computes at small frequencies examples of the time histories of heave pitch and vertical acceleration computed by both cfd and 2d t models are also presented in appendix f these results are not presented in this section as they might make the paper hard to follow as it was explained earlier it is impossible to evaluate the accuracy of 2d t model in reproducing the unsteady motions of a double stepped boat subjected to waves as no experimental data is available instead its results were compared against a cfd model in this section it was seen that their data follow each other at most of forcing conditions there are some differences between the computed data especially at long waves the inconsistency between the models which is related to the way sectional forces are computed is likely to be the main reason also the turbulent nature of the flow especially the water jet flowing toward the middle and rear surfaces can also cause extra shear stresses that are excluded from the 2d t model but it is important to note that turbulence is expected to be stronger for the case of shorter waves as their orbital velocity is higher 7 effects of step on dynamic responses of a double stepped boat in the previous sections the performance of 2d t model in computing the dynamic response of a double stepped vessel operating in planing mode was evaluated it was observed that it can compute the running attitudes and resistance of a hard chine stepped planing boat advancing in smooth water with a good level of accuracy especially at higher speeds then it was shown how it computes the dynamic response of a double stepped boat under the forces of head sea waves the comparison between the results of cfd and 2d t models show that the 2d t model can provide reliable data and can be applied for improving our understanding of the unsteady planing motion of double stepped boats in this section this model is used for this aim 7 1 adding two steps to the bottom heave and pitch responses of model c and c2 are found by using the developed mathematical model motions of these two vessels were mathematically replicated at four different beam froude numbers ranging from 1 9 to 4 77 waves with different frequencies were generated to have rao plots with enough wavelengths heave response of both models are shown in fig 14 at the two lower speeds heave responses of both models seem to be over damped and do not reach a significant peak value in the resonance zone at very long waves such as λ 3l heave responses of both models converge to 1 0 model c2 is observed to have smaller response at most of the forcing conditions at the longest wave heave response of this model is slightly larger compared to that of model c at the frb 3 83 heave response of model c reaches its maximum value at a wavelength ranging between 2l to 4l waves can also resonate heave response of model c2 but heave response corresponding to resonance of model c2 is much smaller compared to that of model c at this speed finally at the highest beam froude number no resonance emerges in heave response of model c2 while a resonance is seen to emerge in the heave response of model c at the all forcing conditions model c is found to have greater heave response pitch responses of both model c and c2 are presented in fig 15 it can be seen that at the lowest speed pitch response of both models is over damped i e pitch amplitude is not highly intensified at frequencies near the natural frequency of both vessels model c2 is seen to have smaller response at most of the forcing conditions at this speed at the higher speeds the pitch response of model c becomes larger and resonance occurs but model c2 is not affected in that way resonance only occurs when model c2 advances at froude number of 4 77 at larger froude number response is seen to be over damped and pitch response is observed to be below or nearly equal the steepness of the incoming wave in addition it is obvious that model c2 has smaller pitch response at all speeds vertical acceleration of both models are shown in fig 16 as seen vertical acceleration of both models increases by the increase in speed which agrees with the previous observations model c has been found to have larger vertical acceleration at its cg at the highest speed vertical acceleration of model c reaches up to 1 7g which is quite large and can be very harmful for the crew of the vessel overall it is observed that model c2 which has two transverse steps has a better performance in head sea condition i e its heave and pitch responses as well as vertical acceleration at cg are smaller compared to those of model c this provides us with an important message that a double stepped design can affect the hydrodynamic behavior of a vessel advancing at planing regime one of the main reasons that leads to such a better performance is likely to be the changes in the wetted surface pattern of the vessel three different surfaces which are partially washed by waves can increase the damping forces and moments which reduce the heave and pitch response of the vessel in resonance zone note that the effects double stepped design on heave and pitch responses was seen to be more significant at the two higher speeds this matches with the physics of problem as the speed of a double stepped hull increases effects of step on flow pattern becomes greater and leads to larger ventilation area and also it reduces the dynamic trim angle 7 2 step height in this sub section vertical motions of two different double stepped hulls are mathematically simulated in head sea condition one of the hulls case 4 has a shorter front step and the other case 6 has two steps with similar heights sectional half beam and deadrise angle of these two hulls are the same heave responses of case 4 triangle markers and case 6 cross markers are displayed in fig 17 pitch response of case 4 is seen to be smaller compared to that of case 5 at higher speed in addition vertical motion of this vessel case 4 is not resonated by waves at the marked area and the heave response plot is showing an over damped behavior note that at smaller froude number frb 3 89 heave response of case 4 is seen to be larger compared to case 6 at short waves pitch response of cases 4 and 6 are plotted in fig 18 both models show an over damped behavior in pitch direction their responses are seen to be very close to each other at longer waves case 4 is seen to have smaller response but at very short waves it can have larger response vertical acceleration of cases 4 and 6 are displayed in fig 19 it can be seen that vertical acceleration of both models follow each other at the lower froude numbers at the higher speed however vertical acceleration of case 4 is seen to be relatively larger compared to that of case 6 the differences at the highest speed are not significant but it can reach up to 1 3g at some forcing conditions on the whole the results presented in this subsection confirmed that the response of the dynamic of a double stepped boat is sensitive to proportion of step heights heave response of the vessel is highly influenced by the step height when the front step is set to be shorter heave motion is highly decreased and a very weak resonance might occur but it can lead to larger vertical acceleration at cg of the vessel when speed is increased such a phenomenon is expected to be affected by distribution of the wetted area of the vessel compared to a case for which both steps have similar heights larger area of the middle body and less area of the rear body are washed the water flow such a wet area pattern is expected to influence the damping forces moments of the vessel by increasing them i e when front step is shorter damping force increases therefore heave response is reduced and a very weak resonance might occur but the larger wet area can allow a larger volume of water to periodically impact the vessel causing a larger vertical force in this condition the vertical acceleration is expected to be larger 8 concluding remarks double stepped planing hulls have been turned into one of the interesting designs that can be used for a safe operation in water their motion obeys nonlinear theories and is far from being linear as the wet area of the vessel varies over time in the current research a mathematical model based on the 2d t was developed to replicate the unsteady motion of double stepped boats in head sea condition the model uses the solution of a high frequency radiation problem known as wagner to compute sectional forces by applying momentum variation law a simplified model was also applied to compute the ventilation area behind each step in parallel a cfd model was used to simulate the unsteady motion of the double stepped boats in waves this model was applied due to the lack of available experimental seakeeping tests of double stepped boats both models were found to be valid enough to be used for performance prediction of the vessel in calm water conditions the related simulations were performed by setting the water waves to be zero which resembles a smooth water test the 2d t model was seen to have large errors at low speeds where the assumptions of the 2d t model are expected to be inconsistent with reality rough water tests then were carried out results of both models were compared against each other showing their results follow each other there were some differences in long waves heave and pitch responses computed by 2d t model were seen to be smaller which is expected to be linked to the assumptions of the 2d t model this model is based on the infinite frequency radiation problem which simplifies fluid motion around the section when unsteady motions occur when waves become longer such an assumption can lead to inconsistency with the physic of the problem but the relative agreement between cfd and 2d t results confirmed that the 2d t model is reliable enough to be used for simulation of the unsteady motion of double stepped hulls the mathematical model was used to improve the understanding of the effects of steps on the unsteady planing motion in waves vertical motions of a stepless boat and a double stepped hull were both were mathematically replicated in head sea by using the 2d t method it was seen that the stepped design can positively affect the performance of the vessel heave and pitch responses were both seen to be reduced when two steps were added to the bottom of the vessel vertical acceleration was also seen to be reduced when two steps were added to the bottom of the vessel for the case of a double stepped boat the wetted area pattern is divided into three sub areas on which the hydrodynamic pressure is distributed such a change in the wetted area pattern of the vessel is likely to be the main reason that reduces vertical motions of double stepped boats two double stepped boats with similar sectional deadrise angles and beams were also mathematically modeled in the head sea condition the main difference between these two designs was the step heights in one case both steps have the same heights but the other vessel had a shorter front step quantitative comparison between the results demonstrated that in the case the front step is shorter heave motion especially in the resonance zone is reduced while vertical acceleration may be increased a shorter front step may increase the washed area of the middle surface a larger washed area can increase the total damping force and also can increase the exciting force therefore such behavior was observed for the vessel with a shorter front step the model developed in the present research provided an understanding of the unsteady planing motion of double stepped hulls the performance of the model can be modified by consideration of oscillation motions of the sections and also by assuming a more accurate prediction for the transom wave in addition the model can be further developed to consider more degrees of freedom specifically the roll motion can be considered in the model which is likely to be very important for the case of high speed vessels as they might show unstable behavior in the transverse direction more importantly as was mentioned before experimental studies highlighting wave induced motions of double stepped planing hulls are lacking at the present stage it is very vital to perform systematic experimental studies on the motions of double stepped planing hulls exposed to water waves this can provide us with an understanding of the unsteady motion of double stepped planing through experimental observations in addition the data provides us with a benchmark that can be used for the validation of mathematical or numerical simulations credit authorship contribution statement rasul niazmand bilandi investigation software validation visualization writing original draft

computing derivative of equation a 1 with respect to time as a 2 a π ρ c c as explained earlier c is a function of time therefore its time rate emerged as we compute the differential of the right side

water entry simulation after chine wetting in a real water entry problem as the water reaches the chine its is separated and can affect the fluid the motion around the solid body but we have simplified the problem by neglecting such a phenomenon appendix bintegral terms emerged in three dimensional forces the integration emerged in the final three dimensional forces acting on each planing

flow behaviour near walls of the vessel a standard y model is used y is defined to be calculated as c 4 d u τ v y where d is the normal distance from the wall of the vessel u τ is the frictional velocity and v is the kinematic viscosity of water the frictional velocity is related to the shear stress acting on the wall of the vessel as c 5 u τ τ w ρ the y value is set to vary between 30 and 300 on the wall of model c2 when it advances in waves its distribution on the wall of the model c2 is shown in fig 20 readers who are interested in reconstruction of the turbulent fluid motion around a planing vessel are referred to hosseini et al 2021 fig 20 distribution of y on the bottom wall of model c2 for fnb 2 94 fig 20 appendix d mesh sensitivity study for cfd model a sample of the mesh study is shown in this appendix vertical motions of model c2 are numerically replicated in the fluid domain simulations are performed to replicate the motion of vessel at beam froude number of 3 83 and wavelength of 3 12l simulations are performed using all four generated grids heave and pitch responses are computed the summary of data is shown in fig 21 it is observed that heave and pitch responses of the vessel converge by the increase of the cells the data presented in fig 21 ensures the fine gird g3 can provide reliable data and grids with greater numbers of cell do not affect the simulations therefore the fine grid is opted to use for modeling the unsteady planing motion of model c2 in different forcing conditions fig 21 results of the performed mesh study these results correspond to the heave and pitch motions of model c2 froude number is 3 83 and wavelength is 3 12l fig 21 appendix e wave generation by cfd model samples of generated waves by the numerical model are presented in this appendix to evaluate the performance of cfd model in generation of water waves tests are performed in an open water condition and the numerical domain is vessel free water waves with a length of 1 6l corresponding to the frequency of 0 7 rad s are generated in the right end of the domain wave steepness is set to be 0 039 this condition matches with one of the forcing conditions used in the present research 4th row of table 4 time history of generated waves at a point with a longitudinal position of 0 5l from the inlet is shown in fig 22 also water surface elevation corresponding to linear wave given by theory is plotted in this figure it can be seen that the numerical data matches with the theory showing that the cfd model is working well fig 22 free surface elevation generated by cfd model in an open water condition at a point with a distance of 0 5l from the wave maker the results are also compared against airy theory to check the validity of the numerical technique fig 22 a sample of water surface is shown in fig 23 the water surface elevation in the whole domain is shown an uni directional pattern for the waves is observed which ensures that the cfd model do not lead to any multi directional waves therefore it is guarantees that the generated wave model provides a clean fully head sea condition fig 23 three dimensional view of the uni directional waves generated by the numerical model the snaphshot presented here corresponds to the wavelength of 1 6l and steepness value of 0 039 fig 23 also the time history of the wave waves at three different virtual wave probes are plotted these probes shown by wp1 wp2 and wp3 are located at longitudinal positions of 0 5l 2 5l 4 5l from the wave maker note that wp1 gives the water surface elevation presented in fig 23 also wp2 locates where the cg of the vessel is located in the wave body testes time histories are plotted in lower panel of fig 24 each time history is bounded with two different dotted lines referring to a in and a in it can be seen that the water is initially at rest but as the wave energy reaches to the point it starts to oscillate around its initial value equilibrium condition water surface elevation at none of the probes is seen to go beyond the dashed lines this means that the energy of waves is well damped at all boundaries and therefore no reflection effects emerges in simulation fig 24 upper row shows the location of three different virtual wave probes note that the tests are vessel free and the vessel with a low transparency is drawn to show the location of the vessel in the tank when its mutual interaction with waves is numerically modeled lower panels show the time histories of the monochromatic wave propagating in the numerical tank time history of water surface elevation is shown since the initial time to show how the generated gravity wave is developed the second probe is placed at the cg of the vessel is located note that all results correspond to an open water condition and the vessel is not placed in the domain fig 24 appendix f sample of time histories of the response of model c2 samples of time histories of heave pitch and vertical acceleration of model c2 are presented in this appendix samples are extracted from both cfd and mathematical models which are respectively shown by solid blue and dashed black plots in all figures and panels the presented data cover two different beam froude numbers of 2 94 and 3 83 which correspond to speeds of 6 25 and 8 13 m s respectively two different forcing conditions with wavelengths of 1 59l and 3 12l are considered the smaller wavelength represents a situation with small heave and pitch responses but can have large vertical acceleration the other wavelengths however can causes larger heave and pitch responses but can induce smaller vertical acceleration fig 25 displays examples of the heave response of the model c2 over the time as seen heave response computed by both models show harmonic behaviour and seems to follow a linear response at the shorter wavelengths cfd and 2d t method are seen to fit very well at the longer wavelength there are some differences and 2d t method computes smaller response fig 25 time histories of heave response of model c2 results correspond to two different beam froude numbers of 2 94 and 3 83 two different wavelengths of 1 59l and 3 12l are considered solid blue and dashed black plots respectively refer to cfd and 2d t models fig 25 samples of pitch response of model c2 are shown in fig 26 as seen like what was observed for heave response time dependent pitch of the vessel is harmonic both cfd and 2d t model provides very similar results at shorter wavelength at the longer wavelength larger pitch response is computed by cfd model fig 26 time histories of pitch response of model c2 results correspond to two different beam froude numbers of 2 94 and 3 83 two different wavelengths of 1 59l and 3 12l are considered solid blue and dashed black plots respectively refer to cfd and 2d t models fig 26 time history of vertical acceleration at cg computed by cfd and 2d t models are plotted in fig 27 this parameter is seen to show nonlinear behaviour as apparent crest of vertical acceleration is sharp crest is seen to be sharper at higher speed and shorter wave the crest corresponding to 2d t model is also seen to be skewed toward left physically 2d t model is more likely to compute larger spectral values for second and third harmonics fig 27 time histories of vertical acceleration of model c2 at cg results correspond to two different beam froude numbers of 2 94 and 3 83 two different wavelengths of 1 59l and 3 12l are considered solid blue and dashed black plots respectively refer to cfd and 2d t models

20403,the double stepped design of lifting surfaces planing in water has been seen to benefit the calm water performance by distributing forces over the washed area the unsteady motion of such surfaces in waves however is not well understood it is not clear how steps can influence the response of a planing vessel operating in waves in the presented research this problem is analyzed by developing a model which is established using a 2d t framework meanwhile a cfd set up is also designed to numerically replicate the motion of double stepped planing hulls subjected to gravity waves it is demonstrated the results of both models agree performing mathematical simulations it is demonstrated that a double stepped design can decrease the heave and pitch responses of the vessel in the resonance zone more importantly mathematical data confirms that wave induced motions of a vessel are highly sensitive to the heights of steps a vessel with a shorter front step has smaller vertical responses especially over the resonance zone while it may have larger vertical acceleration at high speeds this is caused by the larger washed area of the middle surface which can increase damping forces while it allows larger wave forces to impact the vessel keywords double stepped planing hull seakeeping wave induced motions mathematical simulation cfd simulation abbreviations amg algebraic

1900s among different types of designs planing hulls have always been considered as one of the popular hullforms that can well operate at high speeds these vessels have been used for high speed operations in the sea since the early 20 century in the late 1950s and early 1960s a new generation of planing hulls emerged savitsky 1985 a step which leads the water flow to be separated from it was proposed to be added to their bottom fig 1 at the first stage such a design was found to be very interesting and attracted the attentions of different groups of boat designers a set of papers and reports including the calm water performance of these hulls were published in 1960s 1980s e g clement and pope 1961 clement and desty 1980 but it was eventually reported that due to the unbalanced distribution of hydrodynamic pressure over the wetted surface of a single stepped boat the occurrence probability of instability may be intensified at high speeds the problem with the instability of single stepped boats slowed down their applications in coastal seas in the early 2000s a new design approach for stepped boats was suggested instead of one two transverse steps were used on the bottom which on the whole were seen to modify the pressure distribution over the entire length of boats this type of design which is known as double stepped hullform was seen to lead to smaller resistance force and trim angle the angle between baseline and calm water line the good performance of this type of vessel attracted renewed attention of boat designers there is an accumulative series of research analyzing their performance in calm water conditions confirming their satisfactory performance in a smooth sea the steady planing problem of the double stepped planing hulls has been well understood experimental studies have been performed taunton et al 2010 lee et al 2014 numerical and mathematical approaches have also been used to model their calm water performance veysi and ghassemi 2016 de marco et al 2017 dashtimanesh et al 2018 niazmand bilandi et al 2018 niazmand bilandi et al 2019a esfandiari et al 2019 du et al 2019 hydrodynamic of double stepped planing hulls in waves however is unclear the steps lead to ventilation areas and distribute forces over the bottom of the vessel garland and maki 2012 added mass and damping forces moments of the middle body are expected to be scant compared to the front and rear surfaces as the middle surface is nearly dry compared to a stepless design the performance of a double stepped body in waves can be different to understand the effects of steps on the performance of planing hulls exposed to water waves their dynamic motion should be modeled the dynamic of ships in waves also known as seakeeping has been modeled by many researchers since the early 1950s ideal flow assumption zero viscosity hypothesis and the linear potential theory are used to model the problem using these assumptions radiation along with diffraction problems emerge solutions to these problems give the added mass damping force and exciting force at different frequencies the linear theory and these two problems are well explained in newman 1977 radiation and diffraction problems have been seen to be solved in the frequency domain by applying different analytical methods laplace equation governs domain which represents the continuity equations for an incompressible fluid flow with zero viscosity depending on the physics of the problem different methods including eigenfunction matching multiploe methods green integration among others can be used a very deep overview of these methods is presented in linton and mciver 2001 for the case of ships the strip theory can also be used salvesen et al 1970 ogilvie and tuck 1969 which utilizes the sectional damping and added mass coefficients of ship section those which can be computed by using lewis section the radiation problem related to a two dimensional cylinder is solved and then is mapped to the sections of the ship this method has been seen to be valid for the case of displacement hulls for the case of a planing hull advancing in water waves some difficulties emerge since the vessel positions itself at a non zero dynamic trim angle and the centre of gravity cg locates at a different level compared to zero speed condition hydrodynamic pressure turns into an important contributor to the generation of fluid forces in this case the linear potential assumption can lead to different physics which is far from what happens in reality and classical frequency dependent added mass and damping coefficients may not be consistent with real physics simply stated the response of the vessel in the vertical direction is expected to be high and it starts to oscillate leading to large variation in the wetted area of the vessel in this situation added mass and damping coefficients are likely to be response dependent which is different from the classical linear theory definition therefore non linear based models can have been more accurate in this case zarnick 1978 developed a nonlinear model for the mathematical replication of the motion of planing hulls in waves the problem was solved in the time domain while another time scale was used to model the motion of the sections of the boat i e the sectional motions of the boat were modeled through a qusie steady approach the sectional forces were found using added mass forces the model gave response dependent added mass forces and exciting forces it was seen that it can simulate the motion of vessels with a high level of accuracy the model is also known as the 2d t method the application of zarnick s model was later extended to other planing motions such as steady performance and asymmetric drift motions where the model was expected to be consistent with real physics to a higher level xu et al 1999 sebastiani et al 2008 ghadimi et al 2016 dashtimanesh et al 2019 the reason was that zarnick s model assumes that sectional forces emerge from the added mass forces and the frequency of fluid motion around the section is infinite the model has been seen to be used for modeling of the maneuvering motion of planning hulls and acceptable performance of the model is reported while its accuracy is still required to be modified tavakoli and dashtimanesh 2019 in the recent year the 2d t method is used to simulate steady performance of the double stepped planing hulls niazmand bilandi et al 2020 this model is developed by assuming that the water separation from step follows the transom wave theories the general idea comes from the work of savitsky and morabito 2010 who formulated the transom wave in the lee of the vessel aiming to provide a non sophisticated formulation for performance prediction of stepped planing hulls niazmand bilandi et al 2020 used this idea by simplifying it they assumed that the transom wave has a linear shape as the water flowing toward the lifting surface behind the step travels a relatively small distance in such a condition the steep waves cannot be developed and a linear shape can be assumed for the water flow separated from the step it has been observed that it has a great level of accuracy but no mathematical model has been developed for the unsteady motion of double stepped hulls subjected to water waves while there is a pressing need to simulate seakeeping of these hulls as explained earlier meanwhile the computational fluid dynamics cfd has been applied for simulation of seakeeping of ships and boats in the last two decades it has been reported that cfd models can predict the response of the ships boats exposed to water waves with reliable accuracy cfd models solve turbulent viscous flow around ships boats allowing us to model high order phenomena such as turbulent dissipation emerging during the mutual interaction between water waves and ships e g in huang et al 2020 of course such a phenomenon cannot be easily modeled through mathematical modeling as many simplifications occur when these models are developed while cfd models are very popular and accurate they are time consuming they are not recommended to be used in the case a boat ship has not been designed they are better to be utilized in the last stages of the design of a ship the comparison between mathematical and cfd models can let us know how their results can differ for the case of double stepped planing hulls experimental tests highlighting their seakeeping in head sea condition lacks at the current stage therefore cfd models can be used to model their problem and their results can be compared against those of 2d t model of course such a comparison cannot be considered as a validation study but it can provide important messages regarding the performance of both models low differences between their results can show that they both are performing well enough to be used for improving our understanding of the problem the present paper aims to fill the gap in modeling of planing motion of stepped surfaces in water waves by offering two models including a nonlinear mathematical model and a cfd one the mathematical model is established by extending the zarnick s method for double stepped planing hulls the cfd model is developed based on a finite volume method and an overset technique which is applied to model the rigid body motion the 2d t model and an example of the cfd set up that can be used to simulate vertical motions of a double stepped planing hull were previously presented in a conference proceeding niazmand bilandi et al 2019 but the details of the 2d t model and the way that it is developed were not presented in addition the presented results were restricted to one forcing condition and one design in the present research the 2d t model is explained in detail moreover a wide range of results is presented which provides us with an understanding regarding the effects of step on the vertical motion of double stepped planing hulls advancing in waves the present paper is outlined as follows the mathematical model and cfd model are respectively presented in sections 2 and 3 the validity of models in replication of the steady performance of the vessel in calm water is evaluated in section 4 a comparison between the results of cfd and the mathematical model is presented in section 5 results of the paper are presented in section 6 and it is shown how a double stepped design can affect the dynamic response of a planing vessel in waves section 7 includes the concluding remarks 2 the 2dof mathematical model 2 1 formulating the dynamic motion consider a hard chine vessel with two bottom steps operates at planing regime which is identified as fr b 2 0 here fr b u g b 1 and represents beam froude number u is the speed of the vessel b is its beam and g is the gravity acceleration the water surface the interface between water and air may have elevation i e water waves can exist assume that water waves are monochromatic unidirectional and propagate toward the boat with an encounter angle of π the angle between wave direction and boat speed is defined as the encounter angle the boat is supposed to perform in an open sea condition i e the spatial domain is not bounded at all the water depth is assumed to be deep enough to satisfy a deep water wave condition surface waves are assumed to be linear and no wave breaking and modulation instability occur i e linear wave theory also known as airy theory governs the surface waves the water surface elevation at any point therefore obeys 1 ζ a cos κ x ω t ε in eq 1 a is the amplitude of wave ω 2 π t is the wave angular frequency κ 2 π λ is the wave number and ε is the phase shift of the wave t is the wave period and λ is the wave number κ is found using the deep water dispersion equation given by 2 κ g 1 ω 2 heave and pitch motions are assumed to be induced by water waves sway and yaw motions are assumed to be scant and are neglected no roll motion is also allowed assuming that thrust force passes through the cg of the vessel motion equations can be formulated as 3 m z f z w i θ m θ in eq 3 m and i are mass and pitch inertia of the vessel f z and m θ respectively refer to vertical force and pitching moment generated by fluid flow w is the weight force eq 3 shows the relative motion of a body frame attached to cg of the vessel with respect to a hydrodynamic frame which advances with the vessel and never has any oscillations both frames are right handed and are positive downward both of these coordinate systems are shown in fig 2 2 2 model development the body of a double stepped planing hull consists of three lifting surface including front corresponding to x x s 1 x b middle x x s 2 x s 1 and rear x x t x s 2 surfaces x s 1 and x s 2 respectively refer to the longitudinal positions of the front and rear steps in body frame x b and x t refer to the longitudinal positions of the bow and transom in the aforementioned frame the length of each planing surfaces is found as 4 l 1 x b x s 1 5 l 2 x s 1 x s 2 6 l 3 x s 2 x t it is hypothesized that heave force and the pitching moment acting on the body of the double stepped planing hull can be divided into three components each of which separately acts on one of aforementioned lifting surfaces therefore the fluid vertical and angular forces are re written as 7 f z i 1 3 f z i m θ i 1 3 m θ i in eq 7 f z i and m θ i respectively denote the heaving and pitching forces acting on a single planing surface it is hypothesized that water flowing toward the surface behind each step tends to travel linearly the schematic of this assumption is drawn in fig 3 this assumption is known as the linear transom wave theory and has been observed to be relatively true for the case of double stepped planing hulls when water partiality washes the planing surfaces dashtimanesh et al 2018 following this theory the ventilation area corresponding to each planing surface identified with i may be written as 8 l v i h s i 1 tan θ θ i i 2 3 here h s i 1 is the height of each step θ is the pitch angle and θ i is the local pitch angle note that the basis of assumption made to compute the wetted area behind step can be found in the work of savitsky and morabito 2010 they hypothesized that the profile of the water surface behind a step is similar to that of a transom wave they performed a series of experimental tests and reported non sophisticated equations to compute the water surface profile in the present research their hypothesis is simplified and the transom wave is assumed to have a linear shape the reason for such a simplification is that the wetted surface of each planing surface is small and thus the developed transom wave is not steep 2 2 1 sectional forces the sectional forces of the vessel are found using the 2d t model a water entry problem is used to replicate the planing motion at any time step to understand this method it is required to view the problem from an observation plane locating in the path of the vessel as shown in upper panel of fig 4 this theory can also be used for the double stepped hulls by assuming that three water entry problems occur as displayed in lower panel of fig 4 consider that a wedge section enters water hydrodynamic force acting on a section is assumed to be generated by momentum variation and cross drag flow payne 1995 which is given by 9 f d t a v c c d ρ c v 2 here d t is the material derivative a is the added mass of the section v is the relative vertical speed of the section c c d is the cross ﬂow drag coefficient c is half wetted beam for of each section and ρ is the fluid density the first term of eq 9 found using a lagrangian approach can be expanded as 10 d t a v a v v a u x a v here u is the relative longitudinal speed of a section the method for computation of added mass and watted length of section is explained in appendix a overall the above equations show that sectional forces are found using momentum variation which depends on the instant added mass of the section the added mass of the section is computed by utilizing the solution of a water entry problem i e a radiation problem with an infinite frequency known as wagner solution is applied and then added mass of the section is formulated such a hypothesis might not fit with the real physics when a vessel oscillates in any direction fluid motion around any section of it is likely to oscillate with the same frequency but such an inconsistency has been found not to be a big worry as the water entry problem has been reported to have proper accuracy in computation of the sectional forces of a boat advancing in waves the relative local speeds of any section of the vessel are computed by using the heave speed of the boat z pitch rate θ vertical velocity of the free surface and boat speed u as 11 v z w z cos θ θ j u sin θ θ j θ ξ 12 u u cos θ θ j z w z sin θ θ j here w z is the vertical speed of the fluid motion caused by the water waves to find more accurate sectional force it is also assumed that gravity can generate buoyant forces which can be calculated by 13 f h s 2 d 0 5 2 ρ g c h w x here the product of c and h w x gives the sectional wetted area here h w x is the sectional water depth that varies locally g is the gravity acceleration constant this wetted area includes the additional area caused by water pile up known as wagner condition sectional forces are used to derive equations for heave force and pitch moment later 2 2 2 hydrodynamic forces acting on the body hydrodynamic force acting on a single planing surface is computed separately to do so it is needed to integrate forces of sections over the length of the surface sectional force contains momentum variation cross drag and buoyant forces as shown earlier equations 14 gives the integration of sectional forces in heave direction as follows 14 f z i l i t i x d t a v c c d ρ c v 2 d x cos θ θ j l i t i x f h s 2 d d x i 1 2 3 in this equation t i is the transom modification function the upper and lower limits of integration have been presented in eqs 4 through 6 note that the direction of buoyant force is different from that of the sectional forces computed by 13 the transom and steps are all hypothesized to modify the sectional forces i e the kutta condition governs at steps and transom and thus forces should converge zero at related sections a transom modification function can be implemented to serve this aim mathematically this function will be presented later by computing the moment of sectional forces with respect to centre of gravity the pitching moment of each single surface is formulated as 15 m θ i l i t i x d t a v c c d ρ c v 2 x d x l i t i x f h s 2 d x d x i 1 2 3 the effects of transom on sectional forces are activated by using a tangent hyperbolic function this function gives a value of zero as x x t i and also converges 1 0 as x such a behaviour agrees with the real physics the aforementioned function was proposed by garme 2005 and is given by 16 t i x tanh 2 5 c x x t i i 1 2 3 here c is a coefficient that determines the location at which transom effects emerge this coefficient is a function of beam froude number and approaches as fr c is recommended to be found by garme 2005 17 c 0 34 b fr b i 1 2 3 for more technical information regarding eqs 16 and 17 and the way they have been formulated please refer to garme 2005 the effects of transom function on sectional forces appear at different stations that are given by 18 x t i x s i i 1 2 19 x t i x t i 3 the equations for three dimensional forces can be developed by summing the sectional forces integration of the 2d forces over the entire length of each planing surface gives the three dimensional force thus the three dimensional heave force of each lifting surface is formulated as 20 f z i m i cos θ θ i z m i θ m i θ z cos θ θ i u cos θ θ j f z i ① f z i ② f z i ③ f z i ④ f z i ⑤ f z i ⑥ f z i ⑦ cos θ θ i l i t i x f h s d x i 1 2 3 by using the same approach the pitching moment generated by the water flow is formulated as 21 m θ i m i cos θ θ j z m i θ m i θ z sin θ θ j u cos θ θ j m θ i ① m θ i ② m θ i ③ m θ i ④ m θ i ⑤ m θ i ⑥ m θ i ⑦ l i t i x f h s 2 d x d x i 1 2 3 note that the force and moment presented in equations 20 and 21 are three dimensional and formulated by the expansion of the two dimensional forces each of the above equations contains several terms the first three terms indicate the added mass contribution in the body frame these terms are a result of integration of sectional added mass terms are shown with m i the fourth terms in equations 20 and 21 are products of added mass force and velocities which is an absolute nonlinear term some terms are shown by superscripts bounded in a circle these terms refer to the forces moments generated by integration of the added mass rate along with cross drag force formulations for these terms are all presented in appendix b note that terms that are indicated with ① ④ are wave forces and others refer to response dependent damping forces moments last terms in both equations are the buoyant forces moments these terms represent the stiffness mechanism contribution to total forces moments acting on the vessel advancing in waves note that it was previously described that forces are in vertical direction added mass forces moments that are shown with m are given by 22 m i l i t i x a d x i 1 2 3 23 m i l i t i x a x d x i 1 2 3 24 m i l i t i x a x 2 d x i 1 2 3 2 2 3 motion equations the movement of the boat is formulated using the rigid body law as explained earlier forces are substituted in the motion equation and give a set of differential equations as 25 m a z z z a z θ θ f z w a θ z z i a θ θ θ m θ here the summation of m terms are defined as the added mass coefficients and are extracted from the fluid forces and transferred to the left hand side of both equations which helps us to simulate the problem over the time domain added mass terms are shown with a z z a z θ a θ z and a θ θ equation 25 governs the motion of the vessel advancing in waves and is needed to be solved over the time the rest of the forces are kept in the right hand side of the equations and are formulated as 26 f z i 1 3 f z i a z z z a z θ θ m θ i 1 3 m θ i a θ z z a θ θ θ added mass coefficients are given by 27 a z z i 1 3 m i cos 2 θ θ i 28 a z θ i 1 3 m i cos θ θ i 29 a θ z i 1 3 m i cos θ θ i 30 a θ θ i 1 3 m i equations 28 and 29 present a z θ and a θ z the instant values of these two added mass terms are equal it important to note that the added mass terms are influenced by the response of the vessel simply stated they are time dependent and are different from the classical added mass coefficients formulated in linear theory moreover it should be noted that the force and moment identified with a superscript contain damping restoring and non linear mechanisms the formulation developed for added mass coefficients and forces show that the developed model treats the problem by considering non linearities of the fluid motion under such an assumption the problem is not solved in the frequency domain instead it is solved over the time which will be explained the motion equation of double stepped planing hull can be is re written in a vector form as 31 m x f where m is the mass matrix and x z t θ t is the displacement vector f is the force vector the mass matrix and force vector are defined as 32 m m a z z a z θ a θ z i a θ θ at any time interval the acceleration vector is found as 33 x m 1 f using acceleration vector velocity vector x and displacement vector x are computed as 34 x x dt 35 x x dt in each time step there will be a phase lag between waves and the motion of the vessel but the phase lag of the vessel is not of interest in the present research and we will not present the related data in the case that the wave height is set to be zero the steady motion of the vessel is replicated the vessel reaches the dynamic equilibrium in this condition the vertical force generated by fluid equals the weight force in addition the pitching moment is zero as the center of pressure settles at cg 2 2 4 drag forces the drag force is assumed not to have any contribution in vertical motions of the vessel it is hypothesized that this force is only generated by water flow and air drag is assumed to be nil three different components are assumed to cause the drag acting on the bottom of the vessel as 36 d d f d p d s here d f is the frictional drag that is generated by the shear stresses near the wall of the vessel d p is the drag force that is induced by the hydrodynamic pressure note that for the case of a planing surface pressure distribution in longitudinal direction is not symmetric at all and it is expected that pressure generates a large amount of force d s is the spray drag that is common to occur in the bow of planing surfaces as an amount of water jet flows toward the bow of the vessel leading to generation of spray the idea used for computation of hydrodynamic forces is also used to compute the drag forces i e drag force acting on each planing surface is computed separately and then the total drag forces are computed drag forces are found by 37 d f i 1 3 d f i 38 d p i 1 3 d p i 39 d s i 1 3 d s i the frictions drag force of each planing surface denoted with d is computed by using the ittc recommendation ittc 1978 as 40 d f i 0 5 c f δ c f ρ u 2 s i where c f is the frictional drag coefficients and δ c f is the additional friction coefficient due to roughness of the surface s i is the area washed by water wetted area of each planing surface is computed by 41 s i 2 b cos β β j the frictional drag coefficient is found by 42 c f 0 075 logr e 2 2 where r e is the reynolds number reynolds number of the whole planing vessel is used for each planing surface as 43 r e ν 1 u l k here ν is the kinematic viscosity of water l k is the total summation of the keel length washed by water and the ventilation areas given by 44 l k i 1 3 l k i i 2 3 l v i keel wetted length of each surface can be computed by 45 l k i x k i x t i d x the drag force generated by pressure is found as 46 d p i l i t i x d t a v c c d 0 5 ρ c v 2 d x sin θ θ i i 1 2 3 the spray drag acting on each planing surface is computed by 47 d s i f i cos γ i i 1 2 3 where f i is given by 48 f i c f 0 5 ρ v 2 b 2 4 sin γ i cos β β i i 1 2 3 γ i is the angle between the whisker spray edge and the keel line in waterplane area given by 49 γ i tan 1 π tan θ θ i 2 tan β β i i 1 2 3 here β i is the local effective deadrise angle the formulations presented for computation of the spray drag are all taken from savitsky et al 2007 3 the numerical model consider a three dimensional spatial domain with a cartesian right handed coordinate system of oxyz the vessel is assumed to be exposed to waves in this domain which is spanned within x o x x i y l y y r and h z h a a schematic showing this domain and the vessel is presented in fig 5 the velocity field in the whole domain is presented by v x t v x x t v y x t v z x t t which may vary over the time consider that fluid around the vessel which can contain the mixture of water and air is viscous and also incompressible continuity of the mass flow and momentum conservation hold the domain in this condition hence reynolds averaged navier stokes equations rans govern the motion of fluid at any point in the fluid domain as 50 v 0 51 t ρ v ρ vv μ v p f b v μ in y y b here ρ is the density of the mixture of the air and water p in the above equations refer to the pressure also μ is the dynamic viscosity of the air water mixture the fluid flow is assumed to be turbulent and turbulent viscosity is expected to affect the shear stresses and thus the velocity field a k ϵ model is used for this aim details of the turbulent model are explained in appendix c the two phase flow is modeled using a volume fraction method a fraction shown by γ is defined which represents the fraction of water over air at any point a conservation equation governs on this fraction in the whole domain as 52 t γ ρ v γ 0 in y y b viscosity and density of the fluid in every point of the domain are found locally as 53 μ 1 γ μ air μ water 54 ρ 1 γ ρ air ρ water a numerical wave maker is prescribed at x x f that generates surface waves as 55 ζ x f t a exp i ω t which propagate toward the vessel where i 1 water waves are expected to follow the linear water wave theory as they are set to have gentle steepness waves propagate toward the left end of domain and are damped at λ o and λ l in λ l order to stop any reflection of wave energy from boundaries of the domain this forcing conditions replicates a head sea wave condition which is modeled in the present research water and air are prescribed to flow toward the boat from λ i with a velocity of u also flow with velocity of u is also set on λ l which provides and open water condition around the vessel the zero gradient pressure and zero gradient velocity govern on every point of λ o which matches with an outlet boundary condition on the walls of the boat a no slip condition is satisfied i e u x λ b d t λ b as the vessel has no yaw and sway motion and also is not heeled the fluid motion is expected to be symmetry with respect to the xz plane therefore a symmetry boundary shown by λ s is defined which accelerates the simulations and reduces the storage of data as well the upper patch of the domain λ u is set to act as an inlet with a constant velocity being equal to that of the vessel this provides a perfect open sea condition all the aforementioned boundaries conditions are summarized in table 1 motion equations can be solved using rigid body equations over the time the force f and moment m vectors acting on the planing body are computed as 56 f λ b p σ n d λ b 57 m λ b p σ n r d λ b here σ is the normal stress tensor n is the normal vector and r is the distance vector the solution of a rigid body dynamic equations provides the values of instant heave and pitch of the solid body over the time all the presented equations including the fluid and rigid body motions are solved by using a cfd code starccm star ccm 2011 an implicit approach is used for decomposing the unsteady terms the temporal terms are discretized by applying a 2nd order method the convection terms are decomposed by embarking a 2nd order method the gradient discretization is performed through hybrid least squares lsq approach the fluid equations are numerically solved by using a simple semi implicit method for pressure linked equations algorithm the algebraic system of equations is numerically solved by applying an agm algebraic multi grid method the two phase flow is solved by using the vof method as explained earlier the convection of the vof is modeled by using an hric high resolution interface capturing method the dynamic response of the rigid body is solved by employing a dfbi dynamic fluid body interaction planar motion carriage framework the mesh motion is treated with an overset technique the rigid body is placed in a region which moves with the planing vessel therefore no re meshing or deformation of the cells occurs over time an interpolation between the background region and the overset region is performed by utilizing a linear method the computation grid is generated by using the toolbox of the cfd code starccm star ccm 2011 as well the strategy for grid design is based on the previous numerical researches highlighting the wave ship wave structure interaction examples can be found in tezdogan et al 2015 mousaviraad et al 2015 and huang et al 2019 cells are set to be fine near the free surface and the hull surface where fluid is expected to be strongly turbulent and shear stresses should be computed with a high level of accuracy higher resolution is applied for the cells covering the wake of the vessel to ensure that the wake effects are captured and modeled properly since an overset method is used for dynamic simulations cells are not deformable at all a layout of the mesh used for the simulation of the problem is shown in fig 6 please note that it is ensured that the wave height locates in about 20 cells different grids are generated using a mesh refinement ratio of 2 the summary of these grids is shown in table 2 a mesh sensitive study is performed and it is found that g3 can be used for numerical replication of the problem the summary of the mesh sensitive study is presented in appendix d also the accuracy of the model in the generation of gravity waves is evaluated in appendix e a personal computer pc equipped with a 3 1 ghz intel 12 processors and 36 gb memory is used to run simulations each simulation is run over 60 000 time steps every single simulation required nearly 100 h on the machine 4 case conditions mathematical and numerical simulations are performed for two sets of planing models these models are designed and presented in two of the previous research taunton et al 2010 lee et al 2014 highlighting performance of stepped planing hulls effects of step and their location on the resistance and running attitude of planing hulls are evaluated and discussed in the related papers the first planing model set is designed at the university of southampton by taunton et al 2010 effects of two steps on the performance of a planing model were studied and it was observed that two steps can highly decrease the resistance of the vessel the stepless and double stepped boats are named as models c and c2 respectively both vessels have similar body plans and are 2 m long but one has two transverse steps located at 0 158l and 0 31l the mean deadrise angle of these vessels is 22 5 which is the most common deadrise angle used for planing hulls performing in the real sea body plans of the models are shown in fig 7 and their dimensions as well as other principal characteristics are listed in table 3 dynamic motions of models c and c2 are simulated in the head sea condition in the present research by applying both cfd and 2d t models a comparison between the obtained results can be very helpful in verifying the accuracy level of the 2d t model in addition dynamic responses of model c and c2 are compared against each other this can improve our understanding of the effects of steps on the movement of a planing craft in waves the second planing model set is designed in virginia tech in the early 2010s the related hulls are developed to study the effects of step height on the performance of a double stepped planing surface two models including case 4 and case 6 are selected to be studied in the present research the first mode case 4 has two steps with different heights of 0 007b and 0 021b the second one named case 6 has two steps with similar heights of 0 014b a comparison between dynamic responses of cases 4 and 6 can increase our understanding of the influence of the step height on the dynamic response of a double stepped planing craft in waves details of these two models are also presented in table 3 the body lines corresponding to these models are shown in fig 7 the wave forcing condition used in the current research is also presented in table 4 waves cover a wide range of wavelengths that can provide us with rao plots all waves are set to have gentle steepness these forcing conditions are selected from the research of begovic et al 2014 who studied the unsteady motion of warped planing hulls 5 calm water performance tests a validation study before performing a study on dynamic responses calm water performance of the different hulls are computed using cfd and 2d t methods aiming to check their validity in computing hydrodynamic forces and the equilibrium condition of the double stepped vessels in calm water condition it is very important to note that there is no experimental work highlighting the dynamic of double stepped craft advancing in planing regime therefore we have first validated both cfd and 2d t methods in modeling the calm water performance then we have compared dynamic motion results computed by these two models against each other in the next section the calm water experiments are performed by setting waves to have a steepness of zero in both models thus the water surface will be in equilibrium condition the boat has heave and pitch motions both of which converge to steady values steady heave and pitch give dynamic trim angle and cg rise up of the vessel 5 1 calm water tests for models c and c2 a sample of the calm water tests of model c and c2 at froude number of 4 77 is shown in fig 8 as seen initial values are set for heave and pitch and then simulations are run over time up to the time they converge both cfd and 2d t results are observed to provide results close to experimental data dashed red line as mentioned earlier steady planing simulations are run for every single froude numbers to model the calm water operation of model c2 i e similar to what is presented in fig 8 the motion of the model c2 in a calm water condition is run for all speeds and the data is found the summary of simulations is presented in fig 9 trim angle and resistance of the vessel are both presented trim angle of the vessel is expected to reach small values at high beam froude numbers i e fr 4 both cfd and 2d t models are seen to follow this behavior at small froude numbers a peak in trim angle vs fr plot can be seen cfd model can well capture this peak but 2d t method is not able to do so there might be some reasons for this fact the most probable one is the low speed of the vessel which can affect the validity of the 2d t model at such a speed for instance the transom might not get fully dried and the ventilation may not follow the linear wake theory also the 2d t theory is expected to have better accuracy at higher speed where the solution of the infinity frequency water penetration assumption used for commutation of sectional forces is likely to be consistent with the physics of the motion computed values for the drag are also presented in figure the drag force becomes larger by the increase in froude number as it should cfd and 2d t model are seen to provide data with good accuracy both of these methods however can slightly over predict the drag force at very high speed note that the cfd results have been previously presented in niazmand bilandi et al 2020 as the same set up was used here it should be clarified that the cfd setup used in the present research is an extension of what was performed in niazmand bilandi et al 2020 the key difference between the cfd set up used here and the one used in the previous research is the ability of the present set up in modeling of the wave induced simulations the data presented in this sub section is related to the calm water performance operation and thus the extended set up which is able to model the wave induced motion of the vessel is not run for this case therefore the data of the previous research is plotted in fig 9 please note that the cfd results that are presented in section 6 and also appendix f are run with the cfd set up designed in the present research all of the results in section 6 are related to wave induced motions of a double stepped planing hull 5 2 calm water tests for cases 4 and 6 trim angle and drag force of cases 4 and 6 are also simulated by using the steady simulations of the 2d t model the cfd simulations of the wave induced motions are only performed for model c2 the results of which are presented in section 6 the reason is that cfd simulations need a long time to be performed which is nearly 100 h this time is much longer compared to the time the mathematical model is run in addition the set up for the cfd model is designed to provide some additional data which can be used for evaluating the behavior of the developed mathematical model as it was mentioned earlier there is no experimental data highlighting seakeeping of stepped planing hulls hence cfd runs are performed to evaluate the differences between the results of cfd and 2d t model in the computation of wave induced motions of the vessel which are present in section 6 to sum cfd simulations are not run for cases 4 and 6 the computed values are compared against experimentally measured data the computed trim angle is seen to be close to the experimental data but it diverges from experiments at the highest speed for the case 6 this divergence is not significant overall 2d t method has seen to have reasonable accuracy level in modeling of the steady performance of the case 4 and case 6 the steady heave values computed by both cfd and 2d t models are seen to follow each other some differences might be caused by the errors in the prediction of the trim angle as it was seen the trim angle was under predicted so the vessel settles down at a lower height to establish the balance between the weight and fluid vertical force the related data is shown in fig 10 2d t model is again seen to follow the experimentally measured drag forces there are still some over predictions which are seen to be greater for case 6 to summarize the 2d t model is seen to provide a reasonable level of accuracy in computation of the performance of the cases 4 and 6 there are some errors the source of which can be studied in future 6 cfd vs mathematical model in the previous section both models were used to reproduce the steady performance of double stepped planing hulls advancing in still water runs were performed over the time to evaluate their accuracy level in prediction of the steady performance the accuracy level of both methods were observed to be promising in this section the results of cfd and 2d t models in replication of unsteady planing motion are compared against each other as mentioned earlier no experimental based published paper report highlighting regular wave effects on stepped planing surfaces is available therefore it is attempted to compare the results obtained by cfd and 2d t against each other to verify that both methods can work relatively accurate but one point should be mentioned here the present simulations are performed for the case of double stepped planing hulls the accuracy of the 2d t model in simulation of wave induced motions of stepless boats has been previously observed in a wide range of studies in addition another version of the present cfd model which was designed to model wave induced motions of a stepless boat was previously tested by the authors motions of a hard chine vessel operating in regular waves was modeled replicated by cfd and 2d t model the results were presented in tavakoli et al 2020 note that the cfd set up used in the related paper was different from the one used here the difference was the mesh structure around the vessel which was particular to a stepless boat so it can be concluded that an early version of the present cfd set up has been previously seen to compute the vertical motions of stepless boat advancing in waves with a fair level of accuracy model c2 is tested in all forcing conditions at two beam froude numbers of 2 94 and 3 83 heave and pitch response along vertical acceleration at cg are sampled at each time step the data are presented in this section fig 11 shows the heave response of the model c2 two panels are displayed showing the heave rao at two beam froude numbers of 2 94 and 3 83 the wavelengths ranging from 2l to 4l are marked with gray color as they can cause the highest response and are of interest in the present research the reference line referring to wave amplitude is also plotted the dashed red line if the plotted data is below the line it imposes that rigid body motions are smaller than that of the waves otherwise it signifies that the rigid body motion is greater compared to wave motion as observed both cfd and 2d t model predict that heave resonance occurs at the marked area at wavelengths larger than 2 0 2d t model has seen to compute weaker heave response the inconsistency between two models can cause such a difference the cfd model can compute water fluid oscillation around the sections but 2d t model do not consider oscillation for fluid flow instead it assumes that water and solid body mutually interact with a very high frequency it can lead to smaller sectional forces as the waves become longer inasmuch as gravity effects becomes more significant it is interesting to note that authors have seen such a difference between cfd and 2d t results in stimulation of heave response of a stepless boat readers who are interested are invited to find related technical discussions in tavakoli et al 2020 pitch response of model c2 is presented in fig 12 the dashed red line shows the reference line referring to the wave steepness it can be seen that both cfd and 2d t models capture a reassurance at a wavelength being between 2l and 4l at speed of 6 25 m s at the higher speed it can be seen that both models predict that the pitch response converges a constant value as wavelengths becomes longer than 2l again the cfd model predicts higher values the possible reason for the differences between the results of the two models is assumptions made for each of them the 2d t model neglects the gravity and computes sectional forces for an infinite frequency this might lead to larger damping forces and smaller exciting forces especially over the resonance zone where motions are significant vertical acceleration of model c2 at its cg is computed by both methods the related data is shown in fig 13 both models have predicted that vertical acceleration can reach higher values at resonance zone but 2d t model gives large values for vertical accelerations induced by short waves e g 1l such a difference can be attributed to the method by which forces are computed it has been previously observed that when waves are short 2d t model might compute negative sectional forces that can lead to large variation of vertical force in a single cycle which consequences in larger vertical accelerations compared with what is computed by cfd technical information can be found in tavakoli et al 2020 moreover note that the mathematical model neglects the contribution of viscous forces as well when the bow of the vessel re enters water viscous pressure can also contribute huang et al 2021 this can also be another reason for larger vertical acceleration that the 2d t model computes at small frequencies examples of the time histories of heave pitch and vertical acceleration computed by both cfd and 2d t models are also presented in appendix f these results are not presented in this section as they might make the paper hard to follow as it was explained earlier it is impossible to evaluate the accuracy of 2d t model in reproducing the unsteady motions of a double stepped boat subjected to waves as no experimental data is available instead its results were compared against a cfd model in this section it was seen that their data follow each other at most of forcing conditions there are some differences between the computed data especially at long waves the inconsistency between the models which is related to the way sectional forces are computed is likely to be the main reason also the turbulent nature of the flow especially the water jet flowing toward the middle and rear surfaces can also cause extra shear stresses that are excluded from the 2d t model but it is important to note that turbulence is expected to be stronger for the case of shorter waves as their orbital velocity is higher 7 effects of step on dynamic responses of a double stepped boat in the previous sections the performance of 2d t model in computing the dynamic response of a double stepped vessel operating in planing mode was evaluated it was observed that it can compute the running attitudes and resistance of a hard chine stepped planing boat advancing in smooth water with a good level of accuracy especially at higher speeds then it was shown how it computes the dynamic response of a double stepped boat under the forces of head sea waves the comparison between the results of cfd and 2d t models show that the 2d t model can provide reliable data and can be applied for improving our understanding of the unsteady planing motion of double stepped boats in this section this model is used for this aim 7 1 adding two steps to the bottom heave and pitch responses of model c and c2 are found by using the developed mathematical model motions of these two vessels were mathematically replicated at four different beam froude numbers ranging from 1 9 to 4 77 waves with different frequencies were generated to have rao plots with enough wavelengths heave response of both models are shown in fig 14 at the two lower speeds heave responses of both models seem to be over damped and do not reach a significant peak value in the resonance zone at very long waves such as λ 3l heave responses of both models converge to 1 0 model c2 is observed to have smaller response at most of the forcing conditions at the longest wave heave response of this model is slightly larger compared to that of model c at the frb 3 83 heave response of model c reaches its maximum value at a wavelength ranging between 2l to 4l waves can also resonate heave response of model c2 but heave response corresponding to resonance of model c2 is much smaller compared to that of model c at this speed finally at the highest beam froude number no resonance emerges in heave response of model c2 while a resonance is seen to emerge in the heave response of model c at the all forcing conditions model c is found to have greater heave response pitch responses of both model c and c2 are presented in fig 15 it can be seen that at the lowest speed pitch response of both models is over damped i e pitch amplitude is not highly intensified at frequencies near the natural frequency of both vessels model c2 is seen to have smaller response at most of the forcing conditions at this speed at the higher speeds the pitch response of model c becomes larger and resonance occurs but model c2 is not affected in that way resonance only occurs when model c2 advances at froude number of 4 77 at larger froude number response is seen to be over damped and pitch response is observed to be below or nearly equal the steepness of the incoming wave in addition it is obvious that model c2 has smaller pitch response at all speeds vertical acceleration of both models are shown in fig 16 as seen vertical acceleration of both models increases by the increase in speed which agrees with the previous observations model c has been found to have larger vertical acceleration at its cg at the highest speed vertical acceleration of model c reaches up to 1 7g which is quite large and can be very harmful for the crew of the vessel overall it is observed that model c2 which has two transverse steps has a better performance in head sea condition i e its heave and pitch responses as well as vertical acceleration at cg are smaller compared to those of model c this provides us with an important message that a double stepped design can affect the hydrodynamic behavior of a vessel advancing at planing regime one of the main reasons that leads to such a better performance is likely to be the changes in the wetted surface pattern of the vessel three different surfaces which are partially washed by waves can increase the damping forces and moments which reduce the heave and pitch response of the vessel in resonance zone note that the effects double stepped design on heave and pitch responses was seen to be more significant at the two higher speeds this matches with the physics of problem as the speed of a double stepped hull increases effects of step on flow pattern becomes greater and leads to larger ventilation area and also it reduces the dynamic trim angle 7 2 step height in this sub section vertical motions of two different double stepped hulls are mathematically simulated in head sea condition one of the hulls case 4 has a shorter front step and the other case 6 has two steps with similar heights sectional half beam and deadrise angle of these two hulls are the same heave responses of case 4 triangle markers and case 6 cross markers are displayed in fig 17 pitch response of case 4 is seen to be smaller compared to that of case 5 at higher speed in addition vertical motion of this vessel case 4 is not resonated by waves at the marked area and the heave response plot is showing an over damped behavior note that at smaller froude number frb 3 89 heave response of case 4 is seen to be larger compared to case 6 at short waves pitch response of cases 4 and 6 are plotted in fig 18 both models show an over damped behavior in pitch direction their responses are seen to be very close to each other at longer waves case 4 is seen to have smaller response but at very short waves it can have larger response vertical acceleration of cases 4 and 6 are displayed in fig 19 it can be seen that vertical acceleration of both models follow each other at the lower froude numbers at the higher speed however vertical acceleration of case 4 is seen to be relatively larger compared to that of case 6 the differences at the highest speed are not significant but it can reach up to 1 3g at some forcing conditions on the whole the results presented in this subsection confirmed that the response of the dynamic of a double stepped boat is sensitive to proportion of step heights heave response of the vessel is highly influenced by the step height when the front step is set to be shorter heave motion is highly decreased and a very weak resonance might occur but it can lead to larger vertical acceleration at cg of the vessel when speed is increased such a phenomenon is expected to be affected by distribution of the wetted area of the vessel compared to a case for which both steps have similar heights larger area of the middle body and less area of the rear body are washed the water flow such a wet area pattern is expected to influence the damping forces moments of the vessel by increasing them i e when front step is shorter damping force increases therefore heave response is reduced and a very weak resonance might occur but the larger wet area can allow a larger volume of water to periodically impact the vessel causing a larger vertical force in this condition the vertical acceleration is expected to be larger 8 concluding remarks double stepped planing hulls have been turned into one of the interesting designs that can be used for a safe operation in water their motion obeys nonlinear theories and is far from being linear as the wet area of the vessel varies over time in the current research a mathematical model based on the 2d t was developed to replicate the unsteady motion of double stepped boats in head sea condition the model uses the solution of a high frequency radiation problem known as wagner to compute sectional forces by applying momentum variation law a simplified model was also applied to compute the ventilation area behind each step in parallel a cfd model was used to simulate the unsteady motion of the double stepped boats in waves this model was applied due to the lack of available experimental seakeeping tests of double stepped boats both models were found to be valid enough to be used for performance prediction of the vessel in calm water conditions the related simulations were performed by setting the water waves to be zero which resembles a smooth water test the 2d t model was seen to have large errors at low speeds where the assumptions of the 2d t model are expected to be inconsistent with reality rough water tests then were carried out results of both models were compared against each other showing their results follow each other there were some differences in long waves heave and pitch responses computed by 2d t model were seen to be smaller which is expected to be linked to the assumptions of the 2d t model this model is based on the infinite frequency radiation problem which simplifies fluid motion around the section when unsteady motions occur when waves become longer such an assumption can lead to inconsistency with the physic of the problem but the relative agreement between cfd and 2d t results confirmed that the 2d t model is reliable enough to be used for simulation of the unsteady motion of double stepped hulls the mathematical model was used to improve the understanding of the effects of steps on the unsteady planing motion in waves vertical motions of a stepless boat and a double stepped hull were both were mathematically replicated in head sea by using the 2d t method it was seen that the stepped design can positively affect the performance of the vessel heave and pitch responses were both seen to be reduced when two steps were added to the bottom of the vessel vertical acceleration was also seen to be reduced when two steps were added to the bottom of the vessel for the case of a double stepped boat the wetted area pattern is divided into three sub areas on which the hydrodynamic pressure is distributed such a change in the wetted area pattern of the vessel is likely to be the main reason that reduces vertical motions of double stepped boats two double stepped boats with similar sectional deadrise angles and beams were also mathematically modeled in the head sea condition the main difference between these two designs was the step heights in one case both steps have the same heights but the other vessel had a shorter front step quantitative comparison between the results demonstrated that in the case the front step is shorter heave motion especially in the resonance zone is reduced while vertical acceleration may be increased a shorter front step may increase the washed area of the middle surface a larger washed area can increase the total damping force and also can increase the exciting force therefore such behavior was observed for the vessel with a shorter front step the model developed in the present research provided an understanding of the unsteady planing motion of double stepped hulls the performance of the model can be modified by consideration of oscillation motions of the sections and also by assuming a more accurate prediction for the transom wave in addition the model can be further developed to consider more degrees of freedom specifically the roll motion can be considered in the model which is likely to be very important for the case of high speed vessels as they might show unstable behavior in the transverse direction more importantly as was mentioned before experimental studies highlighting wave induced motions of double stepped planing hulls are lacking at the present stage it is very vital to perform systematic experimental studies on the motions of double stepped planing hulls exposed to water waves this can provide us with an understanding of the unsteady motion of double stepped planing through experimental observations in addition the data provides us with a benchmark that can be used for the validation of mathematical or numerical simulations credit authorship contribution statement rasul niazmand bilandi investigation software validation visualization writing original draft

solid wedge shape body entering water is found using the wagner solution as a 1 a π 2 ρ c 2 here c is the half wetted beam of the solid body and vary over time time rate of added mass is found by computing derivative of equation a 1 with respect to time as a 2 a π ρ c c as explained earlier c is a function of time therefore its time rate emerged as we compute the differential of the right side

case of a wedge shape body entering water with constant speed 1 ψ is found to be π 2 c 0 refers to the transverse location of intersection between calm water line water and is computed using the shape

water entry simulation after chine wetting in a real water entry problem as the water reaches the chine its is separated and can affect the fluid the motion around the solid body but we have simplified the problem by neglecting such a phenomenon appendix bintegral terms emerged in three dimensional forces the integration emerged in the final three dimensional forces acting on each planing

flow behaviour near walls of the vessel a standard y model is used y is defined to be calculated as c 4 d u τ v y where d is the normal distance from the wall of the vessel u τ is the frictional velocity and v is the kinematic viscosity of water the frictional velocity is related to the shear stress acting on the wall of the vessel as c 5 u τ τ w ρ the y value is set to vary between 30 and 300 on the wall of model c2 when it advances in waves its distribution on the wall of the model c2 is shown in fig 20 readers who are interested in reconstruction of the turbulent fluid motion around a planing vessel are referred to hosseini et al 2021 fig 20 distribution of y on the bottom wall of model c2 for fnb 2 94 fig 20 appendix d mesh sensitivity study for cfd model a sample of the mesh study is shown in this appendix vertical motions of model c2 are numerically replicated in the fluid domain simulations are performed to replicate the motion of vessel at beam froude number of 3 83 and wavelength of 3 12l simulations are performed using all four generated grids heave and pitch responses are computed the summary of data is shown in fig 21 it is observed that heave and pitch responses of the vessel converge by the increase of the cells the data presented in fig 21 ensures the fine gird g3 can provide reliable data and grids with greater numbers of cell do not affect the simulations therefore the fine grid is opted to use for modeling the unsteady planing motion of model c2 in different forcing conditions fig 21 results of the performed mesh study these results correspond to the heave and pitch motions of model c2 froude number is 3 83 and wavelength is 3 12l fig 21 appendix e wave generation by cfd model samples of generated waves by the numerical model are presented in this appendix to evaluate the performance of cfd model in generation of water waves tests are performed in an open water condition and the numerical domain is vessel free water waves with a length of 1 6l corresponding to the frequency of 0 7 rad s are generated in the right end of the domain wave steepness is set to be 0 039 this condition matches with one of the forcing conditions used in the present research 4th row of table 4 time history of generated waves at a point with a longitudinal position of 0 5l from the inlet is shown in fig 22 also water surface elevation corresponding to linear wave given by theory is plotted in this figure it can be seen that the numerical data matches with the theory showing that the cfd model is working well fig 22 free surface elevation generated by cfd model in an open water condition at a point with a distance of 0 5l from the wave maker the results are also compared against airy theory to check the validity of the numerical technique fig 22 a sample of water surface is shown in fig 23 the water surface elevation in the whole domain is shown an uni directional pattern for the waves is observed which ensures that the cfd model do not lead to any multi directional waves therefore it is guarantees that the generated wave model provides a clean fully head sea condition fig 23 three dimensional view of the uni directional waves generated by the numerical model the snaphshot presented here corresponds to the wavelength of 1 6l and steepness value of 0 039 fig 23 also the time history of the wave waves at three different virtual wave probes are plotted these probes shown by wp1 wp2 and wp3 are located at longitudinal positions of 0 5l 2 5l 4 5l from the wave maker note that wp1 gives the water surface elevation presented in fig 23 also wp2 locates where the cg of the vessel is located in the wave body testes time histories are plotted in lower panel of fig 24 each time history is bounded with two different dotted lines referring to a in and a in it can be seen that the water is initially at rest but as the wave energy reaches to the point it starts to oscillate around its initial value equilibrium condition water surface elevation at none of the probes is seen to go beyond the dashed lines this means that the energy of waves is well damped at all boundaries and therefore no reflection effects emerges in simulation fig 24 upper row shows the location of three different virtual wave probes note that the tests are vessel free and the vessel with a low transparency is drawn to show the location of the vessel in the tank when its mutual interaction with waves is numerically modeled lower panels show the time histories of the monochromatic wave propagating in the numerical tank time history of water surface elevation is shown since the initial time to show how the generated gravity wave is developed the second probe is placed at the cg of the vessel is located note that all results correspond to an open water condition and the vessel is not placed in the domain fig 24 appendix f sample of time histories of the response of model c2 samples of time histories of heave pitch and vertical acceleration of model c2 are presented in this appendix samples are extracted from both cfd and mathematical models which are respectively shown by solid blue and dashed black plots in all figures and panels the presented data cover two different beam froude numbers of 2 94 and 3 83 which correspond to speeds of 6 25 and 8 13 m s respectively two different forcing conditions with wavelengths of 1 59l and 3 12l are considered the smaller wavelength represents a situation with small heave and pitch responses but can have large vertical acceleration the other wavelengths however can causes larger heave and pitch responses but can induce smaller vertical acceleration fig 25 displays examples of the heave response of the model c2 over the time as seen heave response computed by both models show harmonic behaviour and seems to follow a linear response at the shorter wavelengths cfd and 2d t method are seen to fit very well at the longer wavelength there are some differences and 2d t method computes smaller response fig 25 time histories of heave response of model c2 results correspond to two different beam froude numbers of 2 94 and 3 83 two different wavelengths of 1

for heave response time dependent pitch of the vessel is harmonic both cfd and 2d t model provides very similar results at shorter wavelength at the longer wavelength larger pitch response is computed by cfd model fig 26 time histories of pitch response of model c2 results correspond to two different beam froude numbers of 2 94 and 3 83 two different wavelengths of 1 59l and 3 12l are considered

seen to show nonlinear behaviour as apparent crest of vertical acceleration is sharp crest is seen to be sharper at higher speed and shorter wave the crest corresponding to 2d t model is also seen to be skewed toward left physically 2d t model is more likely to compute larger spectral values for second and third harmonics fig 27 time histories of vertical acceleration of model c2 at cg results

20404,the interaction of airy waves with a bottom mounted surface piercing concentric dual arc porous wall was theoretically investigated in this study via the eigenfunction expansion approach the outer and inner arc shaped walls were considered to be thin in thickness and rigidly fixed on a flat seabed as critical elements two virtual concentric cylinders extending the dual arc wall structure were introduced to divide the entire fluid domain into three major sub domains subsequently a set of linear equations of unknown coefficients in the velocity potential was derived and solved by matching the boundary conditions between different regions the current results of the three cases were consistent with the literature reports moreover the dual arc wall delivered a better shielding performance than the single arc wall in addition parametric studies on porosity annular spacing opening angle and incident wave angle were given and discussed furthermore the hydrodynamic loads and wave elevations for a concentric structure with an outer arc shaped wall and a concentric two cylinder structure were compared using the same parameters the hydrodynamic performance of the two structures were found to be similar which reveals that former structure can replace the latter in certain water areas keywords analytical model porous structure dual arc wall wave structure interaction 1 introduction global warming has caused a rise in sea level and protection structures such as porous walls and breakwaters can prevent large water waves from directly damaging the coastal and offshore engineering applications in coastal cities various protective structures have been proposed designed and applied to shelter ports and inlets in deep and medium water depth areas wiegel 1962 briggs et al 1995 chang et al 2012 chu et al 2014 however strong reflected waves cause large hydrodynamic forces to appear on the surface of these structure owing to their impermeable liu and lin 2013a zhai et al 2021 thus porous structures have attracted great attention among researchers over the past decade which can dissipate the energy of the incident wave reduce wave loads and wave runup at a considerably low cost in this context several different types of porous structures have been used in coastal and ocean engineering for instance the well known ekofisk gravity offshore structure applied in the north sea which can be regarded as a concentric cylindrical structure song and tao 2007 therefore the above situation makes the study of wave diffraction on porous structures essential for both academic and engineering purposes the porous wavemaker theory was pioneered by chwang 1983 who studied the total hydrodynamic pressure distribution on the wavemaker and provided the fundamental basis for examining the linear water wave interaction with porous structures such as porous walls and perforated breakwaters since then many theoretical numerical and experimental studies have been conducted on wave diffraction using one or multiple vertical porous cylindrical structures darwiche et al 1994 wang and ren 1994 williams and li 1998 williams et al 2000 williams and li 2000 zhong and wang 2006 song and tao 2007 tao et al 2009 liu et al 2012 weng et al 2016 liu et al 2018 sarkar and bora 2020 zhai et al 2020 in addition extensive research effort has been devoted to wave interaction with different types of porous cylindrical structures among them the concentric cylindrical structures are the most widely applied in practical engineering wang and ren 1994 first analytically investigated analytically the linear wave diffraction by a concentric structure with a porous outer cylinder and an impermeable the inner cylinder via the eigenfunction expansion approach proposed by linton and evans 1990 they reported that the wave force elevation acting on the inner cylinder were remarkably reduced owing to the existence of an outer porous cylinder similarly teng et al 2000 and li et al 2003 presented similar results by applying hankel function instead of bessel function in the interior domain to solve the solutions of velocity potentials darwiche et al 1994 and williams and li 1998 dealt with the diffraction problem of the airy wave using a semi porous concentric system case which is an extension of the work of wang and ren 1994 vijayalakshmi et al 2007 2008 experimentally and numerically investigated the wave surface fluctuations and hydrodynamic force exerted on a porous concentric two cylinder system respectively this typical concentric cylindrical structure was later studied using different incident waves for instance the interactions between these structures and different types of waves such as solitary waves zhong and wang 2006 sankarbabu et al 2008 short crested waves song and tao 2007 tao et al 2009 liu and lin 2013b and cnoidal waves weng et al 2016 zhai et al 2020 have been studied by several researchers in addition there are still many studies focussing on the modifications of concentric cylindrical structures such as a concentric three cylinder structure liu et al 2012 a truncated cylinder with an upper porous sidewall ning et al 2017 a floating compound porous cylinder sarkar and bora 2019 a concentric structure with an exterior porous and flexible cylinder mandal et al 2013 a concentric system with arbitrary smooth section liu et al 2018 and a bottom mounted compound porous cylinder sarkar and bora 2020 through these studies engineers can obtain a better understanding of linear wave diffraction by a porous structure especially for the concentric cylindrical forms which helps in designing and building safer and more effective marine systems arc shaped porous structures have been proposed in recent years to improve the protective effects and reduce the construction costs of porous cylindrical structures therefore to study of plane wave interaction with this type of structure poses great interest in earlier research cheng et al 2007 focused on examining wave surface fluctuations on a porous bottom mounted arc shaped breakwater based on linear wave theory later the hydrodynamic loads and wave amplitude with different model parameters on the impermeable arc shaped breakwater were calculated by chu et al 2014 using the same method duan et al 2012 extended the work of cheng et al 2007 to analyse the sheltering effect of a floating porous arc shaped breakwater lin and liu 2012 extended the work of tao et al 2009 to numerically study the diffraction problems of short crested waves using a concentric dual arc structure via the scaled boundary finite element method subsequently liu and lin 2013a b conducted a numerical analysis on the hydrodynamic performance of a concentric cylindrical system for short crested waves initially with a porous outer wall and further with an outer dual arc wall using the same method recently zhai et al 2020 employed the eigenfunction expansion approach to investigate the cnoidal wave diffraction problem by a concentric structure with an outer porous arc shaped cylinder in a shallow water area compared with the numerical method for the water wave interaction with a porous dual arc cylindrical system in liu and lin 2013b applying the analytical approach to re examine the same diffraction problem is fast and meaningful to the best of the authors knowledge the theoretical study on the interaction between airy waves and a porous concentric dual arc structure is yet to be conducted thus in this study the linear water wave interaction with a concentric porous dual arc wall using the eigenfunction expansion approach was investigated following the works of cheng et al 2007 and chu et al 2014 and the analytical solutions were obtained the free surface elevation and wave force on the outer and inner walls were determined moreover the effects of the wave parameters structure porosity incident wave angle and geometric parameters of the wall on the hydrodynamic loads on the dual arc wall were also discussed the hydrodynamic performance of the dual and single arc walls were compared to investigate its protective effect in addition we compared the wave forces and wave elevation among a single cylinder maccamy and fuchs 1954 a concentric structure with a porous outer arc shaped wall and a concentric two cylinder system wang and ren 1994 under the same parameters as mentioned above the latter two structures have a similar hydrodynamic performance in certain special aquatic areas overall the present analytical approach has the potential to serve as a quick assessment tool for wave loads and wave runup for the design of the dual arc wall the remainder of this paper is organised as follows the theoretical formulation is presented in section 2 section 3 presents the derivation of the analytical solution of the diffraction waves and the resulting wave forces and wave elevation three verification cases were introduced in section 4 to prove the accuracy and efficiency of the analytical solution a comparison of hydrodynamic loads wave runup and wave elevation between the dual arc breakwater and single arc wall was examined in section 5 in section 6 a detailed parametric investigated was carried out further a particular case of a concentric system with a porous outer arc shaped was studied in section 7 finally the conclusions are presented in section 8 2 definition and theoretical formulation a schematic diagram of airy waves passing through a concentric system with porous dual arc walls is shown in fig 1 the thickness of the two arc shaped walls was small enough to be considered negligible in comparison to the incident wavelength and the structure was rigidly fixed on the flat seabed a cartesian coordinate system x y z was built with the origin located at the still water bottom and the z axis passing vertically upward through the centre of the structure symbols a b and h denote the outer arc shaped wall radius inner arc shaped wall radius and still water depth respectively the outer arc shaped wall was symmetrically placed between θ α 1 and θ 2 π α 1 whereas the inner arc shaped wall was located between θ α 2 and θ 2 π α 2 specifically the central angles of the outer and inner arc shaped walls were γ 1 2 π 2 α 1 and γ 2 2 π 2 α 2 respectively as key elements two virtual closed circular cylindrical structures were introduced to extend the dual arc structure from the same centre liu and lin 2013b therefore the entire fluid domain of the study was divided into three sub regions the region outside of the outer wall ω 1 r a 0 z h the region within the inner wall ω 3 r b 0 z h and the annular region between the two walls ω 2 b r a 0 z h it is supposed that the fluid is homogeneous inviscid incompressible and the flow is irrotational the height of incident wave was h the velocity potential φ re ϕ was introduced to describe the fluid motion where ϕ denotes the complex velocity potential and re represents the real part of the argument furthermore the velocity potential in each region can be written as φ j φ i φ s j re ϕ i ϕ s j re ϕ j for j 1 2 3 where φ i and φ s are the incident and scattered wave potential respectively and ϕ i and ϕ s are the complex potential of the incident and scattered wave respectively for a small amplitude incident waves of amplitude a frequency ω and propagating at angle β to the positive x axis the incident wave velocity potential ϕ i can be written as 1 ϕ i i g h 2 ω cosh k z cosh k h e i ω t n 0 β n cos n β

conditions on the free surface and the seabed can be expressed as 3 g ϕ j z ω 2 ϕ j 0 for z h j 1 2 3 4 ϕ j z 0 for z 0 j 1 2 3 where g denotes the gravitational acceleration and ω denotes the angular wave frequency on the porous surface of the two arc shaped walls and on both sides of the virtual closed circular cylindrical structures the complex velocity potential followed the matching conditions

walls was assumed to obey darcy s law therefore the boundary conditions on the two porous arc shaped walls as in williams and li 2000 can be written as 9 ϕ 1 r ϕ 2 r i d 1 ρ ω μ ϕ 1 ϕ 2 for r a α 1 θ 2 π α 1 10 ϕ 2 r ϕ 3 r i d 2 ρ ω μ ϕ 2 ϕ 3 for r b α 2 θ 2 π α 2 where ρ denotes the density of the seawater μ is the constant coefficient of dynamic viscosity and d 1 and d 2 are materials constant with the respective dimensions of length of the outer and inner arc shaped walls the complex velocity potential of the scattered wave ϕ s 1 must satisfy the sommerfeld radiation condition at infinity

analytical solution for the wave diffraction problem was derived following the well known eigenfunction expansion approach the velocity potential ϕ j j 1 2 3 satisfying eq 2 and the boundary conditions in eqs 5 10 the velocity potential in the three domains ω j j 1 2 3 can be expressed as 12 ϕ 1 i g h 2 ω cosh k z cosh k h e i ω t n 0 β n cos n β j n k r a n 1 h n 1 k r cos n θ β n sin n

therefore for the velocity potential ϕ 2 in the region ω 2 the use of h n 1 k r and y n k r is mathematically equivalent song and tao 2007 substituting eqs 12 14 into the structural boundary

compared to that of the current study as shown our results were consistent with those of maccamy and fuchs 1954 third the current structure was converted into a concentric two cylinder system with an outer porous cylinder under the conditions of the porous effect parameters g 1 1 and g 2 0 and the opening angle of the two walls γ 1 γ 2 2 π as investigated by wang and ren 1994 the other parameter

studying various problems related to the parameters 5 comparison of the single arc wall and the dual arc wall 5 1 wave forces and wave runups in the concentric case with the inner wall radius b a single arc wall was arranged at the same position as the inner arc shaped wall of the concentric structure fig 5 shows the comparison of the maximum dimensionless wave force acting on the single arc wall and the inner arc shaped wall for different porous effect parameters g 1 and g 2 the following parameters were used in analysis i e a 150 m b 100 m h 20 m β 0 γ 1 π 2 γ 2 2 π 3 l 200 m and h 2 m where l is the incident wavelength as can be seen in fig 5 the porosity of the structure g 2 1 resulted in an evident reduction of the hydrodynamic loads on the single arc wall the wave force on the inner arc shaped wall was lesser than that on the single arc wall owing to the existence of the outer wall regardless of being impermeable a high oscillating behaviour was observed for the inner wall in the neighbourhood of k h 1 3 when the dual arc wall was impermeable g 1 g 2 0 this effect was caused by resonance however the high oscillating behaviour was avoided when the dual arc wall was porous g 1 g 2 1 fig 6 shows the variation of the wave runup at point p see fig 1 on the inner wall surface for different porous effect parameters g 1 and g 2 the coordinate of feature point p in the x o y plane was b 0 the wave runup of the impermeable single arc wall was evaluated to be greater than that of the porous single arc wall meanwhile a high oscillating behaviour was also observed on the inner wall surface when k h increasing on the dual arc impermeable wall g 1 g 2 0 moreover the changing trend of the wave runup was similar to that of hydrodynamic loads in contrast the wave runup on the inner wall attained a relative stability for the dual arc porous wall g 1 g 2 1 which indicated the noticeable effect of the porous parameter on the wave runup as mentioned above the outer porous structure was used to protect the inner structure for the double layer concentric cylindrical structure in practical engineering application song and tao 2007 tao et al 2009 weng et al 2016 and the protected offshore coastal structure was to be located around the centre of the interior structure in this study the length of the outer arc shaped wall could be relatively small however it could effectively reduce the wave force acting on the inner arc shaped wall therefore this type of typical marine structure has been discussed further the wave force on the inner arc shaped wall plotted against the wavenumber k h for various values of g 1 is shown in fig 7 in this comparison three different basic configurations of the dual arc wall were investigated a a 150 m g 1 1 g 2 0 γ 1 π 2 b a 125 m g 1 0 5 g 2 0 γ 1 π 2 and c a 125 m g 1 0 5 g 2 0 γ 1 π 3 the other parameters were the same as those presented in fig 5 the changing trend of the wave force on the inner wall was similar to that of the wave force on the single arc wall with increasing k h whereas the magnitude of the wave force on the inner wall was evidently lesser than that of the single arc wall for 0 5 k h 2 5 especially for case b the corresponding wave runup at point p on the inner wall surface is shown in fig 8 the wave reflected from the inner impermeable wall could cause a prominent disturbance in the wave field occupying the gap leading to the intensive oscillation of the wave runup with increasing k h still withstanding the wave runup amplitude on the inner wall was significantly lower than that of an impermeable single arc wall 5 2 wave elevation the wave surface elevation change in the vicinity of the single arc and dual arc walls was studied for varying porous effect parameters g 1 and g 2 and the opening angle of the outer wall γ 1 the iso amplitude contours for the entire region are shown in fig 9 eight different basic configurations of single and dual arc walls were studied a single arc wall g 2 0 b single arc wall g 2 1 c dual arc wall a 150 m g 1 g 2 0 γ 1 π 2 d dual arc wall a 150 m g 1 g 2 1 γ 1 π 2 e dual arc wall a 150 m g 1 1 g 2 0 γ 1 π 2 f dual arc wall a 125 m g 1 1 g 2 0 γ 1 π 2 g dual arc wall a 125 m g 1 0 5 g 2 0 γ 1 π 2 h dual arc wall a 125 m g 1 0 5 g 2 0 γ 1 π 3 the other parameters were the same as those used by chu et al 2014 b 100 m γ 2 2 π 3 h 2 m and h 20 m the wave patterns of the impermeable single arc wall or impermeable dual arc wall were much more complex than those of the porous single or porous dual arc wall as generally accepted the iso amplitude plots were symmetric with respect to the longitudinal x axis resulting in zero forces in the y direction tao et al 2009 liu and lin 2013b the wave runup around the impermeable single arc wall was significantly higher than that of the porous single arc wall meanwhile the wave runup around the inner arc shaped wall was noticeably reduced compared to the single arc wall when the both the walls were impermeable however the impermeable dual arc structure can cause resonance as clearly shown in fig 9 e f g and h the wave runup around the inner wall was evidently reduced as compared to the single arc wall owing to the existence of the porous outer wall thus it was theoretically feasible to set up a relatively small porous outer arc shaped wall for protecting the inner wall which could effectively reduce the wave load on the inner wall at a low cost especially for case 9 g additionally the corresponding free surface profiles along the centreline of the concentric structure are also depicted in figs 10 and 11 the amplitude of the wave crest and trough surges for the impermeable structure and the wave elevation in front of the single arc breakwater or the outer breakwater of the concentric structure became excessively large this could cause overtopping and even overturn the structure for excessively large wave elevation the wave elevation on the windward side of the inner wall could be observed to decrease significantly for case 9 g in fig 10 which indicated the improvement in security of the inner wall overall as the porous structure allowed certain waves to penetrate the wave force wave runup and wave elevation exhibited a sharp decrease duan et al 2012 moreover the porous dual arc wall delivered better protection than that of the porous single arc wall however in context of a practical project the dual arc wall with a porous and relatively small outer wall is more likely to be adopted in engineering 6 parametric studies and discussions in this section several numerical results on the dimensionless wave force acting on the outer and inner arc shaped walls were analysed to study the effect of different combinations of parameters in various cases in all the subsequent calculations the radius and the opening angle of the inner arc shaped wall were chosen as 100 m and γ 2 2 π 3 respectively water depth h was 20 m incident wavelength l 200 m and wave height was h 2 m which is consistent with the parameters used by cheng et al 2007 and chu et al 2014 for wave diffraction by a single arc wall 6 1 effect of incident wave angle as standing waves β 0 result in zero hydrodynamic loads on both the walls owing to the symmetry of the problem the cases included four different incident angles at β 0 π 8 π 4 and 3 π 8 in the calculation fig 12 shows the variation of the maximum dimensionless hydrodynamic loads on the outer and inner arc shaped walls versus the wavenumber kh for different values of β with g 1 1 g 2 0 γ 1 π 2 and b a 2 3 in general the hydrodynamic loads on the outer wall decrease as the incident angle β increases note from fig 12 a that when k h was approximately 1 3 2 5 3 8 the wave force on the outer wall reached only small values on the contrary the maximum wave forces on the outer and inner walls occurred near k h 0 5 and k h 0 3 respectively in addition the wave load exerted on the two walls was the largest when the wave has a normal incidence β 0 among the different incident angles therefore it was reasonable to choose β 0 as one of the research parameters in this study considering the safer of the structure design the corresponding dimensionless free surface elevation for various incident angles β is shown in fig 13 which show that the sheltering reduced with an increasing incident angle β in practical engineering the design of protective engineering is to resist certain directional waves for instance the waves always travel in a certain direction owing to wave refraction caused by topography for the structures located near a coast thus focussing on the normal incident waves has a higher applicability 6 2 effect of the opening angle of the two walls the porosity of the two virtual cylindrical structures was uniform in the vertical direction but varied in the circumferential direction this allowed a variety of options for the opening angles of the two porous arc shaped walls liu and lin 2013b fig 14 shows the variation of wave force versus the same opening angles γ γ 1 γ 2 for different values of β where g 1 1 g 2 0 k h 0 3 and b a 2 3 in fig 15 a for the opening angle γ π the wave force on the outer wall decreased with the rise in the incident angle β whereas the wave force experienced an opposite trend for γ 3 π 2 the wave force on the inner wall exhibited a trend similar to that shown in fig 14 a at present the external buildings are often constructed to protect the internal structure from the direct wave impact and the construction of marine structures is incredibly expensive song and tao 2007 therefore the opening angle of the outer wall needs to be studied further in fig 15 the wave forces on the two arc shaped walls are plotted against the wavenumber k h for different values of γ 1 corresponding to g 1 0 g 2 1 γ 2 2 π 3 and b a 2 3 the hydrodynamic forces acting on the outer wall decreased with the increase in β for γ 1 5 π 6 therefore the wave force changed with further increase in γ 1 as clearly shown in fig 15 b the wave forces acting on the inner wall decreased monotonically toward its asymptotic value with increasing γ 1 meanwhile the wave force on the inner wall decreased monotonically as β increased thus for a small incident angle of β the hydrodynamic loads on the inner wall could not be effectively reduced by increasing the opening angle of the porous outer wall γ 1 in addition the maximum dimensionless wave force on the outer and inner walls versus γ 2 for different incident angles β is illustrated in fig 16 evidently the wave force acting on the outer wall initially decreased monotonically until it reached a minimum at a small γ 2 but increased towards its asymptotic value with further increase in γ 2 on the contrary the change in the opening angle γ 2 had a little effect on the wave force on the porous outer wall 6 3 effect of the spacing between the two arc shaped walls in fig 17 the wave force for the two arc shaped walls is plotted against the radius ratio b a for different values of the wavenumber k h corresponding to g 1 1 g 2 0 γ 1 π 2 γ 2 2 π 3 and β 0 as shown in fig 17 when k h increased the wavelength decreased and the oscillation frequency of the wave force on the outer and inner walls was more prominent but the oscillation amplitude of the wave force on the two walls diminished the maximum force on the structure may be due to the constructive interference between the incident and reflected waves the peak value of the wave force on the impermeable inner wall moved towards the left as k h increased whereas that on the outer wall moved towards the right with increasing k h fig 18 shows the overturning moment on the two arc shaped walls with wavenumber k h for different radius ratios b a 0 2 0 4 0 6 and 0 8 with d a 0 2 g 1 1 g 2 1 γ 1 π 2 γ 2 2 π 3 and β 0 the changing trend of the overturning moment was similar for the different radius ratios b a as can be observed from fig 18 a moreover the variation of b a had a slight effect on the moment on the outer wall from fig 18 b it can be observed that the moment on the inner wall first monotonically increases until it approaches a maximum at a small k h value thereafter the moment decreased mildly with further increase in k h meanwhile as b a increased the peak value of the moment on the inner wall moved towards the right moreover when k h 2 3 the changing trend of the moment on the inner wall was inversely proportional to the initial trend 6 4 effect of the porosities of the two arc shaped walls fig 19 shows the wave force acting on the outer and inner walls versus the porous effect parameter g 1 for different wavenumbers k h where b a 2 3 γ 1 π 2 γ 2 2 π 3 g 2 0 and β 0 the results shown in fig 19 indicate that the wave force acting on the outer wall decreases monotonically for various wavenumber k h as the porous effect parameters g 1 increased whereas the variation trend of the wave force on the inner wall was inverse to that on the outer wall with increasing g 1 this observation was analogous to the case of wave diffraction by a concentric cylindrical structure as in wang and ren 1994 zhong and wang 2006 song and tao 2007 and liu and lin 2013b besides as g 1 increased from 0 to 1 the wave force on the outer and inner walls experienced a significant descend and ascend respectively thereafter with further increase in g 1 the wave force amplitude of the outer and inner walls respectively decreased and increased towards their asymptotic values this indicated that the porous effect parameter g 1 should be moderate because a moderate g 1 could better protect the inner wall as well as improve the safety of the outer wall fig 20 presents the variation of the moment versus k h for different g 1 where b a 2 3 γ 1 π 2 γ 2 2 π 3 g 2 0 and β 0 similar to fig 19 the changes of the overturning moment were small for different g 1 at small k h values or in the low frequency region owing to the strong transmission ability of the long waves ning et al 2017 as g 1 rose from 0 1 to 3 the moment on the outer wall rapidly decreased for k h 1 3 whereas the moment on the inner wall increased quickly for 0 5 k h 1 4 as k h 1 5 the moment on the two walls varies less for different values of g 1 more importantly the curve of the numerical result was not smooth and this could have been caused by several factors for instance the water depth h the strong reflection of the impermeability of the inner wall and the influence of complex special functions like bessel and hankel functions can influence roughness in the given curve 7 a special case a concentric structure with an outer arc shaped wall our previous model was based on a concentric dual arc wall we now discuss a concentric structure with a porous outer arc shaped wall see fig 21 in other words the internal structure opening angle is selected as γ 2 2 π this model was been numerically investigated by liu and lin 2013a for short crested wave diffraction hereafter the hydrodynamic performance is compared under the same parameters on the present structure and the concentric two cylinder system wang and ren 1994 the other parameters are the same as wang and ren 1994 that is a 10 m b 5 m g 1 1 g 2 0 and h 1 m the purpose of this section is to explore whether the current structure can replace the concentric two cylinder system in certain marine environments see fig 21 7 1 effect of the porosities of the two arc shaped walls fig 22 displays the wave force acting on the structure versus the opening angle γ 1 for different incident angles β where a 10 m h 15 m b a 1 2 g 1 1 g 2 0 b a 0 5 and k h 1 5 the wave force on the outer wall decreased and that on the inner cylindrical wall increased with an increase in β however the wave force attained a relatively stable maximum value on the outer wall and a minimum value on the inner cylinder near γ 1 2 π 3 therefore it was appropriate to set the opening angle γ 1 of the outer wall to 2 π 3 7 2 comparison of wave force free surface elevation and surface profile between a concentric two cylinder system and the current structure a solid cylinder was arranged at the same position as the inner cylinder of the concentric structure with the same centre and inner cylinder radius b fig 23 shows the variation of the wave force acting on a solid cylinder of three different configurations namely a single solid cylinder maccamy and fuchs 1954 concentric structure with an outer arc shaped wall and concentric two cylinder system wang and ren 1994 where β 0 b a 1 2 a 10 m h 15 m h 1 m γ 1 2 π 3 γ 2 2 π g 1 1 and g 2 0 the wave forces on the inner cylinder of the latter two structures were smaller than that on the solid cylinder moreover the gap between them decreased gradually as the wavenumber k h increased in addition the amplitude of the wave force on the inner cylinder of the latter two structures was almost equivalent for k h 3 2 furthermore fig 24 shows the corresponding wave runup at point p on the solid cylindrical structure surface where the configuration parameters of the structure were the same as those in fig 23 for the two concentric structures the wave runup exhibited prominent oscillations with increasing k h and the amplitude variations trends were similar this represented that the low cost concentric structure with a porous outer arc shaped wall had a comparable sheltering effect on the concentric two cylinder system furthermore fig 25 illustrates the changes in wave surface elevation in the vicinity of the three different structures as shown the wave elevation around the single cylinder was considerably higher than that around the other two inner cylinders having with different concentric structures because the concentric porous outer protective structure was highly effective in reducing the transmitted and reflected wave heights in the meantime the corresponding free surface profiles along the centreline of the three structures are shown in fig 26 at y 0 and k h 2 for the two different concentric structures the wave elevation along the windward and leeward sides of the single solid cylinder was remarkably higher than that on the interior cylinder the amplitude of the wave elevation on both the sides of the inner cylinder was in contact distance for the two different concentric structures thus a concentric structure with a porous outer arc shaped wall could replace the concentric two cylinder system in certain marine regions therefore the study contributed towards the low cost design of structures that reduced wave loads on crucial marine structures 8 conclusions and future prospects in this study the eigenfunction expansion approach was applied to solve the interaction between water wave and a concentric bottom mounted surface piercing porous dual arc wall the two homocentric arc shaped structures were extended into two full cylinders to divide the entire fluid domains into three respective regions and the matched boundary conditions between the different regions were further used to derive and obtain the unknown coefficients of the analytical model the present method was numerically validated by comparing the results for typical cases with the solutions of maccamy and fuchs 1954 wang and ren 1994 and chu et al 2014 the effects of the incident angle opening angle of the arc shaped wall spacing between the two walls and porosity parameters on hydrodynamic loads wave runups and wave elevations on the outer and inner walls were carried out to perform the parametric study the results are as follows 1 the dual arc wall exhibited a better protective performance than the single arc wall however the wave force on the dual arc wall exhibited high oscillating behaviour caused by resonance as the two walls were impermeable g 1 g 2 0 therefore the application of the dual arc walls with porous outer and impermeable inner walls g 1 1 g 2 0 can be a potential choice in practical engineering application 2 a relatively small porous outer arc shaped wall was theoretically proved to effectively reduce the wave load on the inner wall and protect it at a low cost 3 as k h increased the wavelength decreased oscillation frequency of the wave force on the outer and inner walls was more prominent and oscillation amplitude of the wave force on both the wall was reduced to protect the inner wall which can effectively reduce the wave load on the inner wall with low cost 4 for the concentric two system and the concentric structure with an outer arc shaped wall the amplitudes of the wave force wave runup and wave elevation on their internal structure are very close when the incident wave angle was small this implied that the latter structure could replace the former structure in certain regions the results of this study provide reference value for the design of coastal and marine structures besides when the dual arc wall was located in shallow water areas it was more suitable to use shallow water wave theory to investigate the diffraction problem owing to the shallow water effect thus further research on the shallow water wave diffraction by a dual arc structure will be the focus of further work credit authorship contribution statement zhenfeng zhai conceptualization validation

20404,the interaction of airy waves with a bottom mounted surface piercing concentric dual arc porous wall was theoretically investigated in this study via the eigenfunction expansion approach the outer and inner arc shaped walls were considered to be thin in thickness and rigidly fixed on a flat seabed as critical elements two virtual concentric cylinders extending the dual arc wall structure were introduced to divide the entire fluid domain into three major sub domains subsequently a set of linear equations of unknown coefficients in the velocity potential was derived and solved by matching the boundary conditions between different regions the current results of the three cases were consistent with the literature reports moreover the dual arc wall delivered a better shielding performance than the single arc wall in addition parametric studies on porosity annular spacing opening angle and incident wave angle were given and discussed furthermore the hydrodynamic loads and wave elevations for a concentric structure with an outer arc shaped wall and a concentric two cylinder structure were compared using the same parameters the hydrodynamic performance of the two structures were found to be similar which reveals that former structure can replace the latter in certain water areas keywords analytical model porous structure dual arc wall wave structure interaction 1 introduction global warming has caused a rise in sea level and protection structures such as porous walls and breakwaters can prevent large water waves from directly damaging the coastal and offshore engineering applications in coastal cities various protective structures have been proposed designed and applied to shelter ports and inlets in deep and medium water depth areas wiegel 1962 briggs et al 1995 chang et al 2012 chu et al 2014 however strong reflected waves cause large hydrodynamic forces to appear on the surface of these structure owing to their impermeable liu and lin 2013a zhai et al 2021 thus porous structures have attracted great attention among researchers over the past decade which can dissipate the energy of the incident wave reduce wave loads and wave runup at a considerably low cost in this context several different types of porous structures have been used in coastal and ocean engineering for instance the well known ekofisk gravity offshore structure applied in the north sea which can be regarded as a concentric cylindrical structure song and tao 2007 therefore the above situation makes the study of wave diffraction on porous structures essential for both academic and engineering purposes the porous wavemaker theory was pioneered by chwang 1983 who studied the total hydrodynamic pressure distribution on the wavemaker and provided the fundamental basis for examining the linear water wave interaction with porous structures such as porous walls and perforated breakwaters since then many theoretical numerical and experimental studies have been conducted on wave diffraction using one or multiple vertical porous cylindrical structures darwiche et al 1994 wang and ren 1994 williams and li 1998 williams et al 2000 williams and li 2000 zhong and wang 2006 song and tao 2007 tao et al 2009 liu et al 2012 weng et al 2016 liu et al 2018 sarkar and bora 2020 zhai et al 2020 in addition extensive research effort has been devoted to wave interaction with different types of porous cylindrical structures among them the concentric cylindrical structures are the most widely applied in practical engineering wang and ren 1994 first analytically investigated analytically the linear wave diffraction by a concentric structure with a porous outer cylinder and an impermeable the inner cylinder via the eigenfunction expansion approach proposed by linton and evans 1990 they reported that the wave force elevation acting on the inner cylinder were remarkably reduced owing to the existence of an outer porous cylinder similarly teng et al 2000 and li et al 2003 presented similar results by applying hankel function instead of bessel function in the interior domain to solve the solutions of velocity potentials darwiche et al 1994 and williams and li 1998 dealt with the diffraction problem of the airy wave using a semi porous concentric system case which is an extension of the work of wang and ren 1994 vijayalakshmi et al 2007 2008 experimentally and numerically investigated the wave surface fluctuations and hydrodynamic force exerted on a porous concentric two cylinder system respectively this typical concentric cylindrical structure was later studied using different incident waves for instance the interactions between these structures and different types of waves such as solitary waves zhong and wang 2006 sankarbabu et al 2008 short crested waves song and tao 2007 tao et al 2009 liu and lin 2013b and cnoidal waves weng et al 2016 zhai et al 2020 have been studied by several researchers in addition there are still many studies focussing on the modifications of concentric cylindrical structures such as a concentric three cylinder structure liu et al 2012 a truncated cylinder with an upper porous sidewall ning et al 2017 a floating compound porous cylinder sarkar and bora 2019 a concentric structure with an exterior porous and flexible cylinder mandal et al 2013 a concentric system with arbitrary smooth section liu et al 2018 and a bottom mounted compound porous cylinder sarkar and bora 2020 through these studies engineers can obtain a better understanding of linear wave diffraction by a porous structure especially for the concentric cylindrical forms which helps in designing and building safer and more effective marine systems arc shaped porous structures have been proposed in recent years to improve the protective effects and reduce the construction costs of porous cylindrical structures therefore to study of plane wave interaction with this type of structure poses great interest in earlier research cheng et al 2007 focused on examining wave surface fluctuations on a porous bottom mounted arc shaped breakwater based on linear wave theory later the hydrodynamic loads and wave amplitude with different model parameters on the impermeable arc shaped breakwater were calculated by chu et al 2014 using the same method duan et al 2012 extended the work of cheng et al 2007 to analyse the sheltering effect of a floating porous arc shaped breakwater lin and liu 2012 extended the work of tao et al 2009 to numerically study the diffraction problems of short crested waves using a concentric dual arc structure via the scaled boundary finite element method subsequently liu and lin 2013a b conducted a numerical analysis on the hydrodynamic performance of a concentric cylindrical system for short crested waves initially with a porous outer wall and further with an outer dual arc wall using the same method recently zhai et al 2020 employed the eigenfunction expansion approach to investigate the cnoidal wave diffraction problem by a concentric structure with an outer porous arc shaped cylinder in a shallow water area compared with the numerical method for the water wave interaction with a porous dual arc cylindrical system in liu and lin 2013b applying the analytical approach to re examine the same diffraction problem is fast and meaningful to the best of the authors knowledge the theoretical study on the interaction between airy waves and a porous concentric dual arc structure is yet to be conducted thus in this study the linear water wave interaction with a concentric porous dual arc wall using the eigenfunction expansion approach was investigated following the works of cheng et al 2007 and chu et al 2014 and the analytical solutions were obtained the free surface elevation and wave force on the outer and inner walls were determined moreover the effects of the wave parameters structure porosity incident wave angle and geometric parameters of the wall on the hydrodynamic loads on the dual arc wall were also discussed the hydrodynamic performance of the dual and single arc walls were compared to investigate its protective effect in addition we compared the wave forces and wave elevation among a single cylinder maccamy and fuchs 1954 a concentric structure with a porous outer arc shaped wall and a concentric two cylinder system wang and ren 1994 under the same parameters as mentioned above the latter two structures have a similar hydrodynamic performance in certain special aquatic areas overall the present analytical approach has the potential to serve as a quick assessment tool for wave loads and wave runup for the design of the dual arc wall the remainder of this paper is organised as follows the theoretical formulation is presented in section 2 section 3 presents the derivation of the analytical solution of the diffraction waves and the resulting wave forces and wave elevation three verification cases were introduced in section 4 to prove the accuracy and efficiency of the analytical solution a comparison of hydrodynamic loads wave runup and wave elevation between the dual arc breakwater and single arc wall was examined in section 5 in section 6 a detailed parametric investigated was carried out further a particular case of a concentric system with a porous outer arc shaped was studied in section 7 finally the conclusions are presented in section 8 2 definition and theoretical formulation a schematic diagram of airy waves passing through a concentric system with porous dual arc walls is shown in fig 1 the thickness of the two arc shaped walls was small enough to be considered negligible in comparison to the incident wavelength and the structure was rigidly fixed on the flat seabed a cartesian coordinate system x y z was built with the origin located at the still water bottom and the z axis passing vertically upward through the centre of the structure symbols a b and h denote the outer arc shaped wall radius inner arc shaped wall radius and still water depth respectively the outer arc shaped wall was symmetrically placed between θ α 1 and θ 2 π α 1 whereas the inner arc shaped wall was located between θ α 2 and θ 2 π α 2 specifically the central angles of the outer and inner arc shaped walls were γ 1 2 π 2 α 1 and γ 2 2 π 2 α 2 respectively as key elements two virtual closed circular cylindrical structures were introduced to extend the dual arc structure from the same centre liu and lin 2013b therefore the entire fluid domain of the study was divided into three sub regions the region outside of the outer wall ω 1 r a 0 z h the region within the inner wall ω 3 r b 0 z h and the annular region between the two walls ω 2 b r a 0 z h it is supposed that the fluid is homogeneous inviscid incompressible and the flow is irrotational the height of incident wave was h the velocity potential φ re ϕ was introduced to describe the fluid motion where ϕ denotes the complex velocity potential and re represents the real part of the argument furthermore the velocity potential in each region can be written as φ j φ i φ s j re ϕ i ϕ s j re ϕ j for j 1 2 3 where φ i and φ s are the incident and scattered wave potential respectively and ϕ i and ϕ s are the complex potential of the incident and scattered wave respectively for a small amplitude incident waves of amplitude a frequency ω and propagating at angle β to the positive x axis the incident wave velocity potential ϕ i can be written as 1 ϕ i i g h 2 ω cosh k z cosh k h e i ω t n 0 β n cos n β

conditions on the free surface and the seabed can be expressed as 3 g ϕ j z ω 2 ϕ j 0 for z h j 1 2 3 4 ϕ j z 0 for z 0 j 1 2 3 where g denotes the gravitational acceleration and ω denotes the angular wave frequency on the porous surface of the two arc shaped walls and on both sides of the virtual closed circular cylindrical structures the complex velocity potential followed the matching conditions 5 ϕ 1 ϕ 2 for r a 0 θ α 1 2 π α 1 θ 2 π 6 ϕ 2 ϕ 3 for r b 0 θ α 2 2 π α 2 θ 2 π 7 ϕ 1 r ϕ 2 r for r a 0 θ 2 π 8 ϕ 2 r ϕ 3 r for r b 0 θ 2 π in general the fluid passing through the porous arc shaped walls was assumed to obey darcy s law therefore the boundary conditions on the two porous arc shaped walls as in williams and li 2000 can be written as 9 ϕ 1 r ϕ 2 r i d 1 ρ ω μ ϕ 1 ϕ 2 for r a α 1 θ 2 π α 1 10 ϕ 2 r ϕ 3 r i d 2 ρ ω μ ϕ 2 ϕ 3 for r b α 2 θ 2 π α 2 where ρ denotes the density of the seawater μ is the constant coefficient of dynamic viscosity and d 1 and d 2 are materials constant with the respective dimensions of length of the outer and inner arc shaped walls the complex velocity potential of the scattered wave ϕ s 1 must satisfy the sommerfeld radiation condition at infinity

program was developed in this study the hydrodynamic forces acting on the structures were compared with the published results for three limiting cases to validate our analytical model the maximum wave runup around the two walls is denoted as η which is made dimensionless by h 2 first the dual arc wall attained the form of an impermeable arc shaped wall when the opening angles of the inner arc shaped walls γ 2 0 and the porous effect parameter of the outer wall g 1 0 as investigated by chu et al 2014 fig 2 depicts a comparison of the wave force for the current prediction and the results of chu et al 2014 for a 100 m h 20 m β 0 and γ 1 π 3 and 2 π 3 where a good agreement can be observed between the two compared results second for the porous effect parameter of the outer wall g 1 0 and its opening angle γ 1 2 π the present structure converted into an impermeable cylindrical form as investigated by maccamy and fuchs 1954 the current structure became a solid cylinder from a hydrodynamic perspective because no waves inside the cylinder could be excited fig 3 shows the dimensionless hydrodynamic force exerted on a solid cylinder for the results of maccamy and fuchs 1954 compared to that of the current study as shown our results were consistent with those of maccamy and fuchs 1954 third the current structure was converted into a concentric two cylinder system with an outer porous cylinder under the conditions of the porous effect parameters g 1 1 and g 2 0 and the opening angle of the two walls γ 1 γ 2 2 π as investigated by wang and ren 1994 the other parameter values were set according to wang and ren 1994 as a 10 m b 5 m h 15 m and k h 1 2 fig 4 depicts that the two results were identical overall our analytical model proved to be useful and effective for studying various problems related to the parameters 5 comparison of the single arc wall and the dual arc wall 5 1 wave forces and wave runups in the concentric case with the inner wall radius b a single arc wall was arranged at the same position as the inner arc shaped wall of the concentric structure fig 5 shows the comparison of the maximum dimensionless wave force acting on the single arc wall and the inner arc shaped wall for different porous effect parameters g 1 and g 2 the following parameters were used in analysis i e a 150 m b 100 m h 20 m β 0 γ 1 π 2 γ 2 2 π 3 l 200 m and h 2 m where l is the incident wavelength as can be seen in fig 5 the porosity of the structure g 2 1 resulted in an evident reduction of the hydrodynamic loads on the single arc wall the wave force on the inner arc shaped wall was lesser than that on the single arc wall owing to the existence of the outer wall regardless of being impermeable a high oscillating behaviour was observed for the inner wall in the neighbourhood of k h 1 3 when the dual arc wall was impermeable g 1 g 2 0 this effect was caused by resonance however the high oscillating behaviour was avoided when the dual arc wall was porous g 1 g 2 1 fig 6 shows the variation of the wave runup at point p see fig 1 on the inner wall surface for different porous effect parameters g 1 and g 2 the coordinate of feature point p in the x o y plane was b 0 the wave runup of the impermeable single arc wall was evaluated to be greater than that of the porous single arc wall meanwhile a high oscillating behaviour was also observed on the inner wall surface when k h increasing on the dual arc impermeable wall g 1 g 2 0 moreover the changing trend of the wave runup was similar to that of hydrodynamic loads in contrast the wave runup on the inner wall attained a relative stability for the dual arc porous wall g 1 g 2 1 which indicated the noticeable effect of the porous parameter on the wave runup as mentioned above the outer porous structure was used to protect the inner structure for the double layer concentric cylindrical structure in practical engineering application song and tao 2007 tao et al 2009 weng et al 2016 and the protected offshore coastal structure was to be located around the centre of the interior structure in this study the length of the outer arc shaped wall could be relatively small however it could effectively reduce the wave force acting on the inner arc shaped wall therefore this type of typical marine structure has been discussed further the wave force on the inner arc shaped wall plotted against the wavenumber k h for various values of g 1 is shown in fig 7 in this comparison three different basic configurations of the dual arc wall were investigated a a 150 m g 1 1 g 2 0 γ 1 π 2 b a 125 m g 1 0 5 g 2 0 γ 1 π 2 and c a 125 m g 1 0 5 g 2 0 γ 1 π 3 the other parameters were the same as those presented in fig 5 the changing trend of the wave force on the inner wall was similar to that of the wave force on the single arc wall with increasing k h whereas the magnitude of the wave force on the inner wall was evidently lesser than that of the single arc wall for 0 5 k h 2 5 especially for case b the corresponding wave runup at point p on the inner wall surface is shown in fig 8 the wave reflected from the inner impermeable wall could cause a prominent disturbance in the wave field occupying the gap leading to the intensive oscillation of the wave runup with increasing k h still withstanding the wave runup amplitude on the inner wall was significantly lower than that of an impermeable single arc wall 5 2 wave elevation the wave surface elevation change in the vicinity of the single arc and dual arc walls was studied for varying porous effect parameters g 1 and g 2 and the opening angle of the outer wall γ 1 the iso amplitude contours for the entire region are shown in fig 9 eight different basic configurations of single and dual arc walls were studied a single arc wall g 2 0 b single arc wall g 2 1 c dual arc wall a 150 m g 1 g 2 0 γ 1 π 2 d dual arc wall a 150 m g 1 g 2 1 γ 1 π 2 e dual arc wall a 150 m g 1 1 g 2 0 γ 1 π 2 f dual arc wall a 125 m g 1 1 g 2 0 γ 1 π 2 g dual arc wall a 125 m g 1 0 5 g 2 0 γ 1 π 2 h dual arc wall a 125 m g 1 0 5 g 2 0 γ 1 π 3 the other parameters were the same as those used by chu et al 2014 b 100 m γ 2 2 π 3 h 2 m and h 20 m the wave patterns of the impermeable single arc wall or impermeable dual arc wall were much more complex than those of the porous single or porous dual arc wall as generally accepted the iso amplitude plots were symmetric with respect to the longitudinal x axis resulting in zero forces in the y direction tao et al 2009 liu and lin 2013b the wave runup around the impermeable single arc wall was significantly higher than that of the porous single arc wall meanwhile the wave runup around the inner arc shaped wall was noticeably reduced compared to the single arc wall when the both the walls were impermeable however the impermeable dual arc structure can cause resonance as clearly shown in fig 9 e f g and h the wave runup around the inner wall was evidently reduced as compared to the single arc wall owing to the existence of the porous outer wall thus it was theoretically feasible to set up a relatively small porous outer arc shaped wall for protecting the inner wall which could effectively reduce the wave load on the inner wall at a low cost especially for case 9 g additionally the corresponding free surface profiles along the centreline of the concentric structure are also depicted in figs 10 and 11 the amplitude of the wave crest and trough surges for the impermeable structure and the wave elevation in front of the single arc breakwater or the outer breakwater of the concentric structure became excessively large this could cause overtopping and even overturn the structure for excessively large wave elevation the wave elevation on the windward side of the inner wall could be observed to decrease significantly for case 9 g in fig 10 which indicated the improvement in security of the inner wall overall as the porous structure allowed certain waves to penetrate the wave force wave runup and wave elevation exhibited a sharp decrease duan et al 2012 moreover the porous dual arc wall delivered better protection than that of the porous single arc wall however in context of a practical project the dual arc wall with a porous and relatively small outer wall is more likely to be adopted in engineering 6 parametric studies and discussions in this section several numerical results on the dimensionless wave force acting on the outer and inner arc shaped walls were analysed to study the effect of different combinations of parameters in various cases in all the subsequent calculations the radius and the opening angle of the inner arc shaped wall were chosen as 100 m and γ 2 2 π 3 respectively water depth h was 20 m incident wavelength l 200 m and wave height was h 2 m which is consistent with the parameters used by cheng et al 2007 and chu et al 2014 for wave diffraction by a single arc wall 6 1 effect of incident wave angle as standing waves β 0 result in zero hydrodynamic loads on both the walls owing to the symmetry of the problem the cases included four different incident angles at β 0 π 8 π 4 and 3 π 8 in the calculation fig 12 shows the variation of the maximum dimensionless hydrodynamic loads on the outer and inner arc shaped walls versus the wavenumber kh for different values of β with g 1 1 g 2 0 γ 1 π 2 and b a 2 3 in general the hydrodynamic loads on the outer wall decrease as the incident angle β increases note from fig 12 a that when k h was approximately 1 3 2 5 3 8 the wave force on the outer wall reached only small values on the contrary the maximum wave forces on the outer and inner walls occurred near k h 0 5 and k h 0 3 respectively in addition the wave load exerted on the two walls was the largest when the wave has a normal incidence β 0 among the different incident angles therefore it was reasonable to choose β 0 as one of the research parameters in this study considering the safer of the structure design the corresponding dimensionless free surface elevation for various incident angles β is shown in fig 13 which show that the sheltering reduced with an increasing incident angle β in practical engineering the design of protective engineering is to resist certain directional waves for instance the waves always travel in a certain direction owing to wave refraction caused by topography for the structures located near a coast thus focussing on the normal incident waves has a higher applicability 6 2 effect of the opening angle of the two walls the porosity of the two virtual cylindrical structures was uniform in the vertical direction but varied in the circumferential direction this allowed a variety of options for the opening angles of the two porous arc shaped walls liu and lin 2013b fig 14 shows the variation of wave force versus the same opening angles γ γ 1 γ 2 for different values of β where g 1 1 g 2 0 k h 0 3 and b a 2 3 in fig 15 a for the opening angle γ π the wave force on the outer wall decreased with the rise in the incident angle β whereas the wave force experienced an opposite trend for γ 3 π 2 the wave force on the inner wall exhibited a trend similar to that shown in fig 14 a at present the external buildings are often constructed to protect the internal structure from the direct wave impact and the construction of marine structures is incredibly expensive song and tao 2007 therefore the opening angle of the outer wall needs to be studied further in fig 15 the wave forces on the two arc shaped walls are plotted against the wavenumber k h for different values of γ 1 corresponding to g 1 0 g 2 1 γ 2 2 π 3 and b a 2 3 the hydrodynamic forces acting on the outer wall decreased with the increase in β for γ 1 5 π 6 therefore the wave force changed with further increase in γ 1 as clearly shown in fig 15 b the wave forces acting on the inner wall decreased monotonically toward its asymptotic value with increasing γ 1 meanwhile the wave force on the inner wall decreased monotonically as β increased thus for a small incident angle of β the hydrodynamic loads on the inner wall could not be effectively reduced by increasing the opening angle of the porous outer wall γ 1 in addition the maximum dimensionless wave force on the outer and inner walls versus γ 2 for different incident angles β is illustrated in fig 16 evidently the wave force acting on the outer wall initially decreased monotonically until it reached a minimum at a small γ 2 but increased towards its asymptotic value with further increase in γ 2 on the contrary the change in the opening angle γ 2 had a little effect on the wave force on the porous outer wall 6 3 effect of the spacing between the two arc shaped walls in fig 17 the wave force for the two arc shaped walls is plotted against the radius ratio b a for different values of the wavenumber k h corresponding to g 1 1 g 2 0 γ 1 π 2 γ 2 2 π 3 and β 0 as shown in fig 17 when k h increased the wavelength decreased and the oscillation frequency of the wave force on the outer and inner walls was more prominent but the oscillation amplitude of the wave force on the two walls diminished the maximum force on the structure may be due to the constructive interference between the incident and reflected waves the peak value of the wave force on the impermeable inner wall moved towards the left as k h increased whereas that on the outer wall moved towards the right with increasing k h fig 18 shows the overturning moment on the two arc shaped walls with wavenumber k h for different radius ratios b a 0 2 0 4 0 6 and 0 8 with d a 0 2 g 1 1 g 2 1 γ 1 π 2 γ 2 2 π 3 and β 0 the changing trend of the overturning moment was similar for the different radius ratios b a as can be observed from fig 18 a moreover the variation of b a had a slight effect on the moment on the outer wall from fig 18 b it can be observed that the moment on the inner wall first monotonically increases until it approaches a maximum at a small k h value thereafter the moment decreased mildly with further increase in k h meanwhile as b a increased the peak value of the moment on the inner wall moved towards the right moreover when k h 2 3 the changing trend of the moment on the inner wall was inversely proportional to the initial trend 6 4 effect of the porosities of the two arc shaped walls fig 19 shows the wave force acting on the outer and inner walls versus the porous effect parameter g 1 for different wavenumbers k h where b a 2 3 γ 1 π 2 γ 2 2 π 3 g 2 0 and β 0 the results shown in fig 19 indicate that the wave force acting on the outer wall decreases monotonically for various wavenumber k h as the porous effect parameters g 1 increased whereas the variation trend of the wave force on the inner wall was inverse to that on the outer wall with increasing g 1 this observation was analogous to the case of wave diffraction by a concentric cylindrical structure as in wang and ren 1994 zhong and wang 2006 song and tao 2007 and liu and lin 2013b besides as g 1 increased from 0 to 1 the wave force on the outer and inner walls experienced a significant descend and ascend respectively thereafter with further increase in g 1 the wave force amplitude of the outer and inner walls respectively decreased and increased towards their asymptotic values this indicated that the porous effect parameter g 1 should be moderate because a moderate g 1 could better protect the inner wall as well as improve the safety of the outer wall fig 20 presents the variation of the moment versus k h for different g 1 where b a 2 3 γ 1 π 2 γ 2 2 π 3 g 2 0 and β 0 similar to fig 19 the changes of the overturning moment were small for different g 1 at small k h values or in the low frequency region owing to the strong transmission ability of the long waves ning et al 2017 as g 1 rose from 0 1 to 3 the moment on the outer wall rapidly decreased for k h 1 3 whereas the moment on the inner wall increased quickly for 0 5 k h 1 4 as k h 1 5 the moment on the two walls varies less for different values of g 1 more importantly the curve of the numerical result was not smooth and this could have been caused by several factors for instance the water depth h the strong reflection of the impermeability of the inner wall and the influence of complex special functions like bessel and hankel functions can influence roughness in the given curve 7 a special case a concentric structure with an outer arc shaped wall our previous model was based on a concentric dual arc wall we now discuss a concentric structure with a porous outer arc shaped wall see fig 21 in other words the internal structure opening angle is selected as γ 2 2 π this model was been numerically investigated by liu and lin 2013a for short crested wave diffraction hereafter the hydrodynamic performance is compared under the same parameters on the present structure and the concentric two cylinder system wang and ren 1994 the other parameters are the same as wang and ren 1994 that is a 10 m b 5 m g 1 1 g 2 0 and h 1 m the purpose of this section is to explore whether the current structure can replace the concentric two cylinder system in certain marine environments see fig 21 7 1 effect of the porosities of the two arc shaped walls fig 22 displays the wave force acting on the structure versus the opening angle γ 1 for different incident angles β where a 10 m h 15 m b a 1 2 g 1 1 g 2 0 b a 0 5 and k h 1 5 the wave force on the outer wall decreased and that on the inner cylindrical wall increased with an increase in β however the wave force attained a relatively stable maximum value on the outer wall and a minimum value on the inner cylinder near γ 1 2 π 3 therefore it was appropriate to set the opening angle γ 1 of the outer wall to 2 π 3 7 2 comparison of wave force free surface elevation and surface profile between a concentric two cylinder system and the current structure a solid cylinder was arranged at the same position as the inner cylinder of the concentric structure with the same centre and inner cylinder radius b fig 23 shows the variation of the wave force acting on a solid cylinder of three different configurations namely a single solid cylinder maccamy and fuchs 1954 concentric structure with an outer arc shaped wall and concentric two cylinder system wang and ren 1994 where β 0 b a 1 2 a 10 m h 15 m h 1 m γ 1 2 π 3 γ 2 2 π g 1 1 and g 2 0 the wave forces on the inner cylinder of the latter two structures were smaller than that on the solid cylinder moreover the gap between them decreased gradually as the wavenumber k h increased in addition the amplitude of the wave force on the inner cylinder of the latter two structures was almost equivalent for k h 3 2 furthermore fig 24 shows the corresponding wave runup at point p on the solid cylindrical structure surface where the configuration parameters of the structure were the same as those in fig 23 for the two concentric structures the wave runup exhibited prominent oscillations with increasing k h and the amplitude variations trends were similar this represented that the low cost concentric structure with a porous outer arc shaped wall had a comparable sheltering effect on the concentric two cylinder system furthermore fig 25 illustrates the changes in wave surface elevation in the vicinity of the three different structures as shown the wave elevation around the single cylinder was considerably higher than that around the other two inner cylinders having with different concentric structures because the concentric porous outer protective structure was highly effective in reducing the transmitted and reflected wave heights in the meantime the corresponding free surface profiles along the centreline of the three structures are shown in fig 26 at y 0 and k h 2 for the two different concentric structures the wave elevation along the windward and leeward sides of the single solid cylinder was remarkably higher than that on the interior cylinder the amplitude of the wave elevation on both the sides of the inner cylinder was in contact distance for the two different concentric structures thus a concentric structure with a porous outer arc shaped wall could replace the concentric two cylinder system in certain marine regions therefore the study contributed towards the low cost design of structures that reduced wave loads on crucial marine structures 8 conclusions and future prospects in this study the eigenfunction expansion approach was applied to solve the interaction between water wave and a concentric bottom mounted surface piercing porous dual arc wall the two homocentric arc shaped structures were extended into two full cylinders to divide the entire fluid domains into three respective regions and the matched boundary conditions between the different regions were further used to derive and obtain the unknown coefficients of the analytical model the present method was numerically validated by comparing the results for typical cases with the solutions of maccamy and fuchs 1954 wang and ren 1994 and chu et al 2014 the effects of the incident angle opening angle of the arc shaped wall spacing between the two walls and porosity parameters on hydrodynamic loads wave runups and wave elevations on the outer and inner walls were carried out to perform the parametric study the results are as follows 1 the dual arc wall exhibited a better protective performance than the single arc wall however the wave force on the dual arc wall exhibited high oscillating behaviour caused by resonance as the two walls were impermeable g 1 g 2 0 therefore the application of the dual arc walls with porous outer and impermeable inner walls g 1 1 g 2 0 can be a potential choice in practical engineering application 2 a relatively small porous outer arc shaped wall was theoretically proved to effectively reduce the wave load on the inner wall and protect it at a low cost 3 as k h increased the wavelength decreased oscillation frequency of the wave force on the outer and inner walls was more prominent and oscillation amplitude of the wave force on both the wall was reduced to protect the inner wall which can effectively reduce the wave load on the inner wall with low cost 4 for the concentric two system and the concentric structure with an outer arc shaped wall the amplitudes of the wave force wave runup and wave elevation on their internal structure are very close when the incident wave angle was small this implied that the latter structure could replace the former structure in certain regions the results of this study provide reference value for the design of coastal and marine structures besides when the dual arc wall was located in shallow water areas it was more suitable to use shallow water wave theory to investigate the diffraction problem owing to the shallow water effect thus further research on the shallow water wave diffraction by a dual arc structure will be the focus of further work credit authorship contribution statement zhenfeng zhai conceptualization validation
