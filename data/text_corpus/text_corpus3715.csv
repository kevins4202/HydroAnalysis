18575,microplastics mps are emerging pollutants that have been extensively detected in marine and terrestrial environments landfills are receptacles for cumulative loading of plastic waste derived from industry and households but data on mps occurrences in landfill systems are lacking in the current study the occurrence characteristics and distribution patterns of mps in landfills including leachate and refuse of the megacity shanghai were investigated in accordance with different landfill ages 3 20 years the results revealed that the average abundances of mps in leachate and refuse were 8 3 items l and 62 23 items g respectively the predominant shapes and polymer types of the detected mps were fibers and cellophane in leachate whereas they were fragments and polyethylene in refuse the patterns of abundance and size distribution of mps in refuse varied from different landfill age and different polymer mps exhibited various occurrence patterns with increasing landfill age further spectra analysis suggested the presence of oxidative degradation of polyethylene mps in the landfill process especially for the landfill time of more than 20 years so the fates of mps in landfills were determined by the increase consumptions of plastics products and the degradation process of mps in landfills this study firstly provided a systematic overview of mps pollution characteristics in landfill systems and the results will foster the understanding of mps fates over a long time scale in the environments graphical abstract image 1 keywords microplastics landfill systems pollution characteristics landfill age 1 introduction due to showing excellent stability and durability synthetic plastics have been used in a wide variety of products such as fabrics textiles packaging and compact discs which now are indispensable parts of our life during the last 60 years the global plastics production has increased by 200 times reaching 335 million tons in 2016 statista 2018 and meanwhile remarkable amounts of plastics have been introduced to the ecosystem despite the substantial studies on marine plastic pollution derraik 2002 eriksen et al 2014 microplastics mps synthetic polymers measuring less than 5 mm in diameter have recently attracted increasing attentions regarding their contamination and risk to anthropogenic environments andrady 2011 lei et al 2018 murphy et al 2016 primary mps are derived from a wide range of sources including synthetic fibers from clothing polymer manufacturing and processing industries and personal care products browne et al 2011 lechner and ramler 2015 while secondary mps originate from the breakdown of plastic debris song et al 2017 mps have the potential to adsorb persistent organic contaminants and heavy metals and then transport these contaminants or enrich them in biota thus imposing major impacts on human health and ecosystems bouwmeester et al 2015 increasing numbers of studies have identified the presence of mps in oceanic and estuarial habitats including seas yu et al 2016 lakes su et al 2016 rivers klein et al 2015 and sediments hu et al 2018 however data concerning mps in terrestrial ecosystems are still limited especially for the environmental matrices under the impacts of prolonged anthropogenic activities liu et al 2018 the amount of plastic waste has increased along with the continuously growing production and consumption of plastic materials and approximately 12 000 million tons of plastic waste will have been discarded by 2050 geyer et al 2017 due to the lack of systematic waste classification and relatively low degrees of waste recycling waste plastic products have become important contributors to municipal solid waste msw and the situation was more severe in developing countries landfills receive large amount of plastic wastes accounting for about 20 of msw wang et al 2015 zhou et al 2014 thus landfills are theoretically speculated to act as a major reservoir of mps including tiny plastic granules used in cosmetics and small plastic fragments derived from the breakdown of macroplastics these small particles or fibers can be spread from landfills to surrounding environments via an air borne pathway rillig 2012 and the potential risk would be increased in case of poor management in addition leachate from landfills contained abundant pollutants including heavy metals and organic contaminants sui et al 2017 so mps potentially carried by leachate may act as vectors of other contaminants and exacerbate the adverse effects on surrounding environments with leachate discharge given that studies seldom have sought to determine the presence of mps in landfills a holistic investigation of mps occurrence pollution characteristics and fates in landfill systems is of great essence landfilling is a long term process that occurs over decades and the system conditions undergo complex and dynamic fluctuations during the long operating time including changes in ph oxygen levels and temperature kjeldsen et al 2002 the varying habitats may affect the characteristics of contaminants such as heavy metals pharmaceuticals and personal care products as well as antibiotic resistance genes chai et al 2007 sui et al 2017 wu et al 2017 even though the occurrence of mps in different environments has been investigated the fates and dynamic variations of mps over long time scales such as several decades during the landfilling process are still unknown from the plastic debris contaminated environments researchers have isolated a novel bacterium being capable to assimilate plastic polymers yoshida et al 2016 landfill was a primary reservoir of plastic waste and the landfilling process generally involved in anaerobic circumstances which were considered to facilitate the breakdown of mps mahon et al 2017 therefore the determination of whether mps degradation occurs in the long term landfill process with dynamic conditions will be of great significance for mps pollution control given the facts that landfills were the primary reservoir of plastic waste and the possible occurrence of mps in landfills would pose potential risks to surrounding environment matrices the aims of this study were 1 to investigate the occurrence characteristics of mps in landfills including leachate and refuse and 2 to discern the fates of mps over different landfill ages and analyze the possible reasons this investigation detected the occurrence of mps in the massive landfill systems including the leachate and refuse of shanghai shanghai is a super megacity in china with approximately 25 5 million population well developed city economy integrity process for waste collection and transportation system and a long time more than 30 years of landfill treatment application in waste including plastic waste disposal the municipal waste delivering quantity in shanghai increases by 10 annually and plastic waste one of the primary constituents is increasingly accumulated in landfills herein the variations of mps abundance size morphology and polymer composition were characterized in association with considerable landfill age 20 years by analyzing the distribution patterns of mps with different sizes surface morphologies and polymer types this study is expected to provide the first systematic overview of the mps pollution in landfill system which will foster the understanding of mps fates in human impacted environmental matrices 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling leachate and refuse samples were obtained from the laogang landfill in shanghai china laogang landfill is located in the eastern area of shanghai and receives about 12 000 tons of municipal solid waste per day according to the operational age the laogang landfill is divided into several distinct zones young landfill with a landfill age of 3 years medium aged landfill of 10 years and old landfill of 20 years due to the high heterogeneity of refuse three sites were first determined in individual landfill zones and then three samples were further taken around each site the refuse samples were obtained from depths of 0 5 1 and 1 5 m respectively and then mixed to form one sample and sufficient mass of refuse 6 10 kg was taken for each sample and then homogenized after sampling the top of the sample bottles were first covered with aluminum foil before capping to avoid contamination from the plastic caps and then the samples were immediately stored in sealed boxes and transferred to the laboratory for the following analysis 2 2 extraction of mps from leachate and refuse the protocol for the extraction of mps from leachate samples followed the procedures of previous publication hu et al 2018 leachate samples of 3 l were initially filtered through a sieve pore size of 48 μm and the retentate was rinsed with distilled water and filtered onto nylon membrane filters millipore usa ny2004700 with 47 mm of diameter and 20 μm of pore size due to the high viscosity and high impurity contents of leachate the filters with pore size of 20 μm were appropriate and time efficient for sample handing and nylon membrane had the adequate strength to support pore size of 20 μm the obtained membrane with containers was digested with 20 ml of h2o2 30 v v for 72 h and the resulting digestion solution was filtered again through a 47 mm nylon filter which was then washed with distilled water three times and dried naturally in an evaporating dish for subsequent observation the procedure for mps extraction from refuse samples referred to previous studies with slight modification klein et al 2015 li et al 2018 the obtained refuse samples were dried at 65 c for 3 days after which 3 g of dry refuse was mixed with 1 2 g ml of saturated nacl solution and stirred for 15 min the mixture was then allowed to settle overnight and the supernatant was subsequently filtered in a vacuum filtration unit using a sieve with pore size of 48 μm for three times the extracts in sieve were digested with 30 h2o2 overnight the resultant mixture was poured into a conical flask with 300 ml of distilled water vacuum filtered through filters pore size of 20 μm and rinsed with distilled water for three times the final product samples were obtained after being dried in a desiccator for 3 days 2 3 mps characterization all suspected mps items were placed on cellulose nitrate grid membrane filters whatman wme 47 mm 0 45 μm and examined by the attenuated total reflection atr mode of micro fourier transform infrared spectroscopy μ ft ir bruker lumos the spectra were obtained as the average of 32 scans in the wavenumber range of 4000 600 cm 1 with resolution of 4 cm 1 all spectra were processed with omnic software and compared with a database from bruker to determine the polymer type qu et al 2018 the spectrum matches were more than 70 for most of the identified particles and the wavenumber regions of different polymer types were also used for identification tagg et al 2015 the effect of landfill process on mps surficial structure changes was monitored by determining carbonyl index which was defined as the peak areas of carbonyl moieties 1780 1600 cm 1 relative to the areas of reference peaks methylene moieties 1490 1420 cm 1 ter halle et al 2017 to assure the result reliability 5 particles were randomly subsampled from the mps collected from individual landfill and the average ftir absorbance value was obtained for calculating carbonyl index mps were observed by a carl zeiss discovery v8 stereomicroscope microimaging gmbh germany and images were obtained with an axiocam digital camera mps were categorized according to their morphological characteristics as fibers fibrous or straight plastic fragments small irregular pieces granules spherical and ovoid pieces rods long and cylindrical bar or films thin plane of flimsy plastic the size was determined by measuring the longest dimension with imagej 1 48 software and mps were allotted to the following size categorizes class a 0 5 mm class b 0 5 1 mm and class c 1 5 mm 2 4 quality assurance of mps extraction to verify the accuracy of mps extraction method recovery experiments with clean leachate and refuse samples were performed according to the literatures hu et al 2018 li et al 2018 clean leachate was obtained by filtering through a sieve with pore size of 48 μm and clean refuse sample was from the refuse after mps were extracted to simulate the mps portion polystyrene ps and polypropylene pp were added to the leachate and refuse and the sizes of selected mps were 300 and 850 μm prior to the experiments polymer mps were dyed with a blue marker and the subsequent method of extracting mps was as described above no mps was detected in the blank control and the average detection rates of leachate and refuse samples were 91 7 5 9 and 88 3 4 2 respectively then the comparison experiment was conducted to evaluate the sample handing performance of different filters the mps were extracted from leachate and refuse samples by nylon glass and cellulose membranes respectively and the detected mps abundances suggested different membranes would not significantly affect mps extraction one way anova p 0 05 data shown in table s1 so the nylon membrane treatment did not cause nylon fibers release these results confirmed the validity and accuracy of the mps extraction protocol adopted in the current study 2 5 data analysis statistical analyses were carried out using spss 22 0 software ibm corp usa the normality test was performed using shapiro wilk test and nonparametric testing method mann whitney u was adopted when the data sets did not fit the normal distribution if the data fitted normal distribution analysis of variance anova was performed to determine the differences in the quantities of mps among different samples at the 95 confidence level principal component analysis pca to provide the distribution patterns of mps in leachate and refuse was carried out in r v 3 3 2 all data are shown as mean standard deviation and p 0 05 was considered as statistically significant 3 results and discussion 3 1 abundance of mps in leachate and refuse mps were detected in all leachate and refuse samples as shown in fig 1 a the abundance of mps extracted from leachate ranged from 4 to 13 items l in the investigation of mps occurrence in surface water mps abundances were detected in the range of 0 5 22 items l hu et al 2018 which was in the same order of magnitude as observed in this study the average mps abundances in young and medium landfills were 8 and 10 items l respectively but fewer mps 4 items l were detected in leachate from old landfill p 0 05 in refuse samples the mps abundance was in the range of 20 91 items g which was one or two orders of magnitude higher than that reported in freshwater sediments coastal sediment and farmland soil reported by previous studies hu et al 2018 liu et al 2018 mohamed nor and obbard 2014 also the average abundance of mps detected in landfill refuse 62 23 items g was higher than in sewage sludge li et al 2018 given the current waste collection and treatment system landfills received vast majority household and industrial plastic products and thus became the primary reservoir of mps specifically the abundances of mps from young medium and old landfills were 83 10 68 6 and 36 14 items g respectively a significantly lower abundance in refuse from old landfill was observed compared to young and medium landfills p 0 05 which was in accord with the mps occurrence in leachate most mps were originated from the fragmentation of macroplastics so the plastic waste amount affected mps occurrence in previous publication plastic wastes were observed to account for 2 95 21 76 of solid wastes in landfills and the percentage of plastic waste in near term landfill was more than the long term landfill zhou et al 2014 therefore macroplastics were also the predominant pollutants in landfills which would determine the mps abundances over different landfill age 3 2 size and morphology of mps in leachate and refuse the size distributions of mps in leachate and refuse are shown in fig s1 the size of detected mps in leachate ranged from 0 07 to 3 67 mm and the average sizes were 0 89 0 85 and 0 77 mm for young medium and old landfills respectively no apparently significant difference in average mps size was observed as landfill age increased p 0 05 for refuse samples the measured sizes of mps were in the range of 0 23 4 97 mm and their average size of 1 03 mm was larger than leachate samples 0 83 mm it could be inferred that smaller particles were more readily to reach the leachate while larger mps would retain in refuse the average sizes of mps were 1 23 0 91 and 0 71 mm for refuse samples from young medium and old landfills respectively and the anova results suggested that the landfill age significantly affected mps size distribution in refuse p 0 01 for the further analysis of mps size characteristics with varied landfill age size fraction was conducted and mps were categorized into three classes class a 0 5 mm class b 0 5 1 mm and class c 1 5 mm the abundances of mps with various size classes were shown in fig 2 fewer small and intermediate sized particles class a and b were found in the leachate from old landfill compared to young and medium landfills and medium age leachate exhibited a greater abundance of large size mps class c for refuse samples the percent of mps 16 with size smaller than 0 5 mm was lower than the data in leachate 38 which was consistent with the results of average size a significantly lower abundance of mps at large and intermediate sizes was observed for older landfilling age p 0 05 in contrast an increasing pattern of mps in the small particle class a was observed with increasing landfill age overall the mps occurrences in refuse varied from landfill age and smaller size was observed in the old landfill generally mps occurred in diverse shapes such as granules fibers films rods and fragments in environmental samples vianello et al 2013 this study confirmed that mps retained in the leachate were mainly in the shape of fibers granules and fragments where the predominant fiber mps accounted for approximately 60 followed by granules and fragments with 24 62 and 15 38 respectively fig 3 fibers were also found to be the primary mps form in sludge and wastewater li et al 2018 murphy et al 2016 which generally originated from washing clothes and discharge of the fiber manufacturing industry compared to the mps in leachate more diverse mps shapes were found in refuse samples including fragments granules fibers films and rods and fragment mps dominated accounting for 59 82 across all refuse samples irregular fragments were also identified as one of the major mps morphologies in sediment samples vianello et al 2013 additionally film mps accounted for 7 86 in refuse to which household plastic packing might be the primary contributor stereomicrographs of randomly selected mps in leachate and refuse are shown in fig 4 the mps shown in fig 4a c are granules fibers and fragments detected in leachate and fig 4d f shows granule rod and film mps from refuse according to the stereomicrographs the mps were generally irregular in shape and hackly in structure thus the breakdown of plastic debris was the primary contributor to mps i e secondary mps furthermore the hackly surface of mps would benefit the enrichment of contaminants such as heavy metals and organic contaminants koelmans et al 2016 which could enhance the environmental risk of leachate discharged to the environment 3 3 polymer composition and variations of mps in leachate and refuse the polymer composition of mps was identified by μ ftir and the detected polymer types included cellophane polypropylene pp polyethylene pe ethylene propylene copolymer epm polyethylene terephthalate pet polyvinyl chloride pvc polyamide pa polystyrene ps and other polymers the ftir spectra of several selected mps are shown in fig 5 as well as the standard spectra of corresponding polymer the characteristic peaks used for the identification of mps polymers were annotated and the detailed information on characteristic peaks assignment was illustrated in table s2 in total more than 9 and 15 different polymer types were identified in leachate and refuse respectively and almost all common types of polymer including thermoplastics and thermosets were detected in landfill the primary mps polymers found in other environmental matrices such as farmland soil and sewage sludge were proved to exist in landfills liu et al 2018 mahon et al 2017 the results implied that most plastic waste was accumulated in landfills so landfills exhibited a wide range of plastic sources among the identified mps in leachate samples the dominant class of mps were detected as cellophane 45 12 followed by pe pp and ps which accounted for 9 76 8 54 and 8 54 respectively fig s2a su et al also found that the most common type of mps was cellophane in the sediments of taihu lake su et al 2016 cellophane a typical semi synthetic material is the most popular material for packaging a variety of food items battery and cigar and has been defined as mps in a report of unep and recent studies su et al 2016 unep 2016 yang et al 2015 for refuse samples the highest abundance in terms of mps number was represented by pe and pe polyether urethane peur ps epm and pp polymers constituted 60 of all mps identified in refuse fig s2b the observed pe mps reportedly originated from packaging container and personal care products such as body and facial scrubs fendall and sewell 2009 pe is the most commonly used plastic in the world accounting for 34 of the total plastics market geyer et al 2017 in addition pp ps pvc and pet are also the most widely used plastics in industrial activities and daily life and are therefore important contributors to mps in landfills apart from frequently identified polymers such as pe pp and ps found in rivers sediments and coastal water klein et al 2015 song et al 2018 copolymers were also detected in landfills epm a class of synthetic rubber produced by copolymerizing ethylene and propylene is used to produce products employed in automotive engines electrical wiring and construction epm was observed to account for 9 09 of the total mps in refuse but was detected at lower levels in rivers and oceanic environments hu et al 2018 tanaka and takada 2016 vianello et al 2013 ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer eva a copolymer of ethylene and vinyl acetate is widely used as thermoplastic and elastomeric materials in melt adhesives and coatings photovoltaic modules and agricultural films carraher 2013 czanderna and pern 1996 in the current study eva was detected with an abundances of 1 4 items g in refuse therefore the abundances and polymer composition directly reflected the consumption current situation of plastic products for the plastic waste in landfills was primarily derived from household and industrial sources the distributions of different polymer mps in leachate and refuse samples of varied landfill age were analyzed in this study as shown in fig 6 the cellophane mps were less abundant in leachate from old landfill compared to young and medium landfills regarding pp and pe and pet they were less abundant or not detectable in old landfill in refuse the abundances of main polymer types such as pe peur ps and pet were significantly affected by landfill age p 0 05 specifically the abundance of peur epm and pet in old landfill was lower than in young and medium landfills while the change trend of pe and ps first increased and then decreased with the increasing landfill age the size variations of different polymer mps were also investigated fig 7 depicts the size distribution of the primary polymer mps in leachate and refuse although the overall size distribution of mps in leachate was not affected by landfill age fig 7a cellophane mps with a large size class c 1 5 mm showed a decrease in their average size with increasing landfill age fig s3c in refuse samples the sizes of different polymer mps decreased significantly during the landfilling process specifically the sizes of peur pe and ps with class a in old landfill were significantly lower than medium landfill p 0 05 and the average size of cellophane with the range 1 5 mm class c decreased in the old landfill compared to young and medium landfills fig s4 3 4 mps occurrence patterns across different landfill age taking into account the characteristics of abundance size and polymer composition fig 8 a presents the pca results regarding the mps characteristic distributions among different samples to discern the role of plastic waste generation on mps occurrence pattern the abundances of mps were normalized by the amount of individual plastic waste and the pca results were shown in fig 8b the leachate samples from different landfill age were in clustered together while the refuse samples scattered into three groups as a function of landfill age this may imply that mps characteristics in leachate samples were markedly different from refuse and the mps occurrence patterns in refuse were strongly landfill age dependent however landfilling age posed more remarkable effects on mps occurrence in refuse than the ones in leachate in addition refuse from old landfill and leachate samples had similar mps characteristics based on the euclidean distance in pca plot it was clear that even plastic consumption might determine mps occurrence in landfills landfill age also shaped mps distribution patterns with considerations of other characteristics to a certain extent including size and polymer types the abundance size and polymer composition of mps detected in leachate and refuse showed different distribution patterns across landfill age mps were more abundant in young and medium landfills and the diversity of polymer types also decreased with an increased landfill age there were two possible reasons attributing to these results 1 increased amount of plastics production and usage and 2 possible fragmentation or degradation process of mps in landfill in the most recent decades the global plastics production has increased for 34 and more than 30 of the plastic wastes are disposed in landfills plastics europe 2018 interestingly dislike the pe and pp mps the abundances of peur in young landfill were far more than the one in medium landfill and it was even no detectable in old landfill this result might be attributed to the difference in application fields and lifetime of different plastic products peur achieved commercial success due to its good mechanical properties and fiber producing ability and the market size was projected to grow at 7 annually plastics insight 2016 compared to the widely applications of pe and pp since 1970s the high demand of peur drove the rapid market growth in recent decades especially in china furthermore peur were mostly applied in the fields of transportation building and construction and consumer institutional products which had longer lifetimes of 13 35 and 3 years compared to 0 5 years of packaging predominantly composed of pe pp and pet geyer et al 2017 therefore increased disposal of plastic wastes might be responsible for the elevated abundances of mps in near term landfills and the growing trend application areas and products lifetimes of plastics products determined the occurrence patterns of individual mps in landfills with varying landfill age on the other hand there was already substantial evidence of microbial breakdown of polymers by exoenzymes shah et al 2008 yoshida et al 2016 several bacterial strains isolated from the plastic contaminated sites were capable to degrade plastic polymers shah et al 2008 previous study confirmed that the decomposition of pe mps was accelerated by bacterial colonization isolated from landfills park and kim 2019 thus the possible degradation might also account for the variation of mps characteristics in the current study taking the most abundant pe mps for example the ftir spectra of pe mps samples over landfill age were shown in fig 9 compared to the virgin pe particles infrared spectroscopy analyses evidenced the formation of oxidized carbonyl groups 1780 1600 cm 1 of mps in landfills the evolution of carbonyl groups was one of the main indicators for monitoring the degree of degradation of a polymer it was observed that the landfill process increased carbonyl index of pe from 0 18 virgin pe to 1 30 pe mps from old landfill which suggested the oxidative degradation of pe mps in the landfill process especially for the landfill time of more than 20 years 4 conclusions the occurrences of mps in leachate and refuse were studied and the average abundances of mps in leachate and refuse were 8 3 items l and 62 23 items g respectively the results suggested that landfills were not only the primary disposal sites of plastic waste but also the important sources of mps the predominant shape and polymer type of the detected mps in leachate were fibers and cellophane respectively by contrast fragments and polyethylene became dominant with respective to the shape and polymer type of mps in refuse mps in leachate exhibited different characteristics compared to the ones in refuse and the characteristic patterns of mps in refuse varied from landfill age the occurrences of mps in landfills were primarily affected by the increased plastic waste amount lifetimes of plastic products and polymer degradation the spectra analysis indicated the oxidative degradation of pe mps in the landfills with the increased landfill age which would enhance the understanding of the fates of mps in landfill systems further studies should focus on the plastic biodegradation process and underlying mechanism such as the isolation of microorganisms capable of degrading polymer declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

and then mixed to form one sample and sufficient mass of refuse 6 10 kg was taken for each sample and then homogenized after sampling the top of the sample bottles were first covered with aluminum foil before capping to avoid contamination from the plastic caps and then the samples were immediately stored in sealed boxes and transferred to the laboratory for the following analysis 2 2 extraction of mps from leachate and refuse the protocol for the extraction of mps from leachate samples followed the procedures of previous publication hu et al 2018 leachate samples of 3 l were initially filtered through a sieve pore size of 48 μm and the retentate was rinsed with distilled water and filtered onto nylon membrane filters millipore usa ny2004700 with 47 mm of diameter and 20 μm of pore size due to the high viscosity and high impurity contents of leachate the filters with pore size of 20 μm were appropriate and time efficient for sample handing and nylon membrane had the adequate strength to support pore size of 20 μm the obtained membrane with containers was digested with 20 ml of h2o2 30 v v for 72 h and the resulting digestion solution was filtered again through a 47 mm nylon filter which was then washed with distilled water three times and dried naturally in an evaporating dish for subsequent observation the procedure for mps extraction from refuse samples referred to previous studies with slight modification klein et al 2015 li et al 2018 the obtained refuse samples were dried at 65 c for 3 days after which 3 g of dry refuse was mixed with 1 2 g ml of saturated nacl solution and stirred for 15 min the mixture was then allowed to settle overnight and the supernatant was subsequently filtered in a vacuum filtration unit using a sieve with pore size of 48 μm for three times the extracts in sieve were digested with 30 h2o2 overnight the resultant mixture was poured into a conical flask with 300 ml of distilled water vacuum filtered through filters pore size of 20 μm and rinsed with distilled water for three times the final product samples were obtained after being dried in a desiccator for 3 days 2 3 mps characterization all suspected mps items were placed on cellulose nitrate grid membrane filters whatman wme 47 mm 0 45 μm and examined by the attenuated total reflection atr mode of micro fourier transform infrared spectroscopy μ ft ir bruker lumos the spectra were obtained as the average of 32 scans in the wavenumber range of 4000 600 cm 1 with resolution of 4 cm 1 all spectra were processed with omnic software and compared with a database from bruker to determine the polymer type qu et al 2018 the spectrum matches were more than 70 for most of the identified particles and the wavenumber regions of different polymer types were also used for identification tagg et al 2015 the effect of landfill process on mps surficial structure changes was monitored by determining carbonyl index which was defined as the peak areas of carbonyl moieties 1780 1600 cm 1 relative to the areas of reference peaks methylene moieties 1490 1420 cm 1 ter halle et al 2017 to assure the result reliability 5 particles were randomly subsampled from the mps collected from individual landfill and the average ftir absorbance value was obtained for calculating carbonyl index mps were observed by a carl zeiss discovery v8 stereomicroscope microimaging gmbh germany and images were obtained with an axiocam digital camera mps were categorized according to their morphological characteristics as fibers fibrous or straight plastic fragments small irregular pieces granules spherical and ovoid pieces rods long and cylindrical bar or films thin plane of flimsy plastic the size was determined by measuring the longest dimension with imagej 1 48 software and mps were allotted to the following size categorizes class a 0 5 mm class b 0 5 1 mm and class c 1 5 mm 2 4 quality assurance of mps extraction to verify the accuracy of mps extraction method recovery experiments with clean leachate and refuse samples were performed according to the literatures hu et al 2018 li et al 2018 clean leachate was obtained by filtering through a sieve with pore size of 48 μm and clean refuse sample was from the refuse after mps were extracted to simulate the mps portion polystyrene ps and polypropylene pp were added to the leachate and refuse and the sizes of selected mps were 300 and 850 μm prior to the experiments polymer mps were dyed with a blue marker and the subsequent method of extracting mps was as described above no mps was detected in the blank control and the average detection rates of leachate and refuse samples were 91 7 5 9 and 88 3 4 2 respectively then the comparison experiment was conducted to evaluate the sample handing performance of different filters the mps were extracted from leachate and refuse samples by nylon glass and cellulose membranes respectively and the detected mps abundances suggested different membranes would not significantly affect mps extraction one way anova p 0 05 data shown in table s1 so the nylon membrane treatment did not cause nylon fibers release these results confirmed the validity and accuracy of the mps extraction protocol adopted in the current study 2 5 data analysis statistical analyses were carried out using spss 22 0 software ibm corp usa the normality test was performed using shapiro wilk test and nonparametric testing method mann whitney u was adopted when the data sets did not fit the normal distribution if the data fitted normal distribution analysis of variance anova was performed to determine the differences in the quantities of mps among different samples at the 95 confidence level principal component analysis pca to provide the distribution patterns of mps in leachate and refuse was carried out in r v 3 3 2 all data are shown as mean standard deviation and p 0 05 was considered as statistically significant 3 results and discussion 3 1 abundance of mps in leachate and refuse mps were detected in all leachate and refuse samples as shown in fig 1 a the abundance of mps extracted from leachate ranged from 4 to 13 items l in the investigation of mps occurrence in surface water mps abundances were detected in the range of 0 5 22 items l hu et al 2018 which was in the same order of magnitude as observed in this study the average mps abundances in young and medium landfills were 8 and 10 items l respectively but fewer mps 4 items l were detected in leachate from old landfill p 0 05 in refuse samples the mps abundance was in the range of 20 91 items g which was one or two orders of magnitude higher than that reported in freshwater sediments coastal sediment and farmland soil reported by previous studies hu et al 2018 liu et al 2018 mohamed nor and obbard 2014 also the average abundance of mps detected in landfill refuse 62 23 items g was higher than in sewage sludge li et al 2018 given the current waste collection and treatment system landfills received vast majority household and industrial plastic products and thus became the primary reservoir of mps specifically the abundances of mps from young medium and old landfills were 83 10 68 6 and 36 14 items g respectively a significantly lower abundance in refuse from old landfill was observed compared to young and medium landfills p 0 05 which was in accord with the mps occurrence in leachate most mps were originated from the fragmentation of macroplastics so the plastic waste amount affected mps occurrence in previous publication plastic wastes were observed to account for 2 95 21 76 of solid wastes in landfills and the percentage of plastic waste in near term landfill was more than the long term landfill zhou et al 2014 therefore macroplastics were also the predominant pollutants in landfills which would determine the mps abundances over different landfill age 3 2 size and morphology of mps in leachate and refuse the size distributions of mps in leachate and refuse are shown in fig s1 the size of detected mps in leachate ranged from 0 07 to 3 67 mm and the average sizes were 0 89 0 85 and 0 77 mm for young medium and old landfills respectively no apparently significant difference in average mps size was observed as landfill age increased p 0 05 for refuse samples the measured sizes of mps were in the range of 0 23 4 97 mm and their average size of 1 03 mm was larger than leachate samples 0 83 mm it could be inferred that smaller particles were more readily to reach the leachate while larger mps would retain in refuse the average sizes of mps were 1 23 0 91 and 0 71 mm for refuse samples from young medium and old landfills respectively and the anova results suggested that the landfill age significantly affected mps size distribution in refuse p 0 01 for the further analysis of mps size characteristics with varied landfill age size fraction was conducted and mps were categorized into three classes class a 0 5 mm class b 0 5 1 mm and class c 1 5 mm the abundances of mps with various size classes were shown in fig 2 fewer small and intermediate sized particles class a and b were found in the leachate from old landfill compared to young and medium landfills and medium age leachate exhibited a greater abundance of large size mps class c for refuse samples the percent of mps 16 with size smaller than 0 5 mm was lower than the data in leachate 38 which was consistent with the results of average size a significantly lower abundance of mps at large and intermediate sizes was observed for older landfilling age p 0 05 in contrast an increasing pattern of mps in the small particle class a was observed with increasing landfill age overall the mps occurrences in refuse varied from landfill age and smaller size was observed in the old landfill generally mps occurred in diverse shapes such as granules fibers films rods and fragments in environmental samples vianello et al 2013 this study confirmed that mps retained in the leachate were mainly in the shape of fibers granules and fragments where the predominant fiber mps accounted for approximately 60 followed by granules and fragments with 24 62 and 15 38 respectively fig 3 fibers were also found to be the primary mps form in sludge and wastewater li et al 2018 murphy et al 2016 which generally originated from washing clothes and discharge of the fiber manufacturing industry compared to the mps in leachate more diverse mps shapes were found in refuse samples including fragments granules fibers films and rods and fragment mps dominated accounting for 59 82 across all refuse samples irregular fragments were also identified as one of the major mps morphologies in sediment samples vianello et al 2013 additionally film mps accounted for 7 86 in refuse to which household plastic packing might be the primary contributor stereomicrographs of randomly selected mps in leachate and refuse are shown in fig 4 the mps shown in fig 4a c are granules fibers and fragments detected in leachate and fig 4d f shows granule rod and film mps from refuse according to the stereomicrographs the mps were generally irregular in shape and hackly in structure thus the breakdown of plastic debris was the primary contributor to mps i e secondary mps furthermore the hackly surface of mps would benefit the enrichment of contaminants such as heavy metals and organic contaminants koelmans et al 2016 which could enhance the environmental risk of leachate discharged to the environment 3 3 polymer composition and variations of mps in leachate and refuse the polymer composition of mps was identified by μ ftir and the detected polymer types included cellophane polypropylene pp polyethylene pe ethylene propylene copolymer epm polyethylene terephthalate pet polyvinyl chloride pvc polyamide pa polystyrene ps and other polymers the ftir spectra of several selected mps are shown in fig 5 as well as the standard spectra of corresponding polymer the characteristic peaks used for the identification of mps polymers were annotated and the detailed information on characteristic peaks assignment was illustrated in table s2 in total more than 9 and 15 different polymer types were identified in leachate and refuse respectively and almost all common types of polymer including thermoplastics and thermosets were detected in landfill the primary mps polymers found in other environmental matrices such as farmland soil and sewage sludge were proved to exist in landfills liu et al 2018 mahon et al 2017 the results implied that most plastic waste was accumulated in landfills so landfills exhibited a wide range of plastic sources among the identified mps in leachate samples the dominant class of mps were detected as cellophane 45 12 followed by pe pp and ps which accounted for 9 76 8 54 and 8 54 respectively fig s2a su et al also found that the most common type of mps was cellophane in the sediments of taihu lake su et al 2016 cellophane a typical semi synthetic material is the most popular material for packaging a variety of food items battery and cigar and has been defined as mps in a report of unep and recent studies su et al 2016 unep 2016 yang et al 2015 for refuse samples the highest abundance in terms of mps number was represented by pe and pe polyether urethane peur ps epm and pp polymers constituted 60 of all mps identified in refuse fig s2b the observed pe mps reportedly originated from packaging container and personal care products such as body and facial scrubs fendall and sewell 2009 pe is the most commonly used plastic in the world accounting for 34 of the total plastics market geyer et al 2017 in addition pp ps pvc and pet are also the most widely used plastics in industrial activities and daily life and are therefore important contributors to mps in landfills apart from frequently identified polymers such as pe pp and ps found in rivers sediments and coastal water klein et al 2015 song et al 2018 copolymers were also detected in landfills epm a class of synthetic rubber produced by copolymerizing ethylene and propylene is used to produce products employed in automotive engines electrical wiring and construction epm was observed to account for 9 09 of the total mps in refuse but was detected at lower levels in rivers and oceanic environments hu et al 2018 tanaka and takada 2016 vianello et al 2013 ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer eva a copolymer of ethylene and vinyl acetate is widely used as thermoplastic and elastomeric materials in melt adhesives and coatings photovoltaic modules and agricultural films carraher 2013 czanderna and pern 1996 in the current study eva was detected with an abundances of 1 4 items g in refuse therefore the abundances and polymer composition directly reflected the consumption current situation of plastic products for the plastic waste in landfills was primarily derived from household and industrial sources the distributions of different polymer mps in leachate and refuse samples of varied landfill age were analyzed in this study as shown in fig 6 the cellophane mps were less abundant in leachate from old landfill compared to young and medium landfills regarding pp and pe and pet they were less abundant or not detectable in old landfill in refuse the abundances of main polymer types such as pe peur ps and pet were significantly affected by landfill age p 0 05 specifically the abundance of peur epm and pet in old landfill was lower than in young and medium landfills while the change trend of pe and ps first increased and then decreased with the increasing landfill age the size variations of different polymer mps were also investigated fig 7 depicts the size distribution of the primary polymer mps in leachate and refuse although the overall size distribution of mps in leachate was not affected by landfill age fig 7a cellophane mps with a large size class c 1 5 mm showed a decrease in their average size with increasing landfill age fig s3c in refuse samples the sizes of different polymer mps decreased significantly during the landfilling process specifically the sizes of peur pe and ps with class a in old landfill were significantly lower than medium landfill p 0 05 and the average size of cellophane with the range 1 5 mm class c decreased in the old landfill compared to young and medium landfills fig s4 3 4 mps occurrence patterns across different landfill age taking into account the characteristics of abundance size and polymer composition fig 8 a presents the pca results regarding the mps characteristic distributions among different samples to discern the role of plastic waste generation on mps occurrence pattern the abundances of mps were normalized by the amount of individual plastic waste and the pca results were shown in fig 8b the leachate samples from different landfill age were in clustered together while the refuse samples scattered into three groups as a function of landfill age this may imply that mps characteristics in leachate samples were markedly different from refuse and the mps occurrence patterns in refuse were strongly landfill age dependent however landfilling age posed more remarkable effects on mps occurrence in refuse than the ones in leachate in addition refuse from old landfill and leachate samples had similar mps characteristics based on the euclidean distance in pca plot it was clear that even plastic consumption might determine mps occurrence in landfills landfill age also shaped mps distribution patterns with considerations of other characteristics to a certain extent including size and polymer types the abundance size and polymer composition of mps detected in leachate and refuse showed different distribution patterns across landfill age mps were more abundant in young and medium landfills and the diversity of polymer types also decreased with an increased landfill age there were two possible reasons attributing to these results 1 increased amount of plastics production and usage and 2 possible fragmentation or degradation process of mps in landfill in the most recent decades the global plastics production has increased for 34 and more than 30 of the plastic wastes are disposed in landfills plastics europe 2018 interestingly dislike the pe and pp mps the abundances of peur in young landfill were far more than the one in medium landfill and it was even no detectable in old landfill this result might be attributed to the difference in application fields and lifetime of different plastic products peur achieved commercial success due to its good mechanical properties and fiber producing ability and the market size was projected to grow at 7 annually plastics insight 2016 compared to the widely applications of pe and pp since 1970s the high demand of peur drove the rapid market growth in recent decades especially in china furthermore peur were mostly applied in the fields of transportation building and construction and consumer institutional products which had longer lifetimes of 13 35 and 3 years compared to 0 5 years of packaging predominantly composed of pe pp and pet geyer et al 2017 therefore increased disposal of plastic wastes might be responsible for the elevated abundances of mps in near term landfills and the growing trend application areas and products lifetimes of plastics products determined the occurrence patterns of individual mps in landfills with varying landfill age on the other hand there was already substantial evidence of microbial breakdown of polymers by exoenzymes shah et al 2008 yoshida et al 2016 several bacterial strains isolated from the plastic contaminated sites were capable to degrade plastic polymers shah et al 2008 previous study confirmed that the decomposition of pe mps was accelerated by bacterial colonization isolated from landfills park and kim 2019 thus the possible degradation might also account for the variation of mps characteristics in the current study taking the most abundant pe mps for example the ftir spectra of pe mps samples over landfill age were shown in fig 9 compared to the virgin pe particles infrared spectroscopy analyses evidenced the formation of oxidized carbonyl groups 1780 1600 cm 1 of mps in landfills the evolution of carbonyl groups was one of the main indicators for monitoring the degree of degradation of a polymer it was observed that the landfill process increased carbonyl index of pe from 0 18 virgin pe to 1 30 pe mps from old landfill which suggested the oxidative degradation of pe mps in the landfill process especially for the landfill time of more than 20 years 4 conclusions the occurrences of mps in leachate and refuse were studied and the average abundances of mps in leachate and refuse were 8 3 items l and 62 23 items g respectively the results suggested that landfills were not only the primary disposal sites of plastic waste but also the important sources of mps the predominant shape and polymer type of the detected mps in leachate were fibers and cellophane respectively by contrast fragments and polyethylene became dominant with respective to the shape and polymer type of mps in refuse mps in leachate exhibited different characteristics compared to the ones in refuse and the characteristic patterns of mps in refuse varied from landfill age the occurrences of mps in landfills were primarily affected by the increased plastic waste amount lifetimes of plastic products and polymer degradation the spectra analysis indicated the oxidative degradation of pe mps in the landfills with the increased landfill age which would enhance the understanding of the fates of mps in landfill systems further studies should focus on the plastic biodegradation process and underlying mechanism such as the isolation of microorganisms capable of degrading polymer declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

18576,organic matter om refers to the largest reactive reservoir of carbon based compounds on earth aside of its role as a source of carbon om is also actively involved in a wide range of ecological functions it also plays an important role in the solubility toxicity bioavailability mobility and distribution of pollutants therefore om is a key component in the local and global carbon cycle about 12 000 articles containing organic matter in the title were published during the past decade with a continuous increasing number each year isi web of science although this topic was widely explored and its interest has significantly increased some limitations remain these limitations can be technical e g pre treatment processes low resolution instrument data handling and can be related to the current approach in this review we first present the current strategies and tools to characterize the organic matter in the aquatic environment then we tackle several aspects of current characterization limitations finally we suggest new perspectives and priorities of research to improve the current limitations from our point of view simultaneous studies of particulate and dissolved om fractions should be prioritized and multi disciplinary approach creation of databases controlled experiments and collaborative works should be the next targets for future om research priorities graphical abstract image 1 keywords dissolved organic matter particulate organic matter carbon cycle carbon sources biogeochemistry 1 introduction organic matter om refers to the largest reactive reservoir of carbon based compounds on earth with a total amount of carbon of 3200 pg c through the 3 environments e g soils 1600 pg c sediments 1000 pg c and the ocean 685 pg c bianchi 2011 hedges 1992 om present in the environment is introduced either naturally or anthropogenically natural om is generated by the breakdown and degradation of organisms through various biological and physical natural processes involving hydrosphere biosphere and geosphere sillanpää 2014 anthropogenic om on the other hand is introduced in the environment through human activities and by products e g sewage guo et al 2010 and litter and through degradation of microplastics romera castillo et al 2018 aside of its role as a source of carbon om is also actively involved in a wide range of ecological functions being a source of energy for microbes in soil and aquatic food web and a byproduct of biological metabolism jiao et al 2010 thurman 1985 it also plays important roles in the solubility toxicity bioavailability mobility and the distribution of pollutants via binding with heavy metals and or persistent organic pollutants pops deb and shukla 2011 farrington and takada 2014 hedges 2002 romera castillo et al 2018 therefore om is a key component in local and global carbon cycle and small changes in its size proportion and dynamics can potentially impact a large number of biogeochemical processes and or systems such as carbon storage co2 release and coupling of terrestrial and marine systems cole et al 2007 tranvik et al 2009 with several consequences on climate aquatic life and global habitability folger 2008 lal et al 2008 lehmann and kleber 2015 schuur et al 2015 york 2018 in this sense the understanding of the carbon cycle from local to global scale is currently one of the major conundrums in the fields of environmental sciences and biogeochemistry in aquatic environments om is defined as a heterogeneous mixture of particles and molecules having variable physical e g size and porosity and chemical e g functional group content and solubility properties baldock et al 2004 it is operationally divided into 2 fractions based on filter pore size dissolved organic matter dom 0 2 0 45 0 7 μm and particulate organic matter pom 0 2 0 45 0 7 μm exchanges between both forms are easy and regulated by mechanisms such as adsorption desorption aggregation dissolution dissolution precipitation etc and can be mediated by photochemical processes and biological activity he et al 2016a 2016b perdue and ritchie 2003 zimmermann timm 2002 moreover the amounts and the characteristics of the om are greatly influenced by biogeochemical processes such as photochemical and biological degradation understanding the om dynamics in aquatic environments and its role in local and global carbon cycles implies a study at various structural level and from diverse perspectives summons 1993 a wide range of techniques are used to characterize the om based on bulk chemical properties with general parameters e g measurement of dissolved and particulate organic carbon concentration doc and poc to deep insights into the molecular setup of dom via advanced tools e g the characterization via fourier transform ion cyclotron mass spectrometry dittmar and stubbins 2014 the om can be studied by using two different approaches source tracking which gives information on sources and molecular characterization which gives detailed structural information e g class compounds functional groups and elemental formula within the first approach we can find techniques such as stable isotopes ratios lambert et al 2011 biomarkers derrien et al 2017c compound specific isotopes analysis schmidt et al 2004 and spectroscopic characterization by measuring uv absorption helms et al 2008 and fluorescence coble 1996 murphy et al 2014a 2013 stedmon et al 2003 within the molecular characterization techniques we can find size exclusion chromatography coupled with organic and or nitrogen organic detector s huber et al 2011 pyrolysis gas chromatography mass spectrometry jeanneau et al 2015 homo and hetero correlated multidimensional nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy hertkorn et al 2013 and fourier transform ion cyclotron mass spectrometry sleighter and hatcher 2007 despite numerous studies in the last decades the om dynamics in aquatic environments and the dom pom interactions as well as at a bigger scale its role in local and global carbon cycles are still poorly understood various reasons can be found to justify this gap in understanding knowledge one of these is related to inherent problems affecting the analysis due to the nature of the sample low concentration salt occurrence heterogeneity complexity sensitivity to physical and chemical properties and or to the limitations of the techniques price accessibility sample preparation sensitivity fraction targeted etc another critical point is that dom and pom fractions are mostly investigated separately and only a few studies consider both dhillon and inamdar 2013 he et al 2016c lambert et al 2017 osburn et al 2015 2012 roebuck jr et al 2018 thibault et al 2019 lastly it can also be explained by the difficulties in linking the results of the om characterization to the mechanisms and dynamics of the om more effort should be made to improve the current strategy for the characterization of the om and its dynamics in this framework the aims of this paper were 1 to present the current strategies and briefly summarize the tools used to characterize the om in aquatic environment i e source tracking and molecular characterization techniques 2 to raise the current issues limiting our ability to clearly understand the dynamics of the om at local and global scales and 3 to suggest new perspectives and priorities of research to improve the current limitations 2 dom and pom in the aquatic environment organic matter comprises a large number of molecules belonging to many classes of compounds e g polysaccharides amino acids humic substances lignin cellulose peptidoglycan protein saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbons tannins aromatic compounds and with different polarity hydrophobic transphilic and hydrophilic antony et al 2017 hawkes et al 2018 kellerman et al 2015 leenheer and croué 2003 sandron et al 2015 volkman and tanoue 2002 it represents a complex mixture which also varies widely according to the environment the geography the time and the depth in the water column mccallister et al 2018 mopper et al 2007 although the organic matter is commonly divided into the dissolved dom and particulate pom size fractions there is a size continuum where the colloidal forms marine gels are the link between the two pools orellana and leck 2015 these colloidal forms can aggregate and disassemble shifting between the dissolved and particulate form the size of the molecules is also one of the factors that determine the reactivity and turn over time of om in the natural environment e g it affects bacterial uptake amon and benner 1996 the complexity of om and of the processes affecting it results in a large variability in its reactivity a reactivity continuum model was proposed by boudreau and ruddick 1991 and it is still used to have the most realistic description of om decomposition in different environments aumont et al 2017 garcia et al 2018 manzoni et al 2012 mostovaya et al 2017 sources of om are multiple and diverse which greatly increases its complexity these sources are usually classified as allochthonous or autochthonous the natural allochthonous sources coming from outside the aquatic environment include materials from land e g vascular plants leaves root exudates and soils as well as from the atmosphere e g dust storms and from hydrocarbon seeps at the seafloor apart from that anthropogenic activities play important role as allochthonous om sources with input from e g organic fertilizers effluents from wastewater treatment facilities treated ad or untreated sewage industrial wastewaters black carbon from fires and fossil fuel oil spills and ultimately leached from plastic carstea et al 2016 d sa et al 2016 derrien et al 2015 jaffe et al 2013 romera castillo et al 2018 autochthonous om produced within water bodies derives from aquatic biota e g algae bacteria plankton macrophytes and nekton and is produced by both autotrophic romera castillo et al 2010 thornton 2014 and heterotrophic organisms at all trophic level derrien et al 2018a steinberg et al 2004 tulonen 2004 as well as by viruses through viral lysis at the same time both dom and pom can be removed and or transformed and can play an important role on the overall biogeochemical cycles and microbial loop within the aquatic environment asmala et al 2018 ávila et al 2019 they can be removed by aquatic organisms and used for biomass synthesis or for respiration the latter producing co2 as om is subject to photochemical processes that can affect dom and pom properties it acts as an important photosensitizer mediating the production of carbon dioxide co2 carbon monoxide co and other dangerous reactive oxygen species causing oxidative stress to living organisms at the same time that it can also degrade toxic compounds preventing exposure to the biota vione et al 2014 these processes affecting both fractions are variable in time and space and often controlled by environmental parameters e g temperature ph salinity increasing their variability moreover exchanges mechanisms between the two pools from doc to poc and vice versa are highly important and need to be considered fig 1 summarizes the main processes affecting dom and pom described in this paragraph

stable isotope ratios carbon has two stable naturally occurring isotopes 12c 98 89 and13c 1 11 physical chemical or biological processes in natural environments can lead to changes in the isotopic composition due to a difference in atomic mass between 12c and 13c for instance according to the types of plants e g c3 c4 or crassulacean acid metabolism cam and or their specific photosynthetic paths the isotopic ratios may subject to change c3 plants present values of carbon isotopic composition δ13c ratio of stable isotopes 13c 12c reported in parts per thousand per mil measured via an elemental analyzer coupled with an isotope ratio mass spectrometer ea irms between 33 to 24 while the values range from 16 to 10 for c4 and between 20 and 10 for cam stable carbon isotope ratios are widely used and considered as one of the most effective ways to track both the sources e g allochthonous versus autochthonous and the transformation processes of om in the environment amiotte suchet et al 2007 benner et al 1997 lambert et al 2011 meyers 1994 toming et al 2013 previously most of the studies were focused on δ13c analysis nowadays this is often combined with the analysis of stable nitrogen isotope ratios δ15n to prevent some existing overlaps with the single use of the δ13c tracer barros et al 2010 berto et al 2013 cloern et al 2002 derrien et al 2018a gao et al 2012 ogrinc et al 2005 in addition to these measurements isotopic mixing models based on isotopic mass balance equation phillips et al 2005 phillips and gregg 2003 can be used to estimate the contributions of om sources in multi source watershed context or during storm events derrien et al 2018a yang et al 2015 yu et al 2019 3 2 biomarkers molecular biomarkers e g targeted organic compound analyzed by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry gc ms provide a powerful tool to identify the origins of om and the associated biogeochemical processes and thus to reconstruct environmental changes in the environment to date lignin phenol i e lignin plant pigments i e chlorophylls and carotenoids carbohydrates proteins and lipids have been most widely used as biomarkers to identify om sources bianchi et al 1995 bianchi and canuel 2011 hedges 1992 meyers and ishiwatari 1993 saiz jimenez and de leeuw 1986 among those lipids have the highest potential as molecular markers for marine berge and

sources e g allochthonous autochthonous sources and anthropogenic inputs derrien et al 2015 zimmerman and canuel 2001 due to the characteristics of ubiquity diagenetic and chemical stability and their extreme structural diversity the accuracy if the assignment of the om sources via this approach is helped by the use of compounds ratio and the application of multivariate statistical tools derrien et al 2017c have recently presented a detailed review of the lipid biomarkers and their use 3 3 compound specific isotope analysis csia csia refers to the measurement of the isotopic signatures typically

al 2004 csia was first applied to the δ 13c analysis of hydrocarbons in crude oils and refined products to reduce the variability of source pools and identify the sources of individual compounds or groups of compounds in complex mixtures bianchi and canuel 2011 hayes et al 1990 simoneit 1997 then it has subsequently been extended to other biogenic elements e g nitrogen and hydrogen batista et al 2014 chikaraishi and naraoka 2003 lichtfouse 2000 and a variety of biochemicals amino acids carbohydrates lipids and lignin phenols alewell et al 2016 pearson et al 2001 and organic contaminants e g polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pah polychlorinated biphenyls pcb benzene toluene ethylbenzene btex etc elsner and imfeld 2016 schmidt et al 2004 the power of this technique lies in the differential fractionation of individual compounds especially when it is used in combination with already known chemical biomarker to identify the origin of the organic matter in all environments amelung et al 2008 bendle et al 2007 cooper et al 2015 tolosa et al 2013 3 4 optical properties the absorbance and fluorescence properties of dom have been defined as optical markers comparable to traditional biomarkers stedmon and nelson 2015 uv visible absorption and fluorescence have been widely used to characterize the colored and fluorescent sub fractions of dom cdom and fdom respectively coble 2007 helms et al 2008 wünsch et al 2017 the cdom component absorbs light mainly in the ultraviolet uv and blue regions of the electromagnetic spectrum bricaud et al 1981 the absorption coefficients at selected wavelengths aλ are used for different purposes the most common is the a254 which is calculated to estimate cdom content del vecchio and blough 2004 weishaar et al 2003 the a350 and a440 are used due to their strong correlation with lignin spencer et al 2009b stedmon et al 2011a and application to ocean color remote sensing siegel et al 2005 respectively a series of indices have been also widely applied using absorption coefficients to gain information on the average molecular weight the ratio between a250 and a365 e2 e3 peuravuori and pihlaja 1997 the spectral slope ratio sr helms et al 2008 and the aromaticity of the molecules specific ultraviolet absorption at 254 nm suva254 weishaar et al 2003 and on the tracking of terrestrial compounds spectral slope between 275 and 295 nm s275 295 fichot and benner 2012 the fdom is the fraction of cdom which can emit fluorescence after absorbing uv visible light the spectral characteristics of fdom can be investigated by using excitation emission wavelength pairs e g in situ probes single emission spectra synchronous spectra and three dimensional excitation emission matrices eems moreover the combination eems with parallel factor analysis parafac fig 2 allows to distinguish between different groups of fluorophores components such as humic like re elaborated humic like also called microbial or marine humic like and protein like fellman et al 2010 ishii and boyer 2012 murphy et al 2014a stedmon and bro 2008 a set of indices have been also developed by using the ratio of the fluorescence intensity at specific wavelengths or wavelength ranges mainly to distinguish between autochthonous and allochthonous dom sources and to assess the degree of humification of dom gabor et al 2014 huguet et al 2009 mcknight et al 2001 zsolnay et al 1999 both fluorescence component distribution and optical indices have successfully been applied to investigate the chemical composition identify the sources of dom and track the involved biogeochemical processes in many aquatic environments such as wastewaters rivers groundwaters lakes seas and oceans fichot et al 2013 gonçalves araujo et al 2016 2015 inamdar et al 2011 jaffé et al 2014 lambert et al 2016 retelletti brogi et al 2019 2018 stedmon et al 2011b yamashita et al 2013 yang et al 2014 due to their low cost rapidity and sensitivity the very limited sample pre treatment required and thanks to the development of user friendly tools to treat the data murphy et al 2013 these techniques are now considered as a popular powerful and standard tool for dom characterization their wide application on an exponentially increasing number of studies allowed for gaining information on om composition and its related environmental processes on a global scale which would take much longer time and effort if done with more complex and time consuming techniques 4 structural characterization 4 1 size exclusion chromatography techniques the liquid chromatography coupled to organic carbon and nitrogen detectors lc ocd ond is basically a size exclusion chromatography coupled to 2 online detectors ocd and ond huber et al 2011 this method uses a purified mobile phase a phosphate buffer and a chromatographic column a weak cation exchange column on polymethacrylate basis able to separate the om according to the molecular weight huber et al 2011 nowadays it is recognized to be an attractive technique providing for direct qualitative and quantitative information on the om molecular weight fractionation and doc and don concentrations allpike et al 2007 her et al 2003 2002 huber et al 2011 retelletti brogi et al 2018 so et al 2017 yan et al 2012 five defined size fractions can be identified and quantified including biopolymers bp 10 kda humic substances hs approximately 1 kda building blocks bb 300 500 da low molecular weight acid and neutrals lmw a n 350 da huber et al 2011 maqbool et al 2017 nowadays this technique is mainly applied to track the natural organic matter in drinking water and or to study membrane fouling issues baghoth et al 2011 kennedy et al 2005 rosenberger et al 2006 zheng et al 2014 it is also becoming a preferred choice to characterize organic matter from natural environments dittmar and kattner 2003 hutchins et al 2017 penru et al 2013 retelletti brogi et al 2018 villacorte et al 2015 as the molecular weight of the organic matter strongly affects reactivity in the natural ecosystems yan et al 2012 it has also been suggested that since it detects the a254 coupled with the different size fractions it can give a hint on the chemical composition of cdom stedmon and nelson 2015 one advantage of this method is that the samples do not need any pre treatment and its strength is enhanced when coupled with other techniques e g optical properties baghoth et al 2008 penru et al 2013 allowing to investigate the properties of the specific size fractions 4 2 pyrolysis gas chromatography mass spectrometry py gc ms py gc ms is a method of chemical analysis in which natural and synthetic biopolymers present in the sample are heated to decomposition to produce sub units i e low molecular weight molecules that are then separated by gas chromatography and detected using mass spectrometry leenheer and croué 2003 matilainen et al 2011 this technique is not the most used for the characterization of the molecular composition of the om however it represents an interesting option for obtaining detailed structural information on the components of natural organic matter as well as on humic substances for both dom and pom and also to assess the preservation diagenesis and provenance of sediment organic matter carr et al 2010 derenne and nguyen 2014 greenwood et al 2012 iwai et al 2013 lately jeanneau et al 2018 demonstrated the suitability of this molecular analysis to apportion the sources of pom in river 4 3 fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir ftir is probably one of the most commonly used spectroscopic tool after fluorescence spectroscopy for the analysis of either liquid or solid natural om nom samples artz et al 2008 derenne and nguyen 2014 dick et al 2003 giovanela et al 2004 haberhauer et al 2000 parolo et al 2017 tremblay et al 2011 this spectroscopy exploits the fact that molecules absorb frequencies that are characteristics of their structure e g vibrational characteristics of their chemical bonds the resulting absorption is a unique fingerprint of compounds allowing the identification of functional groups matilainen et al 2011 transmission spectroscopy through a sample kbr pellet is the oldest and most commonly used method in nom studies alternatively reflectance spectroscopy as attenuated total reflectance atr and diffuse reflectance infrared fourier transform drift have been preferentially used as it represents a more robust reliable and non destructive technique and generates higher reproducibility than the former one simonescu 2012 although this technique presents the advantage of being applicable to both dom and pom fractions nowadays it is rarely used by itself and preferentially combined to other techniques e g nmr fluorescence to endorse the interpretation of the results related to changes during biochemical mechanisms and or to control the quality and efficiency of the water remediation processes maqbool et al 2017 rodríguez et al 2016 4 4 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy nmr nmr has been extensively used for decades to characterize the structure of the molecules in om as it provides a detailed picture of its molecular architecture barron and wilson 1981 hertkorn et al 2016 2013 kögel knabner 1997 konstantinov et al 2013 matilainen et al 2011 wong et al 2002 zhong et al 2011 briefly nmr is a physical phenomenon in which nuclei in a magnetic field absorb and re emit electromagnetic radiation it can be a very selective technique distinguishing among many atoms within a molecule or collection of molecules of the same type but which differ only in terms of their local chemical environment nmr can be done on both solid and liquid phase samples matilainen et al 2011 mopper et al 2007 and commonly performs for the nuclei of atoms 1h 13c and 15n minor et al 2014 traditionally 1 dimensional 1d nmr was used to characterize the om however over the past decade nmr has been used in two 2d or multidimensional configuration as they represent a more appropriate technique to characterize complex organic compounds hertkorn et al 2013 kaiser et al 2003 zhong et al 2011 detailed information on the use of nmr to characterize om can be found in mopper et al 2007 and matilainen et al 2011 4 5 high resolution fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms ft icr ms has emerged as a reliable tool for the in depth molecular characterization of complex mixtures as dom over the last decade ft icr ms had the prevailing position for the chemical characterization of dom at the molecular level and for all the environments including lakes seas oceans estuary wetlands soils rivers and even ice cores bae et al 2011 chen et al 2011 derrien et al 2017a 2017b gonsior et al 2013 kujawinski et al 2002 li et al 2019 lu et al 2016 mopper et al 2007 retelletti brogi et al 2018 sleighter and hatcher 2008 coupled with electrospray ionization esi this technique provides the necessary resolution to determine with high accuracy hundreds to several thousand ions with an m z range typically from 200 to 1000 da furthermore due to the high mass resolution and accuracy less than 0 5 ppm the elemental formulas are assigned with a high level of confidence repeta 2015 stubbins and dittmar 2014 as esi ft icr ms analysis generates a large amount of data the empirical formula data are commonly categorized in 6 8 main class of compounds e g lipids proteins carbohydrates unsaturated hydrocarbons lignins and or carboxyl rich alicyclic molecules cram tannins and condensed aromatic compounds according to their h c and o c ratios e g van krevelen diagram some indices related to the degree of unsaturation dbe double bond equivalent index and or the aromaticity of the formulae ai or aimod modified aromaticity index have been also developed hockaday et al 2009 hodgkins et al 2016 ohno et al 2010 comparison of samples at this molecular specificity scale allowed for the identification of specific classes of compounds according their sources or ways of production koch et al 2005 koch and dittmar 2006 and also more recently to highlight the extreme isomeric complexity in the dom across aquatic environments hawkes et al 2018 nowadays this technique is likely considered as the most powerful tool that can be used to characterize the structures and the molecular properties of the dom 5 limitations of the actual methods and approaches a large fraction of uncertainty on om composition is related to inherent problems affecting its analysis such as i low concentration e g seawater 0 4 1 mg l 1 in water with a much higher amount of inorganic compounds that can negatively affect chemical analysis or the low abundance of some compounds minor et al 2014 stubbins and dittmar 2014 ii extreme diversity and heterogeneity of compounds of their chemical properties and of their molecular weights which complicates isolation and analysis approaches hertkorn et al 2008 sandron et al 2015 and iii the difficulty in extracting unbiased material during isolation or concentration processes matilainen et al 2011 mopper et al 2007 although notable advances have been done in this last decade to improve the sample pre treatment instrument resolution and analytical capabilities of the equipment mccallister et al 2018 most of the highly sensitive techniques still present some inconveniences technical issues and prohibitive cost in addition to the difficulties related to data handling compared to the elemental techniques for instance the analysis of the stable isotope ratios does not require much pre treatment but it will give only one value which relates to the source of the organic matter while the more advanced techniques such as ft icr ms analysis will provide thousands of formulas often not allowing for a full understanding or interpretation of the data besides these issues related to the nature of the samples it is very important to raise the question related to the representativeness of the studied fraction and or sub fractions over the past decades tremendous efforts have been made to quantify analyze and characterize the om but we are still facing these issues bulk pom dom fdom or even cdom are different om fractions which can be studied with the techniques previously introduced cdom and fdom are widely investigated since their analyses are cost effective relatively quick and non destructive however this optical approach is limited to colored and fluorescent om what percentage of bulk om or even of the dom does that represent for example recently hawkes et al 2019 analyzed online the size distribution with hpsec uvdad high pressure size exclusion chromatography coupled with uv vis diode array detector and the molecular mass via esi ms of different dom samples they observed a clear discrepancy between the two methods and showed that an important pool of organic matter having a strong uv absorbance showed no esi ms signal these results demonstrate that there is a substantial distinction in dom samples between what is optically active and what is efficiently ionized by esi hence is targeting only a specific sub fraction suitable to understand mechanisms at a larger scale then most of the om studies were focused on dom or pom fractions separately this approach is questionable is it the most insightful approach to understand the dynamics of the om in the aquatic environment the interactions between both fractions happen continuously and sometimes very fast they also change in time due to the biotic and abiotic factors it is a dynamic system therefore focusing studies on only one om fraction has several limits thus simultaneous studies should be prioritized of course studies integrating simultaneous dom and pom characterization would induce other issues as shown in fig 3 most of the techniques of om characterization cannot be directly applied to both fractions techniques such as isotopes biomarkers or py gc ms can be applied on dom fractions after a process of freeze drying plus desalination in the case of salted water these pre processes require a large amount of sample 1 l or more according to the concentration and may cause om modification repeta 2015 there are also some techniques i e fluorescence which can be performed on pom after extracting the dom from it i e water or solvent extraction assuming it is representative of the whole pom fraction however the representativeness of this extract was never explored or tested indeed this limitation cannot be neglected especially when recent studies highlight the potential failure of representativeness of these extracts derrien et al 2018a yu et al 2019 these observations finally lead to an ultimate question how can we link all the various and diversified collected data to the basic understanding of om dynamics in the aquatic environment om is studied at various structural level and from diverse perspectives fig 4 elemental analysis as doc or poc concentrations or stable isotope help estimate the flux of carbon or identify the sources of the organic matter one can thus understand mechanisms of transport by contrast a molecular approach will give information on the state of the material maturity lability aromaticity freshness etc diagenetic effects or geological changes summons 1993 it is clear that a complementary approach is necessary but linking all the information together is probably the biggest challenge we have to solve in order to achieve a full understanding of the aquatic organic matter dynamics and at a larger scale the carbon cycle so far few recent studies have attempted to combine source tracking methods and molecular characterization techniques with a preference for fluorescence and ft icr ms stubbins et al 2014 wagner et al 2015 wünsch et al 2018a although the work of wagner et al 2015 has given a good correlation between the results of both techniques the question of the representativeness of the fluorescence fraction is still pending newly thibault et al 2019 published a multi compartment e g dom pom and bulk fractions study in which they applied complementary analytical approaches including bulk elemental and isotopic composition and structural solid state 13c nmr analyses this strategy allowed them to irrefutably demonstrate each om pool has its own properties and dynamics challenges are still up but similar approaches need to be preferentially applied for the better understanding 6 future directions and new perspectives after describing the inherent issues related to the techniques applied for characterization of the aquatic om and or its nature in this last paragraph we attempt to suggest some approaches that would be worthwhile to explore more in the future 6 1 standardization and databases some of the previously mentioned analytical techniques require the choice of different instrumental settings and samples preparation however these different choices may sometimes affect the final measurement of the samples making difficult a comparison of the results between different studies two symbolic examples are the processing and data treatment of the fluorescence eems and the ft icr ms coupled with esi the results of fluorescence measurements depend on several factors such as instrumental settings slits scan speed internal instrument biases and phenomena like inner filter effect exceeding a certain concentration will result in a decrease of the fluorescence signal and the modification of the emission spectrum these factors can be controlled and normalized to be comparable between different studies during post measurements data treatment however some of these data treatments vary according to different studies for example some authors correct the inner filter effect during data treatment whereas others dilute the samples according to the absorbance at 254 nm a254 but there is no agreement on the limit of the a254 value for the dilution hur et al 2008 miller et al 2010 ohno 2002 moreover some authors present the data in raman units ru whereas others use quinine sulfate units qsu the latter is however doubtful because different studies report different methods or do not give details on the qsu conversion ferretto et al 2017 lønborg et al 2010 romera castillo et al 2014 yamashita et al 2010 yao et al 2011 the first step for ft icr ms is solid phase extraction spe and according to the method used the extraction efficiency can vary lv et al 2016 repeta 2015 stücheli et al 2018 wünsch et al 2018b dittmar et al 2008 summarized the different methods used to extract dom for ft icr ms analysis highlighting the different retention properties of the most commonly used sorbents then ft icr ms is mostly used with electrospray ionization esi including both negative and positive modes the results of positive and negative esi can overlap but differences are still present repeta 2015 for example hertkorn et al 2013 compared both modes of esi for ft icr ms analysis on ocean dom samples from the surface to deep depths the results showed a preferential detection of carbon rich 62 and oxygen depleted 26 ions in positive mode compared to the negative mode 50 and 36 42 respectively in the assigned molecular formulas they generally observed a larger number of assigned molecular compositions in positive mode than in negative mode on the other hand negative mode esi seems to be more sensitive towards acidic functional groups solihat et al 2019 higher discrepancies are inevitably observed with different ionization sources such as atmospheric pressure ionization appi or atmospheric pressure chemical ionization apci due to their inherent selectivity for specific types of molecules hertkorn et al 2008 solihat et al 2019 hence the selectivity and the matrix sensitivity of the ionization sources represent an issue which needs to be considered and refined with a standardization of the method derrien et al 2018b mopper et al 2007 these examples highlight the need for a standardization of sample preparation analytical methods and data treatment standardized data processing tools are already available for fluorescence eems treatment and were improved during the last few years the newest dreem tool developed by murphy et al 2014a allows for the correction of eems by doing blank subtraction raman or quinine sulfate normalization instrumental bias correction and inner filter correction producing comparable data from different instruments and instrumental settings murphy et al 2010 similarly a standardized method to prepare and measure the samples and or treat the data after measurements should be prepared for all the techniques that might have these issues in order to improve the quality of the data and the comparison of different studies on top of that the creation of online databases of published data would allow for a big step forward to improve data comparison and interpretation for instance a database of published fluorescence components obtained by coupling eems with parallel factor analysis has been created murphy et al 2014b and allows calculating the percentage of similarities between the published spectra more recently leefmann et al 2019 developed a new browser based software tool for processing high resolution mass spectrometry data with the option to export the final data report and to compare with previous datasets these kinds of databases similarly to libraries used in chromatography and mass spectra analyses would help a faster interpretation of the results if previously reported and increase the coherence between different studies with similar results the standardization of the methods and creation of databases will benefit especially those techniques such as ft icr ms that produce big datasets that are currently only partially exploited 6 2 laboratory experiment in controlled conditions as previously highlighted the factors regulating dom and pom in the aquatic environment are several and variable in time and space the analysis of samples from natural environments provides a snapshot of the om in a specific place either at a small or large scale at a specific time however according to the parameters chosen it is not always possible to identify the processes that lead to the observed dynamics characteristics and extending these observations to a larger spatial and or temporal scale is challenging setting up a laboratory experiment can help in identifying the effects that certain factors have on om dynamics properties experiments carried out under controlled conditions can be split into two categories according to the main purpose 1 to study a single factor by isolating its effects and 2 to study the combined effect of multiple factors many experiments studying the effect of a single factor have already been carried out for dom for instance incubation experiments to study microbial degradation of om have been carried out by removing the effect of autotrophic activity by filtration and dark incubation and grazers by filtration asmala et al 2014 logue et al 2016 raymond and bauer 2000 retelletti brogi et al 2015 photodegradation experiments to study the effect of uv radiation were carried out by removing the microbial communities by poisoning porcal et al 2004 spencer et al 2009a a step forward would be at this point to put more efforts in planning experiments that consider the concurrent effect of more factors some good examples can be already found whitehead et al 2000 set up a mesocosm experiment in 1500 l volume tanks and studied the combined effect of phytoplankton biological activity irradiation and water mixing on dom properties more recently osterholz et al 2015 carried out an experiment in 10 l volume bottles to study the microbial production of refractory dom for this purpose the authors took account of phytoplankton abundance and species microbial abundance and dna and nutrients concentration simulating an upwelling lastly d andrilli et al 2019 performed a small scale microcosm incubation experiment to isolate temporal patterns of c processing i e respiration and total c utilization for 3 different om sources the combination of several parameters measured in two recent incubation experiments highlighted the complexity of dom production and consumption in a coastal environment and in particular showed that the composition of autochthonous dom was mainly controlled by nutrient availability and the characteristics of the initial bulk dom rather than the phytoplankton community haraguchi pers comm these studies demonstrated that the combination of biological and chemical techniques allows for linking the different factors such as time dom sources biological activity uv radiation and to have a hint of the effects of these combined factors that is more similar to what is happening in a natural environment by contrast few studies were focused on the pom fraction and most of them investigated its degradation under different conditions of bioturbation navel et al 2012 sun and dai 2005 or mineralization processes guenet et al 2014 the laboratory experiments should also be realistic and consequently resemble as much as possible to the natural environment planning an experiment that resembles the natural environment is challenging because is not possible to reproduce and consider all the factors controlling the om dynamics however when planning an experiment it is fundamental to think about size and time scale how much the size of the experiment can be related to the natural environment if we want to relate the results of a laboratory experiment to the environmental processes the experiment should have an appropriate size scale for instance it could be difficult to relate the results of an experiment conducted in 200 ml bottle to what really happens in the aquatic environment big size experiments would be preferable for this purpose this should be analogously considered for the time scale for how long the experiment will keep the original conditions during the experiments we can observe changes that do not happen in the natural environment nutrients get depleted oxygen is consumed the biological community can change due to the experimental conditions and many others appropriate measures should be considered to either keep the original conditions e g nutrient supply aeration or terminate the experiment once the conditions are too different from those observed in the natural environment 6 3 holistic approach nowadays we have at our disposal a wide range of advanced and high frequency analytical techniques in the field of biogeochemistry to characterize the organic matter however because the dynamics and the behavior of the organic matter are intimately linked to the biomass the topography the hydrology and the ecology of the environment a full understanding requires a holistic approach and a collaborative work with all these fields of expertise below are presented from our point of view the most promising holistic approaches 6 3 1 satellite remote sensing and bio optics a complementary approach to expand the spatial and time scale of the study of om distribution is the use of bio optical sensors designed for applications in remote sensing and autonomous oceanographic platforms the retrieval of particulate matter pm and cdom at the ocean s surface from satellite observations has been getting more attention in the latest years and allows to have a synoptic view of om dynamics on a global scale ahn et al 2001 cao et al 2018 kutser et al 2015 le et al 2018 loisel et al 2002 nelson and siegel 2013 woźniak et al 2016 zhu et al 2014 however the currently operating ocean color algorithms for retrieving cdom and pm have shown poor performances especially in high cdom waters such as coastal zones and the arctic ocean aurin and dierssen 2012 gonçalves araujo et al 2018 siegel et al 2005 moreover it has been recently highlighted the importance of combining satellite remote sensing with numerical hydrodynamic modeling that can for example link physical processes and the distribution and transport of water constituents in the coastal environments d sa and ko 2008 joshi et al 2017 along with that the incorporation of bio optical sensors with channels for cdom and pm into oceanographic autonomous platforms gliders moorings autonomous underwater vehicles ice tethered profilers etc has emerged as the state of the art monitoring tools in the past decades as they allow for sampling also over the water column and despite of sun light coverage and weather conditions those sensors do not only provide highly resolved spatial cdom coverage over the water column laney et al 2014 niewiadomska et al 2008 seegers et al 2017 they also gather large datasets for improving the current ocean color algorithms 6 3 2 neural network analysis collaborative work with the bioinformatic community can undeniably be of high profit and it should be one of the directions of our future research indeed using computational tools will greatly help the interpretation of the voluminous and complicated datasets for instance longnecker and kujawinski 2016 applied neural network analysis to their ft icr ms spectra the combination of both tools helped them identify new potential building blocks of organic compounds in deep sea and to highlight the importance of the dissolved organic sulfur components in this kind of environment recently zark and dittmar 2018 have concluded the major component of dom is molecularly indistinguishable after a meticulous comparison of the structural fingerprint of individual molecular formulae in fresh and sea waters one of the hypotheses to explain this observation was the results of a cascade of degradation processes or common synthetic pathways which lead to the formation of a universal pool of molecules regardless of the origin or the history of the material this novel insight in this study directly affects the understanding of long term turnover of dom and ruins the idea of universality of mechanisms another example would be peleato et al 2018 who applied the neural networks to their parafac data the combined approach allowed them to identify the relations between fluorescence regions and the disinfection by product formation facilitating therefore the prediction of their formation a similar approach could be used to predict organic matter reactivity combining computational tools like neural networks to this kind of large and similar data set might improve and certainly help interpret what is observed in the aquatic environment it would also generate new findings and contribute to re think and re built our understanding of the om dynamics as it is illustrated by the few studies that applied this kind of approach 6 3 3 numerical modeling another approach will consist of coupling analytical approaches and numerical modeling to acquire a more detailed picture of the dynamics of the aquatic om modeling approaches can be performed at different scales i large scale such as catchment to regional scale ii ecosystem scale and iii microcosmic scale they require collaborative and interdisciplinary work with hydrologist hydrogeologists ecologists biologists and modelers at catchment scale developed models are based on a coupling between hydrological and biogeochemical approaches fabre et al 2019 futter et al 2007 kim et al 2007 nakayama 2017a these kinds of models such as the integrated catchments model for carbon inca c futter et al 2007 or national integrated catchment based eco hydrology nice bgc nakayama 2017a or the soil and water assessment tool hydrological model swat fabre et al 2019 mainly simulate the horizontal and vertical organic carbon fluxes in a carbon budget framework for instance they were applied to various environment to assess the inter annual and seasonal doc dynamics in mixed catchments futter et al 2011 nakayama 2017b oni et al 2012 to estimate the lateral doc exports de wit et al 2016 or even both horizontal and vertical carbon fluxes nakayama 2017a or to estimate the doc poc and sediment transfer at daily timescale fabre et al 2019 recently nakhavali et al 2018 implemented the joint uk environment simulator jules model used to evaluate the global c cycle and its role in the earth system le quéré et al 2015 in order to provide a model able to represent the doc processes jules docm from the land to the river e g model integrating a representation of doc production in terrestrial ecosystems based on the incomplete decomposition of organic matter doc decomposition within the soil column and doc export to the river network via leaching at the ecosystem scale the models target the response of the living organisms to the surrounding parameters and they are generally called general ecosystem model gem fitz et al 1996 they have been widely applied for terrestrial ecosystems to simulate the soil organic matter cycling campbell e and paustian 2015 li xia and jian jun 2003 schmidt et al 2011 they are also used to a lesser extent in the aquatic environment most of them were used to simulate vertical dynamics of the biomass nutrients detritus and dynamics of elements including carbon fitz et al 1996 mann et al 2014 prokopkin et al 2010 schmittner et al 2005 models at the microcosmic scale are commonly used to characterize and simulate the interactions between dom and pom he et al 2016a and references therein most of them are only focused on individual dom pom exchange mechanisms one of the options to overcome this limitation will be to develop the exergy theory dewulf et al 2008 in order to establish a unified model that combines all the dom pom exchange mechanisms and will fully simulate the exchange behaviors as suggested by he et al 2016a the ideal case would be to simulate any single microcosmic interaction at a global scale taking account of all the processes involved in the aquatic environment therefore research dedicated to this complementary multidisciplinary approach should be expanded in particular with respect to linking processes operating at a molecular scale to those operating at the global scale jansen et al 2014 all the aforementioned modeling approaches presented still require improvements two directions could be simultaneously taken to overcome all the limitations related to their processes of elaboration and or their uses first the calibration of the models requires to be supported with a higher amount of field data creating a database of the standard measurement in the field including chemical physical hydrological and ecological data over the world would greatly facilitate the establishment of accurate models at the global scale another direction might be to focus our efforts on the microcosmic scale model supported by laboratory experiments e g microcosm and mesocosm experiments to fully characterize the interactions between dom and pom see above and implement this microcosmic mesocosmic models into models at a larger global scale 7 conclusion organic matter is a key component in the local and global carbon cycle and the understanding of this cycle is currently one of the major conundrums in the fields of environmental sciences and biogeochemistry although the organic matter topic was extensively explored over the last decades several research gaps still need to be filled and improvements and or new ideas are required future studies should be done at various structural levels and from diverse perspectives simultaneous studies of both particulate and dissolved om fractions should be prioritized likewise multi disciplinary approaches creation of databases and collaborative works should be the future om research priorities

18576,organic matter om refers to the largest reactive reservoir of carbon based compounds on earth aside of its role as a source of carbon om is also actively involved in a wide range of ecological functions it also plays an important role in the solubility toxicity bioavailability mobility and distribution of pollutants therefore om is a key component in the local and global carbon cycle about 12 000 articles containing organic matter in the title were published during the past decade with a continuous increasing number each year isi web of science although this topic was widely explored and its interest has significantly increased some limitations remain these limitations can be technical e g pre treatment processes low resolution instrument data handling and can be related to the current approach in this review we first present the current strategies and tools to characterize the organic matter in the aquatic environment then we tackle several aspects of current characterization limitations finally we suggest new perspectives and priorities of research to improve the current limitations from our point of view simultaneous studies of particulate and dissolved om fractions should be prioritized and multi disciplinary approach creation of databases controlled experiments and collaborative works should be the next targets for future om research priorities graphical abstract image 1 keywords dissolved organic matter particulate organic matter carbon cycle carbon sources biogeochemistry 1 introduction organic matter om refers to the largest reactive reservoir of carbon based compounds on earth with a total amount of carbon of 3200 pg c through the 3 environments e g soils 1600 pg c sediments 1000 pg c and the ocean 685 pg c bianchi 2011 hedges 1992 om present in the environment is introduced either naturally or anthropogenically natural om is generated by the breakdown and degradation of organisms through various biological and physical natural processes involving hydrosphere biosphere and geosphere sillanpää 2014 anthropogenic om on the other hand is introduced in the environment through human activities and by products e g sewage guo et al 2010 and litter and through degradation of microplastics romera castillo et al 2018 aside of its role as a source of carbon om is also actively involved in a wide range of ecological functions being a source of energy for microbes in soil and aquatic food web and a byproduct of biological metabolism jiao et al 2010 thurman 1985 it also plays important roles in the solubility toxicity bioavailability mobility and the distribution of pollutants via binding with heavy metals and or persistent organic pollutants pops deb and shukla 2011 farrington and takada 2014 hedges 2002 romera castillo et al 2018 therefore om is a key component in local and global carbon cycle and small changes in its size proportion and dynamics can potentially impact a large number of biogeochemical processes and or systems such as carbon storage co2 release and coupling of terrestrial and marine systems cole et al 2007 tranvik et al 2009 with several consequences on climate aquatic life and global habitability folger 2008 lal et al 2008 lehmann and kleber 2015 schuur et al 2015 york 2018 in this sense the understanding of the carbon cycle from local to global scale is currently one of the major conundrums in the fields of environmental sciences and biogeochemistry in aquatic environments om is defined as a heterogeneous mixture of particles and molecules having variable physical e g size and porosity and chemical e g functional group content and solubility properties baldock et al 2004 it is operationally divided into 2 fractions based on filter pore size dissolved organic matter dom 0 2 0 45 0 7 μm and particulate organic matter pom 0 2 0 45 0 7 μm exchanges between both forms are easy and regulated by mechanisms such as adsorption desorption aggregation dissolution dissolution precipitation etc and can be mediated by photochemical processes and biological activity he et al 2016a 2016b perdue and ritchie 2003 zimmermann timm 2002 moreover the amounts and the characteristics of the om are greatly influenced by biogeochemical processes such as photochemical and biological degradation understanding the om dynamics in aquatic environments and its role in local and global carbon cycles implies a study at various structural level and from diverse perspectives summons 1993 a wide range of techniques are used to characterize the om based on bulk chemical properties with general parameters e g measurement of dissolved and particulate organic carbon concentration doc and poc to deep insights into the molecular setup of dom via advanced tools e g the characterization via fourier transform ion cyclotron mass spectrometry dittmar and stubbins 2014 the om can be studied by using two different approaches source tracking which gives information on sources and molecular characterization which gives detailed structural information e g class compounds functional groups and elemental formula within the first approach we can find techniques such as stable isotopes ratios lambert et al 2011 biomarkers derrien et al 2017c compound specific isotopes analysis schmidt et al 2004 and spectroscopic characterization by measuring uv absorption helms et al 2008 and fluorescence coble 1996 murphy et al 2014a 2013 stedmon et al 2003 within the molecular characterization techniques we can find size exclusion chromatography coupled with organic and or nitrogen organic detector s huber et al 2011 pyrolysis gas chromatography mass spectrometry jeanneau et al 2015 homo and hetero correlated multidimensional nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy hertkorn et al 2013 and fourier transform ion cyclotron mass spectrometry sleighter and hatcher 2007 despite numerous studies in the last decades the om dynamics in aquatic environments and the dom pom interactions as well as at a bigger scale its role in local and global carbon cycles are still poorly understood various reasons can be found to justify this gap in understanding knowledge one of these is related to inherent problems affecting the analysis due to the nature of the sample low concentration salt occurrence heterogeneity complexity sensitivity to physical and chemical properties and or to the limitations of the techniques price accessibility sample preparation sensitivity fraction targeted etc another critical point is that dom and pom fractions are mostly investigated separately and only a few studies consider both dhillon and inamdar 2013 he et al 2016c lambert et al 2017 osburn et al 2015 2012 roebuck jr et al 2018 thibault et al 2019 lastly it can also be explained by the difficulties in linking the results of the om characterization to the mechanisms and dynamics of the om more effort should be made to improve the current strategy for the characterization of the om and its dynamics in this framework the aims of this paper were 1 to present the current strategies and briefly summarize the tools used to characterize the om in aquatic environment i e source tracking and molecular characterization techniques 2 to raise the current issues limiting our ability to clearly understand the dynamics of the om at local and global scales and 3 to suggest new perspectives and priorities of research to improve the current limitations 2 dom and pom in the aquatic environment organic matter comprises a large number of molecules belonging to many classes of compounds e g polysaccharides amino acids humic substances lignin cellulose peptidoglycan protein saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbons tannins aromatic compounds and with different polarity hydrophobic transphilic and hydrophilic antony et al 2017 hawkes et al 2018 kellerman et al 2015 leenheer and croué 2003 sandron et al 2015 volkman and tanoue 2002 it represents a complex mixture which also varies widely according to the environment the geography the time and the depth in the water column mccallister et al 2018 mopper et al 2007 although the organic matter is commonly divided into the dissolved dom and particulate pom size fractions there is a size continuum where the colloidal forms marine gels are the link between the two pools orellana and leck 2015 these colloidal forms can aggregate and disassemble shifting between the dissolved and particulate form the size of the molecules is also one of the factors that determine the reactivity and turn over time of om in the natural environment e g it affects bacterial uptake amon and benner 1996 the complexity of om and of the processes affecting it results in a large variability in its reactivity a reactivity continuum model was proposed by boudreau and ruddick 1991 and it is still used to have the most realistic description of om decomposition in different environments aumont et al 2017 garcia et al 2018 manzoni et al 2012 mostovaya et al 2017 sources of om are multiple and diverse which greatly increases its complexity these sources are usually classified as allochthonous or autochthonous the natural allochthonous sources coming from outside the aquatic environment include materials from land e g vascular plants leaves root exudates and soils as well as from the atmosphere e g dust storms and from hydrocarbon seeps at the seafloor apart from that anthropogenic activities play important role as allochthonous om sources with input from e g organic fertilizers effluents from wastewater treatment facilities treated ad or untreated sewage industrial wastewaters black carbon from fires and fossil fuel oil spills and ultimately leached from plastic carstea et al 2016 d sa et al 2016 derrien et al 2015 jaffe et al 2013 romera castillo et al 2018 autochthonous om produced within water bodies derives from aquatic biota e g algae bacteria plankton macrophytes and nekton and is produced by both autotrophic romera castillo et al 2010 thornton 2014 and heterotrophic organisms at all trophic level derrien et al 2018a steinberg et al 2004 tulonen 2004 as well as by viruses through viral lysis at the same time both dom and pom can be removed and or transformed and can play an important role on the overall biogeochemical cycles and microbial loop within the aquatic environment asmala et al 2018 ávila et al 2019 they can be removed by aquatic organisms and used for biomass synthesis or for respiration the latter producing co2 as om is subject to photochemical processes that can affect dom and pom properties it acts as an important photosensitizer mediating the production of carbon dioxide co2 carbon monoxide co and other dangerous reactive oxygen species causing oxidative stress to living organisms at the same time that it can also degrade toxic compounds preventing exposure to the biota vione et al 2014 these processes affecting both fractions are variable in time and space and often controlled by environmental parameters e g temperature ph salinity increasing their variability moreover exchanges mechanisms between the two pools from doc to poc and vice versa are highly important and need to be considered fig 1 summarizes the main processes affecting dom and pom described in this paragraph amon and benner 1996 estapa and mayer 2010 grey et al 2001 hansell and carlson 2015 he et al 2016a hein et al 2003 heitmann et al 2007 jiao et al 2010 jin et al 2006 mccarthy et al 2007 ogawa et al 2001 porcal et al 2015 romera castillo et al 2010 salonen and hammar 1986 smith et al 2015 steinberg et al 2004 thornton 2014 tulonen 2004 weston et al 2006 wolf et al 2018 3 source tracking 3 1 stable isotope ratios carbon has two stable naturally occurring isotopes 12c 98 89 and13c 1 11 physical chemical or biological processes in natural environments can lead to changes in the isotopic composition due to a difference in atomic mass between 12c and 13c for instance according to the types of plants e g c3 c4 or crassulacean acid metabolism cam and or their specific photosynthetic paths the isotopic ratios may subject to change c3 plants present values of carbon isotopic composition δ13c ratio of stable isotopes 13c 12c reported in parts per thousand per mil measured via an elemental analyzer coupled with an isotope ratio mass spectrometer ea irms between 33 to 24 while the values range from 16 to 10 for c4 and between 20 and 10 for cam stable carbon isotope ratios are widely used and considered as one of the most effective ways to track both the sources e g allochthonous versus autochthonous and the transformation processes of om in the environment amiotte suchet et al 2007 benner et al 1997 lambert et al 2011 meyers 1994 toming et al 2013 previously most of the studies were focused on δ13c analysis nowadays this is often combined with the analysis of stable nitrogen isotope ratios δ15n to prevent some existing overlaps with the single use of the δ13c tracer barros et al 2010 berto et al 2013 cloern et al 2002 derrien et al 2018a gao et al 2012 ogrinc et al 2005 in addition to these measurements isotopic mixing models based on isotopic mass balance equation phillips et al 2005 phillips and gregg 2003 can be used to estimate the contributions of om sources in multi source watershed context or during storm events derrien et al 2018a yang et al 2015 yu et al 2019 3 2 biomarkers molecular biomarkers e g targeted organic compound analyzed by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry gc ms provide a powerful tool to identify the origins of om and the associated biogeochemical processes and thus to reconstruct environmental changes in the environment to date lignin phenol i e lignin plant pigments i e chlorophylls and carotenoids carbohydrates proteins and lipids have been most widely used as biomarkers to identify om sources bianchi et al 1995 bianchi and canuel 2011 hedges 1992 meyers and ishiwatari 1993 saiz jimenez and de leeuw 1986 among those lipids have the highest potential as molecular markers for marine berge and barnathan 2005 christodoulou et al 2009 prahl et al 1994 volkman 1986 coastal canuel 2001 wakeham et al 2002 wakeham and beier 1991 yoshinaga et al 2008 estuarine systems carreira et al 2011 hall et al 2006 laurcillard and saliot 1993 mudge and norris 1997 zimmerman and canuel 2001 and inland environments derrien et al 2015 jaffé et al 1995 jandl et al 2005 pisani et al 2013 covering diverse om sources e g allochthonous autochthonous sources and anthropogenic inputs derrien et al 2015 zimmerman and canuel 2001 due to the characteristics of ubiquity diagenetic and chemical stability and their extreme structural diversity the accuracy if the assignment of the om sources via this approach is helped by the use of compounds ratio and the application of multivariate statistical tools derrien et al 2017c have recently presented a detailed review of the lipid biomarkers and their use 3 3 compound specific isotope analysis csia csia refers to the measurement of the isotopic signatures typically the stable isotopes of carbon hydrogen oxygen nitrogen or sulfur of individual compounds from a complex environmental mixture via gc combustion isotope ratio mass spectrometry gc c irms this approach can provide information about source differentiation e g origin and fate of organic matter in both extant and fossil environment evershed et al 2008 reaction pathways in the environment including biodegradation and abiotic degradation and help for forensic applications as environmental remediation decision or monitoring remediation processes on polluted sites elsner and imfeld 2016 schmidt et al 2004 csia was first applied to the δ 13c analysis of hydrocarbons in crude oils and refined products to reduce the variability of source pools and identify the sources of individual compounds or groups of compounds in complex mixtures bianchi and canuel 2011 hayes et al 1990 simoneit 1997 then it has subsequently been extended to other biogenic elements e g nitrogen and hydrogen batista et al 2014 chikaraishi and naraoka 2003 lichtfouse 2000 and a variety of biochemicals amino acids carbohydrates lipids and lignin phenols alewell et al 2016 pearson et al 2001 and organic contaminants e g polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pah polychlorinated biphenyls pcb benzene toluene ethylbenzene btex etc elsner and imfeld 2016 schmidt et al 2004 the power of this technique lies in the differential fractionation of individual compounds especially when it is used in combination with already known chemical biomarker to identify the origin of the organic matter in all environments amelung et al 2008 bendle et al 2007 cooper et al 2015 tolosa et al 2013 3 4 optical properties the absorbance and fluorescence properties of dom have been defined as optical markers comparable to traditional biomarkers stedmon and nelson 2015 uv visible absorption and fluorescence have been widely used to characterize the colored and fluorescent sub fractions of dom cdom and fdom respectively coble 2007 helms et al 2008 wünsch et al 2017 the cdom component absorbs light mainly in the ultraviolet uv and blue regions of the electromagnetic spectrum bricaud et al 1981 the absorption coefficients at selected wavelengths aλ are used for different purposes the most common is the a254 which is calculated to estimate cdom content del vecchio and blough 2004 weishaar et al 2003 the a350 and a440 are used due to their strong correlation with lignin spencer et al 2009b stedmon et al 2011a and application to ocean color remote sensing siegel et al 2005 respectively a series of indices have been also widely applied using absorption coefficients to gain information on the average molecular weight the ratio between a250 and a365 e2 e3 peuravuori and pihlaja 1997 the spectral slope ratio sr helms et al 2008 and the aromaticity of the molecules specific ultraviolet absorption at 254 nm suva254 weishaar et al 2003 and on the tracking of terrestrial compounds spectral slope between 275 and 295 nm s275 295 fichot and benner 2012 the fdom is the fraction of cdom which can emit fluorescence after absorbing uv visible light the spectral characteristics of fdom can be investigated by using excitation emission wavelength pairs e g in situ probes single emission spectra synchronous spectra and three dimensional excitation emission matrices eems moreover the combination eems with parallel factor analysis parafac fig 2 allows to distinguish between different groups of fluorophores components such as humic like re elaborated humic like also called microbial or marine humic like and protein like fellman et al 2010 ishii and boyer 2012 murphy et al 2014a stedmon and bro 2008 a set of indices have been also developed by using the ratio of the fluorescence intensity at specific wavelengths or wavelength ranges mainly to distinguish between autochthonous and allochthonous dom sources and to assess the degree of humification of dom gabor et al 2014 huguet et al 2009 mcknight et al 2001 zsolnay et al 1999 both fluorescence component distribution and optical indices have successfully been applied to investigate the chemical composition identify the sources of dom and track the involved biogeochemical processes in many aquatic environments such as wastewaters rivers groundwaters lakes seas and oceans fichot et al 2013 gonçalves araujo et al 2016 2015 inamdar et al 2011 jaffé et al 2014 lambert et al 2016 retelletti brogi et al 2019 2018 stedmon et al 2011b yamashita et al 2013 yang et al 2014 due to their low cost rapidity and sensitivity the very limited sample pre treatment required and thanks to the development of user friendly tools to treat the data murphy et al 2013 these techniques are now considered as a popular powerful and standard tool for dom characterization their wide application on an exponentially increasing number of studies allowed for gaining information on om composition and its related environmental processes on a global scale which would take much longer time and effort if done with more complex and time consuming techniques 4 structural characterization 4 1 size exclusion chromatography techniques the liquid chromatography coupled to organic carbon and nitrogen detectors lc ocd ond is basically a size exclusion chromatography coupled to 2 online detectors ocd and ond huber et al 2011 this method uses a purified mobile phase a phosphate buffer and a chromatographic column a weak cation exchange column on polymethacrylate basis able to separate the om according to the molecular weight huber et al 2011 nowadays it is recognized to be an attractive technique providing for direct qualitative and quantitative information on the om molecular weight fractionation and doc and don concentrations allpike et al 2007 her et al 2003 2002 huber et al 2011 retelletti brogi et al 2018 so et al 2017 yan et al 2012 five defined size fractions can be identified and quantified including biopolymers bp 10 kda humic substances hs approximately 1 kda building blocks bb 300 500 da low molecular weight acid and neutrals lmw a n 350 da huber et al 2011 maqbool et al 2017 nowadays this technique is mainly applied to track the natural organic matter in drinking water and or to study membrane fouling issues baghoth et al 2011 kennedy et al 2005 rosenberger et al 2006 zheng et al 2014 it is also becoming a preferred choice to characterize organic matter from natural environments dittmar and kattner 2003 hutchins et al 2017 penru et al 2013 retelletti brogi et al 2018 villacorte et al 2015 as the molecular weight of the organic matter strongly affects reactivity in the natural ecosystems yan et al 2012 it has also been suggested that since it detects the a254 coupled with the different size fractions it can give a hint on the chemical composition of cdom stedmon and nelson 2015 one advantage of this method is that the samples do not need any pre treatment and its strength is enhanced when coupled with other techniques e g optical properties baghoth et al 2008 penru et al 2013 allowing to investigate the properties of the specific size fractions 4 2 pyrolysis gas chromatography mass spectrometry py gc ms py gc ms is a method of chemical analysis in which natural and synthetic biopolymers present in the sample are heated to decomposition to produce sub units i e low molecular weight molecules that are then separated by gas chromatography and detected using mass spectrometry leenheer and croué 2003 matilainen et al 2011 this technique is not the most used for the characterization of the molecular composition of the om however it represents an interesting option for obtaining detailed structural information on the components of natural organic matter as well as on humic substances for both dom and pom and also to assess the preservation diagenesis and provenance of sediment organic matter carr et al 2010 derenne and nguyen 2014 greenwood et al 2012 iwai et al 2013 lately jeanneau et al 2018 demonstrated the suitability of this molecular analysis to apportion the sources of pom in river 4 3 fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir ftir is probably one of the most commonly used spectroscopic tool after fluorescence spectroscopy for the analysis of either liquid or solid natural om nom samples artz et al 2008 derenne and nguyen 2014 dick et al 2003 giovanela et al 2004 haberhauer et al 2000 parolo et al 2017 tremblay et al 2011 this spectroscopy exploits the fact that molecules absorb frequencies that are characteristics of their structure e g vibrational characteristics of their chemical bonds the resulting absorption is a unique fingerprint of compounds allowing the identification of functional groups matilainen et al 2011 transmission spectroscopy through a sample kbr pellet is the oldest and most commonly used method in nom studies alternatively reflectance spectroscopy as attenuated total reflectance atr and diffuse reflectance infrared fourier transform drift have been preferentially used as it represents a more robust reliable and non destructive technique and generates higher reproducibility than the former one simonescu 2012 although this technique presents the advantage of being applicable to both dom and pom fractions nowadays it is rarely used by itself and preferentially combined to other techniques e g nmr fluorescence to endorse the interpretation of the results related to changes during biochemical mechanisms and or to control the quality and efficiency of the water remediation processes maqbool et al 2017 rodríguez et al 2016 4 4 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy nmr nmr has been extensively used for decades to characterize the structure of the molecules in om as it provides a detailed picture of its molecular architecture barron and wilson 1981 hertkorn et al 2016 2013 kögel knabner 1997 konstantinov et al 2013 matilainen et al 2011 wong et al 2002 zhong et al 2011 briefly nmr is a physical phenomenon in which nuclei in a magnetic field absorb and re emit electromagnetic radiation it can be a very selective technique distinguishing among many atoms within a molecule or collection of molecules of the same type but which differ only in terms of their local chemical environment nmr can be done on both solid and liquid phase samples matilainen et al 2011 mopper et al 2007 and commonly performs for the nuclei of atoms 1h 13c and 15n minor et al 2014 traditionally 1 dimensional 1d nmr was used to characterize the om however over the past decade nmr has been used in two 2d or multidimensional configuration as they represent a more appropriate technique to characterize complex organic compounds hertkorn et al 2013 kaiser et al 2003 zhong et al 2011 detailed information on the use of nmr to characterize om can be found in mopper et al 2007 and matilainen et al 2011 4 5 high resolution fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms ft icr ms has emerged as a reliable tool for the in depth molecular characterization of complex mixtures as dom over the last decade ft icr ms had the prevailing position for the chemical characterization of dom at the molecular level and for all the environments including lakes seas oceans estuary wetlands soils rivers and even ice cores bae et al 2011 chen et al 2011 derrien et al 2017a 2017b gonsior et al 2013 kujawinski et al 2002 li et al 2019 lu et al 2016 mopper et al 2007 retelletti brogi et al 2018 sleighter and hatcher 2008 coupled with electrospray ionization esi this technique provides the necessary resolution to determine with high accuracy hundreds to several thousand ions with an m z range typically from 200 to 1000 da furthermore due to the high mass resolution and accuracy less than 0 5 ppm the elemental formulas are assigned with a high level of confidence repeta 2015 stubbins and dittmar 2014 as esi ft icr ms analysis generates a large amount of data the empirical formula data are commonly categorized in 6 8 main class of compounds e g lipids proteins carbohydrates unsaturated hydrocarbons lignins and or carboxyl rich alicyclic molecules cram tannins and condensed aromatic compounds according to their h c and o c ratios e g van krevelen diagram some indices related to the degree of unsaturation dbe double bond equivalent index and or the aromaticity of the formulae ai or aimod modified aromaticity index have been also developed hockaday et al 2009 hodgkins et al 2016 ohno et al 2010 comparison of samples at this molecular specificity scale allowed for the identification of specific classes of compounds according their sources or ways of production koch et al 2005 koch and dittmar 2006 and also more recently to highlight the extreme isomeric complexity in the dom across aquatic environments hawkes et al 2018 nowadays this technique is likely considered as the most powerful tool that can be used to characterize the structures and the molecular properties of the dom 5 limitations of the actual methods and approaches a large fraction of uncertainty on om composition is related to inherent problems affecting its analysis such as i low concentration e g seawater 0 4 1 mg l 1 in water with a much higher amount of inorganic compounds that can negatively affect chemical analysis or the low abundance of some compounds minor et al 2014 stubbins and dittmar 2014 ii extreme diversity and heterogeneity of compounds of their chemical properties and of their molecular weights which complicates isolation and analysis approaches hertkorn et al 2008 sandron et al 2015 and iii the difficulty in extracting unbiased material during isolation or concentration processes matilainen et al 2011 mopper et al 2007 although notable advances have been done in this last decade to improve the sample pre treatment instrument resolution and analytical capabilities of the equipment mccallister et al 2018 most of the highly sensitive techniques still present some inconveniences technical issues and prohibitive cost in addition to the difficulties related to data handling compared to the elemental techniques for instance the analysis of the stable isotope ratios does not require much pre treatment but it will give only one value which relates to the source of the organic matter while the more advanced techniques such as ft icr ms analysis will provide thousands of formulas often not allowing for a full understanding or interpretation of the data besides these issues related to the nature of the samples it is very important to raise the question related to the representativeness of the studied fraction and or sub fractions over the past decades tremendous efforts have been made to quantify analyze and characterize the om but we are still facing these issues bulk pom dom fdom or even cdom are different om fractions which can be studied with the techniques previously introduced cdom and fdom are widely investigated since their analyses are cost effective relatively quick and non destructive however this optical approach is limited to colored and fluorescent om what percentage of bulk om or even of the dom does that represent for example recently hawkes et al 2019 analyzed online the size distribution with hpsec uvdad high pressure size exclusion chromatography coupled with uv vis diode array detector and the molecular mass via esi ms of different dom samples they observed a clear discrepancy between the two methods and showed that an important pool of organic matter having a strong uv absorbance showed no esi ms signal these results demonstrate that there is a substantial distinction in dom samples between what is optically active and what is efficiently ionized by esi hence is targeting only a specific sub fraction suitable to understand mechanisms at a larger scale then most of the om studies were focused on dom or pom fractions separately this approach is questionable is it the most insightful approach to understand the dynamics of the om in the aquatic environment the interactions between both fractions happen continuously and sometimes very fast they also change in time due to the biotic and abiotic factors it is a dynamic system therefore focusing studies on only one om fraction has several limits thus simultaneous studies should be prioritized of course studies integrating simultaneous dom and pom characterization would induce other issues as shown in fig 3 most of the techniques of om characterization cannot be directly applied to both fractions techniques such as isotopes biomarkers or py gc ms can be applied on dom fractions after a process of freeze drying plus desalination in the case of salted water these pre processes require a large amount of sample 1 l or more according to the concentration and may cause om modification repeta 2015 there are also some techniques i e fluorescence which can be performed on pom after extracting the dom from it i e water or solvent extraction assuming it is representative of the whole pom fraction however the representativeness of this extract was never explored or tested indeed this limitation cannot be neglected especially when recent studies highlight the potential failure of representativeness of these extracts derrien et al 2018a yu et al 2019 these observations finally lead to an ultimate question how can we link all the various and diversified collected data to the basic understanding of om dynamics in the aquatic environment om is studied at various structural level and from diverse perspectives fig 4 elemental analysis as doc or poc concentrations or stable isotope help estimate the flux of carbon or identify the sources of the organic matter one can thus understand mechanisms of transport by contrast a molecular approach will give information on the state of the material maturity lability aromaticity freshness etc diagenetic effects or geological changes summons 1993 it is clear that a complementary approach is necessary but linking all the information together is probably the biggest challenge we have to solve in order to achieve a full understanding of the aquatic organic matter dynamics and at a larger scale the carbon cycle so far few recent studies have attempted to combine source tracking methods and molecular characterization techniques with a preference for fluorescence and ft icr ms stubbins et al 2014 wagner et al 2015 wünsch et al 2018a although the work of wagner et al 2015 has given a good correlation between the results of both techniques the question of the representativeness of the fluorescence fraction is still pending newly thibault et al 2019 published a multi compartment e g dom pom and bulk fractions study in which they applied complementary analytical approaches including bulk elemental and isotopic composition and structural solid state 13c nmr analyses this strategy allowed them to irrefutably demonstrate each om pool has its own properties and dynamics challenges are still up but similar approaches need to be preferentially applied for the better understanding 6 future directions and new perspectives after describing the inherent issues related to the techniques applied for characterization of the aquatic om and or its nature in this last paragraph we attempt to suggest some approaches that would be worthwhile to explore more in the future 6 1 standardization and databases some of the previously mentioned analytical techniques require the choice of different instrumental settings and samples preparation however these different choices may sometimes affect the final measurement of the samples making difficult a comparison of the results between different studies two symbolic examples are the processing and data treatment of the fluorescence eems and the ft icr ms coupled with esi the results of fluorescence measurements depend on several factors such as instrumental settings slits scan speed internal instrument biases and phenomena like inner filter effect exceeding a certain concentration will result in a decrease of the fluorescence signal and the modification of the emission spectrum these factors can be controlled and normalized to be comparable between different studies during post measurements data treatment however some of these data treatments vary according to different studies for example some authors correct the inner filter effect during data treatment whereas others dilute the samples according to the absorbance at 254 nm a254 but there is no agreement on the limit of the a254 value for the dilution hur et al 2008 miller et al 2010 ohno 2002 moreover some authors present the data in raman units ru whereas others use quinine sulfate units qsu the latter is however doubtful because different studies report different methods or do not give details on the qsu conversion ferretto et al 2017 lønborg et al 2010 romera castillo et al 2014 yamashita et al 2010 yao et al 2011 the first step for ft icr ms is solid phase extraction spe and according to the method used the extraction efficiency can vary lv et al 2016 repeta 2015 stücheli et al 2018 wünsch et al 2018b dittmar et al 2008 summarized the different methods used to extract dom for ft icr ms analysis highlighting the different retention properties of the most commonly used sorbents then ft icr ms is mostly used with electrospray ionization esi including both negative and positive modes the results of positive and negative esi can overlap but differences are still present repeta 2015 for example hertkorn et al 2013 compared both modes of esi for ft icr ms analysis on ocean dom samples from the surface to deep depths the results showed a preferential detection of carbon rich 62 and oxygen depleted 26 ions in positive mode compared to the negative mode 50 and 36 42 respectively in the assigned molecular formulas they generally observed a larger number of assigned molecular compositions in positive mode than in negative mode on the other hand negative mode esi seems to be more sensitive towards acidic functional groups solihat et al 2019 higher discrepancies are inevitably observed with different ionization sources such as atmospheric pressure ionization appi or atmospheric pressure chemical ionization apci due to their inherent selectivity for specific types of molecules hertkorn et al 2008 solihat et al 2019 hence the selectivity and the matrix sensitivity of the ionization sources represent an issue which needs to be considered and refined with a standardization of the method derrien et al 2018b mopper et al 2007 these examples highlight the need for a standardization of sample preparation analytical methods and data treatment standardized data processing tools are already available for fluorescence eems treatment and were improved during the last few years the newest dreem tool developed by murphy et al 2014a allows for the correction of eems by doing blank subtraction raman or quinine sulfate normalization instrumental bias correction and inner filter correction producing comparable data from different instruments and instrumental settings murphy et al 2010 similarly a standardized method to prepare and measure the samples and or treat the data after measurements should be prepared for all the techniques that might have these issues in order to improve the quality of the data and the comparison of different studies on top of that the creation of online databases of published data would allow for a big step forward to improve data comparison and interpretation for instance a database of published fluorescence components obtained by coupling eems with parallel factor analysis has been created murphy et al 2014b and allows calculating the percentage of similarities between the published spectra more recently leefmann et al 2019 developed a new browser based software tool for processing high resolution mass spectrometry data with the option to export the final data report and to compare with previous datasets these kinds of databases similarly to libraries used in chromatography and mass spectra analyses would help a faster interpretation of the results if previously reported and increase the coherence between different studies with similar results the standardization of the methods and creation of databases will benefit especially those techniques such as ft icr ms that produce big datasets that are currently only partially exploited 6 2 laboratory experiment in controlled conditions as previously highlighted the factors regulating dom and pom in the aquatic environment are several and variable in time and space the analysis of samples from natural environments provides a snapshot of the om in a specific place either at a small or large scale at a specific time however according to the parameters chosen it is not always possible to identify the processes that lead to the observed dynamics characteristics and extending these observations to a larger spatial and or temporal scale is challenging setting up a laboratory experiment can help in identifying the effects that certain factors have on om dynamics properties experiments carried out under controlled conditions can be split into two categories according to the main purpose 1 to study a single factor by isolating its effects and 2 to study the combined effect of multiple factors many experiments studying the effect of a single factor have already been carried out for dom for instance incubation experiments to study microbial degradation of om have been carried out by removing the effect of autotrophic activity by filtration and dark incubation and grazers by filtration asmala et al 2014 logue et al 2016 raymond and bauer 2000 retelletti brogi et al 2015 photodegradation experiments to study the effect of uv radiation were carried out by removing the microbial communities by poisoning porcal et al 2004 spencer et al 2009a a step forward would be at this point to put more efforts in planning experiments that consider the concurrent effect of more factors some good examples can be already found whitehead et al 2000 set up a mesocosm experiment in 1500 l volume tanks and studied the combined effect of phytoplankton biological activity irradiation and water mixing on dom properties more recently osterholz et al 2015 carried out an experiment in 10 l volume bottles to study the microbial production of refractory dom for this purpose the authors took account of phytoplankton abundance and species microbial abundance and dna and nutrients concentration simulating an upwelling lastly d andrilli et al 2019 performed a small scale microcosm incubation experiment to isolate temporal patterns of c processing i e respiration and total c utilization for 3 different om sources the combination of several parameters measured in two recent incubation experiments highlighted the complexity of dom production and consumption in a coastal environment and in particular showed that the composition of autochthonous dom was mainly controlled by nutrient availability and the characteristics of the initial bulk dom rather than the phytoplankton community haraguchi pers comm these studies demonstrated that the combination of biological and chemical techniques allows for linking the different factors such as time dom sources biological activity uv radiation and to have a hint of the effects of these combined factors that is more similar to what is happening in a natural environment by contrast few studies were focused on the pom fraction and most of them investigated its degradation under different conditions of bioturbation navel et al 2012 sun and dai 2005 or mineralization processes guenet et al 2014 the laboratory experiments should also be realistic and consequently resemble as much as possible to the natural environment planning an experiment that resembles the natural environment is challenging because is not possible to reproduce and consider all the factors controlling the om dynamics however when planning an experiment it is fundamental to think about size and time scale how much the size of the experiment can be related to the natural environment if we want to relate the results of a laboratory experiment to the environmental processes the experiment should have an appropriate size scale for instance it could be difficult to relate the results of an experiment conducted in 200 ml bottle to what really happens in the aquatic environment big size experiments would be preferable for this purpose this should be analogously considered for the time scale for how long the experiment will keep the original conditions during the experiments we can observe changes that do not happen in the natural environment nutrients get depleted oxygen is consumed the biological community can change due to the experimental conditions and many others appropriate measures should be considered to either keep the original conditions e g nutrient supply aeration or terminate the experiment once the conditions are too different from those observed in the natural environment 6 3 holistic approach nowadays we have at our disposal a wide range of advanced and high frequency analytical techniques in the field of biogeochemistry to characterize the organic matter however because the dynamics and the behavior of the organic matter are intimately linked to the biomass the topography the hydrology and the ecology of the environment a full understanding requires a holistic approach and a collaborative work with all these fields of expertise below are presented from our point of view the most promising holistic approaches 6 3 1 satellite remote sensing and bio optics a complementary approach to expand the spatial and time scale of the study of om distribution is the use of bio optical sensors designed for applications in remote sensing and autonomous oceanographic platforms the retrieval of particulate matter pm and cdom at the ocean s surface from satellite observations has been getting more attention in the latest years and allows to have a synoptic view of om dynamics on a global scale ahn et al 2001 cao et al 2018 kutser et al 2015 le et al 2018 loisel et al 2002 nelson and siegel 2013 woźniak et al 2016 zhu et al 2014 however the currently operating ocean color algorithms for retrieving cdom and pm have shown poor performances especially in high cdom waters such as coastal zones and the arctic ocean aurin and dierssen 2012 gonçalves araujo et al 2018 siegel et al 2005 moreover it has been recently highlighted the importance of combining satellite remote sensing with numerical hydrodynamic modeling that can for example link physical processes and the distribution and transport of water constituents in the coastal environments d sa and ko 2008 joshi et al 2017 along with that the incorporation of bio optical sensors with channels for cdom and pm into oceanographic autonomous platforms gliders moorings autonomous underwater vehicles ice tethered profilers etc has emerged as the state of the art monitoring tools in the past decades as they allow for sampling also over the water column and despite of sun light coverage and weather conditions those sensors do not only provide highly resolved spatial cdom coverage over the water column laney et al 2014 niewiadomska et al 2008 seegers et al 2017 they also gather large datasets for improving the current ocean color algorithms 6 3 2 neural network analysis collaborative work with the bioinformatic community can undeniably be of high profit and it should be one of the directions of our future research indeed using computational tools will greatly help the interpretation of the voluminous and complicated datasets for instance longnecker and kujawinski 2016 applied neural network analysis to their ft icr ms spectra the combination of both tools helped them identify new potential building blocks of organic compounds in deep sea and to highlight the importance of the dissolved organic sulfur components in this kind of environment recently zark and dittmar 2018 have concluded the major component of dom is molecularly indistinguishable after a meticulous comparison of the structural fingerprint of individual molecular formulae in fresh and sea waters one of the hypotheses to explain this observation was the results of a cascade of degradation processes or common synthetic pathways which lead to the formation of a universal pool of molecules regardless of the origin or the history of the material this novel insight in this study directly affects the understanding of long term turnover of dom and ruins the idea of universality of mechanisms another example would be peleato et al 2018 who applied the neural networks to their parafac data the combined approach allowed them to identify the relations between fluorescence regions and the disinfection by product formation facilitating therefore the prediction of their formation a similar approach could be used to predict organic matter reactivity combining computational tools like neural networks to this kind of large and similar data set might improve and certainly help interpret what is observed in the aquatic environment it would also generate new findings and contribute to re think and re built our understanding of the om dynamics as it is illustrated by the few studies that applied this kind of approach 6 3 3 numerical modeling another approach will consist of coupling analytical approaches and numerical modeling to acquire a more detailed picture of the dynamics of the aquatic om modeling approaches can be performed at different scales i large scale such as catchment to regional scale ii ecosystem scale and iii microcosmic scale they require collaborative and interdisciplinary work with hydrologist hydrogeologists ecologists biologists and modelers at catchment scale developed models are based on a coupling between hydrological and biogeochemical approaches fabre et al 2019 futter et al 2007 kim et al 2007 nakayama 2017a these kinds of models such as the integrated catchments model for carbon inca c futter et al 2007 or national integrated catchment based eco hydrology nice bgc nakayama 2017a or the soil and water assessment tool hydrological model swat fabre et al 2019 mainly simulate the horizontal and vertical organic carbon fluxes in a carbon budget framework for instance they were applied to various environment to assess the inter annual and seasonal doc dynamics in mixed catchments futter et al 2011 nakayama 2017b oni et al 2012 to estimate the lateral doc exports de wit et al 2016 or even both horizontal and vertical carbon fluxes nakayama 2017a or to estimate the doc poc and sediment transfer at daily timescale fabre et al 2019 recently nakhavali et al 2018 implemented the joint uk environment simulator jules model used to evaluate the global c cycle and its role in the earth system le quéré et al 2015 in order to provide a model able to represent the doc processes jules docm from the land to the river e g model integrating a representation of doc production in terrestrial ecosystems based on the incomplete decomposition of organic matter doc decomposition within the soil column and doc export to the river network via leaching at the ecosystem scale the models target the response of the living organisms to the surrounding parameters and they are generally called general ecosystem model gem fitz et al 1996 they have been widely applied for terrestrial ecosystems to simulate the soil organic matter cycling campbell e and paustian 2015 li xia and jian jun 2003 schmidt et al 2011 they are also used to a lesser extent in the aquatic environment most of them were used to simulate vertical dynamics of the biomass nutrients detritus and dynamics of elements including carbon fitz et al 1996 mann et al 2014 prokopkin et al 2010 schmittner et al 2005 models at the microcosmic scale are commonly used to characterize and simulate the interactions between dom and pom he et al 2016a and references therein most of them are only focused on individual dom pom exchange mechanisms one of the options to overcome this limitation will be to develop the exergy theory dewulf et al 2008 in order to establish a unified model that combines all the dom pom exchange mechanisms and will fully simulate the exchange behaviors as suggested by he et al 2016a the ideal case would be to simulate any single microcosmic interaction at a global scale taking account of all the processes involved in the aquatic environment therefore research dedicated to this complementary multidisciplinary approach should be expanded in particular with respect to linking processes operating at a molecular scale to those operating at the global scale jansen et al 2014 all the aforementioned modeling approaches presented still require improvements two directions could be simultaneously taken to overcome all the limitations related to their processes of elaboration and or their uses first the calibration of the models requires to be supported with a higher amount of field data creating a database of the standard measurement in the field including chemical physical hydrological and ecological data over the world would greatly facilitate the establishment of accurate models at the global scale another direction might be to focus our efforts on the microcosmic scale model supported by laboratory experiments e g microcosm and mesocosm experiments to fully characterize the interactions between dom and pom see above and implement this microcosmic mesocosmic models into models at a larger global scale 7 conclusion organic matter is a key component in the local and global carbon cycle and the understanding of this cycle is currently one of the major conundrums in the fields of environmental sciences and biogeochemistry although the organic matter topic was extensively explored over the last decades several research gaps still need to be filled and improvements and or new ideas are required future studies should be done at various structural levels and from diverse perspectives simultaneous studies of both particulate and dissolved om fractions should be prioritized likewise multi disciplinary approaches creation of databases and collaborative works should be the future om research priorities

18577,sulfate radical so4 has been extensively studied as a promising alternative in advanced oxidation processes aops for water treatment however little is known about its reactivity to the ubiquitous dissolved organic matter dom in water bodies so4 would selectively react with electron rich moieties in dom known as chromophoric dom cdom due to its light absorbing property in this study the reactivity and typical structural transformation of cdom with so4 was investigated four well characterized hydrophobic dom fractions extracted from different surface water sources were selected as model cdom so4 was produced through the activation of peroxymonosulfate pms by co ii ions at ph 8 in borate buffer the reactivity of cdom was studied based on the decrease in its ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm uva254 as a function of time the reactivity of cdom changed with time where fast and slow reacting cdoms i e cdomfast and cdomslow were clearly distinguished a second order rate constant of cdomfast with so4 was calculated by plotting uva254 decrease versus pms exposure where a rct value i e ratio of sulfate radical exposure to pms exposure was calculated using pcba as a probe compound the transformation of cdom was studied through the analysis of the changes in uva254 electron donating capacity fluorescence intensity and total organic carbon a transformation pathway leading to a significant carbon removal was proposed this new knowledge on the kinetics and transformation of cdom would ultimately assist in the development and operation of so4 based water treatment processes graphical abstract image 1 keywords sulfate radical cdom reaction kinetics structural transformation carbon removal 1 introduction sulfate radical so4 based advanced oxidation processes aops have gained increasing interest in water treatment at both fundamental and applied levels siegrist et al 2011 wacławek et al 2017 due to its comparable or even stronger oxidizing capabilities than oh so4 is also capable of degrading a broad spectrum of trace organic contaminants torcs e g pharmaceuticals personal care products and industrial chemicals which are constantly detected in water bodies ghauch et al 2017 lutze et al 2015a a strong oxidation capacity together with a high selectivity i e lower scavenging of background organics lutze et al 2015a multiple means of radical generation wang et al 2014 and a favored storage transport of stable solid precursors make so4 a promising alternative for contaminants removal previous studies focusing on the removal of torcs by so4 have provided key mechanistic and kinetic insights yang et al 2017 2019 nihemaiti et al 2018 however little is known about the so4 induced reactivity and transformation of dissolved organic matter i e dom a highly heterogeneous mixture of organic molecules ubiquitous in aquatic environments and playing multiple key roles in water treatment lutze et al 2015a varanasi et al 2018 leenheer and croué 2003 briefly the presence of dom is known to decrease the removal efficiency of torcs due to its radical scavenging effect also dom transformation or removal can control disinfection byproducts formation or membrane fouling by applying so4 based aops as a pretreatment strategy chu et al 2015 xie et al 2015 cheng et al 2017 tian et al 2018 therefore an advanced knowledge on so4 induced reactivity and transformation of dom is crucial to different water treatment processes considering its ubiquitous presence and the promising application of so4 based techniques the reactivity of dom with oxidants such as chlorine ozone and oh has been extensively investigated the difference in reactivity i e faster reaction rate at the initial oxidation phase as compared to subsequent reaction phases of different dom isolates has been previously correlated with their structural variability and complexity chon et al 2015 westerhoff et al 2004 interestingly while oh non selectively reacts with target substances so4 mainly reacts with electron rich aromatic or conjugated double bond moieties varanasi et al 2018 this reactive dom fraction has been termed as chromophoric dissolved organic matter cdom due to its light absorbing property leenheer and croué 2003 lee et al 2006 therefore the degradation rate of cdom as measured by ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm uva254 westerhoff et al 2007 could be used to determine its reactivity to so4 a detailed study on the transformation of dom as a result of its reactivity to so4 remains challenging due to its structural complexity and a lack of analytical techniques alternatively traditional dom characterization techniques could be applied to provide some insights into so4 induced changes of typical dom characteristics e g electron donating capacity edc optical property chromophoric or fluorescent property molecular weight or organic content li et al 2016 wang et al 2017 for instance an investigation on the transformation of dom with oh was conducted by tracking the changes in chromophoric and fluorescent properties sarathy and mohseni 2008 specifically the partial oxidation i e no significant carbon removal of dom led to the breakdown of larger molecules ring open of aromatic structures and the formation of small organics interestingly due to the favorable decarboxylation mechanism driven by so4 a higher dom mineralization would be expected varanasi et al 2018 madhavan et al 1978 to fill this knowledge gap the objective of this study was to investigate the reactivity and transformation of cdom with so4 the reactivity of cdom was studied by following the decrease of its uva254 with time a second order rate constant of fast reacting cdom was calculated based on an established correlation between uva254 and radical exposure by recording the changes in uva254 electron donating capacity edc fluorescence intensity fi and total organic carbon toc information on cdom transformation was obtained a co ii activated peroxymonosulfate pms process was used for the production of so4 due to its high efficiency and simplicity four well characterized hydrophobic dom fractions of different origins and characteristics were selected as model cdom this selection of organic isolates obtained from various sources shaping different characters represents a significant advance compared to model organics used in previous investigations 2 materials and method 2 1 chemical reagents and dom fractions peroxomonosufate oxone khso5 0 5khso4 0 5k2so4 2 2 azinobis 3 ethylbenzothiazoline 6 sulfonic acid diammonium salt abts 98 cobalt ii sulfate 99 0 sodium tetraborate 99 5 ethanol 99 5 and tert butanol pure were purchased from sigma aldrich and prepared with ultrapure water purelab ultra elga sulfuric acid of hplc grade and sodium thiosulfate na2s2o3 were purchased from univar p chlorobenzoic acid pcba acros organics was dissolved in ultrapure water to a concentration of 0 2 mm and used as a stock solution a pms stock solution of a high concentration 10 mm was prepared and kept at 4 c due to its instability the concentration of the stock solution was monitored on a daily basis prior to use four dom fractions previously isolated and characterized were selected for this study hydrophobic acids i e dom adsorbed onto xad 8 resin at acid ph and eluted with sodium hydroxide extracted from suwannee river water s hpoa usa and beaufort reservoir b hpoa france hydrophobic dom i e similar protocol using a mixture of water and acetonitrile for resin elution isolated from ribou reservoir nom r hpo france and colorado river c hpo usa the characteristics of the dom isolates were summarized in table s1 2 2 experimental setup and procedures experiments were conducted in 40 ml amber glass vials with teflon caps a pre determined amount of co ii as well as dom stock solution were added into the 10 mm borate buffer to obtain a final composition of 3 90 0 11 mg c l of dom and 1 μm of co ii at ph 8 instead of phosphate buffer tetraborate was used as a buffer solution due to the reported complexing ability of the former with cobalt a ph 8 buffer was used due to its improved buffering capacity upon the addition of pms at high concentrations the experiments for cdom reaction kinetics were started by introducing 1 mm pms the use of a high initial pms concentration would allow for a study under both low and high pms exposure conditions representative of different water treatment processes ethanol and tert butanol at different concentrations 1 or 10 mm were used as radical quenching agents while pcba 10 μm was used as a model compound to quantify primary reactive species samples were collected at specified time intervals and subjected to immediate measurement of pms residual and uv absorbance at 254 nm uva254 without the addition of quenching agent the value of uva254 was further corrected by subtracting the interferences from borate buffer i e including h2so4 for ph adjustment coso4 and pms also the contribution of pms at each sampling time was calculated based on the residual pms concentration and its ε 254nm measured in this study 12 3 m 1cm 1 for samples subjected to pcba analysis the reaction was stopped by adding 0 1 ml of ethanol 10 m to 0 9 ml of sample sodium thiosulfate was found inefficient in quenching residual pms with concentrations as high as 600 mm in order to avoid the interference of quenchers on electron donating capacity edc measurements a new set of experiments was performed by using various initial pms concentrations i e from 0 00 to 1 00 mm to achieve experimental conditions with different pms exposures pms residual was periodically monitored and all samples were analyzed after complete pms consumption all experiments were performed at room temperature 20 c in glass bottles installed on a rotary shaker ika werke gmbh co kg labortechnik ks250 basic operated at 500 rpm 2 3 analytical methods 2 3 1 analysis of residual pms the concentration of pms was measured by an abts based method described elsewhere zhang et al 2016 in this method abts is generated during the oxidation of abts by sulfate radical produced through the catalytic transformation of pms and then it was spectrophotometrically measured briefly a solution containing 0 5 ml of abts 20 mm 0 2 ml of coso4 20 mm 10 ml of h2so4 2 and 1 ml of water sample was well mixed and measured at a 734 nm wavelength with a spectrophotometer cary 60 agilent the calibration curve for pms determination was shown in fig s1 a high concentration of coso4 20 mm was applied to accelerate the catalytic decomposition of pms however this interference has been taken into consideration with the measurement of a blank sample with no pms addition as suggested by the calibration curve in fig s1 also a background dom would not be influential due to a measurement recorded at 734 nm 2 3 2 characterization of dom transformation the edc of dom samples was analysed based on a method developed by chon et al 2015 briefly a size exclusion chromatography sec coupled with post column reaction was used where abts was produced by the oxidation of abts with sodium persulfate in acidic environment a toyopearl hw 50s column 8 mm 30 cm was selected for sec using a 50 mm borate eluent ph 7 8 at a flow rate of 0 2 ml min the post column injection of abts solution was operated at 0 05 ml min from the helium pressurised generator the reaction coil was connected to two uv detectors positioned in series agilent 1100 series usa the first one recording uv absorbance of dom at 254 nm and the second one recording the signal for abts abts at 405 nm a cary 60 spectrophotometer agilent usa was used to collect absorbance data or to record the uv vis spectra from 200 nm to 800 nm in 1 cm path length quartz cell the toc concentration of each sample was measured with a shimadzu toc l analyser shidmazu japan fluorescence excitation and emission matrices eems were obtained using a fluorescence spectrometer cary eclipse varian the operating parameters were adjusted based on the method from chen et al 2003 briefly the scan rate and excitation or emission slit bandwidth were set at 600 nm min and 5 nm respectively the spectra were recorded by scanning an emission spectra from 290 nm to 550 nm at a 5 nm increment with the excitation wavelength ranging from 220 nm to 400 nm at a 5 nm increment the concentration of pcba was measured with a hplc unit equipped with a uv detector agilent 1100 series usa recording absorbance at 238 nm and with a 250 mm 4 6 mm c18 5 μm reverse phase column alltima grace the mobile phase consisted of 60 methanol and 40 phosphoric acid 0 1 v v the pcba calibration curve was built using gradually diluted stock solution 3 results and discussion 3 1 biphasic decrease of cdom in co ii pms system the reaction of cdom with pms led to an average decrease of 11 in uva254 within 60 min fig s2 however the decrease of uva254 was remarkably faster in the presence of both pms and co ii fig 1 approximately 55 70 decrease in uva254 depending on the dom fraction was observed in co ii catalyzed pms system within 60 min this enhanced reaction was caused by the generation of reactive species e g so4 in the co ii pms system while the slight uva254 decrease in the absence of co ii catalyst was probably due to the reaction of quinones with pms as previously reported zhou et al 2015 the occurrence of quinones within humic substances has been widely acknowledged cory and mcknight 2005 noticeably a fast and slow reaction phase could be distinguished for all dom fractions throughout the oxidation process fig 1 specifically the pseudo first order rate constants of the fast reaction phase were 4 2 6 9 times higher than the rate constants of the slower reaction phase these results showed a significant difference in the reactivity of cdom with so4 due to the heterogeneous structural property of the organic matter isolates it has been previously reported that aromatic structures substituted with electron donating groups i e oh nh3 och3 exhibited higher reactivity to so4 luo et al 2017 these structures could represent the main contributor to the fast reacting cdom i e cdomfast the slow reacting cdom i e cdomslow might include lower electron density moieties from the original cdom constituents as well as the oxidation products of cdomfast xiao et al 2015 zhang et al 2012 the influence of the aromatic character of the dom fractions on their reactivity with so4 was highly expected based on previous findings westerhoff et al 2004 luo et al 2017 however the difference in reactivity among the four dom fractions was more significant during the slow reaction phase the pseudo first order reaction rates of cdomslow i e ln uva254 uva254 0 versus reaction time were calculated as 1 20 10 2 0 84 10 2 0 63 10 2 and 0 46 10 2 min 1 for s hpoa b hpoa r hpo and c hpo respectively these cdomslow reactivities linearly increased with the suva values as shown in fig s3 the cdomfast reactivity to so4 of the four dom fractions was further discussed in the following sections 3 2 evaluation of sulfate radical production anipsitakis and dionysiou 2003 reported the predominant role of so4 eq 1 over oh in co ii catalyzed pms systems at ph 7 because a ph 8 may promote a higher production of oh eq 2 the identification of major oxidizing species in the current system was conducted by following the degradation of pcba as a probe compound under different scavenging conditions lutze et al 2015b the second order rate constants of pcba and radical scavengers i e t buoh and etoh with oh and so4 were summarized in table s3 when 10 mm of radical scavenger i e t buoh or etoh at a molar ratio of 1000 1 versus pcba was applied the pcba removal efficiency was decreased by approximately 10 in the presence of t buoh while almost no pcba decrease was observed with the addition of etoh fig s4 quantitatively the ratio of the measured concentration of oh to so4 was lower than 3 these results indicated that so4 was the predominant reactive species at ph 8 this is probably due to the competition for so4 by either pcba 3 6 108 m 1s 1 or scavengers i e dom fractions up to 108 m 1s 1 as discussed below leading to the unfavorable production of oh eq 2 1 h s o 5 c o 2 s o 4 c o 3 o h 2 s o 4 o h s o 4 o h k s o 4 o h 6 5 10 7 m 1 s 1 3 h s o 5 c o 3 s o 5 c o 2 h therefore the production of so4 was investigated following the rct concept and the analysis of pcba decay rct i e the ratio of radical exposure to oxidant exposure elovitz and von gunten 1999 was used to present the production of so4 with pms exposure eq 4 according to elovitz and von gunten 1999 the consumption of radicals by a probe compound p e g pcba in the current study is considered insignificant as compared to major radical scavengers s e g dom in current study if the probe compound is present at a considerably low concentration i e k p p k s s where k p and k s represents the rate constants of the probe compound and major radical scavengers with radicals respectively therefore a low pcba concentration i e 1 μm was applied to ensure an insignificant radical consumption by pcba as compared to dom specifically k pcba pcba was calculated as approximately 1 4 of k dom dom under the current experimental condition where k pcba and k dom represent the second order rate constants of pcba 3 6 108 m 1s 1 and dom 6 8 103 lmgc 1s 1 with so4 respectively the rct value was only studied for the first 10 min of the reaction cdomfast was observed reactive within this timeframe fig 1 the conversion from reaction time to pms exposure was illustrated in table s4 although no noticeable interference was observed with uva254 or edc measurements the rate of catalytic pms decomposition decreased fig s5 due to the formation of cobalt dom complex for instance a 57 pms decomposition was observed within 60 min in the dom free system however the pms decomposition values for s hpoa b hpoa r hpo and c hpo containing system were 41 43 40 and 43 respectively specifically approximately 80 of co ii was calculated as forming complexes with dom under the current experimental conditions using the nica donnan model with the constants adapted from milne et al 2003 in dom containing solutions with the addition of pcba as probe compound pms decomposed following a pseudo first order reaction fig s6a as described by eq 5 and k i e pseudo first order rate constant was measured as approximately 3 0 10 4s 1 independent of dom origins the influence of pcba addition 1 μm on pms decomposition was negligible for instance the averaged pms residual measured in different dom containing systems within 10 min was 80 in the absence of pcba fig s5 and 79 in the presence of pcba fig s6a the determined rate within 10 min was predominantly contributed by a catalytic decomposition since self decomposition of pms was found negligible within 2 h at room temperature 20 c the degradation of pcba fig s6b caused by so4 was described by eqs 6 and 7 by combining eqs 4 and 5 pcba degradation could be described using the rct concept eq 8 4 r c t 0 t s o 4 dt 0 t p m s dt 5 p m s p m s 0 e k t 6 d p c b a d t k s o 4 p c b a p c b a s o 4 7 ln p c b a p c b a 0 k s o 4 p c b a 0 t s o 4 dt 8 ln p c b a p c b a 0 k s o 4 p c b a r c t p m s 0 0 t e kt dt by plotting ln pcba pcba0 versus pms exposure linear correlations were observed as a function of pms exposures fig 2 the rct value at pms exposures higher than 0 1 m s i e a reaction time of 2 10 min table s4 for each system was determined from the slope of the linear regression line fig 2 and listed in table 1 while the higher rct values at pms exposures lower than 0 1 m s i e a reaction time of 0 2 min table s4 were shown in fig s7 higher rct values at the initial oxidation stage pms exposure 0 1 m s results discussed in section 3 4 1 have also been reported during the ozonation of surface waters elovitz and von gunten 1999 the change of rct in the current study was likely due to the co ii regeneration process specifically the conversion of co ii to co iii with a precipitate formation of the latter has been considered as a probable explanation for the slowing down of the catalytic rate with time at ph above 5 9 zhang and edwards 1992 with a ph of 8 used in this study co iii might have also precipitated out as co oh 3 k sp 1 6 10 44 leading to the retardation of the regeneration process and consequently to a slower so4 production moreover the additional pms consumption during the regeneration of co ii eq 3 which inefficiently produced so5 neta et al 1988 would also lead to a decreased rct a change in co ii catalytic behavior at different ph probably associated with co iii precipitation at higher ph has also been observed in previous studies for instance the degradation rate of 2 4 dcp in co ii pms system slowed down with reaction time at ph 7 anipsitakis et al 2005 while it remained unaffected at ph 2 anipsitakis and dionysiou 2003 considering that no enhanced uva254 decrease explained in section 3 4 1 was observed fig 1 in contrast to the significantly higher pcba degradation fig s6b at the initial oxidation stage i e pms exposure lower than 0 1 m s the relatively lower rct values table 1 determined after the initial short stage were used in the analysis of the following section 3 3 reactivity of cdomfast to so4 and its application following the procedures for establishing a relationship between ln pcba pcba0 and pms exposure eq 8 i e obtained by combining eq 4 eq 5 and eq 7 a similar correlation was also established between ln uva254 uva254 0 of cdomfast and pms exposure eq 9 this correlation was found linear when ln uva254 uva254 0 of cdomfast was plotted against pms exposure for all dom fractions fig 3 the good linearity allowed the calculation of the reaction rate constant of cdomfast with so4 using the rct value determined in section 3 2 9 ln u v a 254 u v a 254 0 k s o 4 c d o m r c t p m s 0 0 t e kt dt interestingly the reaction rate constants of cdomfast for all dom fractions were at the same order of magnitude the highest cdomfast value was recorded for s hpoa 4 59 108 m 1s 1 also exhibiting the highest suva 4 78 the lowest cdomfast value was observed for c hpo 1 99 108 m 1s 1 also showing lowest suva 2 14 however b hpoa suva 4 06 showed a lower k value than r hpo suva 3 22 i e 3 04 108 m 1s 1 versus 3 48 108 m 1s 1 respectively therefore the correlation between the reactivity of cdomfast and suva of the corresponding dom fraction would need additional investigation by including a larger pool of dom fractions these reaction rate constants were one order of magnitude higher than the data previously reported i e 107mc 1s 1 for instance lutz et al 2015a observed a rate of 6 8 103 lmgc 1s 1 for humic acid depur from carl roth using an indirect kinetic competition method while zhou et al 2017 recorded a rate of 1 86 103 lmgc 1s 1 for suwannee river fulvic acid using a direct laser flash photolysis method the difference could be attributed to the fact that the value in this study was only measured for the conceptually isolated fast reacting moieties i e cdomfast rather than for the bulk dom i e a combination of both fast and slow reacting moieties however the value was one order of magnitude lower than those reported for aromatic compounds 109 m 1s 1 neta et al 1977 fischer and radom 2001 this difference would be the result of stronger electrosteric repulsion between so4 and structurally complex dom as compared to simpler organic compounds the higher reactivity of sulfate radicals to cdomfast than to oh 107m 1s 1 was expected to lead to an insignificant production of oh eq 2 due to its unfavorable formation kinetics in addition cdomfast would be preferred to bulk dom when evaluating the scavenging property of dissolved organic matter in so4 based aops under lower pms exposures where cdomfast was the major reactive moieties fig 1 the use of uva254 as a surrogate indicator for the assessment of torcs removal efficiency has been extensively studied in ozone and oh based aops gerrity et al 2012 rosario ortiz et al 2010 li et al 2017 this finding could also support its application in so4 based water treatment processes the study on torcs removal efficiency could be achieved using either i the kinetics with second order reaction constants of torcs and radical exposure eq 10 or ii the correlation established between uva254 decrease and contaminants removal eq 11 10 ln t orcs t orcs 0 k s o 4 t rocs 0 t s o 4 dt k s o 4 t rocs ln u v a 254 u v a 254 0 k s o 4 cdom 11 ln t orcs t orcs 0 s l o p e ln u v a 254 u v a 254 0 i n t e r c e p t as compared to the direct measurement of torcs in a full scale water treatment plant the indirect monitoring of uv absorbing parameters using spectrophotometer would require lower capital operating cost as well as time input especially with the use of an on line spectrophotometer a quick track of the oxidation efficiency and consequently a rapid adjustment i e oxidant dose or contact time could also be expected however different correlation models should be established for different torcs due to the discrepancy in their reactivity the successful application of this correlation could also be impacted by the fluctuation of water matrices e g hco3 no3 or cl or temperature due to seasonal changes the use of uv absorbing indices of humic substances in combination with their fluorescence properties has also been suggested as indicators in ozone based water treatment processes li et al 2017 however similar decreasing trend was observed in the current study between uva254 and fluorescence intensity with increasing pms concentration text s1 consequently the uva254 parameter was sufficient as a single process indicator in this so4 based oxidation system 3 4 sulfate radical induced cdom transformation 3 4 1 edc decrease as a function of pms exposures electron donating capacity edc associated with the presence of phenolic structures with different degree of substitution has been previously reported for aquatic humic substances aeschbacher et al 2012 the change in edc fig s8 was studied for each dom fraction under various pms exposures the different pms exposures were obtained by applying varying initial pms concentrations for the same contact time i e 20 h and the calculation of the pms exposures was detailed in text s2 si in addition the changes in normalized edc and uva254 fig s9 of the four dom fractions were plotted in fig 4 this figure shows that for pms exposures lower than 0 1 m s area a1 an average of 54 decrease of edc was recorded when only a 30 decrease of uva254 was observed for pms exposures higher than 0 1 m s area b the averaged normalized uva254 decreased from 70 to 13 i e a 57 decrease whereas the averaged normalized edc decreased from 46 to 7 i e a 39 decrease the larger decrease of edc than uva254 at pms exposure lower than 0 1 m s in this system indicated that the initial phase of so4 reaction was the oxidation of phenolics into quinone type structures with similar chromophoric properties ramseier and gunten 2009 this reaction is thermodynamically favourable considering the very low oxidation potential of phenolic structures 0 153 0 620 v bortolomeazzi et al 2007 and the strong reduction potential of sulfate radicals 2 5 3 1v anipsitakis and dionysiou 2003 a similar observation has been previously reported during the treatment of humic substances by clo2 or hclo where hydroquinone or catechol moieties i e major edc contributors chon et al 2015 were proposed as oxidized by hclo through electron transfer rather than electrophilic substitution wenk et al 2013 interestingly a more pronounced decrease in edc than in uva254 was observed with a pms exposure lower than 0 01 m s area a0 fig 4 which was probably caused by the relatively higher rct observed under this condition fig s7 due to a major so4 consumption by the moieties with edc at the initial oxidation phase i e pms exposure 0 1 m s a uva254 decrease was not enhanced even under higher radical exposure i e higher rct fig 3 this result supported the selection of lower rct values fig 2 in the calculation of the second order rate constants of cdomfast with so4 as described in section 3 3 3 4 2 toc removal efficiency at various pms exposures in order to further explore the transformation of cdom by sulfate radicals the toc content of the solution under different pms exposures was measured a significant toc removal 64 63 56 49 for s hpoa b hpoa r hpo and c hpo respectively i e 58 in average was observed under a pms exposure of 8 04 m s fig s10 the relationship between uva254 decrease and toc removal was established and shown in fig 5 interestingly the toc removal was minor i e less 10 during the depletion of the uv absorbance of cdomfast i e uva254 decrease within 50 as indicated by the red dashed line in fig 5 however the decrease in the chromophoric property of cdomslow i e observed when uva254 decrease was larger than 50 right side of the red dashed line in fig 5 led to a considerable toc removal these results indicated that the reaction of cdomfast would mainly lead to the breakdown of complex aromatic structures into small molecular weight fractions with insignificant mineralization this transformation from larger molecules to smaller ones was evidenced by the blue shift or band contraction chen et al 2002 in fluorescence emission spectra fig 6 specifically the decrease in the bandwidth at 1 2 maximum fluorescence intensity was calculated as 24 nm 24 nm 33 nm and 88 nm for s hpoa b hpoa r hpo and c hpo respectively in contrast the reaction of cdomslow would mainly undergo through decarboxylation which directly led to the observed carbon removal interestingly a good linearity between uva254 decrease and toc removal during the cdomslow decrease was observed fig 5 these results indicated that the change in cdomslow could be used in the prediction of toc removal for surface water during so4 based treatment this may include water treatment processes targeting the removal of organics e g pretreatment for the removal of disinfection byproducts precursors or membranes foulants membrane cleaning and the treatment of reverse osmosis concentrates nevertheless under different water matrices this correlation might be affected by ph conditions or the presence of radical scavengers hco3 or cl 3 4 3 evolution of cdom transformation with sulfate radical based on the findings of this study i e results obtained with the current characterization techniques the evolution of the transformation of cdom by sulfate radicals was summarized in fig 7 the so4 induced reaction of cdomfast i e electron donating group substituted aromatic structures was mainly initiated through single electron transfer or addition the depletion of edc would initially take place through the electron transfer from phenolic hydroxyl groups to sulfate radical as suggested by reaction 1 reaction 2 would produce hydroxylated c centered radical cations and consequently lead to the formation of ring cleavage products anipsitakis et al 2006 remarkably reaction 4 would take place due to the high electron density at r3 site leading to the formation of smaller fluorescent molecules as suggested by the blue shift of fluorescence emission spectra fig 6 the production of smaller molecules from complex structures could also be evidenced by the increased fluorescence signal fig s13 at lower pms exposure as the smaller aromatic moieties would be more fluorescent due to weaker intramolecular quenching effect the decarboxylation of carboxyl groups reaction 3 i e newly formed or originally incorporated within dom structures would be the main reaction mechanism of cdomslow transformation madhavan et al 1978 leading to a significant removal of toc however a more detailed study would be highly recommended for the optimization of process conditions for maximum carbon removal 4 conclusions the current study provided systematic information on both the reactivity and fate of cdom with sulfate radical dom fractions with different origins and characteristics were used in this investigation the main conclusions included fast and slow reacting cdom could be distinguished within all dom fractions interestingly the difference in the reactivity of cdomfast among different organics were minor while the reactivity cdomslow were observed to increase with suva the reactivity of cdomfast to so4 was calculated at an order of 108 m 1s 1 from the observed linear correlation between cdomfast decrease and sulfate radical exposure the correlation also validated the potential application of uva254 as a surrogate indicator for torcs removal efficiency a faster decrease of edc than uva254 at lower pms exposure indicated a preferred oxidation of phenolic structures i e preferential decrease of electron donating capacity afterwards the oxidation of cdomfast would proceed with the formation of transient intermediates and ring cleavage products the transformation products of cdomfast together with the originally less reactive structures i e cdomslow would undergo slow decarboxylation leading to a significant carbon removal the linear relationship recorded between cdomslow reduction and toc removal could be used to predict carbon removal the findings in this work would highly assist in the design and operation of so4 based water treatment processes specifically the scavenging capacity of background dom could be better evaluated using the calculated reactivity of cdomfast if the applied pms exposure would mainly cause changes in cdomfast also the correlation established between cdom and radical exposure would shed light on the applicability of uva254 as an indicator of torcs removal efficiency in so4 based water treatment processes however further site specific studies on the use of uva254 as an indicator are highly needed for its successful application so4 based advanced oxidation technique could be developed to address the need for dom removal in varying water treatment scenarios e g pretreatment for the removal of disinfection by products precursors or membrane foulants application of catalytic membrane for organic fouling mitigation membrane cleaning or the treatment of reverse osmosis concentrate produced from reclaimed water treatment plants also an increased pms dose could be applied to increase the reaction rate of cdomslow and consequently increase carbon removal in addition carbon removal efficiency could be simply estimated based on the removal of cdomslow due to the observed good correlation declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

18577,sulfate radical so4 has been extensively studied as a promising alternative in advanced oxidation processes aops for water treatment however little is known about its reactivity to the ubiquitous dissolved organic matter dom in water bodies so4 would selectively react with electron rich moieties in dom known as chromophoric dom cdom due to its light absorbing property in this study the reactivity and typical structural transformation of cdom with so4 was investigated four well characterized hydrophobic dom fractions extracted from different surface water sources were selected as model cdom so4 was produced through the activation of peroxymonosulfate pms by co ii ions at ph 8 in borate buffer the reactivity of cdom was studied based on the decrease in its ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm uva254 as a function of time the reactivity of cdom changed with time where fast and slow reacting cdoms i e cdomfast and cdomslow were clearly distinguished a second order rate constant of cdomfast with so4 was calculated by plotting uva254 decrease versus pms exposure where a rct value i e ratio of sulfate radical exposure to pms exposure was calculated using pcba as a probe compound the transformation of cdom was studied through the analysis of the changes in uva254 electron donating capacity fluorescence intensity and total organic carbon a transformation pathway leading to a significant carbon removal was proposed this new knowledge on the kinetics and transformation of cdom would ultimately assist in the development and operation of so4 based water treatment processes graphical abstract image 1 keywords sulfate radical cdom reaction kinetics structural transformation carbon removal 1 introduction sulfate radical so4 based advanced oxidation processes aops have gained increasing interest in water treatment at both fundamental and applied levels siegrist et al 2011 wacławek et al 2017 due to its comparable or even stronger oxidizing capabilities than oh so4 is also capable of degrading a broad spectrum of trace organic contaminants torcs e g pharmaceuticals personal care products and industrial chemicals which are constantly detected in water bodies ghauch et al 2017 lutze et al 2015a a strong oxidation capacity together with a high selectivity i e lower scavenging of background organics lutze et al 2015a multiple means of radical generation wang et al 2014 and a favored storage transport of stable solid precursors make so4 a promising alternative for contaminants removal previous studies focusing on the removal of torcs by so4 have provided key mechanistic and kinetic insights yang et al 2017 2019 nihemaiti et al 2018 however little is known about the so4 induced reactivity and transformation of dissolved organic matter i e dom a highly heterogeneous mixture of organic molecules ubiquitous in aquatic environments and playing multiple key roles in water treatment lutze et al 2015a varanasi et al 2018 leenheer and croué 2003 briefly the presence of dom is known to decrease the removal efficiency of torcs due to its radical scavenging effect also dom transformation or removal can control disinfection byproducts formation or membrane fouling by applying so4 based aops as a pretreatment strategy chu et al 2015 xie et al 2015 cheng et al 2017 tian et al 2018 therefore an advanced knowledge on so4 induced reactivity and transformation of dom is crucial to different water treatment processes considering its ubiquitous presence and the promising application of so4 based techniques the reactivity of dom with oxidants such as chlorine ozone and oh has been extensively investigated the difference in reactivity i e faster reaction rate at the initial oxidation phase as compared to subsequent reaction phases of different dom isolates has been previously correlated with their structural variability and complexity chon et al 2015 westerhoff et al 2004 interestingly while oh non selectively reacts with target substances so4 mainly reacts with electron rich aromatic or conjugated double bond moieties varanasi et al 2018 this reactive dom fraction has been termed as chromophoric dissolved organic matter cdom due to its light absorbing property leenheer and croué 2003 lee et al 2006 therefore the degradation rate of cdom as measured by ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm uva254 westerhoff et al 2007 could be used to determine its reactivity to so4 a detailed study on the transformation of dom as a result of its reactivity to so4 remains challenging due to its structural complexity and a lack of analytical techniques alternatively traditional dom characterization techniques could be applied to provide some insights into so4 induced changes of typical dom characteristics e g electron donating capacity edc optical property chromophoric or fluorescent property molecular weight or organic content li et al 2016 wang et al 2017 for instance an investigation on the transformation of dom with oh was conducted by tracking the changes in chromophoric and fluorescent properties sarathy and mohseni 2008 specifically the partial oxidation i e no significant carbon removal of dom led to the breakdown of larger molecules ring open of aromatic structures and the formation of small organics interestingly due to the favorable decarboxylation mechanism driven by so4 a higher dom mineralization would be expected varanasi et al 2018 madhavan et al 1978 to fill this knowledge gap the objective of this study was to investigate the reactivity and transformation of cdom with so4 the reactivity of cdom was studied by following the decrease of its uva254 with time a second order rate constant of fast reacting cdom was calculated based on an established correlation between uva254 and radical exposure by recording the changes in uva254 electron donating capacity edc fluorescence intensity fi and total organic carbon toc information on cdom transformation was obtained a co ii activated peroxymonosulfate pms process was used for the production of so4 due to its high efficiency and simplicity four well characterized hydrophobic dom fractions of different origins and characteristics were selected as model cdom this selection of organic isolates obtained from various sources shaping different characters represents a significant advance compared to model organics used in previous investigations 2 materials and method 2 1 chemical reagents and dom fractions peroxomonosufate oxone khso5 0 5khso4 0 5k2so4 2 2 azinobis 3 ethylbenzothiazoline 6 sulfonic acid diammonium salt abts 98 cobalt ii sulfate 99 0 sodium tetraborate 99 5 ethanol 99 5 and tert butanol pure were purchased from sigma aldrich and prepared with ultrapure water purelab ultra elga sulfuric acid of hplc grade and sodium thiosulfate na2s2o3 were purchased from univar p chlorobenzoic acid pcba acros organics was dissolved in ultrapure water to a concentration of 0 2 mm and used as a stock solution a pms stock solution of a high concentration 10 mm was prepared and kept at 4 c due to its instability the concentration of the stock solution was monitored on a daily basis prior to use four dom fractions previously isolated and characterized were selected for this study hydrophobic acids i e dom adsorbed onto xad 8 resin at acid ph and eluted with sodium hydroxide extracted from suwannee river water s hpoa usa and beaufort reservoir b hpoa france hydrophobic dom i e similar protocol using a mixture of water and acetonitrile for resin elution isolated from ribou reservoir nom r hpo france and colorado river c hpo usa the characteristics of the dom isolates were summarized in table s1 2 2 experimental setup and procedures experiments were conducted in 40 ml amber glass vials with teflon caps a pre determined amount of co ii as well as dom stock solution were added into the 10 mm borate buffer to obtain a final composition of 3 90 0 11 mg c l of dom and 1 μm of co ii at ph 8 instead of phosphate buffer tetraborate was used as a buffer solution due to the reported complexing ability of the former with cobalt a ph 8 buffer was used due to its improved buffering capacity upon the addition of pms at high concentrations the experiments for cdom reaction kinetics were started by introducing 1 mm pms the use of a high initial pms concentration would allow for a study under both low and high pms exposure conditions representative of different water treatment processes ethanol and tert butanol at different concentrations 1 or 10 mm were used as radical quenching agents while pcba 10 μm was used as a model compound to quantify primary reactive species samples were collected at specified time intervals and subjected to immediate measurement of pms residual and uv absorbance at 254 nm uva254 without the addition of quenching agent the value of uva254 was further corrected by subtracting the interferences from borate buffer i e including h2so4 for ph adjustment coso4 and pms also the contribution of pms at each sampling time was calculated based on the residual pms concentration and its ε 254nm measured in this study 12 3 m 1cm 1 for samples subjected to pcba analysis the reaction was stopped by adding 0 1 ml of ethanol 10 m to 0 9 ml of sample sodium thiosulfate was found inefficient in quenching residual pms with concentrations as high as 600 mm in order to avoid the interference of quenchers on electron donating capacity edc measurements a new set of experiments was performed by using various initial pms concentrations i e from 0 00 to 1 00 mm to achieve experimental conditions with different pms exposures pms residual was periodically monitored and all samples were analyzed after complete pms consumption all experiments were performed at room temperature 20 c in glass bottles installed on a rotary shaker ika werke gmbh co kg labortechnik ks250 basic operated at 500 rpm 2 3 analytical methods 2 3 1 analysis of residual pms the concentration of pms was measured by an abts based method described elsewhere zhang et al 2016 in this method abts is generated during the oxidation of abts by sulfate radical produced through the catalytic transformation of pms and then it was spectrophotometrically measured briefly a solution containing 0 5 ml of abts 20 mm 0 2 ml of coso4 20 mm 10 ml of h2so4 2 and 1 ml of water sample was well mixed and measured at a 734 nm wavelength with a spectrophotometer cary 60 agilent the calibration curve for pms determination was shown in fig s1 a high concentration of coso4 20 mm was applied to accelerate the catalytic decomposition of pms however this interference has been taken into consideration with the measurement of a blank sample with no pms addition as suggested by the calibration curve in fig s1 also a background dom would not be influential due to a measurement recorded at 734 nm 2 3 2 characterization of dom transformation the edc of dom samples was analysed based on a method developed by chon et al 2015 briefly a size exclusion chromatography sec coupled with post column reaction was used where abts was produced by the oxidation of abts with sodium persulfate in acidic environment a toyopearl hw 50s column 8 mm 30 cm was selected for sec using a 50 mm borate eluent ph 7 8 at a flow rate of 0 2 ml min the post column injection of abts solution was operated at 0 05 ml min from the helium pressurised generator the reaction coil was connected to two uv detectors positioned in series agilent 1100 series usa the first one recording uv absorbance of dom at 254 nm and the second one recording the signal for abts abts at 405 nm a cary 60 spectrophotometer agilent usa was used to collect absorbance data or to record the uv vis spectra from 200 nm to 800 nm in 1 cm path length quartz cell the toc concentration of each sample was measured with a shimadzu toc l analyser shidmazu japan fluorescence excitation and emission matrices eems were obtained using a fluorescence spectrometer cary eclipse varian the operating parameters were adjusted based on the method from chen et al 2003 briefly the scan rate and excitation or emission slit bandwidth were set at 600 nm min and 5 nm respectively the spectra were recorded by scanning an emission spectra from 290 nm to 550 nm at a 5 nm increment with the excitation wavelength ranging from 220 nm to 400 nm at a 5 nm increment the concentration of pcba was measured with a hplc unit equipped with a uv detector agilent 1100 series usa recording absorbance at 238 nm and with a 250 mm 4 6 mm c18 5 μm reverse phase column alltima grace the mobile phase consisted of 60 methanol and 40 phosphoric acid 0 1 v v the pcba calibration curve was built using gradually diluted stock solution 3 results and discussion 3 1 biphasic decrease of cdom in co ii pms system the reaction of cdom with pms led to an average decrease of 11 in uva254 within 60 min fig s2 however the decrease of uva254 was remarkably faster in the presence of both pms and co ii fig 1 approximately 55 70 decrease in uva254 depending on the dom fraction was observed in co ii catalyzed pms system within 60 min this enhanced reaction was caused by the generation of reactive species e g so4 in the co ii pms system while the slight uva254 decrease in the absence of co ii catalyst was probably due to the reaction of quinones with pms as previously reported zhou et al 2015 the occurrence of quinones within humic substances has been widely acknowledged cory and mcknight 2005 noticeably a fast and slow reaction phase could be distinguished for all dom fractions throughout the oxidation process fig 1 specifically the pseudo first order rate constants of the fast reaction phase were 4 2 6 9 times higher than the rate constants of the slower reaction phase these results showed a significant difference in the reactivity of cdom with so4 due to the heterogeneous structural property of the organic matter isolates it has been previously reported that aromatic structures substituted with electron donating groups i e oh nh3 och3 exhibited higher reactivity to so4 luo et al 2017 these structures could represent the main contributor to the fast reacting cdom i e cdomfast the slow reacting cdom i e cdomslow might include lower electron density moieties from the original cdom constituents as well as the oxidation products of cdomfast xiao et al 2015 zhang et al 2012 the influence of the aromatic character of the dom fractions on their reactivity with so4 was highly expected based on previous findings westerhoff et al 2004 luo et al 2017 however the difference in reactivity among the four dom fractions was more significant during the slow reaction phase the pseudo first order reaction rates of cdomslow i e ln uva254 uva254 0 versus reaction time were calculated as 1 20 10 2 0 84 10 2 0 63 10 2 and 0 46 10 2 min 1 for s hpoa b hpoa r hpo and c hpo respectively these cdomslow reactivities linearly increased with the suva values as shown in fig s3 the cdomfast reactivity to so4 of the four dom fractions was further discussed in the following sections 3 2 evaluation of sulfate radical production anipsitakis and dionysiou 2003 reported the predominant role of so4 eq 1 over oh in co ii catalyzed pms systems at ph 7 because a ph 8 may promote a higher production of oh eq 2 the identification of major oxidizing species in the current system was conducted by following the degradation of pcba as a probe compound under different scavenging conditions lutze et al 2015b the second order rate constants of pcba and radical scavengers i e t buoh and etoh with oh and so4 were summarized in table s3 when 10 mm of radical scavenger i e t buoh or etoh at a molar ratio of 1000 1 versus pcba was applied the pcba removal efficiency was decreased by approximately 10 in the presence of t buoh while almost no pcba decrease was observed with the addition of etoh fig s4 quantitatively the ratio of the measured concentration of oh to so4 was lower than 3 these results indicated that so4 was the predominant reactive species at ph 8 this is probably due to the competition for so4 by either pcba 3 6 108 m 1s 1 or scavengers i e dom fractions up to 108 m 1s 1 as discussed below leading to the unfavorable production of oh eq 2 1 h s o 5 c o 2 s o 4 c o 3 o h 2

ratio of radical exposure to oxidant exposure elovitz and von gunten 1999 was used to present the production of so4 with pms exposure eq 4 according to elovitz and von gunten 1999 the consumption of radicals by a probe compound p e g pcba in the current study is considered insignificant as compared to major radical scavengers s e g dom in current study if the probe compound is present at a considerably low concentration i e k p p k s s where k p and k s represents the rate constants of the probe compound and major radical scavengers with radicals respectively therefore a low pcba concentration i e 1 μm was applied to ensure an insignificant radical consumption by pcba as compared to dom specifically k pcba pcba was calculated as approximately 1 4 of k dom dom under the current experimental condition where k pcba and k dom represent the second order rate constants of pcba 3 6 108 m 1s 1 and dom 6 8 103 lmgc 1s 1 with so4 respectively the rct value was only studied for the first 10 min of the reaction cdomfast was observed reactive within this timeframe fig 1 the conversion from reaction time to pms exposure was illustrated in table s4 although no noticeable interference was observed with uva254 or edc measurements the rate of catalytic pms decomposition decreased fig s5 due to the formation of cobalt dom complex for instance a 57 pms decomposition was observed within 60 min in the dom free system however the pms decomposition values for s hpoa b hpoa r hpo and c hpo containing system were 41 43 40 and 43 respectively specifically approximately 80 of co ii was calculated as forming complexes with dom under the current experimental conditions using the nica donnan model with the constants adapted from milne et al 2003 in dom containing solutions with the addition of pcba as probe compound pms decomposed following a pseudo first order reaction fig s6a as described by eq 5 and k i e pseudo first order rate constant was measured as approximately 3 0 10 4s 1 independent of dom origins the influence of pcba addition 1 μm on pms decomposition was negligible for instance the averaged pms residual measured in different dom containing systems within 10 min was 80 in the absence of pcba fig s5 and 79 in the presence of pcba fig s6a the determined rate within 10 min was predominantly contributed by a catalytic decomposition since self decomposition of pms was found negligible within 2 h at room temperature 20 c the degradation of pcba fig s6b caused by so4 was described by eqs 6 and 7 by combining eqs 4 and 5 pcba degradation could be described using the rct concept eq 8 4 r c t 0 t s o 4 dt 0 t p m s dt 5 p m s p m s 0 e k t 6 d p c b a d t k s o 4 p c b a p c b a s o 4 7 ln p c b a p c b a 0 k s o 4 p c b a 0 t s o 4 dt 8 ln p

exposures higher than 0 1 m s i e a reaction time of 2 10 min table s4 for each system was determined from the slope of the linear regression line fig 2 and listed in table 1 while the higher rct values at pms exposures lower than 0 1 m s i e a reaction time of 0 2 min table s4 were shown in fig s7 higher rct values at the initial oxidation stage pms exposure 0 1 m s results discussed in section 3 4 1 have also been reported during the ozonation of surface waters elovitz and von gunten 1999 the change of rct in the current study was likely due to the co ii regeneration process specifically the conversion of co ii to co iii with a precipitate formation of the latter has been considered as a probable explanation for the slowing down of the catalytic rate with time at ph above 5 9 zhang and edwards 1992 with a ph of 8 used in this study co iii might have also precipitated out as co oh 3 k sp 1 6 10 44 leading to the retardation of the regeneration process and consequently to a slower so4 production moreover the additional pms consumption during the regeneration of co ii eq 3 which inefficiently produced so5 neta et al 1988 would also lead to a decreased rct a change in co ii catalytic behavior at different ph probably associated with co iii precipitation at higher ph has also been observed in previous studies for instance the degradation rate of 2 4 dcp in co ii pms system slowed down with reaction time at ph 7 anipsitakis et al 2005 while it remained unaffected at ph 2 anipsitakis and dionysiou 2003 considering that no enhanced uva254 decrease explained in section 3 4 1 was observed fig 1 in contrast to the significantly higher pcba degradation fig s6b at the initial oxidation stage i e pms exposure lower than 0 1 m s the relatively lower rct values table 1 determined after the initial short stage were used in the analysis of the following section 3 3 reactivity of cdomfast to so4 and its application following the procedures for establishing a relationship between ln pcba pcba0 and pms exposure eq 8 i e obtained by combining eq 4 eq 5 and eq 7 a similar correlation was also established between ln uva254 uva254 0 of cdomfast and pms exposure eq 9 this correlation was found linear when ln uva254 uva254 0 of cdomfast was plotted against pms exposure for all dom fractions fig 3 the good linearity allowed the calculation of the reaction rate constant of cdomfast with so4 using the rct value determined in section 3 2 9 ln u v a 254 u v a 254 0 k s o 4 c d o m r c t p m s 0 0 t e kt dt interestingly the reaction rate constants of cdomfast for all dom fractions were at the same order of magnitude the highest cdomfast value was recorded for s hpoa 4 59 108 m 1s 1 also exhibiting the highest suva 4 78 the lowest cdomfast value was observed for c hpo 1 99 108 m 1s 1 also showing lowest suva 2 14 however b hpoa suva 4 06 showed a lower k value than r hpo suva 3 22 i e 3 04 108 m 1s 1 versus 3 48 108 m 1s 1 respectively therefore the correlation between the reactivity of cdomfast and suva of the corresponding dom fraction would need additional investigation by including a larger pool of dom fractions these reaction rate constants were one order of magnitude higher than the data previously reported i e 107mc 1s 1 for instance lutz et al 2015a observed a rate of 6 8 103 lmgc 1s 1 for humic acid depur from carl roth using an indirect kinetic competition method while zhou et al 2017 recorded a rate of 1 86 103 lmgc 1s 1 for suwannee river fulvic acid using a direct laser flash photolysis method the difference could be attributed to the fact that the value in this study was only measured for the conceptually isolated fast reacting moieties i e cdomfast rather than for the bulk dom i e a combination of both fast and slow reacting moieties however the value was one order of magnitude lower than those reported for aromatic compounds 109 m 1s 1 neta et al 1977 fischer and radom 2001 this difference would be the result of stronger electrosteric repulsion between so4 and structurally complex dom as compared to simpler organic compounds the higher reactivity of sulfate radicals to cdomfast than to oh 107m 1s 1 was expected to lead to an insignificant production of oh eq 2 due to its unfavorable formation kinetics in addition cdomfast would be preferred to bulk dom when evaluating the scavenging property of dissolved organic matter in so4 based aops under lower pms exposures where cdomfast was the major reactive moieties fig 1 the use of uva254 as a surrogate indicator for the assessment of torcs removal efficiency has been extensively studied in ozone and oh based aops gerrity et al 2012 rosario ortiz et al 2010 li et al 2017 this finding could also support its application in so4 based water treatment processes the study on torcs removal efficiency could be achieved using either i the kinetics with second order reaction constants of torcs and radical exposure eq 10 or ii the correlation established between uva254 decrease and contaminants removal eq 11 10 ln t orcs t orcs 0 k s o 4 t rocs 0 t s o 4 dt k s o 4 t rocs ln u v a 254 u v a 254 0 k s o 4 cdom 11 ln t orcs t orcs 0 s l o p e ln u v a 254 u v a 254 0 i n t e r c e p t as compared to the direct measurement of torcs in a full scale water treatment plant the indirect monitoring of uv absorbing parameters using spectrophotometer would require lower capital operating cost as well as time input especially with the use of an on line spectrophotometer a quick track of the oxidation efficiency and consequently a rapid adjustment i e oxidant dose or contact time could also be expected however different correlation models should be established for different torcs due to the discrepancy in their reactivity the successful application of this correlation could also be impacted by the fluctuation of water matrices e g hco3 no3 or cl or temperature due to seasonal changes the use of uv absorbing indices of humic substances in combination with their fluorescence properties has also been suggested as indicators in ozone based water treatment processes li et al 2017 however similar decreasing trend was observed in the current study between uva254 and fluorescence intensity with increasing pms concentration text s1 consequently the uva254 parameter was sufficient as a single process indicator in this so4 based oxidation system 3 4 sulfate radical induced cdom transformation 3 4 1 edc decrease as a function of pms exposures electron donating capacity edc associated with the presence of phenolic structures with different degree of substitution has been previously reported for aquatic humic substances aeschbacher et al 2012 the change in edc fig s8 was studied for each dom fraction under various pms exposures the different pms exposures were obtained by applying varying initial pms concentrations for the same contact time i e 20 h and the calculation of the pms exposures was detailed in text s2 si in addition the changes in normalized edc and uva254 fig s9 of the four dom fractions were plotted in fig 4 this figure shows that for pms exposures lower than 0 1 m s area a1 an average of 54 decrease of edc was recorded when only a 30 decrease of uva254 was observed for pms exposures higher than 0 1 m s area b the averaged normalized uva254 decreased from 70 to 13 i e a 57 decrease whereas the averaged normalized edc decreased from 46 to 7 i e a 39 decrease the larger decrease of edc than uva254 at pms exposure lower than 0 1 m s in this system indicated that the initial phase of so4 reaction was the oxidation of phenolics into quinone type structures with similar chromophoric properties ramseier and gunten 2009 this reaction is thermodynamically favourable considering the very low oxidation potential of phenolic structures 0 153 0 620 v bortolomeazzi et al 2007 and the strong reduction potential of sulfate radicals 2 5 3 1v anipsitakis and dionysiou 2003 a similar observation has been previously reported during the treatment of humic substances by clo2 or hclo where hydroquinone or catechol moieties i e major edc contributors chon et al 2015 were proposed as oxidized by hclo through electron transfer rather than electrophilic substitution wenk et al 2013 interestingly a more pronounced decrease in edc than in uva254 was observed with a pms exposure lower than 0 01 m s area a0 fig 4 which was probably caused by the relatively higher rct observed under this condition fig s7 due to a major so4 consumption by the moieties with edc at the initial oxidation phase i e pms exposure 0 1 m s a uva254 decrease was not enhanced even under higher radical exposure i e higher rct fig 3 this result supported the selection of lower rct values fig 2 in the calculation of the second order rate constants of cdomfast with so4 as described in section 3 3 3 4 2 toc removal efficiency at various pms exposures in order to further explore the transformation of cdom by sulfate radicals the toc content of the solution under different pms exposures was measured a significant toc removal 64 63 56 49 for s hpoa b hpoa r hpo and c hpo respectively i e 58 in average was observed under a pms exposure of 8 04 m s fig s10 the relationship between uva254 decrease and toc removal was established and shown in fig 5 interestingly the toc removal was minor i e less 10 during the depletion of the uv absorbance of cdomfast i e uva254 decrease within 50 as indicated by the red dashed line in fig 5 however the decrease in the chromophoric property of cdomslow i e observed when uva254 decrease was larger than 50 right side of the red dashed line in fig 5 led to a considerable toc removal these results indicated that the reaction of cdomfast would mainly lead to the breakdown of complex aromatic structures into small molecular weight fractions with insignificant mineralization this transformation from larger molecules to smaller ones was evidenced by the blue shift or band contraction chen et al 2002 in fluorescence emission spectra fig 6 specifically the decrease in the bandwidth at 1 2 maximum fluorescence intensity was calculated as 24 nm 24 nm 33 nm and 88 nm for s hpoa b hpoa r hpo and c hpo respectively in contrast the reaction of cdomslow would mainly undergo through decarboxylation which directly led to the observed carbon removal interestingly a good linearity between uva254 decrease and toc removal during the cdomslow decrease was observed fig 5 these results indicated that the change in cdomslow could be used in the prediction of toc removal for surface water during so4 based treatment this may include water treatment processes targeting the removal of organics e g pretreatment for the removal of disinfection byproducts precursors or membranes foulants membrane cleaning and the treatment of reverse osmosis concentrates nevertheless under different water matrices this correlation might be affected by ph conditions or the presence of radical scavengers hco3 or cl 3 4 3 evolution of cdom transformation with sulfate radical based on the findings of this study i e results obtained with the current characterization techniques the evolution of the transformation of cdom by sulfate radicals was summarized in fig 7 the so4 induced reaction of cdomfast i e electron donating group substituted aromatic structures was mainly initiated through single electron transfer or addition the depletion of edc would initially take place through the electron transfer from phenolic hydroxyl groups to sulfate radical as suggested by reaction 1 reaction 2 would produce hydroxylated c centered radical cations and consequently lead to the formation of ring cleavage products anipsitakis et al 2006 remarkably reaction 4 would take place due to the high electron density at r3 site leading to the formation of smaller fluorescent molecules as suggested by the blue shift of fluorescence emission spectra fig 6 the production of smaller molecules from complex structures could also be evidenced by the increased fluorescence signal fig s13 at lower pms exposure as the smaller aromatic moieties would be more fluorescent due to weaker intramolecular quenching effect the decarboxylation of carboxyl groups reaction 3 i e newly formed or originally incorporated within dom structures would be the main reaction mechanism of cdomslow transformation madhavan et al 1978 leading to a significant removal of toc however a more detailed study would be highly recommended for the optimization of process conditions for maximum carbon removal 4 conclusions the current study provided systematic information on both the reactivity and fate of cdom with sulfate radical dom fractions with different origins and characteristics were used in this investigation the main conclusions included fast and slow reacting cdom could be distinguished within all dom fractions interestingly the difference in the reactivity of cdomfast among different organics were minor while the reactivity cdomslow were observed to increase with suva the reactivity of cdomfast to so4 was calculated at an order of 108 m 1s 1 from the observed linear correlation between cdomfast decrease and sulfate radical exposure the correlation also validated the potential application of uva254 as a surrogate indicator for torcs removal efficiency a faster decrease of edc than uva254 at lower pms exposure indicated a preferred oxidation of phenolic structures i e preferential decrease of electron donating capacity afterwards the oxidation of cdomfast would proceed with the formation of transient intermediates and ring cleavage products the transformation products of cdomfast together with the originally less reactive structures i e cdomslow would undergo slow decarboxylation leading to a significant carbon removal the linear relationship recorded between cdomslow reduction and toc removal could be used to predict carbon removal the findings in this work would highly assist in the design and operation of so4 based water treatment processes specifically the scavenging capacity of background dom could be better evaluated using the calculated reactivity of cdomfast if the applied pms exposure would mainly cause changes in cdomfast also the correlation established between cdom and radical exposure would shed light on the applicability of uva254 as an indicator of torcs removal efficiency in so4 based water treatment processes however further site specific studies on the use of uva254 as an indicator are highly needed for its successful application so4 based advanced oxidation technique could be developed to address the need for dom removal in varying water treatment scenarios e g pretreatment for the removal of disinfection by products precursors or membrane foulants application of catalytic membrane for organic fouling mitigation membrane cleaning or the treatment of reverse osmosis concentrate produced from reclaimed water treatment plants also an increased pms dose could be applied to increase the reaction rate of cdomslow and consequently increase carbon removal in addition carbon removal efficiency could be simply estimated based on the removal of cdomslow due to the observed good correlation declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

size and surface area are the key factors in heterogeneous catalysis large surface area thanks to the increase of the active surface sites leads to high photocatalytic efficiency leong et al 2014 the main drawback of the tio2 nanoparticles limiting the widespread technical application of heterogeneous photocatalysis in water treatment is the difficulty of the photocatalyst separation from water

software force and elongation were continuously registered till break before the traction test the thickness of the samples was measured by a caliper and a digital thickener mitutoyo corporation the obtained data were compared to those on pure chitosan scaffolds measurements were done in triplicate 2 6 photodegradation experiments to evaluate the adsorption capacity and photocatalytic activity of the tio2 immobilized on chitosan scaffold tio2 cs experiments in dark i and under uv vis irradiation ii were performed as control experiments were also carried out with the scaffold made of chitosan alone cs and with the aeroxide p25 tio2 i to ensure the achievement of the adsorption desorption equilibrium 40 ml of amx aqueous solution ph 6 7 was placed in a reactor see fig 1 a with cs tio2 or tio2 cs and stirred in the dark until constant concentration measured by uv vis spectrophotometer the amx tio2 molar ratios tested were 1 100 and 1 10 ii the photodegradation of amx aqueous solutions was investigated under external uv vis irradiation using a 125 w helios italquartz medium pressure mercury vapor water jacketed lamp with emission range 300 800 nm the irradiation power at the water surface was 3 5 mw cm2 measured by a digital meter pce uv34 the absorption spectrum of amx and the emission spectrum of the lamp are show in fig 1b and c respectively the photolysis of the amx under irradiation without any catalyst in the same condition of the photodegradation experiments was also verified the uv absorbance at equilibrium a0 measured at the end of the dark experiment was taken as reference for the initial concentration c0 then the solution was irradiated with uv lamp under continuous stirring aliquots 2 ml were taken at defined time intervals and filtrated by 0 45 μm cronus 13 mm nylon syringe filters to remove suspended particles before the analysis the concentration of amx molecules at time t ct was measured with both a lambda bio 20 uv vis spectrometer perkinelmer usa and with hplc uv lc agilent 1200 binary pump equipped with a 100 vial position autosampler agilent technologies uk by monitoring the absorbance at at 230 nm uv230 and 272 nm hplc uv272 respectively the normalized absorbance at a0 of amx solution was taken as the measure of concentration ratio ct c0 at time t all the experiments were done in triplicate hplc analysis was performed to check the results obtained with uv vis spectrophotometry a technique more easily accessible in the laboratories to investigate the optimal photodegradation condition the reaction was carried out with three types of chitosan scaffolds a scaffold made by 3 layers cs3 15 mm 25 mm x 0 6 mm a 5 layers scaffold cs5 15 mm 15 mm x 1 mm and a 15 layers scaffold cs15 8 7 mm 8 7 mm x 3 mm with the same amounts of chitosan and tio2 chromatographic separation was achieved on a c18 gemini 100 4 6 mm 5 μm column phenomenex usa the mobile phase consisted of a mixture of ultrapure water acetonitrile ratio 90 10 with 0 2 of formic acid the flow rate was maintained at 0 6 ml min and the detector wavelength at 272 nm column temperature was not controlled room temperature 24 c injection volume was 20 μl elution was carried out in isocratic mode at the flow rate of 0 6 ml min the stationary phase consisted of a c18 phenomenex gemini 5 μm 110 a 100 4 60 mm the amount of amx was measured by performing calibration using amx standards from 1 to 100 μg ml prepared in up water 2 7 high resolution mass spectrometer analysis of amx degradation products amoxicillin sample solutions were characterized by direct infusion analysis at a flow rate of 10 μl min 1 into an ltq linear ion trap orbitrap xl mass spectrometer thermoscientific corporation san josè ca usa equipped with esi interface and controlled by xcalibur software optimized conditions of the interface were as follows esi voltage 3 5 kv capillary voltage 13 v capillary temperature 275 c tube lens voltage 85 v high resolution mass spectra were acquired in positive ion full scan mode in the m z window 100 1800 with a resolution of 60 000 and in ms ms product ion mode for the analysis of degradation intermediate samples were collected from the reaction media after 30 and 180 min of reaction and the results compared with those of pure amx 3 results and discussion 3 1 scaffold characterization the x ray diffraction patterns of tio2 cs 3d scaffold compared to those of pure tio2 powder and of chitosan cs are shown in fig 2 the 2θ peaks at 25 3 38 0 48 1 53 9 55 2 correspond to the anatase crystalline phase and are due to the reflection planes 101 004 200 105 and 211 respectively while the peaks at 27 6 36 2 41 3 44 5 54 4 correspond to the rutile crystalline phase and are due to the reflection planes 110 101 111 210 and 211 respectively the rutile and anatase features are seen in the tio2 cs diffraction pattern together with the contribution of chitosan showing a broad peak at 2θ 20 2 characteristic of an amorphous structure bergamonti et al 2015 the rutile weight fraction in the tio2 powder was estimated by zhang and banfield 2000 method to be 0 21 the size of the tio2 nanocrystals as expected is not influenced by the immobilization into the 3d scaffold the full width at half maximum fwhm of the main anatase and rutile peaks in the tio2 cs doesn t change the tio2 nanoparticle size both pure or embedded in the scaffold determined by scherrer equation is 20 nm for anatase and 25 nm for rutile phase these values agree with aeroxide p25 nanoparticles average sizes reported in literature ohno et al 2001 the specific surface area of the p25 powder as determined by bet isotherm was 51 m2g 1 in accordance with values reported in literature ohno et al 2001 the raman spectrum of tio2 cs is reported in fig 3 compared with that of pure p25 tio2 anatase 144 197 396 517 639 cm 1 and rutile 448 612 cm 1 features are present in both spectra the width fwhm of the main anatase peak both in tio2 cs and in tio2 powder is about 15 cm 1 compatible with a nanocrystalline size of 20 nm bersani et al 1998 this result agrees with the xrd analysis chitosan features at 899 1110 and 1378 cm 1 are observed in the tio2 cs spectrum nishad et al 2014 highly ordered 3d chitosan structure was easily achieved by 3d printing in fig 4 is reported the sem image of chitosan scaffold cs5 before photodegradation tests the scaffold shape is characterized by a well defined 3d structure composed by crossing filaments with size of about 100 μm forming a uniform grid the resulting channels have nearly square section with a side of 150 200 μm the surface of filaments is compact with a wrinkled homogenous distribution of not interconnected pores size distribution 10 20 μm this ordered morphology does not change after uv irradiation the tio2 addition does not influence the structure of the scaffold as evident in fig 5 a the shape and size of the interconnected channels is not modified even after uv irradiation fig 5b moreover it can be seen by the eds ti map that tio2 is uniformly dispersed into the chitosan matrix with micrometer sized agglomerates fig 5c 3 2 mechanical characterization the value of young s modulus was slightly higher in tio2 cs5 0 49 0 10 mpa than in cs5 0 36 0 05 mpa the deposition of the tio2 nanoparticles among the polymeric chains of the hydrogel causes loosening of the structure and lowering of the elasticity despite this fact the breaking force 0 047 0 010 kgf is high enough to allow the application of tio2 cs in photocatalytic reactors 3 3 photodegradation tests the removal of amx in aqueous solution 0 1 mm was investigated by both uv vis absorbance and hplc uv measurements to assess the amx adsorption dark tests were done with tio2 cs and tio2 cs the reduction in the amx concentration after 18 h was about 7 15 and 15 respectively the adsorption of organic molecules on the tio2 catalyst surface is due to its affinity for polar or ionizable groups as those found in amx thomas and syres 2012 in the case of chitosan the nh2 amino groups are responsible for its capacity to adsorb drugs through interactions of the polar groups of both molecules semwal et al 2013 rinaudo 2006 fig 6 a and b show the normalized amx concentrations ct c0 for direct photolysis amx amx cs and photocatalysis amx tio2 and amx tio2 cs tests obtained monitoring the absorbance peaks at 230 nm and at 272 nm by the uv vis uv230 and hplc uv hplc uv272 measurements respectively the contribution of the direct photolysis on the amx degradation in the experimental conditions adopted is quite low almost 15 of amx is degradated after 180 min exposure to irradiation as reported by several authors see for example moreira et al 2015 kanakaraju et al 2015 amx is very stable to photolysis for irradiation wavelengths above 300 nm the photolytic degradation here observed can be attributed to the amx hydrolysis that proceeds via attack by h2o acting as nucleophile to the β lactam ring followed by ring opening elmolla and chaudhuri 2010a andreozzi et al 2005 no significant changes are observed for the amx photolysis adsorbed on chitosan scaffold cs5 confirming the photo inactivity of the chitosan support a considerable enhancement of the photodegradation rate can be observed in presence of the tio2 catalyst both pure and cs5 immobilized for a 1 100 amx tio2 molar ratio the complete removal of amx adsorbed on p25 catalyst amx tio2 is reached in 2 h in agreement with similar investigations see for example radosavljević et al 2017 the complete amx degradation for tio2 cs5 is slightly slower and requires about 3 h of irradiation despite the use of the same loading of tio2 in the scaffold it is known that the redox photochemical reaction takes place on the tio2 surface when irradiated with uv light in the case of the immobilized tio2 only the nanoparticles easily reached by the light can participate to the photocatalytic processes the decrease in the photodegradation rate of the cs supported tio2 with respect the pure tio2 in the slurry experiment is due to the less amount of available tio2 nanoparticles in the scaffold for the photocatalysis kanakaraju et al 2015 amx photodegradation experiments done using scaffolds with 15 layers tio2 cs15 show low photocatalytic efficiency with irradiation time as for tio2 cs5 confirming the above results the tio2 nanoparticles are mainly embedded in the matrix and cannot be reached by uv irradiation the amx photodegradation after 3 h of irradiation was about 50 see fig 7 amx photodegradation tests performed using a 3 layers chitosan scaffold tio2 cs3 made with the same formulation used for tio2 cs5 show a faster photodegradation rate even at larger amx concentrations amx tio2 1 10 the complete photodegradation is reached in less than 3 h the photocatalytic degradation kinetics using pure p25 for both measurement techniques follows a pseudo first order kinetics fig 7a according to the most referred models for heterogeneous catalysis langmuir hinshelwood mechanism with a half life of 23 min for amx tio2 molar ratio 1 100 and 42 min for 1 10 favier et al 2016 ounnar et al 2016 herrmann 1999 the results for amx degradation with tio2 cs are better described by a zero order reaction kinetics ct c0 1 kt with k a zero th order rate constant fig 7b the half life for amx tio2 molar ratio 1 100 for tio2 cs5 is 90 min and 180 min for tio2 cs15 it is interesting to notice that for amx tio2 1 10 the geometry of tio2 cs3 scaffold influences the photocatalysis allowing high photodegradation efficiency comparable to that of tio2 cs5 with a photocatalyst amount 10 times higher table 1 summarizes the results for the rate constants and the half lives obtained for the different measurement conditions to verify the reusability of the tio2 scaffolds three cycles of photocatalysis were performed after repeated washes in distilled water the test was carried out on cs3 and cs5 which showed the highest photocatalytic activity for 180 min of uv irradiation even if for two different amx tio2 molar ratios fig 8 for cs5 also after the last cycle a good photocatalytic efficiency is maintained and about 80 of amx is photodegradated in the case of 3 layer scaffold already from the second cycle the efficiency decreases only 60 of amx is degraded after a third cycle 3 4 high resolution mass spectrometer analysis of amx degradation products high resolution mass spectrometry allowed to check the presence of amoxicillin and its degradation products amx tio2 cs5 analysed after 30 min of irradiation revealed the presence of amoxicillin dimers both hydrated and not by a water molecule at m z values 749 and 731 respectively fig 9 amoxicillin penilloic acid m z 340 was also found suggesting the beginning of a degradation pattern after 180 min dimers are no more present whereas three types of degradation products were found penilloic acid m z 340 penicilloic acid m z 384 and a product at m z 366 that could correspond to the protonated molecular ion of amx and or its degradation product diketopiperazine fig 10 the comparison made between the product ion ms ms mass spectrum of a standard solution of amx and amx tio2 cs5 irradiated for 180 min revealed the presence of the diketopiperazine degradate fig 11 in fig 11a the typical amx fragmentation pattern is observed with m z ions corresponding to the loss of a water molecule m z 348 and co2 m z 320 and characteristic fragments at m z 207 160 and 114 respectively the presence in fig 11b of the ion at m z 189 attributable to phenol hydroxypyrazine and the different relative intensity among ions strongly indicates the presence of the amx degradation compound diketopiperazine gozlan et al 2013 lamm et al 2009 andreozzi et al 2005 4 conclusions here the preparation and use of 3d printed chitosan based scaffolds as support for the photocatalytic activity of tio2 in environmental wastewater treatment applications were investigated for the first time the advantage of 3d printed scaffolds embedding tio2 is represented by the possibility of modulating their shape and size thus offering a very high area volume ratio crucial parameter for amoxicillin photocatalysis the availability of catalytic tio2 on scaffold surfaces allows to degrade large quantities of amoxicillin residues from wastewaters moreover three dimensional scaffolds can serve as fixing substrates for titanium dioxide since their mechanical properties are suitable for handling manipulation in the industrial environments and they might constitute a prototype of filters for cleaning water discharges degradation kinetics of amx achieved using tio2 cs scaffolds is almost as fast as that obtained with pure tio2 powder making them innovative tools easy to produce in series and reusable for water purification from pollutants such as amoxicillin having a positive impact on the environment rather than for drinking water tio2 immobilized on 3d chitosan scaffold characterized by good mechanical strength and elasticity can be conveniently used for repeated photocatalytic applications making these objects suitable for green wastewaters cleaning systems improvement

amoxicillin photodegradation under uv vis irradiation amoxicillin amx is an antibiotic of the beta lactam family due to the release of antibiotics in wastewater and their persistence in the environment harmful effects can develop on the aquatic and terrestrial organisms tio2 chitosan scaffolds with photocatalytic activity for wastewater remediation have been prepared by 3d printing using commercial p25 tio2 the formulation for the 3d printer was prepared by dispersion of chitosan and tio2 in powder form at the concentration 6 w v and 1 w v respectively the tio2 particles crystalline anatase and rutile phases embedded in the chitosan have a size of about 20 nm like in the starting material as verified by x ray diffraction and raman spectroscopy and are homogeneously distributed in the scaffold also after repeated photocatalytic tests as revealed by sem eds the mechanical properties of the 3d structures are suitable for the targeted application as they can be easily handled without breakage the amx photodegradation efficiency under light irradiation by tio2 cs made with scaffolds of different thicknesses 3 5 15 layers was assessed in water by means of uv vis absorption and hplc uv measurements at two different amx tio2 molar ratios 1 100 and 1 10 the 3d printed tio2 cs system even after repeated cycles shows a high photodegradation efficiency compared to the direct amx photolysis a zero order kinetics for tio2 supported photodegradation was found whereas a pseudo first order was observed for water dispersed tio2 mass spectrometry analysis revealed the presence of amx degradates such as penilloic and penicilloic acids and diketopiperazine the proposed 3d printed chitosan scaffolds may be used as reusable substrate for the tio2 photocatalytic degradation of

reactions take place at the surface of the catalyst when irradiated by light with energy equal to or greater than its bandgap energy eg the semiconductor absorbs photons leading to the formation of electron e hole h pairs the e is promoted in the conduction band leaving h in the valence band the photogenerated electron hole pair can migrate at the surface of the catalyst and react with the adsorbed species such as h2o oh o2 to form hydroxyl radicals superoxide radical anions and hydroperoxyl radicals able to destroy the organic compounds schneider et al 2014 fujishima et al 2008

tetragonal system rutile is the thermodynamically stable phase anatase and brookite phases are transformed to rutile at high temperatures all crystalline forms are photoactive anatase is usually considered to be the most active even if good results are also obtained for tio2 in brookite or rutile forms di paola et al 2013 pigeot rémy et al 2019 and for mixed phases ohno et al 2001 particle size and surface area are the key factors in heterogeneous catalysis large surface area thanks to the increase of the active surface sites leads to high photocatalytic efficiency leong et al 2014 the main drawback of the tio2 nanoparticles limiting the widespread technical application of heterogeneous photocatalysis in water treatment is the difficulty of the photocatalyst separation from water and its regeneration after use to solve this problem researchers attempt to immobilize tio2 nanoparticles on some active support such as activated carbon glass zeolites polymer films or natural biopolymers siripatrawan and kaewklin 2018 karthikeyan et al 2017 kanakaraju et al 2015 cendrowski et al 2011 nawi et al 2009 suwanchawalit et al 2009 in this work a new method for immobilizing tio2

respectively i e g of solute 100 ml of solution powders were then mixed together in a beaker and suspended in de ionized di water the mixture was put under magnetic stirring till the two materials were homogeneously dispersed then glacial acetic acid to obtain a final concentration of 2 v v was added to let the polymer dissolve embedding tio2 nanoparticles the formulation was maintained under magnetic stirring for 24 h the blended material to be printed was then ready to use 2 3 3d scaffold design scaffolds were designed using the software solidworks dassault systems usa allowing the

the normalized absorbance at a0 of amx solution was taken as the measure of concentration ratio ct c0 at time t all the experiments were done in triplicate hplc analysis was performed to check the results obtained with uv vis spectrophotometry a technique more easily accessible in the laboratories to investigate the optimal photodegradation condition the reaction was carried out with three types of chitosan scaffolds a scaffold made by 3 layers cs3 15 mm 25 mm x 0 6 mm a 5 layers scaffold cs5 15 mm 15 mm x 1 mm and a 15 layers scaffold cs15 8 7 mm 8 7 mm x 3 mm with the same amounts of chitosan and tio2 chromatographic separation was achieved on a c18 gemini 100 4 6 mm 5 μm column phenomenex usa the mobile phase consisted of a mixture of ultrapure water acetonitrile ratio 90 10 with 0 2 of formic acid the flow rate was maintained at 0 6 ml min and the detector wavelength at 272 nm column temperature was not controlled room temperature 24 c injection volume was 20 μl elution was carried out in isocratic mode at the flow rate of 0 6 ml min the stationary phase consisted of a c18 phenomenex gemini 5 μm 110 a 100 4 60 mm the amount of amx was measured by performing calibration using amx standards from 1 to 100 μg ml prepared in up water 2 7 high resolution mass spectrometer analysis of amx degradation products amoxicillin sample solutions were characterized by direct infusion analysis at a flow rate of 10 μl min 1 into an ltq linear ion trap orbitrap xl mass spectrometer thermoscientific corporation san josè ca usa equipped with esi interface and controlled by xcalibur software optimized conditions of the interface were as follows esi voltage 3 5 kv capillary voltage 13 v capillary temperature 275 c tube lens voltage 85 v high resolution mass spectra were acquired in positive ion full scan mode in the m z window 100 1800 with a resolution of 60 000 and in ms ms product ion mode for the analysis of degradation intermediate samples were collected from the reaction media after 30 and 180 min of reaction and the results compared with those of pure amx 3 results and discussion 3 1 scaffold characterization the x ray diffraction patterns of tio2 cs 3d scaffold compared to those of pure tio2 powder and of chitosan cs are shown in fig 2 the 2θ peaks at 25 3 38 0 48 1 53 9 55 2 correspond to the anatase crystalline phase and are due to the reflection planes 101 004 200 105 and 211 respectively while the peaks at 27 6 36 2 41 3 44 5 54 4 correspond to the rutile crystalline phase and are due to the reflection planes 110 101 111 210 and 211 respectively the rutile and anatase features are seen in the tio2 cs diffraction pattern together with the contribution of chitosan showing a broad peak at 2θ 20 2 characteristic of an amorphous structure bergamonti et al 2015 the rutile weight fraction in the tio2 powder was estimated by zhang and banfield 2000 method to be 0 21 the size of the tio2 nanocrystals as expected is not influenced by the immobilization into the 3d scaffold the full width at half maximum fwhm of the main anatase and rutile peaks in the tio2 cs doesn t change the tio2 nanoparticle size both pure or embedded in the scaffold determined by scherrer equation is 20 nm for anatase and 25 nm for rutile phase these values agree with aeroxide p25 nanoparticles average sizes reported in literature ohno et al 2001 the specific surface area of the p25 powder as determined by bet isotherm was 51 m2g 1 in accordance with values reported in literature ohno et al 2001 the raman spectrum of tio2 cs is reported in fig 3 compared with that of pure p25 tio2 anatase 144 197 396 517 639 cm 1 and rutile 448 612 cm 1 features are present in both spectra the width fwhm of the main anatase peak both in tio2 cs and in tio2 powder is about 15 cm 1 compatible with a nanocrystalline size of 20 nm bersani et al 1998 this result agrees with the xrd analysis chitosan features at 899 1110 and 1378 cm 1 are observed in the tio2 cs spectrum nishad et al 2014 highly ordered 3d chitosan structure was easily achieved by 3d printing in fig 4 is reported the sem image of chitosan scaffold cs5 before photodegradation tests the scaffold shape is characterized by a well defined 3d structure composed by crossing filaments with size of about 100 μm forming a uniform grid the resulting channels have nearly square section with a side of 150 200 μm the surface of filaments is compact with a wrinkled homogenous distribution of not interconnected pores size distribution 10 20 μm this ordered morphology does not change after uv irradiation the tio2 addition does not influence the structure of the scaffold as evident in fig 5 a the shape and size of the interconnected channels is not modified even after uv irradiation fig 5b moreover it can be seen by the eds ti map that tio2 is uniformly dispersed into the chitosan matrix with micrometer sized agglomerates fig 5c 3 2 mechanical characterization the value of young s modulus was slightly higher in tio2 cs5 0 49 0 10 mpa than in cs5 0 36 0 05 mpa the deposition of the tio2 nanoparticles among the polymeric chains of the hydrogel causes loosening of the structure and lowering of the elasticity despite this fact the breaking force 0 047 0 010 kgf is high enough to allow the application of tio2 cs in photocatalytic reactors 3 3 photodegradation tests the removal of amx in aqueous solution 0 1 mm was investigated by both uv vis absorbance and hplc uv measurements to assess the amx adsorption dark tests were done with tio2 cs and tio2 cs the reduction in the amx concentration after 18 h was about 7 15 and 15 respectively the adsorption of organic molecules on the tio2 catalyst surface is due to its affinity for polar or ionizable groups as those found in amx thomas and syres 2012 in the case of chitosan the nh2 amino groups are responsible for its capacity to adsorb drugs through interactions of the polar groups of both molecules semwal et al 2013 rinaudo 2006 fig 6 a and b show the normalized amx concentrations ct c0 for direct photolysis amx amx cs and photocatalysis amx tio2 and amx tio2 cs tests obtained monitoring the absorbance peaks at 230 nm and at 272 nm by the uv vis uv230 and hplc uv hplc uv272 measurements respectively the contribution of the direct photolysis on the amx degradation in the experimental conditions adopted is quite low almost 15 of amx is degradated after 180 min exposure to irradiation as reported by several authors see for example moreira et al 2015 kanakaraju et al 2015 amx is very stable to photolysis for irradiation wavelengths above 300 nm the photolytic degradation here observed can be attributed to the amx hydrolysis that proceeds via attack by h2o acting as nucleophile to the β lactam ring followed by ring opening elmolla and chaudhuri 2010a andreozzi et al 2005 no significant changes are observed for the amx photolysis adsorbed on chitosan scaffold cs5 confirming the photo inactivity of the chitosan support a considerable enhancement of the photodegradation rate can be observed in presence of the tio2 catalyst both pure and cs5 immobilized for a 1 100 amx tio2 molar ratio the complete removal of amx adsorbed on p25 catalyst amx tio2 is reached in 2 h in agreement with similar investigations see for example radosavljević et al 2017 the complete amx degradation for tio2 cs5 is slightly slower and requires about 3 h of irradiation despite the use of the same loading of tio2 in the scaffold it is known that the redox photochemical reaction takes place on the tio2 surface when irradiated with uv light in the case of the immobilized tio2 only the nanoparticles easily reached by the light can participate to the photocatalytic processes the decrease in the photodegradation rate of the cs supported tio2 with respect the pure tio2 in the slurry experiment is due to the less amount of available tio2 nanoparticles in the scaffold for the photocatalysis kanakaraju et al 2015 amx photodegradation experiments done using scaffolds with 15 layers tio2 cs15 show low photocatalytic efficiency with irradiation time as for tio2 cs5 confirming the above results the tio2 nanoparticles are mainly embedded in the matrix and cannot be reached by uv irradiation the amx photodegradation after 3 h of irradiation was about 50 see fig 7 amx photodegradation tests performed using a 3 layers chitosan scaffold tio2 cs3 made with the same formulation used for tio2 cs5 show a faster photodegradation rate even at larger amx concentrations amx tio2 1 10 the complete photodegradation is reached in less than 3 h the photocatalytic degradation kinetics using pure p25 for both measurement techniques follows a pseudo first order kinetics fig 7a according to the most referred models for heterogeneous catalysis langmuir hinshelwood mechanism with a half life of 23 min for amx tio2 molar ratio 1 100 and 42 min for 1 10 favier et al 2016 ounnar et al 2016 herrmann 1999 the results for amx degradation with tio2 cs are better described by a zero order reaction kinetics ct c0 1 kt with k a zero th order rate constant fig 7b the half life for amx tio2 molar ratio 1 100 for tio2 cs5 is 90 min and 180 min for tio2 cs15 it is interesting to notice that for amx tio2 1 10 the geometry of tio2 cs3 scaffold influences the photocatalysis allowing high photodegradation efficiency comparable to that of tio2 cs5 with a photocatalyst amount 10 times higher table 1 summarizes the results for the rate constants and the half lives obtained for the different measurement conditions to verify the reusability of the tio2 scaffolds three cycles of photocatalysis were performed after repeated washes in distilled water the test was carried out on cs3 and cs5 which showed the highest photocatalytic activity for 180 min of uv irradiation even if for two different amx tio2 molar ratios fig 8 for cs5 also after the last cycle a good photocatalytic efficiency is maintained and about 80 of amx is photodegradated in the case of 3 layer scaffold already from the second cycle the efficiency decreases only 60 of amx is degraded after a third cycle 3 4 high resolution mass spectrometer analysis of amx degradation products high resolution mass spectrometry allowed to check the presence of amoxicillin and its degradation products amx tio2 cs5 analysed after 30 min of irradiation revealed the presence of amoxicillin dimers both hydrated and not by a water molecule at m z values 749 and 731 respectively fig 9 amoxicillin penilloic acid m z 340 was also found suggesting the beginning of a degradation pattern after 180 min dimers are no more present whereas three types of degradation products were found penilloic acid m z 340 penicilloic acid m z 384 and a product at m z 366 that could correspond to the protonated molecular ion of amx and or its degradation product diketopiperazine fig 10 the comparison made between the product ion ms ms mass spectrum of a standard solution of amx and amx tio2 cs5 irradiated for 180 min revealed the presence of the diketopiperazine degradate fig 11 in fig 11a the typical amx fragmentation pattern is observed with m z ions corresponding to the loss of a water molecule m z 348 and co2 m z 320 and characteristic fragments at m z 207 160 and 114 respectively the presence in fig 11b of the ion at m z 189 attributable to phenol hydroxypyrazine and the different relative intensity among ions strongly indicates the presence of the amx degradation compound diketopiperazine gozlan et al 2013 lamm et al 2009 andreozzi et al 2005 4 conclusions here the preparation and use of 3d printed chitosan based scaffolds as support for the photocatalytic activity of tio2 in environmental wastewater treatment applications were investigated for the first time the advantage of 3d printed scaffolds embedding tio2 is represented by the possibility of modulating their shape and size thus offering a very high area volume ratio crucial parameter for amoxicillin photocatalysis the availability of catalytic tio2 on scaffold surfaces allows to degrade large quantities of amoxicillin residues from wastewaters moreover three dimensional scaffolds can serve as fixing substrates for titanium dioxide since their mechanical properties are suitable for handling manipulation in the industrial environments and they might constitute a prototype of filters for cleaning water discharges degradation kinetics of amx achieved using tio2 cs scaffolds is almost as fast as that obtained with pure tio2 powder making them innovative tools easy to produce in series and reusable for water purification from pollutants such as amoxicillin having a positive impact on the environment rather than for drinking water tio2 immobilized on 3d chitosan scaffold characterized by good mechanical strength and elasticity can be conveniently used for repeated photocatalytic applications making these objects suitable for green wastewaters cleaning systems improvement 
18579,glyphosate the most commonly used herbicide in the world can be degraded into more toxic and persistent products such as aminomethylphosphonic acid ampa or non toxic products such as sarcosine and glycine in this study we used liquid chromatography mass spectrometry lc ms and electrospray ionization esi source q extractive orbitrap mass spectrometry esi orbitrap ms to identify glyphosate degradation products and combined with sequential extraction and stable isotopes to investigate the degradation of glyphosate and transformation of phosphorous p product in a soil water system the lc ms and esi orbitrap ms results showed that glycine formed during the early stage but was rapidly utilized by soil microorganisms ampa started to accumulate at the late stage and was found to be 3 6 times more resistant than glyphosate against degradation while no sarcosine was formed the 18o labeling and phosphate oxygen isotope results allowed a clear distinction of the fraction of inorganic p pi derived from glyphosate about half of which was then rapidly taken up and recycled by soil microorganisms our results provide the first evidence of the preferential utilization of glyphosate derived pi by microorganisms in the soil water system the rapid cycling of pi derived from this disregarded source has important implications on nutrient management as well as water quality graphical abstract image 1 keywords glyphosate biotic degradation phosphorus stable isotopes microbial turnover 1 introduction glyphosate n phosphonomethyl glycine is an effective broad spectrum herbicide its application has dramatically increased since the introduction of genetically engineered herbicide tolerant crops in 1996 dill et al 2010 it has been the most heavily used pesticide in the agricultural sector in recent years with an estimated 130 million kilograms in the u s in 2016 usgs 2016 glyphosate degradation is accomplished mainly by various soil microorganisms rueppel et al 1977 sviridov et al 2011 zhan et al 2018 the degradation occurs either through c n bond cleavage which forms aminomethylphosphonic acid ampa a more toxic and resistant metabolite than glyphosate or through c p bond cleavage which yields much safer products sarcosine and then glycine unlike ampa sarcosine is barely detected in the environment wang et al 2016 aside from pure culture experiments zhan et al 2018 the reason for this discrepancy is still unclear but it might be due to the rapid oxidation of sarcosine inefficient extraction from soil matrix or present below the limit of detection although early assessments suggested low acute toxicity of glyphosate and ampa their possible chronic health effects on animals and humans have been reported to be higher in recent studies balbuena et al 2015 van bruggen et al 2018 moreover the report from the international agency for research on cancer iarc which classified glyphosate as a probable carcinogen to humans iarc 2015 has triggered fierce controversy in the public and within regulatory bodies usepa 2017 strong interaction of glyphosate and ampa with soils clays and organic matter bring a concern of potentially contaminating drinking water usepa 2015 this highlights the need to study glyphosate and its metabolites transformation and the preference of the degradation pathways in the system that are relevant to natural water soil environment degradation products from glyphosate eventually generate inorganic forms of carbon nitrogen and phosphorus isolated bacterial and fungal strains have been reported to utilize one or more nutritional elements c n and p in glyphosate see review by zhan et al 2018 little information however has been reported in terms of glyphosate utilization in soil or under other natural environment borggaard and gimsing 2008 wang et al 2016 and the fate of p derived from glyphosate in p rich agricultural soils are unknown given that a very small increase in p concentration due to its low requirement compared to other major nutrients 106c 16n 1p redfield 1958 can cause severe impacts on water quality such as promoting hypoxia and eutrophication therefore the role of glyphosate derived p loading cannot be ignored the sorption of p onto soil organic matter minerals strongly affects its mobilization and bioavailability the hedley sequential extraction method and modification thereof hedley et al 1982 tiessen et al 1984 have been used to separate and characterize different soil p pools and their availability as well as to estimate need for fertilizer on crops most recently phosphate oxygen isotope has emerged as novel research tool and is combined with sequential extraction methods to investigate the bioavailability turnover and transformation of p in soil and other environment gooddy et al 2016 jaisi et al 2017 joshi et al 2016 pistocchi et al 2017 the stable isotope ratios of o in pi δ18op serves as a tracer of p due to its unique isotope effects i temperature dependent equilibrium isotope effects due to the rapid o isotope exchange between dissolved pi and water catalyzed by pyrophosphatase enzyme commonly present in organisms longinelli and nuti 1973 chang and blake 2015 and ii kinetic isotope effects catalyzed by other phosphatase enzymes during the degradation of organic p compounds which partially inherit isotope signatures from the parent molecules liang and blake 2009 sun et al 2017 von sperber et al 2015 the current state of basic and applied research in isotope and molecular separation methods provides a platform for studying the isotope exchange and microbial turnover of p during glyphosate biodegradation in soils and discriminating the particular source of p undergoing a specific pathway of cycling in the environment the major aim of this research was to study glyphosate degradation and the fate of glyphosate derived p in the water soil system especially on its uptake and cycling by soil microorganisms to do so we developed a liquid chromatography mass spectrometry lc ms method to detect and quantify glyphosate and its degradation products and then calculate their half lives in the soil water environment distribution of different p pools in soils was analyzed using the hedley sequential extraction method a refined isotope method was implemented to identify p availability and microbial turnover during glyphosate degradation in the soil incubated with 18o labeled water overall these methodological advances in metabolite identification p distribution and isotopic signature tracking have brought forward a new dimension to better understand glyphosate degradation in the natural environment and cycling of p derived from glyphosate 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagent and chemicals glyphohsate 96 aminomethyl phosphonic acid 98 and 9 fluorenyl methoxycarbonyl chloride fmoc cl 97 were obtained from sigma aldrich isotope labeled compounds including glyphosate 2 13c 15n glycine d5 and sarcosine d3 methyl d3 were purchased from sigma aldrich other chemicals including glycine 99 and sarcosine 98 were purchased either from acros organics or fisher scientific all the reagents were of analytical grade and stock solution were prepared with di water 2 2 soil collection and incubation a typical silt loam soil 0 15 cm depth from the agricultural experiment station research farm at the university of delaware was used in this study the detailed information about the soil characterization has been reported in a previous publication joshi et al 2016 after removing any plant residues and granular rock particles the soil samples were air dried homogenized passed through a 2 mm sieve and stored until analyses a flowchart of the experimental and analytical approach used is shown in fig 1 the first degradation experiment was run to identify glyphosate and its degradation products in soil as well as to determine the degradation kinetics and half lives of major products the soil was incubated with 1 μmol g unlabeled glyphosate at 20 c in the dark with 60 water content for 175 d a separate experiment with dual isotope 13c and 15n labeled glyphosate 1 μmol g spiked in soil was performed for 35 d to accurately identify degradation products the control experiment was performed under the same condition but without glyphosate the natural soil incubation included both biotic and abiotic degradations identical experiment run with autoclaved water and soil served as abiotic degradation at selected time points 5 g subsamples were collected into 50 ml centrifuge tubes and stored at 20 c until further analysis all experiments were run in duplicate under the same condition in order to identify p distribution and bioavailability during glyphosate degradation the second set of experiments was performed in two 18o labeled waters δ18oh2o 6 51 and 18 27 to collect sufficient p for isotope analyses 5 μmol g unlabeled glyphosate was spiked into 300 g soil and incubated with 600 ml 18o labeled water at 20 c in the dark for 161 d the spiked glyphosate concentration is much higher than application dose in agriculture about 1 kg ha but is required to obtain reliable phosphate isotopic analyses the experimental containers were tightly capped to avoid any water evaporation that compromises the water oxygen isotopes the containers were shaken every day for 15 min to homogenize the system and then briefly ventilated to replenish ambient oxygen and to preserve the oxic condition the control experiments were run under the same condition but in the absence of glyphosate subsampling and processing followed a similar procedure as described above 2 3 extraction and analyses of glyphosate ampa glycine and sarcosine the extraction of glyphosate ampa glycine and sarcosine was based on the published method ibáñez et al 2005 briefly 1 g lyophilized soil samples degradation experiments were extracted with 5 ml 0 6 m koh for 1 h by shaking at 140 rpm then centrifuged at 2755 g for 30 min one ml of supernatant was removed and neutralized by hcl and then 0 12 ml of borate buffer ph 9 and 0 12 ml fmoc cl 12 g l were added and shaken for 1 min on a vortex mixer after an overnight reaction at room temperature the mixture was filtered with a 0 45 μm syringe filter for lc ms analysis glyphosate ampa glycine and sarcosine standards were prepared to develop the separation method by using an acclaim 120 c18 column 2 1 250 mm under a gradient eluent program after testing and running several programs the optimized gradient was identified to be effective with a mixture of two mobile phases with a flow rate of 0 35 ml min with a acetonitrile and b 5 mmol l hac nh4ac 0 6 min 20 40 a 80 60 b 6 9 min 40 75 a 60 25 b 9 10 2 min 75 100 a 65 0 b 10 2 12 min

waters single quadrupole lc ms equipped with pda and sq detector the optimized ms parameters are as follows esi positive mode capillary voltage 3 kv cone voltage 40 v desolvation temperature 200 c desolvation gas flow 650 l hr and full mass scan from 100 to 500 m z the unlabeled glyphosate and labeled sarcosine were quantified with labeled glyphosate and unlabeled sarcosine as internal standards similarly labeled glycine was quantified by labeled glycine as an external standard to avoid any interference from glycine already present in soil ampa was determined by the soil spiked external standards labeled glyphosate degradation samples were analyzed with a high resolution mass spectrometry q extractive orbitrap mass spectrometry thermo germany at the university of delaware orbitrap ms data were acquired under the positive mode with scan range from 100 to 1000 m z glycine formation during labeled glyphosate degradation were determined by external standard prepared by spiking labeled glycine in soil to avoid the interference of soil original glycine the extraction and derivatization methods for glyphosate ampa glycine and sarcosine were validated by spiking the known amounts of these compounds in soil the recovery ranged from 85 to 107 for glyphosate 79 93 for ampa 74 88 for glycine and 80 97 for sarcosine with rsd below 20 which is considered satisfactory the limit of quantification loq for glyphosate and ampa is 10 nmol g soil and for glycine and sarcosine is 50 nmol g in single quadrupole lc ms while it was largely improved by using orbitrap 0 5 nmol g 2 4 distribution of p derived from glyphosate into soil p pools to differentiate and quantify the distribution of glyphosate derived p in soil samples from both control and glyphosate spiked soils from the second set of experiments were analyzed a 0 3 g lyophilized soil was weighed and extracted with 30 ml di water for 2 h using the modified hedley et al 1982 sequential extraction method tiessen et al 1984 the supernatant was collected as h2o extractable pi most labile pi and residual soil was extracted with 30 ml of 0 5 m nahco3 for 16 h to collect labile and weakly adsorbed pi inorganic p from those two pools represents microbially available pi tiessen and moir 1993 the soil was further extracted for 16 h first with 30 ml of 0 1 m naoh and then with 1 m hcl to obtain the naoh extractable pi strongly sorbed p fixed by fe and al oxides and hcl extractable pi strongly fixed ca p respectively the concentration of pi in each pool was measured by using the phosphomolybdate blue method murphy and riley 1962 the residual p in the soils after the completion of sequential extraction was quantified using icp ms 2 5 measurement of oxygen isotope ratios soil samples from control and glyphosate spiked 5 μmol g experiments with two 18o labeled waters were centrifuged first to extract waters to measure water oxygen isotopes δ18ow by co2 equilibration method cohn and urey 1938 the measurement was done in a finnigan gasbench ii coupled with an isotope ratio mass spectrometer irms thermo darmstadt germany in the environmental biogeochemistry laboratory at the university of delaware to understand the p bioavailability the h2o and nahco3 extracted pi pools were combined and processed for the measurement of phosphate oxygen isotope ratios δ18op five grams of lyophilized soil samples from the second set of degradation experiments were processed following the joshi et al 2018 method to purify and finally convert pi into silver phosphate the o isotope ratios were measured by a thermochemolysis elemental analyzer tc ea couples with irms all isotopes from samples and standards were run at least in triplicate the measured δ18op values of pi were calibrated against two silver phosphate standards yr 1ar 2 and yr 3 2 with the δ18op values of 5 49 and 33 63 respectively similarly the δ18ow values of porewater were calibrated with two usgs water standards δ18ow values of 1 97 and 9 25 respectively all isotope values are reported in per mil relative to the vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow 3 results and discussions 3 1 degradation kinetics of glyphosate and its metabolites the typical chromatography spectra of glyphosate ampa sarcosine and glycine are shown in fig 2 based on the lc ms results the concentrations of the compounds were calculated and are shown in fig 3 glyphosate gradually degraded over time and the extent of degradation reached 80 by 35 d of incubation but traces of residual glyphosate were still detected until 175 d ampa the major metabolite of glyphosate appear after several days and accumulated during incubation and reached its maximum concentration at 35 and 56 d in the experiment with 1 μmol g and 5 μmol g glyphosate respectively afterwards its degradation dominated over accumulation neither the degradation of glyphosate nor the formation of ampa was observed in the sterilized soil incubation abiotic only experiment indicating microorganisms play a crucial role in degrading glyphosate in soils the degradation of glyphosate with time is often described according to first order kinetics beulke and brown 2001 1 ln c c0 kt 2 t1 2 ln2 k where c 0 is the initial concentration c is the concentration at time t and k is the degradation rate constant the maximum accumulated concentration of ampa is used as its initial concentration since more than 80 of glyphosate was degraded at the time the results show that both glyphosate and ampa degradation follow first order kinetics with a strong correlation coefficient r2 0 85 the calculated half lives of glyphosate under two sets of experiments are 28 9 and 31 5 d respectively consistent with the published results al rajab and schiavon 2010 a calculation based on the maximum amount of ampa accumulated in the soil shows that the ampa accounts for 48 68 of the products from glyphosate degradation it shows much longer half lives 138 6 and 173 3 d which highlights the high risk because of its toxicity and persistence in the environment glycine is a common amino acid and commonly present in soil and other environment the isotope labeled glyphosate provides the reliability of detection because the labeled element is present in glycine as well labeled glycine appeared only after few days accumulated and reached the highest concentration after 5 d and then decreased but was still detectable after 35 d incubation fig 3a the concentration of labeled glycine is low probably due to glycine derived from glyphosate was readily incorporated into microbial biomass son after it formed results from a separate labeled glycine incubation experiment showed a rapid decline of soil spiked glycine 1 μmol g with half life of 0 89 d fig 4 abiotic experiment showed no significant decline in glycine concentration in sterilized soil validating methodology as well as indicating that soil microorganisms play a major role in glycine transformation a recent study of labeled glyphosate reported the distribution of 13c and 15n into several amino acids including glycine wang et al 2016 which our results corroborate these findings together confirm that glyphosate derived glycine in the experiments should have rapidly utilized and metabolized by soil microorganisms sarcosine is a commonly recognized precursor to glycine during glyphosate degradation primarily on pure cultures that include bacteria isolated from soils ermakova et al 2017 moore et al 1983 zhan et al 2018 but rarely from the natural or simulated environments wang et al 2016 in this study sarcosine was not detected in any soil treatments including labeled glyphosate and high glyphosate 5 μmol g incubations there might be three possibilities for the observed results inefficient extraction from soil fast oxidation of sarcosine or presence below the detection limits of the analytical method however the recovery test performed by artificially spiking sarcosine in the same soil revealed that the method used could efficiently extract and accurately quantify sarcosine yield 80 97 the individual incubation experiment showed that sarcosine could be degraded fast in the biotic experiment with half life of 0 99 d but no significant decline in sterilized soil which indicates degradation possible only by soil microorganisms these lines of evidences suggest analytical method is not the reason particularly since the high resolution obitrap ms detection limit of 0 5 nmol g of sarcosine and glycine was used in the labeled glyphosate degradation experiments soil samples were collected in several time points 0 1 2 4 h until 35 d the analytical method used successfully monitored the glycine formation and accumulation under extremely low concentration if sarcosine was actually formed as a precursor to glycine it should have detected by obitrap ms since both sarcosine and glycine have similar half lives in a recent study sarcosine was not detected in the abiotic degradation of glyphosate catalyzed by mn minerals li et al 2018 these authors used advanced analytical methods including nmr hplc and density functional theory dft based electronic structure calculations and concluded that sarcosine was not a necessary intermediate product overall the reliable extraction and analytical methods and intensive time point sampling verified that sarcosine was not formed during glyphosate degradation by soil microorganisms in this study 3 2 distribution of glyphosate derived phosphorous in soil concentrations of four soil pi pools in the control and glyphosate spiked soils during the second set of incubations are shown in fig 5 the experiments performed in two 18o labeled waters are considered duplicates because the difference in water oxygen isotopes does not impact the kinetics and extent of glyphosate degradation clearly the control soil without glyphosate already contains high pi and concentrations of pi in different pools vary it is noticeable however that the concentrations of pi in these four pools remained essentially constant during the long term incubation with h2o pi 1 01 0 08 μmol g nahco3 pi 4 21 0 23 μmol g naoh pi 10 08 0 91 μmol g and hcl pi 0 52 0 06 μmol g this means that no significant transfer of p pools and organic inorganic transformation occurred during the long term incubation the naoh pi pool was the largest indicating that fe and al minerals associated p is the major p sink in this soil which is consistent with several other soils guo et al 2000 tiessen et al 1984 the results from the experiment in which glyphosate was spiked show that pi derived from glyphosate transferred into different pools resulting in an increase of corresponding pool size the maximum concentration of h2o pi was 2 11 μmol g at 70 d of incubation the difference between control soil without glyphosate and glyphosate spiked soil shows that there was 1 06 μmol g glyphosate derived pi transferred into this pool similarly a significant net increase of pi was observed in nahco3 pi 1 40 μmol g naoh pi 1 93 μmol g and hcl pi 0 23 μmol g pools with the highest pi concentrations measured around 56 126 d of incubation it is interesting that the order of p pool was the same as that in the original control soil naoh pi nahco3 pi h2o pi hcl pi calculated p mass balance shows that the total increase in pi among 4 pools was 4 30 μmol g at the end of incubation which accounts for 86 of spiked glyphosate 5 μmol g the residual p in the control and glyphosate spiked soils were similar 7 99 0 69 and 7 67 0 69 μmol g respectively indicating that there was no significant incorporation of glyphosate derived p in the residual p pool it also means that the hedley extraction could efficiently extract almost all p and account p derived from biodegradation of glyphosate in terms of distribution pi derived from glyphosate fig 6 the h2o and nahco3 pi pools which are considered readily available pi for uptake by microorganisms and plant roots received almost half 44 of it meanwhile around 33 38 of glyphosate p transformed into the naoh pi pool an unavailable or moderately bioavailable p pool depending on the soil p conditions and plant efficiency and time helfenstein et al 2018 this means that this conditionally unavailable p pool might be further transported into open water systems by leaching or soil erosion and could increase the risk of polluting waters the hcl pi which is not directly utilized by plants and microorganisms and normally remains as an unavailable p pool in agricultural soil only received 3 5 of p derived from glyphosate these results highlight the fact that p load derived from a large amount of glyphosate application with estimated 130 million kg used in the u s usgs 2016 cannot be ignored given that the pi derived from glyphosate is steady means that it was gradually released as the degradation continues and distributed more into the bioavailable pool and it may be a better p source for plants phosphorus fertilizer is the major p supply for plants with estimated 4 billion kg used in the u s in 2014 usepa 2018 with 50 70 use efficiency roberts and johnston 2015 however its fast p release kinetics do not match the dynamic needs of different crop growth stages well liu et al 2014 and this offset causes nutrient loss from soil to aquatic systems given the slow but steady p release from glyphosate degradation it might be slightly more synchronous than commercial fertilizers but still too fast than plant needs furthermore multiple sprays of glyphosate during the crop lifetime average of 1 6 times per crop year usgs 2016 support the possibility of fractionating more into bioavailable p that plants can readily take up this demands reconsidering glyphosate not only use as a herbicide but a bonus p source to crops and should be included in estimations of crop p needs to improve the p efficiency of plant uptake as well reducing the p loss from agricultural soils 3 3 bioavailability of glyphosate derived phosphorus once inside the cell pi is involved in several metabolic reactions catalyzed by enzymes including incorporation into cell biomass and atp adp conversion one of the unique enzymes is pyrophosphatase ppase which is highly conserved across all three domains of life catalyzes the hydrolysis of pyrophosphate into pi this is a reversible reaction cohn 1953 and leads to exchange of all four o atoms in pi with o in ambient water and thus achieves o isotopic equilibrium between phosphate and water the equilibrium isotope depends on the temperature and water oxygen isotope value chang and blake 2015 to further test the bioavailability and rate of microbial utilization of glyphosate derived pi phosphate oxygen isotopes δ18op of pi in the soil incubated with and without glyphosate were measured and compared with the equilibrium isotope values calculated from the temperature and oxygen isotopes of water δ18ow in the experiments the δ18ow values remained constant at 6 51 0 30 and 18 27 0 12 for two 18o labeled water experiments in the long term incubation except at the end of the experiment 161 d when an inadvertent evaporation resulted in slight enrichment of isotopes 4 90 and 20 71 respectively the expected isotopic equilibrium value δ18op eq was calculated based on the chang and blake 2015 equation as 3 δ 18 o p e q e 14 43 t 0 0265 δ 18 o w 1000 1000 the δ18op eq values in the experiments incubated with 6 51 and 18 27 water are 15 83 0 31 and 41 16 0 12 fig 7 respectively and remained constant during the incubation period except at 161d in which water mass was not conserved the starting isotope values of extracted pi were consistent in all treatments 20 77 0 26 21 02 0 10 21 38 0 42 and 21 21 0 16 in two controls soil without glyphosate and two glyphosate spiked experiments with 6 51 and 18 27 18o labeled waters respectively it means that there are no different o sources or contaminants that might have impacted isotope values during the incubation period besides the degradation of glyphosate the measured δ18op values in the bioavailable p in 18o spiked 18 27 water became gradually heavier fig 7a shifting towards the equilibrium values 41 16 and reached 32 04 at the end of incubation this result reveals the rapid uptake of the available p by soil microorganisms and the release of cycled p back to the soil at the early stage δ18op values of pi in the soil spiked with glyphosate were consistent with those in original control experiments however they became lighter after 14 d and remained 1 2 2 5 lighter for a long period this is due to the contribution from a much lighter isotope value of pi 4 9 derived from glyphosate li et al 2016 the newly derived pi from glyphosate degradation mixed with soil pi pool and turned them into isotopic lighter and away from the equilibrium value around 41 2 this result is consistent with pi distribution that pi was heavily released from glyphosate from 14 d to 84 d fig 5 and preserving isotope record of the lighter glyphosate derived pi in the system see fig 5 however the difference in isotope values between those two treatments gradually narrowed and eventually erased at 161 d indicating that the soil microorganisms were efficient to uptake and cycle almost all of bioavailable p in the soil both from originally present soil and from glyphosate derived pi the isotope trend in the experiments performed in 6 51 water fig 7b is comparable to heavy water but with a minor difference for example the δ18op values in glyphosate spiked soil became much lighter and reached the equilibrium value sooner than those from control soil without glyphosate the reason is that the pi derived from glyphosate carries much lighter δ18op values as explained above which brings the isotope values close to equilibrium which is lighter 15 83 0 31 due to the lighter water oxygen isotopes the gap between the two treatments was 0 8 and then increased to 2 3 due to the large contribution of lighter isotopes of glyphosate derived pi but with the enhancement of microbe turnover it decreased again but still 1 6 off at the end of the incubation the observed results explained above provide several new insights on degradation of glyphosate and its metabolites and recycling of glyphosate derived p and together have several implications on the fate and impact of glyphosate in soils first it proves that the isotope signature of glyphosate degradation can be detected in the experiments mimicking environmental systems second it indicates that the degradation of glyphosate is faster than the microbial uptake and turn over of p so that the unique signature could be measured at the early to middle stage of the reaction third if the δ18op values of the p derived from organic compounds are farther closer to the equilibrium range compared to those present in situ they could easily shift overprint bulk isotope value due to mixing leading to the inacurate estimation of the biological activities 3 4 microbial turnover of p in the soil water system to evaluate the extent of p taken up and recycled by soil microorganisms the p turnover was calculated from the starting δ18op values δ18op t0 at 0 h measured values at time t δ18op t and the equilibrium values δ18op eq 4 p t u r n o v e r δ 18 o p t δ 18 o p t o δ 18 o p e q δ 18 o p t 100 as the equation shows the closer the values of δ18op t0 to δ18op eq the higher the microbial turnover efficiency the results show that pi in the control experiment was rapidly exchanged by soil microorganisms and driven closer to the equilibrium values with the turnover efficiency of 22 28 at 56 d and 45 48 at 161 d in two 18o labeled waters fig 8 as expected the efficiency of p turnover was similar irrespective of the starting isotopic values of 18o labeled water 6 51 or 18 27 in the glyphosate spiked experiments the δ18op value at time t δ18op t spike is the sum of glyphosate derived pi δ18op t gly and the original pi from control soil δ18op t con which can be calcualted from a simple mass balance equation as follows 5 δ 18 o p t s p i k e x δ 18 o p t g l y 1 x δ 18 o p t c o n where x is the fraction of pi derived from glyphosate in the spiked samples we calculated the starting isotope values of glyphosate derived pi in two 18o labeled water systems at 0 h using previous results li et al 2016 which are 6 92 and 12 14 in 6 51 and 18 27 waters respectively based on the starting values of glyphosate derived pi its microbial turnover was calculated using equation 4 as shown in fig 8 the trend of p turnover in the soils receiving glyphosate derived pi was similar to that of control soil without glyphosate but the recycling efficiency was higher 67 75 overall phosphate oxygen isotopes allowed discrimination of sources and variable recycling efficiency of soil p vs glyphosate derived pi 3 5 glyphosate degradation pathways in soil to understand the degradation pathways and specific preferences in the soil system studied the released pi extractable from four pools were combined together the total p mass from glyphosate source was also calculated by adding glyphosate ampa and released pi and are shown in fig 3b the released pi steadily increased and reached the peak concentration around 56 d ampa remained at the accumulation stage and started to degraded at that time only when more than 80 of glyphosate was already degraded there was slight decrease in total p from original concentration of 4 92 μmol g at the early stage of degradation and then remained almost constant during the incubation period consider the efficient extraction of the glyphosate derived pi it implies that there might be some other non detected p speciation during the early stage of glyphosate degradation besides glyphosate ampa and inorganic p a potential p compound could be methylphosphonic acid which can be generated synchronously if glycine forms directly from glyphosate based on the data generated in this study and foregoing assumptions and published results jaisi et al 2016 zelenkova and vinokurova 2008 revised pathways and temporal preference of glyphosate degradation in the soil water system is proposed and shown in fig 9 under the action of soil microorganisms at the early stage of degradation glyphosate is cleaved at c 3 n position to form glycine and methylphosphonic acid the latter one is further degraded to form pi which accumulates in the system another bond cleavage occurs at c 2 n position and form ampa and glyoxylic acid ampa accumulates at the late stage of degradation no sarcosine was generated in the soil water system in this study so it is not the required intermediate metabolite to form glycine 4 conclusion and implications in this study we studied degradation glyphosate and its metabolites and successfully utilized phosphate oxygen isotopes to confirm the biological availability of glyphosate derived p in the simulated soil water system the broader conclusions derived from this study and the implications thereof are as follows 1 a satisfactory method of extraction and separation of glyphosate and its major metabolites in soil was developed which could be used to identify the fate of glyphosate in a variety of environments the absence of degradation in sterilized soil showed the soil microorganisms play the essential role on the degradation of glyphosate temporal presence of glycine and ampa varied as well as their microbial uptake and degradation ampa was found to be 3 6 times resistant than glyphosate against degradation which brings a higher concern to the safety of environment 2 the distribution of glyphosate derived pi in a soil was investigated about half of the glyphosate derived pi transferred into the readily bioavailable p pool a slow but steady release of pi from the degradation of glyphosate could mean that its supply could be slightly more synchronous with plant p demand during plant growth especially becuase it is applied more than one time during a crop cycle this means that a higher proportion of glyphosate derived p than p from commercial fertilizers which release p all at once could be taken up by plants 3 glyphosate derived pi has a distinct isotopic signature and can aid in identification of its source the natural environment however is complex and could pose additional challenges most likely due to the low content of glyphosate and inappropriate sampling time could miss to detect significant offset of isotope values this is because isotope signature could be erased or overprinted due to biological cycling of glyphosate derived p 4 18o labeling in water and application of phosphate oxygen isotope method allowed explicit understanding of microbial uptake and extent of biological turnover of glyphosate derived p the microbial turnover of original p in soil and glyphosate derived p was comparable but it was found that the microorganisms were more efficient to utilize and recycle glyphosate derived p the research tool developed could be further used to investigate the extent of microbial activities in soils and other natural environments declaration of interest statement none author agreement this manuscript has not been published is not currently submitted for

18579,glyphosate the most commonly used herbicide in the world can be degraded into more toxic and persistent products such as aminomethylphosphonic acid ampa or non toxic products such as sarcosine and glycine in this study we used liquid chromatography mass spectrometry lc ms and electrospray ionization esi source q extractive orbitrap mass spectrometry esi orbitrap ms to identify glyphosate degradation products and combined with sequential extraction and stable isotopes to investigate the degradation of glyphosate and transformation of phosphorous p product in a soil water system the lc ms and esi orbitrap ms results showed that glycine formed during the early stage but was rapidly utilized by soil microorganisms ampa started to accumulate at the late stage and was found to be 3 6 times more resistant than glyphosate against degradation while no sarcosine was formed the 18o labeling and phosphate oxygen isotope results allowed a clear distinction of the fraction of inorganic p pi derived from glyphosate about half of which was then rapidly taken up and recycled by soil microorganisms our results provide the first evidence of the preferential utilization of glyphosate derived pi by microorganisms in the soil water system the rapid cycling of pi derived from this disregarded source has important implications on nutrient management as well as water quality graphical abstract image 1 keywords glyphosate biotic degradation phosphorus stable isotopes microbial turnover 1 introduction glyphosate n phosphonomethyl glycine is an effective broad spectrum herbicide its application has dramatically increased since the introduction of genetically engineered herbicide tolerant crops in 1996 dill et al 2010 it has been the most heavily used pesticide in the agricultural sector in recent years with an estimated 130 million kilograms in the u s in 2016 usgs 2016 glyphosate degradation is accomplished mainly by various soil microorganisms rueppel et al 1977 sviridov et al 2011 zhan et al 2018 the degradation occurs either through c n bond cleavage which forms aminomethylphosphonic acid ampa a more toxic and resistant metabolite than glyphosate or through c p bond cleavage which yields much safer products sarcosine and then glycine unlike ampa sarcosine is barely detected in the environment wang et al 2016 aside from pure culture experiments zhan et al 2018 the reason for this discrepancy is still unclear but it might be due to the rapid oxidation of sarcosine inefficient extraction from soil matrix or present below the limit of detection although early assessments suggested low acute toxicity of glyphosate and ampa their possible chronic health effects on animals and humans have been reported to be higher in recent studies balbuena et al 2015 van bruggen et al 2018 moreover the report from the international agency for research on cancer iarc which classified glyphosate as a probable carcinogen to humans iarc 2015 has triggered fierce controversy in the public and within regulatory bodies usepa 2017 strong interaction of glyphosate and ampa with soils clays and organic matter bring a concern of potentially contaminating drinking water usepa 2015 this highlights the need to study glyphosate and its metabolites transformation and the preference of the degradation pathways in the system that are relevant to natural water soil environment degradation products from glyphosate eventually generate inorganic forms of carbon nitrogen and phosphorus isolated bacterial and fungal strains have been reported to utilize one or more nutritional elements c n and p in glyphosate see review by zhan et al 2018 little information however has been reported in terms of glyphosate utilization in soil or under other natural environment borggaard and gimsing 2008 wang et al 2016 and the fate of p derived from glyphosate in p rich agricultural soils are unknown given that a very small increase in p concentration due to its low requirement compared to other major nutrients 106c 16n 1p redfield 1958 can cause severe impacts on water quality such as promoting hypoxia and eutrophication therefore the role of glyphosate derived p loading cannot be ignored the sorption of p onto soil organic matter minerals strongly affects its mobilization and bioavailability the hedley sequential extraction method and modification thereof hedley et al 1982 tiessen et al 1984 have been used to separate and characterize different soil p pools and their availability as well as to estimate need for fertilizer on crops most recently phosphate oxygen isotope has emerged as novel research tool and is combined with sequential extraction methods to investigate the bioavailability turnover and transformation of p in soil and other environment gooddy et al 2016 jaisi et al 2017 joshi et al 2016 pistocchi et al 2017 the stable isotope ratios of o in pi δ18op serves as a tracer of p due to its unique isotope effects i temperature dependent equilibrium isotope effects due to the rapid o isotope exchange between dissolved pi and water catalyzed by pyrophosphatase enzyme commonly present in organisms longinelli and nuti 1973 chang and blake 2015 and ii kinetic isotope effects catalyzed by other phosphatase enzymes during the degradation of organic p compounds which partially inherit isotope signatures from the parent molecules liang and blake 2009 sun et al 2017 von sperber et al 2015 the current state of basic and applied research in isotope and molecular separation methods provides a platform for studying the isotope exchange and microbial turnover of p during glyphosate biodegradation in soils and discriminating the particular source of p undergoing a specific pathway of cycling in the environment the major aim of this research was to study glyphosate degradation and the fate of glyphosate derived p in the water soil system especially on its uptake and cycling by soil microorganisms to do so we developed a liquid chromatography mass spectrometry lc ms method to detect and quantify glyphosate and its degradation products and then calculate their half lives in the soil water environment distribution of different p pools in soils was analyzed using the hedley sequential extraction method a refined isotope method was implemented to identify p availability and microbial turnover during glyphosate degradation in the soil incubated with 18o labeled water overall these methodological advances in metabolite identification p distribution and isotopic signature tracking have brought forward a new dimension to better understand glyphosate degradation in the natural environment and cycling of p derived from glyphosate 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagent and chemicals glyphohsate 96 aminomethyl phosphonic acid 98 and 9 fluorenyl methoxycarbonyl chloride fmoc cl 97 were obtained from sigma aldrich isotope labeled compounds including glyphosate 2 13c 15n glycine d5 and sarcosine d3 methyl d3 were purchased from sigma aldrich other chemicals including glycine 99 and sarcosine 98 were purchased either from acros organics or fisher scientific all the reagents were of analytical grade and stock solution were prepared with di water 2 2 soil collection and incubation a typical silt loam soil 0 15 cm depth from the agricultural experiment station research farm at the university of delaware was used in this study the detailed information about the soil characterization has been reported in a previous publication joshi et al 2016 after removing any plant residues and granular rock particles the soil samples were air dried homogenized passed through a 2 mm sieve and stored until analyses a flowchart of the experimental and analytical approach used is shown in fig 1 the first degradation experiment was run to identify glyphosate and its degradation products in soil as well as to determine the degradation kinetics and half lives of major products the soil was incubated with 1 μmol g unlabeled glyphosate at 20 c in the dark with 60 water content for 175 d a separate experiment with dual isotope 13c and 15n labeled glyphosate 1 μmol g spiked in soil was performed for 35 d to accurately identify degradation products the control experiment was performed under the same condition but without glyphosate the natural soil incubation included both biotic and abiotic degradations identical experiment run with autoclaved water and soil served as abiotic degradation at selected time points 5 g subsamples were collected into 50 ml centrifuge tubes and stored at 20 c until further analysis all experiments were run in duplicate under the same condition in order to identify p distribution and bioavailability during glyphosate degradation the second set of experiments was performed in two 18o labeled waters δ18oh2o 6 51 and 18 27 to collect sufficient p for isotope analyses 5 μmol g unlabeled glyphosate was spiked into 300 g soil and incubated with 600 ml 18o labeled water at 20 c in the dark for 161 d the spiked glyphosate concentration is much higher than application dose in agriculture about 1 kg ha but is required to obtain reliable phosphate isotopic analyses the experimental containers were tightly capped to avoid any water evaporation that compromises the water oxygen isotopes the containers were shaken every day for 15 min to homogenize the system and then briefly ventilated to replenish ambient oxygen and to preserve the oxic condition the control experiments were run under the same condition but in the absence of glyphosate subsampling and processing followed a similar procedure as described above 2 3 extraction and analyses of glyphosate ampa glycine and sarcosine the extraction of glyphosate ampa glycine and sarcosine was based on the published method ibáñez et al 2005 briefly 1 g lyophilized soil samples degradation experiments were extracted with 5 ml 0 6 m koh for 1 h by shaking at 140 rpm then centrifuged at 2755 g for 30 min one ml of supernatant was removed and neutralized by hcl and then 0 12 ml of borate buffer ph 9 and 0 12 ml fmoc cl 12 g l were added and shaken for 1 min on a vortex mixer after an overnight reaction at room temperature the mixture was filtered with a 0 45 μm syringe filter for lc ms analysis glyphosate ampa glycine and sarcosine standards were prepared to develop the separation method by using an acclaim 120 c18 column 2 1 250 mm under a gradient eluent program after testing and running several programs the optimized gradient was identified to be effective with a mixture of two mobile phases with a flow rate of 0 35 ml min with a acetonitrile and b 5 mmol l hac nh4ac 0 6 min 20 40 a 80 60 b 6 9 min 40 75 a 60 25 b 9 10 2 min 75 100 a 65 0 b 10 2 12 min 100 a 0 b 12 12 1 min 100 20 a 0 80 b 12 1 14 min 20 a 80 b the chromatographic separation for each sample required 14 min glyphosate and its degradation products were identified and quantified by a waters single quadrupole lc ms equipped with pda and sq detector the optimized ms parameters are as follows esi positive mode capillary voltage 3 kv cone voltage 40 v desolvation temperature 200 c desolvation gas flow 650 l hr and full mass scan from 100 to 500 m z the unlabeled glyphosate and labeled sarcosine were quantified with labeled glyphosate and unlabeled sarcosine as internal standards similarly labeled glycine was quantified by labeled glycine as an external standard to avoid any interference from glycine already present in soil ampa was determined by the soil spiked external standards labeled glyphosate degradation samples were analyzed with a high resolution mass spectrometry q extractive orbitrap mass spectrometry thermo germany at the university of delaware orbitrap ms data were acquired under the positive mode with scan range from 100 to 1000 m z glycine formation during labeled glyphosate degradation were determined by external standard prepared by spiking labeled glycine in soil to avoid the interference of soil original glycine the extraction and derivatization methods for glyphosate ampa glycine and sarcosine were validated by spiking the known amounts of these compounds in soil the recovery ranged from 85 to 107 for glyphosate 79 93 for ampa 74 88 for glycine and 80 97 for sarcosine with rsd below 20 which is considered satisfactory the limit of quantification loq for glyphosate and ampa is 10 nmol g soil and for glycine and sarcosine is 50 nmol g in single quadrupole lc ms while it was largely improved by using orbitrap 0 5 nmol g 2 4 distribution of p derived from glyphosate into soil p pools to differentiate and quantify the distribution of glyphosate derived p in soil samples from both control and glyphosate spiked soils from the second set of experiments were analyzed a 0 3 g lyophilized soil was weighed and extracted with 30 ml di water for 2 h using the modified hedley et al 1982 sequential extraction method tiessen et al 1984 the supernatant was collected as h2o extractable pi most labile pi and residual soil was extracted with 30 ml of 0 5 m nahco3 for 16 h to collect labile and weakly adsorbed pi inorganic p from those two pools represents microbially available pi tiessen and moir 1993 the soil was further extracted for 16 h first with 30 ml of 0 1 m naoh and then with 1 m hcl to obtain the naoh extractable pi strongly sorbed p fixed by fe and al oxides and hcl extractable pi strongly fixed ca p respectively the concentration of pi in each pool was measured by using the phosphomolybdate blue method murphy and riley 1962 the residual p in the soils after the completion of sequential extraction was quantified using icp ms 2 5 measurement of oxygen isotope ratios soil samples from control and glyphosate spiked 5 μmol g experiments with two 18o labeled waters were centrifuged first to extract waters to measure water oxygen isotopes δ18ow by co2 equilibration method cohn and urey 1938 the measurement was done in a finnigan gasbench ii coupled with an isotope ratio mass spectrometer irms thermo darmstadt germany in the environmental biogeochemistry laboratory at the university of delaware to understand the p bioavailability the h2o and nahco3 extracted pi pools were combined and processed for the measurement of phosphate oxygen isotope ratios δ18op five grams of lyophilized soil samples from the second set of degradation experiments were processed following the joshi et al 2018 method to purify and finally convert pi into silver phosphate the o isotope ratios were measured by a thermochemolysis elemental analyzer tc ea couples with irms all isotopes from samples and standards were run at least in triplicate the measured δ18op values of pi were calibrated against two silver phosphate standards yr 1ar 2 and yr 3 2 with the δ18op values of 5 49 and 33 63 respectively similarly the δ18ow values of porewater were calibrated with two usgs water standards δ18ow values of 1 97 and 9 25 respectively all isotope values are reported in per mil relative to the vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow 3 results and discussions 3 1 degradation kinetics of glyphosate and its metabolites the typical chromatography spectra of glyphosate ampa sarcosine and glycine are shown in fig 2 based on the lc ms results the concentrations of the compounds were calculated and are shown in fig 3 glyphosate gradually degraded over time and the extent of degradation reached 80 by 35 d of incubation but traces of residual glyphosate were still detected until 175 d ampa the major metabolite of glyphosate appear after several days and accumulated during incubation and reached its maximum concentration at 35 and 56 d in the experiment with 1 μmol g and 5 μmol g glyphosate respectively afterwards its degradation dominated over accumulation neither the degradation of glyphosate nor the formation of ampa was observed in the sterilized soil incubation abiotic only experiment indicating microorganisms play a crucial role in degrading glyphosate in soils the degradation of glyphosate with time is often described according to first order kinetics beulke and brown 2001 1 ln c c0 kt 2 t1 2 ln2 k where c 0 is the initial concentration c is the concentration at time t and k is the degradation rate constant the maximum accumulated concentration of ampa is used as its initial concentration since more than 80 of glyphosate was degraded at the time the results show that both glyphosate and ampa degradation follow first order kinetics with a strong correlation coefficient r2 0 85 the calculated half lives of glyphosate under two sets of experiments are 28 9 and 31 5 d respectively consistent with the published results al rajab and schiavon 2010 a calculation based on the maximum amount of ampa accumulated in the soil shows that the ampa accounts for 48 68 of the products from glyphosate degradation it shows much longer half lives 138 6 and 173 3 d which highlights the high risk because of its toxicity and persistence in the environment glycine is a common amino acid and commonly present in soil and other environment the isotope labeled glyphosate provides the reliability of detection because the labeled element is present in glycine as well labeled glycine appeared only after few days accumulated and reached the highest concentration after 5 d and then decreased but was still detectable after 35 d incubation fig 3a the concentration of labeled glycine is low probably due to glycine derived from glyphosate was readily incorporated into microbial biomass son after it formed results from a separate labeled glycine incubation experiment showed a rapid decline of soil spiked glycine 1 μmol g with half life of 0 89 d fig 4 abiotic experiment showed no significant decline in glycine concentration in sterilized soil validating methodology as well as indicating that soil microorganisms play a major role in glycine transformation a recent study of labeled glyphosate reported the distribution of 13c and 15n into several amino acids including glycine wang et al 2016 which our results corroborate these findings together confirm that glyphosate derived glycine in the experiments should have rapidly utilized and metabolized by soil microorganisms sarcosine is a commonly recognized precursor to glycine during glyphosate degradation primarily on pure cultures that include bacteria isolated from soils ermakova et al 2017 moore et al 1983 zhan et al 2018 but rarely from the natural or simulated environments wang et al 2016 in this study sarcosine was not detected in any soil treatments including labeled glyphosate and high glyphosate 5 μmol g incubations there might be three possibilities for the observed results inefficient extraction from soil fast oxidation of sarcosine or presence below the detection limits of the analytical method however the recovery test performed by artificially spiking sarcosine in the same soil revealed that the method used could efficiently extract and accurately quantify sarcosine yield 80 97 the individual incubation experiment showed that sarcosine could be degraded fast in the biotic experiment with half life of 0 99 d but no significant decline in sterilized soil which indicates degradation possible only by soil microorganisms these lines of evidences suggest analytical method is not the reason particularly since the high resolution obitrap ms detection limit of 0 5 nmol g of sarcosine and glycine was used in the labeled glyphosate degradation experiments soil samples were collected in several time points 0 1 2 4 h until 35 d the analytical method used successfully monitored the glycine formation and accumulation under extremely low concentration if sarcosine was actually formed as a precursor to glycine it should have detected by obitrap ms since both sarcosine and glycine have similar half lives in a recent study sarcosine was not detected in the abiotic degradation of glyphosate catalyzed by mn minerals li et al 2018 these authors used advanced analytical methods including nmr hplc and density functional theory dft based electronic structure calculations and concluded that sarcosine was not a necessary intermediate product overall the reliable extraction and analytical methods and intensive time point sampling verified that sarcosine was not formed during glyphosate degradation by soil microorganisms in this study 3 2 distribution of glyphosate derived phosphorous in soil concentrations of four soil pi pools in the control and glyphosate spiked soils during the second set of incubations are shown in fig 5 the experiments performed in two 18o labeled waters are considered duplicates because the difference in water oxygen isotopes does not impact the kinetics and extent of glyphosate degradation clearly the control soil without glyphosate already contains high pi and concentrations of pi in different pools vary it is noticeable however that the concentrations of pi in these four pools remained essentially constant during the long term incubation with h2o pi 1 01 0 08 μmol g nahco3 pi 4 21 0 23 μmol g naoh pi 10 08 0 91 μmol g and hcl pi 0 52 0 06 μmol g this means that no significant transfer of p pools and organic inorganic transformation occurred during the long term incubation the naoh pi pool was the largest indicating that fe and al minerals associated p is the major p sink in this soil which is consistent with several other soils guo et al 2000 tiessen et al 1984 the results from the experiment in which glyphosate was spiked show that pi derived from glyphosate transferred into different pools resulting in an increase of corresponding pool size the maximum concentration of h2o pi was 2 11 μmol g at 70 d of incubation the difference between control soil without glyphosate and glyphosate spiked soil shows that there was 1 06 μmol g glyphosate derived pi transferred into this pool similarly a significant net increase of pi was observed in nahco3 pi 1 40 μmol g naoh pi 1 93 μmol g and hcl pi 0 23 μmol g pools with the highest pi concentrations measured around 56 126 d of incubation it is interesting that the order of p pool was the same as that in the original control soil naoh pi nahco3 pi h2o pi hcl pi calculated p mass balance shows that the total increase in pi among 4 pools was 4 30 μmol g at the end of incubation which accounts for 86 of spiked glyphosate 5 μmol g the residual p in the control and glyphosate spiked soils were similar 7 99 0 69 and 7 67 0 69 μmol g respectively indicating that there was no significant incorporation of glyphosate derived p in the residual p pool it also means that the hedley extraction could efficiently extract almost all p and account p derived from biodegradation of glyphosate in terms of distribution pi derived from glyphosate fig 6 the h2o and nahco3 pi pools which are considered readily available pi for uptake by microorganisms and plant roots received almost half 44 of it meanwhile around 33 38 of glyphosate p transformed into the naoh pi pool an unavailable or moderately bioavailable p pool depending on the soil p conditions and plant efficiency and time helfenstein et al 2018 this means that this conditionally unavailable p pool might be further transported into open water systems by leaching or soil erosion and could increase the risk of polluting waters the hcl pi which is not directly utilized by plants and microorganisms and normally remains as an unavailable p pool in agricultural soil only received 3 5 of p derived from glyphosate these results highlight the fact that p load derived from a large amount of glyphosate application with estimated 130 million kg used in the u s usgs 2016 cannot be ignored given that the pi derived from glyphosate is steady means that it was gradually released as the degradation continues and distributed more into the bioavailable pool and it may be a better p source for plants phosphorus fertilizer is the major p supply for plants with estimated 4 billion kg used in the u s in 2014 usepa 2018 with 50 70 use efficiency roberts and johnston 2015 however its fast p release kinetics do not match the dynamic needs of different crop growth stages well liu et al 2014 and this offset causes nutrient loss from soil to aquatic systems given the slow but steady p release from glyphosate degradation it might be slightly more synchronous than commercial fertilizers but still too fast than plant needs furthermore multiple sprays of glyphosate during the crop lifetime average of 1 6 times per crop year usgs 2016 support the possibility of fractionating more into bioavailable p that plants can readily take up this demands reconsidering glyphosate not only use as a herbicide but a bonus p source to crops and should be included in estimations of crop p needs to improve the p efficiency of plant uptake as well reducing the p loss from agricultural soils 3 3 bioavailability of glyphosate derived phosphorus once inside the cell pi is involved in several metabolic reactions catalyzed by enzymes including incorporation into cell biomass and atp adp conversion one of the unique enzymes is pyrophosphatase ppase which is highly conserved across all three domains of life catalyzes the hydrolysis of pyrophosphate into pi this is a reversible reaction cohn 1953 and leads to exchange of all four o atoms in pi with o in ambient water and thus achieves o isotopic equilibrium between phosphate and water the equilibrium isotope depends on the temperature and water oxygen isotope value chang and blake 2015 to further test the bioavailability and rate of microbial utilization of glyphosate derived pi phosphate oxygen isotopes δ18op of pi in the soil incubated with and without glyphosate were measured and compared with the equilibrium isotope values calculated from the temperature and oxygen isotopes of water δ18ow in the experiments the δ18ow values remained constant at 6 51 0 30 and 18 27 0 12 for two 18o labeled water experiments in the long term incubation except at the end of the experiment 161 d when an inadvertent evaporation resulted in slight enrichment of isotopes 4 90 and 20 71 respectively the expected isotopic equilibrium value δ18op eq was calculated based on the chang and blake 2015 equation as 3 δ 18 o p e q e 14 43 t 0 0265 δ 18 o w 1000 1000 the δ18op eq values in the experiments incubated with 6 51 and 18 27 water are 15 83 0 31 and 41 16 0 12 fig 7 respectively and remained constant during the incubation period except at 161d in which water mass was not conserved the starting isotope values of extracted pi were consistent in all treatments 20 77 0 26 21 02 0 10 21 38 0 42 and 21 21 0 16 in two controls soil without glyphosate and two glyphosate spiked experiments with 6 51 and 18 27 18o labeled waters respectively it means that there are no different o sources or contaminants that might have impacted isotope values during the incubation period besides the degradation of glyphosate the measured δ18op values in the bioavailable p in 18o spiked 18 27 water became gradually heavier fig 7a shifting towards the equilibrium values 41 16 and reached 32 04 at the end of incubation this result reveals the rapid uptake of the available p by soil microorganisms and the release of cycled p back to the soil at the early stage δ18op values of pi in the soil spiked with glyphosate were consistent with those in original control experiments however they became lighter after 14 d and remained 1 2 2 5 lighter for a long period this is due to the contribution from a much lighter isotope value of pi 4 9 derived from glyphosate li et al 2016 the newly derived pi from glyphosate degradation mixed with soil pi pool and turned them into isotopic lighter and away from the equilibrium value around 41 2 this result is consistent with pi distribution that pi was heavily released from glyphosate from 14 d to 84 d fig 5 and preserving isotope record of the lighter glyphosate derived pi in the system see fig 5 however the difference in isotope values between those two treatments gradually narrowed and eventually erased at 161 d indicating that the soil microorganisms were efficient to uptake and cycle almost all of bioavailable p in the soil both from originally present soil and from glyphosate derived pi the isotope trend in the experiments performed in 6 51 water fig 7b is comparable to heavy water but with a minor difference for example the δ18op values in glyphosate spiked soil became much lighter and reached the equilibrium value sooner than those from control soil without glyphosate the reason is that the pi derived from glyphosate carries much lighter δ18op values as explained above which brings the isotope values close to equilibrium which is lighter 15 83 0 31 due to the lighter water oxygen isotopes the gap between the two treatments was 0 8 and then increased to 2 3 due to the large contribution of lighter isotopes of glyphosate derived pi but with the enhancement of microbe turnover it decreased again but still 1 6 off at the end of the incubation the observed results explained above provide several new insights on degradation of glyphosate and its metabolites and recycling of glyphosate derived p and together have several implications on the fate and impact of glyphosate in soils first it proves that the isotope signature of glyphosate degradation can be detected in the experiments mimicking environmental systems second it indicates that the degradation of glyphosate is faster than the microbial uptake and turn over of p so that the unique signature could be measured at the early to middle stage of the reaction third if the δ18op values of the p derived from organic compounds are farther closer to the equilibrium range compared to those present in situ they could easily shift overprint bulk isotope value due to mixing leading to the inacurate estimation of the biological activities 3 4 microbial turnover of p in the soil water system to evaluate the extent of p taken up and recycled by soil microorganisms the p turnover was calculated from the starting δ18op values δ18op t0 at 0 h measured values at time t δ18op t and the equilibrium values δ18op eq 4 p t u r n o v e r δ 18 o p t δ 18 o p t o δ 18 o p e q δ 18 o p t 100 as the equation shows the closer the values of δ18op t0 to δ18op eq the higher the microbial turnover efficiency the results show that pi in the control experiment was rapidly exchanged by soil microorganisms and driven closer to the equilibrium values with the turnover efficiency of 22 28 at 56 d and 45 48 at 161 d in two 18o labeled waters fig 8 as expected the efficiency of p turnover was similar irrespective of the starting isotopic values of 18o labeled water 6 51 or 18 27 in the glyphosate spiked experiments the δ18op value at time t δ18op t spike is the sum of glyphosate derived pi δ18op t gly and the original pi from control soil δ18op t con which can be calcualted from a simple mass balance equation as follows 5 δ 18 o p t s p i k e x δ 18 o p t g l y 1 x δ 18 o p t c o n where x is the fraction of pi derived from glyphosate in the spiked samples we calculated the starting isotope values of glyphosate derived pi in two 18o labeled water systems at 0 h using previous results li et al 2016 which are 6 92 and 12 14 in 6 51 and 18 27 waters respectively based on the starting values of glyphosate derived pi its microbial turnover was calculated using equation 4 as shown in fig 8 the trend of p turnover in the soils receiving glyphosate derived pi was similar to that of control soil without glyphosate but the recycling efficiency was higher 67 75 overall phosphate oxygen isotopes allowed discrimination of sources and variable recycling efficiency of soil p vs glyphosate derived pi 3 5 glyphosate degradation pathways in soil to understand the degradation pathways and specific preferences in the soil system studied the released pi extractable from four pools were combined together the total p mass from glyphosate source was also calculated by adding glyphosate ampa and released pi and are shown in fig 3b the released pi steadily increased and reached the peak concentration around 56 d ampa remained at the accumulation stage and started to degraded at that time only when more than 80 of glyphosate was already degraded there was slight decrease in total p from original concentration of 4 92 μmol g at the early stage of degradation and then remained almost constant during the incubation period consider the efficient extraction of the glyphosate derived pi it implies that there might be some other non detected p speciation during the early stage of glyphosate degradation besides glyphosate ampa and inorganic p a potential p compound could be methylphosphonic acid which can be generated synchronously if glycine forms directly from glyphosate based on the data generated in this study and foregoing assumptions and published results jaisi et al 2016 zelenkova and vinokurova 2008 revised pathways and temporal preference of glyphosate degradation in the soil water system is proposed and shown in fig 9 under the action of soil microorganisms at the early stage of degradation glyphosate is cleaved at c 3 n position to form glycine and methylphosphonic acid the latter one is further degraded to form pi which accumulates in the system another bond cleavage occurs at c 2 n position and form ampa and glyoxylic acid ampa accumulates at the late stage of degradation no sarcosine was generated in the soil water system in this study so it is not the required intermediate metabolite to form glycine 4 conclusion and implications in this study we studied degradation glyphosate and its metabolites and successfully utilized phosphate oxygen isotopes to confirm the biological availability of glyphosate derived p in the simulated soil water system the broader conclusions derived from this study and the implications thereof are as follows 1 a satisfactory method of extraction and separation of glyphosate and its major metabolites in soil was developed which could be used to identify the fate of glyphosate in a variety of environments the absence of degradation in sterilized soil showed the soil microorganisms play the essential role on the degradation of glyphosate temporal presence of glycine and ampa varied as well as their microbial uptake and degradation ampa was found to be 3 6 times resistant than glyphosate against degradation which brings a higher concern to the safety of environment 2 the distribution of glyphosate derived pi in a soil was investigated about half of the glyphosate derived pi transferred into the readily bioavailable p pool a slow but steady release of pi from the degradation of glyphosate could mean that its supply could be slightly more synchronous with plant p demand during plant growth especially becuase it is applied more than one time during a crop cycle this means that a higher proportion of glyphosate derived p than p from commercial fertilizers which release p all at once could be taken up by plants 3 glyphosate derived pi has a distinct isotopic signature and can aid in identification of its source the natural environment however is complex and could pose additional challenges most likely due to the low content of glyphosate and inappropriate sampling time could miss to detect significant offset of isotope values this is because isotope signature could be erased or overprinted due to biological cycling of glyphosate derived p 4 18o labeling in water and application of phosphate oxygen isotope method allowed explicit understanding of microbial uptake and extent of biological turnover of glyphosate derived p the microbial turnover of original p in soil and glyphosate derived p was comparable but it was found that the microorganisms were more efficient to utilize and recycle glyphosate derived p the research tool developed could be further used to investigate the extent of microbial activities in soils and other natural environments declaration of interest statement none author agreement this manuscript has not been published is not currently submitted for
