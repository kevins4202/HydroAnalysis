eem combined with principal component coefficients parallel factor analyses parafac moving window two dimensional correlation spectroscopy mw2dcos and structural equation modeling sem eight components were extracted from the titrants through eem parafac i e phenol like substance c1 tyrosine like substance c2 visible tryptophan like substance c3 ultraviolet tryptophan like substance c4 recent biological production c5 wastewater derived organic matter c6 microbial humic like substance c7 and fulvic like substance c8 interestingly ndom only contained c1 c3 c5 and c8 while nearly all components were found in rdom except for c2 and udom except for c4 the f value of c1 1 239 in ndom was much higher than those in rdom 0 134 and udom 0 115 so was of c8 it indicated that phenol like and fulvic like derived from autochthonous sources exhibited great binding ratios in the complexation with cu ii moreover c3 and c5 from udom exhibited higher f values 0 591 and 1 983 than those from ndom and rdom suggesting that cu ii has a great binding capacity on protein like from domestic and industrial wastewater the mw2dcos revealed that phenol like and protein like in ndom and rdom were essential for the binding of 160 μmol l 1 cu ii whereas fulvic like in ndom and udom could react significantly with 10 μmol l 1 cu ii based on sem cu ii concentration had a negative direct effect on the fluorescence intensity of c7 or c8 whereas it showed an indirect positive effect on c7 or c8 through influencing c5 so was c6 it suggested that cu ii showed an indirect positive effect on the c8 this study might present a further comprehend of the environmental behaviors of cu ii in rivers graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords cu ii dom binding fluorescence excitation emission matrix parallel factor principal component coefficients two dimensional correlation spectroscopy structural equation modeling data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction heavy metals in aquatic ecosystem have attracted a widespread concern due to their potential toxic action on aquatic microorganisms which may raise a severe challenge to prevent water pollution in rivers or lakes zhou et al 2019 du et al 2018 tandon et al 2013 hence it will be indispensable for insight into environmental behaviors of heavy metals in aquatic ecosystem there are two major sources of potential heavy metals in aquatic ecosystem i e natural and anthropogenic sources then heavy metal pollution might be mainly attributed to the latter which included domestic and industrial wastewater discharges fossil fuel combustion automobile exhaust residential population density and atmospheric deposition islam et al 2015 sekabira et al 2010 dissolved organic matter dom is a heterogeneous and complex mixture consisting of organic molecules i e polysaccharide protein humic substances and hydrophilic organic acid and functional groups i e phenolic carboxylic and carbonyl hu et al 2019 xu et al 2018 as the most active ingredient in aquatic ecosystem dom has a significant effect on environmental behaviors of heavy metals by complexation which is associated with speciation distribution bioavailability transformation and toxicity zhu et al 2021 reports have demonstrated that dom could form combined pollutants with heavy metals which might restrict adsorption or precipitation of heavy metals in aquatic ecosystem aggravating metals environmental risks huang et al 2020 it is reported that dom fractions are strongly influenced by anthropogenic activities and early diagenesis xu et al 2016 hur et al 2014 the diversity of dom fractions may consequently impact the environmental behaviors of heavy metals in different ways thus in depth examination on the interactions of metals with dom from different origins could help uncover heavy metal movement and availability in aquatic ecosystem cu is considered as a target element based on its relatively high toxicity and abundance in aquatic ecosystem and universal application for insight into its complexation with dom hu et al 2019 xu et al 2018 xu et al 2013 cu is one of the most common metal pollutants in environment which mainly originated from the application of pesticides chemical fertilizers antifouling paints and construction materials liu et al 2022 despite a trace of cu is vital for living cells it could destroy the antioxidative defense system of many organisms in relatively high concentrations wu et al 2017 cu pollution could be generally relative to impacts of anthropogenic activities i e domestic agricultural industrial and mining activities furthermore previous studies reported that cu was sensitive to the participation of dom fractions whose biogeochemistry was deeply determined by its interactions with dom huang et al 2021 zhou et al 2019 at present several advanced technologies including fluorescence spectroscopy ultraviolet visible spectroscopy uv vis and fourier infrared spectroscopy ftir have been applied to probe the binding characteristics of metals dom guo et al 2022 yu et al 2019 hur and lee 2011 moreover fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem spectroscopy combined with parallel factor analysis parafac is extensively employed to describe the interactive mechanism of heavy metals with dom fractions which can present detailed information about compositions and relative content of dom as well as its environmental dynamics wang et al 2020 qian et al 2017 however the eem resolution might be immeasurably impacted by the inner filter effects of concentrated samples except for the rayleigh and raman scattering chemometrics methods based on multivariate statistics have been employed in performing the eem data for modified spectrum principal component analysis pca one of these techniques has been becoming popularity as a tool for food authentication and classification particularly in edible oil and wine the refolding 3 dimentional data from the pca can be operated to not only identify the key region of eem but also discriminate the samples al riza et al 2021 al riza et al 2019 nevertheless this technique does rarely implement for variable selection of fluorescence eem with some modification in the terrestrial aquatic ecosystem structural equation modeling sem is an efficient statistical tool since it can explicitly link empirical data to a theoretical model it is seldom presented that eem parafac coupled with sem is utilized to characterize heavy metals binding with dom fractions schmidt et al 2019 recently two dimensional correlation spectroscopy 2dcos has been broadly used to trace faint the subtle reactions of dom under external perturbations i e ph temperature and metal addition gao et al 2019 lee and hur 2016 noda 2016 for instance generalized 2dcos was applied for revealing the variations of dom components extracted by eem parafac under different treatments which could effectively elucidate the sequence of several fluorescence peaks in a unitary component zhu et al 2020 the hetero 2dcos might precisely reveal the changing order of different components in metals dom binding wu et al 2022 moving window two dimensional correlation spectroscopy mw2dcos advanced by thomas and richardson could be lightly employed to probe the perturbation induced spectral transition points on account of the correlation intensity along the disturbance variables direction zhou et al 2019 noda 2014 nevertheless few studies have reportedly used combinatorial techniques of generalized 2dcos hetero 2dcos and mw2dcos to reveal the variation in composition and molecular structure of dom fractions from different origins influenced by each level of cu ii all of these methods could provide new insight into dom conformations at the molecular level li et al 2021 baitapuhe river is a typical urbanized river across shenyang city in the northeast of china where rapid development of industry and livestock poultry breeding has induced a potential threat to water quality especially for cu pollution liu et al 2021b found that the cu concentration in hilly region was less than its background value 24 57 mg kg 1 for the soil in liaohe plain while the cu concentration in rural or urban regions was more than five times larger than the background value in this study the river is selected to explore the binding characteristics of cu ii with dom from different origins the intentions of our study are as follows 1 to characterize three types of dom obtained from the river across hilly rural and urban regions through eem parafac 2 to explore the binding characteristics of ndom rdom and udom fractions towards cu ii by a modified stern volar model 3 to elucidate the binding sequence and sites of dom with cu ii using generalized 2dcos hetero 2dcos and mw2dcos analyses 4 and to reveal the binding ability of cu ii with dom from three origins by sem 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling strategy and doc measurement more details regarding baitapuhe river in this research can be found in liu et al 2021a three kinds of surface water samples were collected from the hilly b1 rural b2 and urban regions b3 respectively and mixed thoroughly fig 1 subsequently the samples were all filtered through 0 45 μm acetate fiber filters and the filtrates were well known as dom solutions which were transported to laboratory immediately dom in the hilly region was less affected by anthropogenic activity which might be regarded as natural dissolved organic matter ndom dom from the river across rural region rdom could derive from the livestock and poultry breeding wastewater agricultural drainage and rural domestic sewage dom from the river across urban region udom was assigned to the effluents from industrial park wastewater treatment plant and partial domestic sewage here the dissolved organic carbon doc concentrations of dom solutions were determined by a toc analyzer toc vcpn shimadzu kyoto japan 2 2 titration experiment preceding the cu ii complexation experiment ndom rdom and udom solutions were diluted with milli q deionized water until the doc concentration was 5 mg l 1 so as to reduce the effect of internal filtration hu et al 2019 metal titrations were implemented by adding 0 1 mg l 1 cu no3 2 titrants into 50 ml dom samples results in that the gradients of cu ii concentration in the final solution were set from 0 to 200 μmol l 1 0 10 20 40 60 90 120 160 200 μmol l 1 particularly the adjunct quantity of cu ii was less than 5 of the solution to refrain the concentration influence larsson et al 2007 after the titrations process the ph was adjusted to 7 5 0 05 by adding 0 1 μmol l 1 hcl or naoh solutions chen et al 2015 to coincide with surface water in this study huang et al 2019 all solutions were shaken at 200 rpm in darkness and 25 for 24 h to reach binding equilibrium 2 3 eem and parafac eem scanning spectra of the titrants were detected by employing a fluorescence spectrophotometer f 7000 hitachi japan with three replicates making for 54 spectra the scan operated excitation wavelengths ex ranging from 200 to 450 nm and emission wavelengths em ranging from 260 to 500 nm with a stepwise increment of 5 nm ex and em silt widths were regulated to 5 nm with the scanning speed of 2400 nm min 1 to correct the inner filter effects milli q deionized water spectra were treated as the blank which was subtracted from all sample eem stedmon and bro 2008 principal component analysis was implemented to explore the eem data and identify important variables a detail introduction to the parsing process of pca has been described by al riza et al 2021 parafac modeling was performed to analyze the collected spectra by matlab r2017b mathworks natick ma usa with dom fluor toolbox parafac components were determined according to split half analysis and visual inspection and relative quantities of the individual fluorescent components were represented by their maximum fluorescence intensity fmax in this study eem data obtained from ndom rdom and udom binding with cu ii were loaded separately into the parafac analysis for directly comparing the binding properties of ndom rdom and udom with cu ii 2 4 complexation model the binding parameters of dom with cu ii were determined with the modified stern volmer model lehrer 1971 fluorescence intensities of components extracted from ndom rdom and udom were applied for the calculation of the fluorescent ligand ratio f and the stability constant k the equation was depicted as follows 1 f 0 f 0 f 1 f k c u i i 1 f where f0 and f are the fluorescence intensities of these components from eem spectra when no metal ions and cu ii ions are added respectively k represents the complexed stability of cu ii dom and f symptomatizes the binding proportion of dom fractions with cu ii 2 5 two dimensional correlation spectra analysis 2d cos was devoted to identifying the sequential variations and external perturbation threshold occurring in the eem spectra of ndom rdom and udom induced by cu ii as an external perturbation generalized 2dcos hetero 2dcos and mw2dcos were obtained by 2d shige software distributed from kwansei gakuin university japan detailed information has been exposited in previous literature the window size was set as 3 2m 1 for generating distinct mw2dcos spectrums 2 6 structural equation modeling as a statistical model sem has attracted extensive attention from environmentalists in recent years since it could plainly link empirical data to a theoretical model for denoting complex causal networks mathematically and testing the hypothesized interconnections in this study sem was employed to identify the interaction properties of fluorescence components in ndom rdom and udom with cu ii using amos 26 0 amos ibm usa 3 results and discussions 3 1 variable selection of eem data from cu ii dom binding properties of dom from different sources were analyzed in fig s1 and table s1 the eem data for each sample fig s2 was unfolded and concatenated to be a vector data type by which pca was implemented to identify the key region of fluorescence eem three principal components pc were found to be sufficient for representing over 99 of data variance the refolded absolute values of pc loading 1 to 3 were added up and then the sum of the absolute values of pc 1 3 loadings have been plotted fig 2 four discrete variables for excitation emission pairs were identified from the pca including three protein like substances ex em 220 300 220 335 and 270 320 nm and a humic like substance ex em 245 410 nm 2d scattering plots of pc 1 2 scores with different labeling were plotted to discriminate the samples fig 3 all samples were divided into three groups by the pc1 and pc2 loadings which represented more than 75 of the sample s variance group 1 including ndom samples in the first quadrant the group 2 containing rdom samples was in the second quadrant yet the group 3 comprised udom samples was in the third and fourth quadrant it was evident that samples were divided into three categories with significant regional characteristics hence pca was conducted on eem data of cu ii ndom fig s2a i cu ii rdom fig s2j r and cu ii udom fig s2s aa respectively there were three discrete variables in pc1 3 for cu ii ndom binding representing over 99 of data variance which included a broad peak ex em 220 335 nm and two weak shoulders ex em 220 295 270 325 nm fig 4 a the broad peak might be related to tyrosine like substances the first shoulder to ultraviolet tryptophan like substances and the second shoulder to visible tryptophan like substances for cu ii rdom binding pc coefficients 1 2 accounting for 99 of data variance were roughly similar to the pc coefficients 1 3 from ndom cu ii fig 4b however the visible tryptophan like in the former exhibited a red shift of ex 5 nm than that in the latter which attributed to greater amounts of conjugated aromatic p electron systems with electron withdrawing groups such as carbonyl containing substituents and carboxyl constituents song et al 2019 chen et al 2002 thus visible tryptophan like from cu ii rdom had greater amounts of carbonyl carboxyl groups than that from cu ii ndom for cu ii udom binding four discrete variables were revealed in pc coefficients 1 3 accounting for 99 of data variance a unique peak was identified in fig 4c which might be related to fulvic like substances 3 2 interaction of parafac components with cu ii parafac was applied respectively for eem data of cu ii ndom cu ii rdom and cu ii udom to extract the fluorescent components for the significant discrepancy in their spectral signatures parafac processing eem data fig s2 extracted eight components table s2 stedmon and bro 2008 all the identified components were compared with the openfluor model dataset with the fitting of 0 95 c1 could be assigned to a phenol like substance which appeared as precursors of lignin material spied in vascular plants d andrilli et al 2017 c2 with the wavelength of 215 260 300 nm ex em was regarded as tyrosine like substance derrien et al 2020 c3 and c4 were associated with tryptophan like substances representing biolabile or semibiolabile pools of dom podgorski et al 2018 bianchi et al 2014 c5 with the maxima at 220 335 nm generally connected with recent biological production dainard et al 2015 c6 was recognized as the protein like substance associated with wastewater derived organic matter wang et al 2020 c7 could be the combination of microbial humic like and tryptophan like concerning with biological production in surface water stedmon et al 2003 c8 exhibited at 245 275 nm 415 nm ex em which was regarded as fulvic like substance nimptsch et al 2015 huang et al 2015 bianchi et al 2014 additionally only four components c1 c3 c5 and c8 were recognized in ndom fig 5 while all components were nearly recognized in rdom except for c2 fig 6 and rdom except for c4 fig 7 the intensity variations of dom components with cu ii addition were displayed in fig 8 the cu ii quenching with c1 of dom in three regions exhibited a linear drop in dom notably for udom whose intensity almost dropped to zero at 200 μmol l 1 cu ii this was mainly attributed to the abundant active groups of phenol like such as aromatic ring structure aliphatic aromatic hydroxyl and quinone groups coble et al 2014 c2 was only found in udom with cu ii addition whose intensity initially increased rapidly and then decreased gradually interestingly the intensity of c3 in udom with cu ii addition presented an opposite trend of c2 moreover the intensities of c2 with cu ii addition showed a significant negative correlation to the corresponding intensities of c3 r 0 909 p 0 001 fig s6 indirectly demonstrated that c2 might be derived from the partial c3 binding with cu ii xing et al 2020 yamashita and jaffé 2008 the intensities of c3 binding with cu ii in ndom or udom showed a fluctuating small reduction indicating a low sensitivity of cu ii binding with c3 the intensities of c4 only occurring in rdom binding with cu ii were deeply quenched with cu ii addition which were attributed that c4 could be derived from livestock and poultry wastewater zhu et al 2021 similar to c1 cu ii played an essential quenching effect on c5 as its intensities in ndom dropped to 62 36 at 200 μmol l 1 cu ii addition 89 50 in rdom and 91 23 in udom the trend of cu ii binding with c8 was similar to c5 this was consistent with previous studies that fulvic like had a strong ability to combine with cu ii due to its abundant oxygen containing functional groups i e phenolic and carboxylic groups xu et al 2021 yan and korshin 2014 cu ii with high concentration 200 μmol l 1 quenched 19 95 of intensities for c6 in rdom and 39 27 of fluorescence intensities for c6 in udom it indicated that the quenching effect of c6 with cu ii was low for wastewater derived organic matter was a more labile fraction of dom hudson et al 2007 as for c7 a conspicuous quenching was observed in rdom whereas the intensity increased firstly and then decreased in udom this might be attributed to the discrepancies in dom structural composition molecular weight and spatial conformation result of different sources li et al 2017 the quenching effects of cu ii on c1 c4 and c5 were greater than c8 in this study thus phenol like and protein like might be the critical factor to control the interaction of cu ii with dom fractions in view of the above discussion the binding properties of cu ii with individual fluorescent component of dom should depend a lot on the source of dom 3 3 binding parameters of cu ii with dom to further probe the discrepancy of cu ii binding characteristics with different dom fractions the modified stern volmer model was employed for calculating the cu ii binding parameters using the fmax values of individual component displaying quenching performances table 1 for component c1 the values of f and log k were in the range of 0 115 1 239 and 3 495 4 083 respectively the former in ndom was higher than those in rdom and udom while the latter in ndom was the lowest this was greatly consistent with the previous report that the more fraction of binding fluorophores with cu ii the weaker stability of complexes formed liu et al 2021a c3 and c5 in udom exhibited higher f values than those in ndom and rdom whereas the log k values were lower previous studies have shown that c3 and c5 were most likely to involve in the biodegradable fraction of domestic and industrial wastewater dainard et al 2015 similar to c1 cu ii played an essential quenching influence on c8 presenting an initial speedy quenching and then gradually decreasing the f values of c1 and c8 in ndom were higher than those in rdom and udom indicating that phenol like and fulvic like substances from autochthonous sources had a greater metal binding ability this could be attributed to the discrepancies in dom abundance molecular structure and spatial conformation from different origins li et al 2017 according to c6 the increasing order of f values was rdom udom while the diminished sequence of log k values was rdom udom the f and log k values of component c7 were both approximate in rdom and udom 3 4 binding sequence and disturbing sits of cu ii with dom 3 4 1 binding sensitivity of cu ii with dom generalized 2dcos and hetero 2dcos were applied for identifying the binding sensitivity of fractions in ndom rdom and udom with cu ii for cu ii binding with ndom fractions c31 was positively correlated to c1 in synchronous map fig 9 a so was c32 with c1 an obviously negative relationship was shown between c32 and c1 fig 9b judging by noda s rule the sequence of preferential binding to cu ii was c32 c1 c31 noda 2014 c5 was positively correlated to c31 and c32 in synchronous and asynchronous hetero 2dcos fig 9c d suggesting their changing order with cu ii addition was c31 c32 c5 c81 had positive correlations with c31 and c32 in synchronous hetero 2dcos yet negative correlations with c31 and c32 in asynchronous hetero 2dcos fig 9e f so was c82 with c31 and c32 it indicated that the preferential binding of cu ii with dom fractions was in the following order c81 c82 c31 c32 furthermore c82 was positively correlated to c81 in synchronous spectrum while negatively correlated to c81 in asynchronous spectrum fig 9g h hence the binding sensitivity of cu ii with c8 followed an order c82 c81 based on the above results the binding sensitivity of cu ii to ndom fractions followed the order c82 c81 c32 c1 c31 c5 indirectly revealed that fulvic like took priority over protein like and phenol like to binding with cu ii in the hilly region previous studies also reported a preferential cu ii binding with fulvic like from natural organic electrolytes in consequence of these substance containing more abundant oxygen containing functional groups such as phenolic and carboxylic groups benedetti et al 1996 for cu ii binding with rdom fractions c1 was positively correlated to c7 in either synchronous map or asynchronous map fig 10 a and b indicating that the order of cu ii binding sensitivity with c1 and c7 was c1 c7 a positive correlation occurred between c1 and c8 in synchronous map fig 10c while a negative relationship between c1 and c8 in asynchronous map fig 10d whose binding order was c8 c1 c6 was positively correlated to c32 in synchronous and asynchronous maps fig 10e and f so was c4 with c32 c4 was positively correlated to c31 in synchronous map while negatively correlated to c31 in asynchronous map it suggested that cu ii binding sensitivity with c3 c4 and c6 should follow the order c32 c4 c31 c6 c3 was positively correlated to c5 in synchronous and asynchronous maps fig 10g and h indicating that the order of cu ii binding with c3 and c5 was c32 c31 c5 the trend of cu ii with c7 and c3 was similar to c1 and c8 and the order of cu ii binding sensitivity with c7 was c7 c3 fig 10i and j c4 was positively correlated with c5 in synchronous map while negatively correlated to c5 in asynchronous map c6 was positively correlated to c5 in synchronous and asynchronous maps fig 10k and l it demonstrated that cu ii binding sensitivity with c4 c5 and c6 followed the order c4 c5 c6 on the basis of above results the preferential binding of cu ii with rdom fractions followed in an order of c8 c1 c7 c32 c4 c31 c5 c6 it indirectly identified that cu ii in the river across rural region was preferentially bound to fulvic like followed by phenol like and protein like and finally to wastewater derived organic matter this result was consistent with the previous research that the fulvic like component from livestock and poultry wastewater dominated the transformation of hms speciation zhu et al 2021 cu ii binding with udom fractions c1 was positively correlated to c21 and c22 in synchronous map fig 11 a c1 was positively correlated to c21 whereas negatively correlated to c22 in asynchronous map fig 11b it indicated that cu ii binding sensitivity with c1 and c2 was in the following order c22 c1 c21 c3 was positively correlated with c1 and c2 in synchronous map fig 11c while negatively correlated to c1 and c2 in asynchronous map fig 11d it proved that cu ii binding sensitivity with c1 c2 and c3 might follow the order c3 c1 c2 the trend of cu ii with c5 c6 and c3 was similar to c1 and c2 the order of prior combination with cu ii was c32 c5 c6 c31 fig 11e h c6 was positively correlated with c5 in synchronous map fig 11i while negatively correlated to c5 in asynchronous map fig 11j it indicated that cu ii binding sensitive with c6 and c5 followed by the order c6 c5 c1 was positively correlated to c7 and c8 in synchronous and asynchronous maps fig 11k and l suggesting that cu ii binding sensitivity with c1 c2 c7 and c8 should follow the order c1 c2 c7 c8 c8 was positively correlated to c7 in synchronous map while negatively correlated to c7 in asynchronous map fig 11m and n the trend of cu ii binding with c71 and c72 was similar to c8 and c7 it demonstrated that the sequence of prior combination with cu ii followed an order of c8 c72 c71 as a whole the substances were formed as cu ii concentrations in the following order c32 c6 c5 c31 c22 c1 c21 c8 c72 c71 which recognized that wastewater derived organic matter took priority over protein like phenol like and fulvic like to bind with cu ii in the river across urban region yu et al 2022 reported that wastewater derived organic matter had a complex and variable composition compared to ndom and rdom which might make them easier to combine with hms liu et al 2021a in contrast to ndom and udom phenol like in rdom showed a preferential bonding sequence on cu ii suggesting that phenol like derived from the hilly region had a greater bonding sensitivity with cu ii than that from the rural or urban region the binding sequence of cu ii with recent biological production in udom was prior which could be attributed to the high abundance of protein like discharged from domestic and industrial wastewater fulvic like in udom displayed a poor binding order on cu ii corresponded to that in ndom and rdom demonstrating that the binding sensitivity of cu ii with fulvic like could be prominently affected by cu ii background concentration liu et al 2021b 3 4 2 binding disturbing sites of cu ii with dom the mw2dcos was devoted to revealing the eigenvalues of cu ii concentration which were significantly bound with different fluorescent components for cu ii binding with ndom fractions three peaks appeared at c1 with a critical cu ii concentration of 10 90 and 160 μmol l 1 indicating that the variation of phenol like in ndom occurred at each level of cu ii fig 12 a c3 exhibited two peaks at 40 and 160 μmol l 1 of cu ii concentrations and the former exhibited a sparser contour in accordance with the latter so was c5 this phenomenon demonstrated that the fluorescent components of visible tryptophan like and recent biological production could react significantly with high concentrations of cu ii to trigger transitions of molecular configuration wu et al 2022 for c8 two peaks were found at a critical cu ii concentration of 20 and 40 μmol l 1 suggesting that fulvic like was essential for the complexation of cu ii with trace concentrations fig 12d overall phenol like and protein like in ndom were susceptible to 160 μmol l 1 cu ii addition while fulvic like to 20 μmol l 1 cu ii concentration cu ii binding with rdom fractions four peaks were found at c1 with 20 60 90 and 160 μmol l 1 cu ii concentration fig 13 a suggesting that phenol like from rdom could be impacted significantly by each level of cu ii the trend of cu ii with c3 c4 c6 c5 and c7 was similar to c3 in ndom and the fluorescent components of tryptophan like recent biological production wastewater derived organic matter and microbial humic like substances in rdom could react significantly with high concentrations of cu ii fig 13b e as for c8 three peaks appeared at 20 90 and 160 μmol l 1 on the pressure of cu ii concentrations and fulvic like was decisive in the complexation of 160 μmol l 1 cu ii concentration due to the stronger peak intensity fig 13f showed that phenol like in rdom was sensitive to 160 μmol l 1 cu ii addition whereas protein like and fulvic like to 160 μmol l 1 cu ii concentration for cu ii binding with udom fractions when the cu ii concentration reached 10 and 60 μmol l 1 two cross peaks appeared at c1 c2 fig 14 a the latter displayed a denser contour compared to the former suggesting that phenol like had a critical role in the complexation of 60 μmol l 1 cu ii concentration when the cu ii concentration reached 10 μmol l 1 an obvious cross peak was found at c3 c5 or c6 fig 14b d moreover a strong cross peak appeared at c7 c8 with a critical cu ii concentration of 10 μmol l 1 fig 14e the results indicated that protein like and fulvic like could react significantly with trace levels of cu ii on the whole phenol like in udom could react at a critical concentration of 60 μmol l 1 cu ii protein like at 10 μmol l 1 cu ii and fulvic like at 20 μmol l 1 cu ii 3 5 binding ability of cu ii with dom on the basis of a postulated modeling sem could be constructed as a modeling with cu ii concentration and the fmax of c1 to c8 which was conducted to expose the binding ability of cu ii on ndom rdom and udom as for ndom fig 15 a cu ii concentration had a direct negative effect on the fluorescence intensities of c1 0 91 c3 0 40 c5 0 61 and c8 0 64 suggesting that components from ndom showed obvious quenching effect especially for phenol like substance c5 with the path coefficients of 0 57 manifested a direct negative effect on c8 suggesting cu ii had an indirect positive effect on c8 cu ii c5 c8 tian et al 2021 fig 15b showed that cu ii concentration had a direct negative effect on the fluorescence intensity of rdom components i e c1 c3 c4 c5 c6 c7 and c8 the path coefficients of c1 0 90 c4 0 89 and c5 0 75 were greater than that of other components indicating that phenol like ultraviolet tryptophan like substance and recent biological production in rdom showed great binding ability on cu ii in addition c5 0 38 and c6 0 13 both had direct negative effects on c7 suggesting that cu ii displayed an indirect positive effect on c7 cu ii c5 c6 c7 c1 c3 c4 and c6 showed direct negative effects on c8 as the path coefficients of 0 82 0 64 0 57 and 0 16 respectively yu et al 2019 as for udom fig 15c cu ii concentration had a direct negative effect on the fluorescence intensities of c1 0 90 c3 0 40 c5 0 83 c6 0 26 c7 0 43 and c8 0 33 suggesting that components from udom displayed obvious quenching effect especially for phenol like substance and recent biological production in contrast cu ii with the path coefficient of 0 28 exhibited a direct positive influence on c2 indicating that fluorescence intensities of tyrosine like substance in udom were enhanced after adding cu ii furthermore c5 with the path coefficient of 0 94 and 0 34 showed a direct negative influence on c7 and c8 suggesting that cu ii showed an indirect positive effect on c7 and c8 cu ii c5 c7 c8 based on the results in fig 15 cu ii had a negative direct effect on c7 or c8 whereas it showed an indirect positive effect on c7 or c8 through influencing c5 this might mainly attribute to that the complexes of cu ii with recent biological production are condensed with humic like components resulting in the blue shift of the latter huang et al 2021 similarly cu ii displayed an indirect positive effect on c7 or c8 by affecting c6 mainly as a consequence of condensation polymerization between humic like and complexes of cu ii with wastewater derived organic matter this could contribute to an increasing amount of low substituted aromatic nuclei capable of a low degree of resonance in c7 or c8 3 6 environmental implications in recent years heavy metal pollution in aquatic ecosystem has been widely admitted to be a serious threat owing to its environmental toxicity bio accumulation properties and persistence he et al 2019 islam et al 2015 as a ubiquitous metal pollutant cu is one of the most studied representative elements which tends to combine with dom fractions wu et al 2022 as broadly recognized the environmental behaviors of cu were significantly impacted by dom in aquatic environment and the formation of cu dom complexes is impacted by a variety of factors such as dom sources ph and ionic strength hur and lee 2011 nevertheless in a specific ecosystem factors affecting metal binding ought to be confined to the innate properties of dom xu et al 2018 it is vital to reveal the dynamic binding mechanisms of dom fractions from different origins toward cu so as to better evaluate the environmental behaviors of cu in aquatic ecosystem in this study cu ii had great quenching effects on three types of dom from an urbanized river and the higher binding ratios were revealed in rdom and udom with cu ii compared to ndom previous reports demonstrated that fulvic like with low molecular weight had an essential role in cu ii binding zhu et al 2021 the present study found that cu ii showed a great binding capacity on protein like derived from livestock poultry and industrial wastewater especially for the region significantly influenced by anthropogenic activities the complexes of protein like with cu ii were readily absorbed by aquatic organism and entered food chains which could be conducive to bioaccumulation and aggravate environmental risks of heavy metals one proposed efficient solution to this issue is to strengthen the source control of heavy metals in urbanized rivers such as preventing and controlling of soil erosion in hilly region faeces and pesticide pollution in rural region and industrial and domestic pollution in urban region 4 conclusion combining eem parafac with principal component coefficient mw2dcos and sem is a practicable and promising approach for insight into the cu ii binding properties with dom fractions eight components were extracted from dom samples ultraviolet tryptophan like only occurred in rdom and tyrosine like was found just in udom with cu ii addition phenol like and fulvic like from autochthonous sources exhibited great binding ratios in the complexation with cu ii recent biological production in udom displayed a prior binding order on cu ii while the binding sequence of cu ii with fulvic like was poor demonstrating the binding sensitivity of cu ii with dom fractions prominently affected by cu ii background concentration and the abundance of organic matter phenol like and protein like in ndom and dom fractions in rdom were essential for the binding of cu ii with high concentration whereas fulvic like in ndom and dom fractions in udom could react significantly at a critical trace concentration the complexes of cu ii with c5 or c6 could condense with humic like components which increased amount of low substituted aromatic nuclei capable of a low degree of resonance in humic like components these findings for the complexation mechanism of cu ii with dom fractions could be conducive to further comprehend the cu ii fate and consequences in aquatic environment credit authorship contribution statement dongping

15310,dissolved organic matter dom in aquatic environment distinctly affects the behavior and fate of heavy metals via complexation while the interfacial mechanisms and processes are still lacking in detail here cu ii binding characteristics of dom originated from hilly ndom rural rdom and urban udom regions in an urbanized river was explored by fluorescence excitation emission matrix spectroscopy eem combined with principal component coefficients parallel factor analyses parafac moving window two dimensional correlation spectroscopy mw2dcos and structural equation modeling sem eight components were extracted from the titrants through eem parafac i e phenol like substance c1 tyrosine like substance c2 visible tryptophan like substance c3 ultraviolet tryptophan like substance c4 recent biological production c5 wastewater derived organic matter c6 microbial humic like substance c7 and fulvic like substance c8 interestingly ndom only contained c1 c3 c5 and c8 while nearly all components were found in rdom except for c2 and udom except for c4 the f value of c1 1 239 in ndom was much higher than those in rdom 0 134 and udom 0 115 so was of c8 it indicated that phenol like and fulvic like derived from autochthonous sources exhibited great binding ratios in the complexation with cu ii moreover c3 and c5 from udom exhibited higher f values 0 591 and 1 983 than those from ndom and rdom suggesting that cu ii has a great binding capacity on protein like from domestic and industrial wastewater the mw2dcos revealed that phenol like and protein like in ndom and rdom were essential for the binding of 160 μmol l 1 cu ii whereas fulvic like in ndom and udom could react significantly with 10 μmol l 1 cu ii based on sem cu ii concentration had a negative direct effect on the fluorescence intensity of c7 or c8 whereas it showed an indirect positive effect on c7 or c8 through influencing c5 so was c6 it suggested that cu ii showed an indirect positive effect on the c8

matrix parallel factor principal component coefficients two dimensional correlation spectroscopy structural equation modeling data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction heavy metals in aquatic ecosystem have attracted a widespread concern due to their potential toxic action on aquatic microorganisms which may raise a severe challenge to prevent water pollution in rivers or lakes zhou et al 2019 du et al 2018 tandon et al 2013 hence it will be indispensable for insight into environmental behaviors of heavy metals in aquatic ecosystem there are two major sources of potential heavy metals in aquatic ecosystem i e natural and anthropogenic sources then heavy metal pollution might be mainly attributed to the latter which included domestic and industrial wastewater discharges fossil fuel combustion automobile exhaust residential population density and atmospheric deposition islam et al 2015 sekabira et al 2010 dissolved organic matter dom is a heterogeneous and complex mixture consisting of organic molecules i e polysaccharide protein humic substances and hydrophilic organic acid and functional groups i e phenolic carboxylic and carbonyl hu et al 2019 xu et al 2018 as the most active ingredient in aquatic ecosystem dom has a significant effect on environmental behaviors of heavy metals by complexation which is associated with speciation distribution bioavailability transformation and toxicity zhu et al 2021 reports have demonstrated that dom could form combined pollutants with heavy metals which might restrict adsorption or precipitation of heavy metals in aquatic ecosystem aggravating metals environmental risks huang et al 2020 it is reported that dom fractions are strongly influenced by anthropogenic activities and early diagenesis xu et al 2016 hur et al 2014 the diversity of dom fractions may consequently impact the environmental behaviors of heavy metals in different ways thus in depth examination on the interactions of metals with dom from different origins could help uncover heavy metal movement and availability in aquatic ecosystem cu is considered as a target element based on its relatively high toxicity and abundance in aquatic ecosystem and universal application for insight into its complexation with dom hu et al 2019 xu et al 2018 xu et al 2013 cu is one of the most common metal pollutants in environment which mainly originated from the application of pesticides chemical fertilizers antifouling paints and construction materials liu et al 2022 despite a trace of cu is vital for living cells it could destroy the antioxidative defense system of many organisms in relatively high concentrations wu et al 2017 cu pollution could be generally relative to impacts of anthropogenic activities i e domestic agricultural industrial and mining activities furthermore previous studies reported that cu was sensitive to the participation of dom fractions whose biogeochemistry was deeply determined by its interactions with dom huang et al 2021 zhou et al 2019 at present several advanced technologies including fluorescence spectroscopy ultraviolet visible spectroscopy uv vis and fourier infrared spectroscopy ftir have been applied to probe the binding characteristics of metals dom guo et al 2022 yu et al 2019 hur and lee 2011 moreover fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem spectroscopy combined with parallel factor analysis parafac is extensively employed to describe the interactive mechanism of heavy metals with dom fractions which can present detailed information about compositions and relative content of dom as well as its environmental dynamics wang et al 2020 qian et al 2017 however the eem resolution might be immeasurably impacted by the inner filter effects of concentrated samples except for the rayleigh and raman scattering chemometrics methods based on multivariate statistics have been employed in performing the eem data for modified spectrum principal component analysis pca one of these techniques has been becoming popularity as a tool for food authentication and classification particularly in edible oil and wine the refolding 3 dimentional data from the pca can be operated to not only identify the key region of eem but also discriminate the samples al riza et al 2021 al riza et al 2019 nevertheless this technique does rarely implement for variable selection of fluorescence eem with some modification in the terrestrial aquatic ecosystem structural equation modeling sem is an efficient statistical tool since it can explicitly link empirical data to a theoretical model it is seldom presented that eem parafac coupled with sem is utilized to characterize heavy metals binding with dom fractions schmidt et al 2019 recently two dimensional correlation spectroscopy 2dcos has been broadly used to trace faint the subtle reactions of dom under external perturbations i e ph temperature and metal addition gao et al 2019 lee and hur 2016 noda 2016 for instance generalized 2dcos was applied for revealing the variations of dom components extracted by eem parafac under different treatments which could effectively elucidate the sequence of several fluorescence peaks in a unitary component zhu et al 2020 the hetero 2dcos might precisely reveal the changing order of different components in metals dom binding wu et al 2022 moving window two dimensional correlation spectroscopy mw2dcos advanced by thomas and richardson could be lightly employed to probe the perturbation induced spectral transition points on account of the correlation intensity along the disturbance variables direction zhou et al 2019 noda 2014 nevertheless few studies have reportedly used combinatorial techniques of generalized 2dcos hetero 2dcos and mw2dcos to reveal the variation in composition and molecular structure of dom fractions from different origins influenced by each level of cu ii all of these methods could provide new insight into dom conformations at the molecular level li et al 2021 baitapuhe river is a typical urbanized river across shenyang city in the northeast of china where rapid development of industry and livestock poultry breeding has induced a potential threat to water quality especially for cu pollution liu et al 2021b found that the cu concentration in hilly region was less than its background value 24 57 mg kg 1 for the soil in liaohe plain while the cu concentration in rural or urban regions was more than five times larger than the background value in this study the river is selected to explore the binding characteristics of cu ii with dom from different origins the intentions of our study are as follows 1 to characterize three types of dom obtained from the river across hilly rural and urban regions through eem parafac 2 to explore the binding characteristics of ndom rdom and udom fractions towards cu ii by a modified stern volar model 3 to elucidate the binding sequence and sites of dom with cu ii using generalized 2dcos hetero 2dcos and mw2dcos analyses 4 and to reveal the binding ability of cu ii with dom from three origins by sem 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling strategy and doc measurement more details regarding baitapuhe river in this research can be found in liu et al 2021a three kinds of surface water samples were collected from the hilly b1 rural b2 and urban regions b3 respectively and mixed thoroughly fig 1 subsequently the samples were all filtered through 0 45 μm acetate fiber filters and the filtrates were well known as dom solutions which were transported to laboratory immediately dom in the hilly region was less affected by anthropogenic activity which might be regarded as natural dissolved organic matter ndom dom from the river across rural region rdom could derive from the livestock and poultry breeding wastewater agricultural drainage and rural domestic sewage dom from the river across urban region udom was assigned to the effluents from industrial park wastewater treatment plant and partial domestic sewage here the dissolved organic carbon doc concentrations of dom solutions were determined by a toc analyzer toc vcpn shimadzu kyoto japan 2 2 titration experiment preceding the cu ii complexation experiment ndom rdom and udom solutions were diluted with milli q deionized water until the doc concentration was 5 mg l 1 so as to reduce the effect of internal filtration hu et al 2019 metal titrations were implemented by adding 0 1 mg l 1 cu no3 2 titrants into 50 ml dom samples results in that the gradients of cu ii concentration in the final solution were set from 0 to 200 μmol l 1 0 10 20 40 60 90 120 160 200 μmol l 1 particularly the adjunct quantity of cu ii was less than 5 of the solution to refrain the concentration influence larsson et al 2007 after the titrations process the ph was adjusted to 7 5 0 05 by adding 0 1 μmol l 1 hcl or naoh solutions chen et al 2015 to coincide with surface water in this study huang et al 2019 all solutions were shaken at 200 rpm in darkness and 25 for 24 h to reach binding equilibrium 2 3 eem and parafac eem scanning spectra of the titrants were detected by employing a fluorescence spectrophotometer f 7000 hitachi japan with three replicates making for 54 spectra the scan operated excitation wavelengths ex ranging from 200 to 450 nm and emission wavelengths em ranging from 260 to 500 nm with a stepwise increment of 5 nm ex and em silt widths were regulated to 5 nm with the scanning speed of 2400 nm min 1 to correct the inner filter effects milli q deionized water spectra were treated as the blank which was subtracted from all sample eem stedmon and bro 2008 principal component analysis was implemented to explore the eem data and identify important variables a detail introduction to the parsing process of pca has been described by al riza et al 2021 parafac modeling was performed to analyze the collected spectra by matlab r2017b mathworks natick ma usa with dom fluor toolbox parafac components were determined according to split half analysis and visual inspection and relative quantities of the individual fluorescent components were represented by their maximum fluorescence intensity fmax in this study eem data obtained from ndom rdom and udom binding with cu ii were loaded separately into the parafac analysis for directly comparing the binding properties of ndom rdom and udom with cu ii 2 4 complexation model the binding parameters of dom with cu ii were determined with the modified stern volmer model lehrer 1971 fluorescence intensities of components extracted from ndom rdom and udom were applied for the calculation of the fluorescent ligand ratio f and the stability constant k the equation was depicted as follows 1 f 0 f 0 f 1 f k c u i i 1 f where f0 and f are the fluorescence intensities of these components from eem spectra when no metal ions and cu ii ions are added respectively k represents the complexed stability of cu ii dom and f symptomatizes the binding proportion of dom fractions with cu ii 2 5 two dimensional correlation spectra analysis 2d cos was devoted to identifying the sequential variations and external perturbation threshold occurring in the eem spectra of ndom rdom and udom induced by cu ii as an external perturbation generalized 2dcos hetero 2dcos and mw2dcos were obtained by 2d shige software distributed from kwansei gakuin university japan detailed information has been exposited in previous literature the window size was set as 3 2m 1 for generating distinct mw2dcos spectrums 2 6 structural equation modeling as a statistical model sem has attracted extensive attention from environmentalists in recent years since it could plainly link empirical data to a theoretical model for denoting complex causal networks mathematically and testing the hypothesized interconnections in this study sem was employed to identify the interaction properties of fluorescence components in ndom rdom and udom with cu ii using amos 26 0 amos ibm usa 3 results and discussions 3 1 variable selection of eem data from cu ii dom binding properties of dom from different sources were analyzed in fig s1 and table s1 the eem data for each sample fig s2 was unfolded and concatenated to be a vector data type by which pca was implemented to identify the key region of fluorescence eem three principal components pc were found to be sufficient for representing over 99 of data variance the refolded absolute values of pc loading 1 to 3 were added up and then the sum of the absolute values of pc 1 3 loadings have been plotted fig 2 four discrete variables for excitation emission pairs were identified from the pca including three protein like substances ex em 220 300 220 335 and 270 320 nm and a humic like substance ex em 245 410 nm 2d scattering plots of pc 1 2 scores with different labeling were plotted to discriminate the samples fig 3 all samples were divided into three groups by the pc1 and pc2 loadings which represented more than 75 of the sample s variance group 1 including ndom samples in the first quadrant the group 2 containing rdom samples was in the second quadrant yet the group 3 comprised udom samples was in the third and fourth quadrant it was evident that samples were divided into three categories with significant regional characteristics hence pca was conducted on eem data of cu ii ndom fig s2a i cu ii rdom fig s2j r and cu ii udom fig s2s aa respectively there were three discrete variables in pc1 3 for cu ii ndom binding representing over 99 of data variance which included a broad peak ex em 220 335 nm and two weak shoulders ex em 220 295 270 325 nm fig 4 a the broad peak might be related to tyrosine like substances the first shoulder to ultraviolet tryptophan like substances and the second shoulder to visible tryptophan like substances for cu ii rdom binding pc coefficients 1 2 accounting for 99 of data variance were roughly similar to the pc coefficients 1 3 from ndom cu ii fig 4b however the visible tryptophan like in the former exhibited a red shift of ex 5 nm than that in the latter which attributed to greater amounts of conjugated aromatic p electron systems with electron withdrawing groups such as carbonyl containing substituents and carboxyl constituents song et al 2019 chen et al 2002 thus visible tryptophan like from cu ii rdom had greater amounts of carbonyl carboxyl groups than that from cu ii ndom for cu ii udom binding four discrete variables were revealed in pc coefficients 1 3 accounting for 99 of data variance a unique peak was identified in fig 4c which might be related to fulvic like substances 3 2 interaction of parafac components with cu ii parafac was applied respectively for eem data of cu ii ndom cu ii rdom and cu ii udom to extract the fluorescent components for the significant discrepancy in their spectral signatures parafac processing eem data fig s2 extracted eight components table s2 stedmon and bro 2008 all the identified components were compared with the openfluor model dataset with the fitting of 0 95 c1 could be assigned to a phenol like substance which appeared as precursors of lignin material spied in vascular plants d andrilli et al 2017 c2 with the wavelength of 215 260 300 nm ex em was regarded as tyrosine like substance derrien et al 2020 c3 and c4 were associated with tryptophan like substances representing biolabile or semibiolabile pools of dom podgorski et al 2018 bianchi et al 2014 c5 with the maxima at 220 335 nm generally connected with recent biological production dainard et al 2015 c6 was recognized as the protein like substance associated with wastewater derived organic matter wang et al 2020 c7 could be the combination of microbial humic like and tryptophan like concerning with biological production in surface water stedmon et al 2003 c8 exhibited at 245 275 nm 415 nm ex em which was regarded as fulvic like substance nimptsch et al 2015 huang et al 2015 bianchi et al 2014 additionally only four components c1 c3 c5 and c8 were recognized in ndom fig 5 while all components were nearly recognized in rdom except for c2 fig 6 and rdom except for c4 fig 7 the intensity variations of dom components with cu ii addition were displayed in fig 8 the cu ii quenching with c1 of dom in three regions exhibited a linear drop in dom notably for udom whose intensity almost dropped to zero at 200 μmol l 1 cu ii this was mainly attributed to the abundant active groups of phenol like such as aromatic ring structure aliphatic aromatic hydroxyl and quinone groups coble et al 2014 c2 was only found in udom with cu ii addition whose intensity initially increased rapidly and then decreased gradually interestingly the intensity of c3 in udom with cu ii addition presented an opposite trend of c2 moreover the intensities of c2 with cu ii addition showed a significant negative correlation to the corresponding intensities of c3 r 0 909 p 0 001 fig s6 indirectly demonstrated that c2 might be derived from the partial c3 binding with cu ii xing et al 2020 yamashita and jaffé 2008 the intensities of c3 binding with cu ii in ndom or udom showed a fluctuating small reduction indicating a low sensitivity of cu ii binding with c3 the intensities of c4 only occurring in rdom binding with cu ii were deeply quenched with cu ii addition which were attributed that c4 could be derived from livestock and poultry wastewater zhu et al 2021 similar to c1 cu ii played an essential quenching effect on c5 as its intensities in ndom dropped to 62 36 at 200 μmol l 1 cu ii addition 89 50 in rdom and 91 23 in udom the trend of cu ii binding with c8 was similar to c5 this was consistent with previous studies that fulvic like had a strong ability to combine with cu ii due to its abundant oxygen containing functional groups i e phenolic and carboxylic groups xu et al 2021 yan and korshin 2014 cu ii with high concentration 200 μmol l 1 quenched 19 95 of intensities for c6 in rdom and 39 27 of fluorescence intensities for c6 in udom it indicated that the quenching effect of c6 with cu ii was low for wastewater derived organic matter was a more labile fraction of dom hudson et al 2007 as for c7 a conspicuous quenching was observed in rdom whereas the intensity increased firstly and then decreased in udom this might be attributed to the discrepancies in dom structural composition molecular weight and spatial conformation result of different sources li et al 2017 the quenching effects of cu ii on c1 c4 and c5 were greater than c8 in this study thus phenol like and protein like might be the critical factor to control the interaction of cu ii with dom fractions in view of the above discussion the binding properties of cu ii with individual fluorescent component of dom should depend a lot on the source of dom 3 3 binding parameters of cu ii with dom to further probe the discrepancy of cu ii binding characteristics with different dom fractions the modified stern volmer model was employed for calculating the cu ii binding parameters using the fmax values of individual component displaying quenching performances table 1 for component c1 the values of f and log k were in the range of 0 115 1 239 and 3 495 4 083 respectively the former in ndom was higher than those in rdom and udom while the latter in ndom was the lowest this was greatly consistent with the previous report that the more fraction of binding fluorophores with cu ii the weaker stability of complexes formed liu et al 2021a c3 and c5 in udom exhibited higher f values than those in ndom and rdom whereas the log k values were lower previous studies have shown that c3 and c5 were most likely to involve in the biodegradable fraction of domestic and industrial wastewater dainard et al 2015 similar to c1 cu ii played an essential quenching influence on c8 presenting an initial speedy quenching and then gradually decreasing the f values of c1 and c8 in ndom were higher than those in rdom and udom indicating that phenol like and fulvic like substances from autochthonous sources had a greater metal binding ability this could be attributed to the discrepancies in dom abundance molecular structure and spatial conformation from different origins li et al 2017 according to c6 the increasing order of f values was rdom udom while the diminished sequence of log k values was rdom udom the f and log k values of component c7 were both approximate in rdom and udom 3 4 binding sequence and disturbing sits of cu ii with dom 3 4 1 binding sensitivity of cu ii with dom generalized 2dcos and hetero 2dcos were applied for identifying the binding sensitivity of fractions in ndom rdom and udom with cu ii for cu ii binding with ndom fractions c31 was positively correlated to c1 in synchronous map fig 9 a so was c32 with c1 an obviously negative relationship was shown between c32 and c1 fig 9b judging by noda s rule the sequence of preferential binding to cu ii was c32 c1 c31 noda 2014 c5 was positively correlated to c31 and c32 in synchronous and asynchronous hetero 2dcos fig 9c d suggesting their changing order with cu ii addition was c31 c32 c5 c81 had positive correlations with c31 and c32 in synchronous hetero 2dcos yet negative correlations with c31 and c32 in asynchronous hetero 2dcos fig 9e f so was c82 with c31 and c32 it indicated that the preferential binding of cu ii with dom fractions was in the following order c81 c82 c31 c32 furthermore c82 was positively correlated to c81 in synchronous spectrum while negatively correlated to c81 in asynchronous spectrum fig 9g h hence the binding sensitivity of cu ii with c8 followed an order c82 c81 based on the above results the binding sensitivity of cu ii to ndom fractions followed the order c82 c81 c32 c1 c31 c5 indirectly revealed that fulvic like took priority over protein like and phenol like to binding with cu ii in the hilly region previous studies also reported a preferential cu ii binding with fulvic like from natural organic electrolytes in consequence of these substance containing more abundant oxygen containing functional groups such as phenolic and carboxylic groups benedetti et al 1996 for cu ii binding with rdom fractions c1 was positively correlated to c7 in either synchronous map or asynchronous map fig 10 a and b indicating that the order of cu ii binding sensitivity with c1 and c7 was c1 c7 a positive correlation occurred between c1 and c8 in synchronous map fig 10c while a negative relationship between c1 and c8 in asynchronous map fig 10d whose binding order was c8 c1 c6 was positively correlated to c32 in synchronous and asynchronous maps fig 10e and f so was c4 with c32 c4 was positively correlated to c31 in synchronous map while negatively correlated to c31 in asynchronous map it suggested that cu ii binding sensitivity with c3 c4 and c6 should follow the order c32 c4 c31 c6 c3 was positively correlated to c5 in synchronous and asynchronous maps fig 10g and h indicating that the order of cu ii binding with c3 and c5 was c32 c31 c5 the trend of cu ii with c7 and c3 was similar to c1 and c8 and the order of cu ii binding sensitivity with c7 was c7 c3 fig 10i and j c4 was positively correlated with c5 in synchronous map while negatively correlated to c5 in asynchronous map c6 was positively correlated to c5 in synchronous and asynchronous maps fig 10k and l it demonstrated that cu ii binding sensitivity with c4 c5 and c6 followed the order c4 c5 c6 on the basis of above results the preferential binding of cu ii with rdom fractions followed in an order of c8 c1 c7 c32 c4 c31 c5 c6 it indirectly identified that cu ii in the river across rural region was preferentially bound to fulvic like followed by phenol like and protein like and finally to wastewater derived organic matter this result was consistent with the previous research that the fulvic like component from livestock and poultry wastewater dominated the transformation of hms speciation zhu et al 2021 cu ii binding with udom fractions c1 was positively correlated to c21 and c22 in synchronous map fig 11 a c1 was positively correlated to c21 whereas negatively correlated to c22 in asynchronous map fig 11b it indicated that cu ii binding sensitivity with c1 and c2 was in the following order c22 c1 c21 c3 was positively correlated with c1 and c2 in synchronous map fig 11c while negatively correlated to c1 and c2 in asynchronous map fig 11d it proved that cu ii binding sensitivity with c1 c2 and c3 might follow the order c3 c1 c2 the trend of cu ii with c5 c6 and c3 was similar to c1 and c2 the order of prior combination with cu ii was c32 c5 c6 c31 fig 11e h c6 was positively correlated with c5 in synchronous map fig 11i while negatively correlated to c5 in asynchronous map fig 11j it indicated that cu ii binding sensitive with c6 and c5 followed by the order c6 c5 c1 was positively correlated to c7 and c8 in synchronous and asynchronous maps fig 11k and l suggesting that cu ii binding sensitivity with c1 c2 c7 and c8 should follow the order c1 c2 c7 c8 c8 was positively correlated to c7 in synchronous map while negatively correlated to c7 in asynchronous map fig 11m and n the trend of cu ii binding with c71 and c72 was similar to c8 and c7 it demonstrated that the sequence of prior combination with cu ii followed an order of c8 c72 c71 as a whole the substances were formed as cu ii concentrations in the following order c32 c6 c5 c31 c22 c1 c21 c8 c72 c71 which recognized that wastewater derived organic matter took priority over protein like phenol like and fulvic like to bind with cu ii in the river across urban region yu et al 2022 reported that wastewater derived organic matter had a complex and variable composition compared to ndom and rdom which might make them easier to combine with hms liu et al 2021a in contrast to ndom and udom phenol like in rdom showed a preferential bonding sequence on cu ii suggesting that phenol like derived from the hilly region had a greater bonding sensitivity with cu ii than that from the rural or urban region the binding sequence of cu ii with recent biological production in udom was prior which could be attributed to the high abundance of protein like discharged from domestic and industrial wastewater fulvic like in udom displayed a poor binding order on cu ii corresponded to that in ndom and rdom demonstrating that the binding sensitivity of cu ii with fulvic like could be prominently affected by cu ii background concentration liu et al 2021b 3 4 2 binding disturbing sites of cu ii with dom the mw2dcos was devoted to revealing the eigenvalues of cu ii concentration which were significantly bound with different fluorescent components for cu ii binding with ndom fractions three peaks appeared at c1 with a critical cu ii concentration of 10 90 and 160 μmol l 1 indicating that the variation of phenol like in ndom occurred at each level of cu ii fig 12 a c3 exhibited two peaks at 40 and 160 μmol l 1 of cu ii concentrations and the former exhibited a sparser contour in accordance with the latter so was c5 this phenomenon demonstrated that the fluorescent components of visible tryptophan like and recent biological production could react significantly with high concentrations of cu ii to trigger transitions of molecular configuration wu et al 2022 for c8 two peaks were found at a critical cu ii concentration of 20 and 40 μmol l 1 suggesting that fulvic like was essential for the complexation of cu ii with trace concentrations fig 12d overall phenol like and protein like in ndom were susceptible to 160 μmol l 1 cu ii addition while fulvic like to 20 μmol l 1 cu ii concentration cu ii binding with rdom fractions four peaks were found at c1 with 20 60 90 and 160 μmol l 1 cu ii concentration fig 13 a suggesting that phenol like from rdom could be impacted significantly by each level of cu ii the trend of cu ii with c3 c4 c6 c5 and c7 was similar to c3 in ndom and the fluorescent components of tryptophan like recent biological production wastewater derived organic matter and microbial humic like substances in rdom could react significantly with high concentrations of cu ii fig 13b e as for c8 three peaks appeared at 20 90 and 160 μmol l 1 on the pressure of cu ii concentrations and fulvic like was decisive in the complexation of 160 μmol l 1 cu ii concentration due to the stronger peak intensity fig 13f showed that phenol like in rdom was sensitive to 160 μmol l 1 cu ii addition whereas protein like and fulvic like to 160 μmol l 1 cu ii concentration for cu ii binding with udom fractions when the cu ii concentration reached 10 and 60 μmol l 1 two cross peaks appeared at c1 c2 fig 14 a the latter displayed a denser contour compared to the former suggesting that phenol like had a critical role in the complexation of 60 μmol l 1 cu ii concentration when the cu ii concentration reached 10 μmol l 1 an obvious cross peak was found at c3 c5 or c6 fig 14b d moreover a strong cross peak appeared at c7 c8 with a critical cu ii concentration of 10 μmol l 1 fig 14e the results indicated that protein like and fulvic like could react significantly with trace levels of cu ii on the whole phenol like in udom could react at a critical concentration of 60 μmol l 1 cu ii protein like at 10 μmol l 1 cu ii and fulvic like at 20 μmol l 1 cu ii 3 5 binding ability of cu ii with dom on the basis of a postulated modeling sem could be constructed as a modeling with cu ii concentration and the fmax of c1 to c8 which was conducted to expose the binding ability of cu ii on ndom rdom and udom as for ndom fig 15 a cu ii concentration had a direct negative effect on the fluorescence intensities of c1 0 91 c3 0 40 c5 0 61 and c8 0 64 suggesting that components from ndom showed obvious quenching effect especially for phenol like substance c5 with the path coefficients of 0 57 manifested a direct negative effect on c8 suggesting cu ii had an indirect positive effect on c8 cu ii c5 c8 tian et al 2021 fig 15b showed that cu ii concentration had a direct negative effect on the fluorescence intensity of rdom components i e c1 c3 c4 c5 c6 c7 and c8 the path coefficients of c1 0 90 c4 0 89 and c5 0 75 were greater than that of other components indicating that phenol like ultraviolet tryptophan like substance and recent biological production in rdom showed great binding ability on cu ii in addition c5 0 38 and c6 0 13 both had direct negative effects on c7 suggesting that cu ii displayed an indirect positive effect on c7 cu ii c5 c6 c7 c1 c3 c4 and c6 showed direct negative effects on c8 as the path coefficients of 0 82 0 64 0 57 and 0 16 respectively yu et al 2019 as for udom fig 15c cu ii concentration had a direct negative effect on the fluorescence intensities of c1 0 90 c3 0 40 c5 0 83 c6 0 26 c7 0 43 and c8 0 33 suggesting that components from udom displayed obvious quenching effect especially for phenol like substance and recent biological production in contrast cu ii with the path coefficient of 0 28 exhibited a direct positive influence on c2 indicating that fluorescence intensities of tyrosine like substance in udom were enhanced after adding cu ii furthermore c5 with the path coefficient of 0 94 and 0 34 showed a direct negative influence on c7 and c8 suggesting that cu ii showed an indirect positive effect on c7 and c8 cu ii c5 c7 c8 based on the results in fig 15 cu ii had a negative direct effect on c7 or c8 whereas it showed an indirect positive effect on c7 or c8 through influencing c5 this might mainly attribute to that the complexes of cu ii with recent biological production are condensed with humic like components resulting in the blue shift of the latter huang et al 2021 similarly cu ii displayed an indirect positive effect on c7 or c8 by affecting c6 mainly as a consequence of condensation polymerization between humic like and complexes of cu ii with wastewater derived organic matter this could contribute to an increasing amount of low substituted aromatic nuclei capable of a low degree of resonance in c7 or c8 3 6 environmental implications in recent years heavy metal pollution in aquatic ecosystem has been widely admitted to be a serious threat owing to its environmental toxicity bio accumulation properties and persistence he et al 2019 islam et al 2015 as a ubiquitous metal pollutant cu is one of the most studied representative elements which tends to combine with dom fractions wu et al 2022 as broadly recognized the environmental behaviors of cu were significantly impacted by dom in aquatic environment and the formation of cu dom complexes is impacted by a variety of factors such as dom sources ph and ionic strength hur and lee 2011 nevertheless in a specific ecosystem factors affecting metal binding ought to be confined to the innate properties of dom xu et al 2018 it is vital to reveal the dynamic binding mechanisms of dom fractions from different origins toward cu so as to better evaluate the environmental behaviors of cu in aquatic ecosystem in this study cu ii had great quenching effects on three types of dom from an urbanized river and the higher binding ratios were revealed in rdom and udom with cu ii compared to ndom previous reports demonstrated that fulvic like with low molecular weight had an essential role in cu ii binding zhu et al 2021 the present study found that cu ii showed a great binding capacity on protein like derived from livestock poultry and industrial wastewater especially for the region significantly influenced by anthropogenic activities the complexes of protein like with cu ii were readily absorbed by aquatic organism and entered food chains which could be conducive to bioaccumulation and aggravate environmental risks of heavy metals one proposed efficient solution to this issue is to strengthen the source control of heavy metals in urbanized rivers such as preventing and controlling of soil erosion in hilly region faeces and pesticide pollution in rural region and industrial and domestic pollution in urban region 4 conclusion combining eem parafac with principal component coefficient mw2dcos and sem is a practicable and promising approach for insight into the cu ii binding properties with dom fractions eight components were extracted from dom samples ultraviolet tryptophan like only occurred in rdom and tyrosine like was found just in udom with cu ii addition phenol like and fulvic like from autochthonous sources exhibited great binding ratios in the complexation with cu ii recent biological production in udom displayed a prior binding order on cu ii while the binding sequence of cu ii with fulvic like was poor demonstrating the binding sensitivity of cu ii with dom fractions prominently affected by cu ii background concentration and the abundance of organic matter phenol like and protein like in ndom and dom fractions in rdom were essential for the binding of cu ii with high concentration whereas fulvic like in ndom and dom fractions in udom could react significantly at a critical trace concentration the complexes of cu ii with c5 or c6 could condense with humic like components which increased amount of low substituted aromatic nuclei capable of a low degree of resonance in humic like components these findings for the complexation mechanism of cu ii with dom fractions could be conducive to further comprehend the cu ii fate and consequences in aquatic environment credit authorship contribution statement dongping

15311,constructed wetlands cws are an important barrier to prevent nanoplastics nps and microplastics mps from entering receiving streams however little is known about how the accumulation of nps affects the growth photosynthesis oxidative stress responses and metabolism of plants especially submerged plants that are widely used in cws for water purification herein we adopted utricularia vulgaris u vulgaris a typical submerged macrophyte as the model plant to address the above knowledge gaps under exposure to polystyrene nps ps nps 500 nm 0 10 mg l 1 results showed that ps nps were absorbed by insect traps and further transported to stems and leaves of u vulgaris which limited plant height 6 8 72 9 relative growth rate 7 4 17 2 and photosynthesis 3 7 28 2 u vulgaris suffered from oxidative stresses as evidenced by the increase in malondialdehyde antioxidant enzymes catalase peroxidase and superoxide dismutase and h2o2 especially under 1 and 10 mg l 1 abundances of 548 metabolites were quantified and 291 metabolites were detected with altered levels after exposure in which 25 34 metabolites were up regulated and 32 40 metabolites were down regulated in metabolite expression metabolic pathways of the tricarboxylic acid cycle and amino acid were disrupted in which citric acid threonine and adenine decreased while amino acids like serine phenylalanine histidine etc increased first and then decreased with increasing ps nps concentrations moreover ps nps reduced the removal efficiency of total nitrogen and phosphorus from water by u vulgaris bringing potential risks to aquatic ecosystems these findings have greatly enhanced our understanding of the metabolic mechanisms and interactions of aquatic macrophytes that are heavily used in cws in response to nps

freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems as well as their widespread involvement in almost all food webs mps and nps pollution has become a major global environmental issue alongside global warming ozone depletion and ocean acidification galloway and lewis 2016 in particular the plastic medical waste and protective supplies used in large quantities during the covid 19 pandemic have contributed to plastic pollution patrício silva et al 2022 prata et al 2020 polystyrene ps is one of the most abundant polymers dominating mps pollution in rivers from switzerland faure et al 2015 china liu et al 2020 and effluents from sewage plants discharging into receiving waters park et al 2020 chronic exposure to mps and nps can adversely affect individual organisms through reduced feeding and depletion of energy stores bringing knock on effects on fecundity and growth and further affecting deep sea carbon fluxes and the global carbon cycle galloway et al 2017 ecologically the microscopic size of nps allows them to cross biological barriers and enter cells while the high surface area to volume ratio enhances their reactivity nel et al 2009 moreover the trojan horse effect of nps enriches and carries pollutants from the aquatic environment into plants such as herbicides pesticides and antibiotics and promotes their uptake and accumulation in plants lim 2021 in addition nps aggregate more readily with plankton natural colloids and suspended particulate matter than mps making them more bioavailable for filter feeding and suspension feeding organisms brewer et al 2021 current toxicological studies indicate that nps are immunotoxic metabolically toxic endocrine toxic neurotoxic developmentally toxic and have other deleterious effects causing organ damage and behavioral changes in aquatic animals such as daphnia magna pacific oysters crassostrea gigas and monogonont rotifer brachionus koreanus cole and galloway 2015 nasser and lynch 2016 plants can take up engineered nanomaterials such as metals oxides etc and accumulate them in branches and roots cao et al 2021 du et al 2015 suggesting the potential for nps uptake by plants and cycles in terrestrial ecosystems which in turn bring direct ecological impacts on agricultural sustainability and food security sun et al 2020 a few studies chen et al 2019 li et al 2020 lian et al 2020 sun et al 2020 wu et al 2020 have focused on the effects of nps on terrestrial plants which are listed in table s1 for example sun et al 2020 found that ps nps ps nps induced the accumulation of reactive oxygen species ros in arabidopsis thaliana which strongly inhibited plant growth and seedling development li et al 2020 further revealed the crack entry mode and transpirational pull as the main drivers of submicron plastic uptake in wheat triticum aestivum and lettuce lactuca sativa terrestrial plants are exposed to nps mainly through sewage and sludge application sato et al 2013 agricultural land film lysis boots et al 2019 brewer et al 2021 and atmospheric deposition guo et al 2020 compared to them aquatic plants are directly under exposure to ubiquitous nps in the aquatic ecosystem however the effects of nps on aquatic plants and the aquatic ecosystem are not yet clear zhang et al 2022 environmental stress could cause the oxidative stress and further interferes with proteomic and metabolomic levels nasser and lynch 2016 vo et al 2021 wang et al 2010 environmental stresses including uv light drought herbicides and nps have been shown to increase the production of antioxidant enzymes e g catalase cat peroxidase pod and superoxide dismutase sod and in plants lozano and rillig 2020 zhang and kirkham 1994 although a few antioxidant enzymes were found to show a dose dependent relationship with nps li et al 2021a lian et al 2021 wu et al 2020 induced antioxidant response pathways and the role of the corresponding antioxidant enzyme activities are still unclear yamada et al 2020 when plants are subjected to abiotic stress metabolomics provides information on changes in their metabolites and metabolic pathways and thus has been proven to be an effective tool to understand changes in plant chemistry and further reveal the mechanisms cao et al 2021 vo et al 2021 worley and powers 2012 metabolomics revealed that energy production interfered and carbohydrate metabolism were the major sources of adverse effects for rice oryza sativa l and barley exposed to mps suggesting an important detoxification mechanism to protect plants from stress chen et al 2019 li et al 2021a wu et al 2020 however the effects of nps on key metabolite activities may be different from those of mps li et al 2021a and few studies have applied metabolomics to assess the feasibility of the effects of nps on plants especially aquatic plants utricularia vulgaris u vulgaris is a perennial rootless typical submerged aquatic insectivorous plant that is widely distributed in eutrophic mesotrophic to mildly eutrophic waters e g lakes fishponds dam reservoirs swamps in europe north africa and asia prausová et al 2022 as an important low trophic level producer u vulgaris demonstrates advantages in maintaining the water ecological balance and purifying water and therefore it has been widely used as a functional plant in constructed wetlands cws arnon 1949 kibriya and iwan jones 2007 u vulgaris have tiny insect traps which could intake nutrients and pollutants simultaneously sirová et al 2009 previous studies showed that mps inhibited the growth photosynthesis and cell viability of phytoplankton diatom and cryptophyte nava and leoni 2021 and submerged plants vallisneria natans zhang et al 2022 consequently we hypothesize that i plant growth photosynthesis antioxidant systems and metabolic systems would respond differently to high and low doses of nps exposure ii nps could inhibit the water purification function of plants by affecting enzymes involved in energy and ros metabolism indirectly causing adverse effects to aquatic ecosystems to our knowledge it is the first study to highlight the effects of nps on the growth metabolism oxidative stress and water purification of typical submerged plants and provide new insights into the potential health risks and ecological impacts of nps on aquatic plants and ecosystems 2 materials and methods 2 1 nanoplastics and plant materials the green monodispersed fluorescently labeled ps nps were synthesized by zhongkeleiming daojin technology co ltd beijing china 500 nm was selected due to its widespread and potential toxic effects trevisan et al 2022 to prevent precipitation and unbound staining nps were sonicated and purified in ultrapure water 18 2 mω hitech shanghai china before the experiment setup the morphology fig 1 a and infrared spectra fig 1 b of ps nps were characterized using scanning electron microscopy sem fei hillsboro usa and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy

502 nm and an average of 500 5 nm fig s1 u vulgaris collected at beijing city park was selected as the target plant since it is a carnivorous rootless and submerged aquatic herb widely distributed in the freshwater system e g lakes ponds and wetlands and thus commonly utilized as one of the major plants in the freshwater ecosystem mieczan and bartkowska 2022 sirová et al 2009 the leaves of u vulgaris have tiny insect traps each of which contains microbial symbionts forming a plant microbe system sirová et al 2009 in addition to the normal uptake of nutrients through the plant surface the traps can also capture small phytoplankton becoming the main source of nutrient intake yu et al 2020 2 2 experimental design the collected u vulgaris were moved into glass containers φ160mm 250mm with

to monitor the potential contamination during the laboratory background every batch of fifteen samples was processed with procedural blanks all experiments were set up with three replicates no nps were detected in the laboratory environment and in addition four concentration gradients of ps nps without plants showed no significant change in concentration as well as size distribution after 15 day exposure experiments 2 8 data analysis uparse version 7 0 http drive5 com uparse was used to cluster operational taxonomic units using 97 similarity criteria using the ribosomal database project

significant graphics were drawn using r studio 3 5 1 and origin pro version 9 1 origin lab 3 results and discussion 3 1 uptake and translocation of ps nps in this study exposure experiments of ps nps were conducted using four concentration gradients including 0 0 1 1 and 10 mg l 1 the results showed that the plant heights increased among all four concentration gradients of exposure fig 2 a in the control group ps nps at 0 mg l 1 the plant height increased from 10 cm to 15 9 0 5 cm and the plant heights in the 0 1 1 and 10 mg l 1 exposure groups were 15 5 0 3 14 3 0 5 and 11 6 0 4 cm respectively in particular compared with the other three groups the ps nps exposure at 10 mg l 1 significantly mann whitney u test p 0 05 inhibited the plant height the rgr of u vulgaris was also affected by the exposure concentrations of ps nps fig 2 b which was 17 2 1 2 15 6 0 4 12 8 1 2 and 7 4 1 6 at ps nps exposure concentrations of 0 0 1 1 and 10 mg l 1 respectively compared with the exposure to ps nps at 0 0 1 and 1 mg l 1 the exposure to ps nps at 10 mg l 1 significantly mann whitney u test p 0 01 0 01 and 0 05 reduced the rgr of u vulgaris and the inhibition of biomass was enhanced with increasing ps nps concentrations on appearance u vulgaris in the control group were in good ecological condition with firm rhizomes and thick and luxuriant new branches while after the exposure to 10 mg l 1 ps nps u vulgaris grew up with thin sparse new leaves and severe capsular abscission in connection with previous studies showing that ps mps inhibited the growth of submerged plants only at very high exposure doses vallisneria natans 50 mg l 1 u vulgaris 140 mg l 1 while ps nps in this study inhibited u vulgaris even at low doses 0 1 10 mg l 1 yu et al 2020 zhang et al 2022 and the side shoot length root and rgr of macrophytes such as elodea sp and m spicatum were reduced under exposure to ps nps while no consistent dose effect relationships were found after exposure to ps mps van weert et al 2019 the above studies may indicate that compared with mps nps may have different exposure patterns and metabolic pathways thus leading to higher potential toxicity in addition even low doses of nps could negatively affect plant growth jiang et al 2020 trevisan et al 2022 given that the concentrations of nps in the aqueous environment are much higher than those of mps their ecotoxicity and environmental risks deserve further study liu et al 2020 plastics of the nanometer 1 100 nm submicron 100 nm to 1 µm and micron 1 µm to 5 mm sizes could be absorbed by plant roots under hydroponic conditions and subsequently transported from the roots to the shoots li et al 2020 lian et al 2020 these microplastics accumulated would hinder the growth of plants and disrupt the balance of ecosystems although u vulgaris are rhizosphere free aquatic plants they have insect traps that could capture insects and ingest mps nps simultaneously yu et al 2020 therefore insect traps stems and leaves of u vulgaris exposed to 10 mg l 1 ps nps were selected made into sections and observed under sem with images presented in fig 3 a large number of 500 nm spherical particles were found at the entrance and interior of insect traps fig 3 a and 3 b which confirmed for the first time that nps could enter the interior of the insect traps in addition the ps nps were also found in the vascular ducts of plant stems fig 3 c and 3 d as well as in the leaf veins fig 3 e and 3 f similar studies in wheat and arabidopsis thaliana also showed that both ps mps and ps nps accumulated in different tissues providing direct evidence for the internalization of nps in terrestrial plants li et al 2020 sun et al 2020 compared to terrestrial plants aquatic plants with multiform nutrient uptake structures and submerged modes are more susceptible to pollutant stress and therefore can be used as indicator species for water pollution kibriya and iwan jones 2007 wang et al 2020 the pathways of nps entering the stems and leaves of u vulgaris or plants are not fully understood li et al 2020 although existing studies have shown that when irrigated with treated wastewater the slit entry pattern is the basic pattern of ps mps uptake by plants li et al 2020 since u vulgaris are rootless and obtain nutrients primarily by capturing and digesting prey in the insect traps kibriya and iwan jones 2007 the insect traps or bladders absorb nutrients from the environment through the ducts attached to the leaves at the end they are transferred to the leaves and stems to supply plant growth and development in the process it will inevitably take in the ubiquitous nps from the aqueous environment which in turn will enter the leaves and stems with the nutrients yu et al 2020 moreover higher transpiration rates would enhance the uptake of plastic particles with the transpiration pull acting as the main driving force li et al 2020 to our knowledge the present study is the first to find that nps could enter from insect traps and transport through ductal tissue into plants which may not only limit the nutrient uptake and capture efficiency but also bring the risk of plastic contamination to the typical carnivorous plant u vulgaris magrì et al 2018 3 2 impacts on photosynthesis plant photosynthetic pigments such as chl a chl b and chl t play an important role in absorbing and converting energy during photosynthesis and since their contents reflect photosynthesis efficiency photosynthetic pigments are important indicators of plant growth status yu et al 2022 in addition to light quality chlorophyll production is influenced by mineral nutrition and chemical metabolites produced by plants ahmad et al 2018 thus when plants are stressed under adverse conditions the metabolic functions of chloroplasts and cysts would lead to a decrease in photosynthesis efficiency and correspondingly photosynthetic pigments du et al 2015 chlorophyll contents in u vulgaris leaves significantly decreased at 10 mg l 1 mann whitney u test p 0 01 after exposure to ps nps fig 4 with chl t only 75 2 0 2 of that from the control group indicating the inhibition from ps nps to plant photosynthesis to date there is little evidence to describe the direct pathway or mechanism of ps nps effects on plant photosynthesis lian et al 2020 the aggregation size of nps is one of the main factors decreasing the chlorophyll content du et al 2015 after being ingested by plants into their tissues plastic particles have a shading effect to reduce the contact area between plants and light and could cause damage to plant cell membranes altering the composition of pigments and proteins thereby reducing photosynthetic efficiency lian et al 2020 in addition nanoparticles tend to cause a decrease in the production of photons in photosynthesis and affect the expression of their functional genes tighe neira et al 2018 these changes have the potential to affect the growth and vigor of the plants du et al 2015 3 3 impacts on oxidative stress responses during the aerobic metabolism of organisms oxygen atoms could be converted into reactive oxygen containing compounds or ros through oxygen containing metabolism which catalyzes cell aging and brings irreversible damage li et al 2021a when plants are subjected to external stimuli ros would accumulate inside and plants have their antioxidant capacity producing antioxidants to eliminate the adverse effects of ros wang et al 2010 therefore levels of antioxidant enzymes and antioxidants are closely related to the degree of oxidative damage and are important indicators commonly used to assess damage to plant growth lian et al 2021 wu et al 2020 one of the most important consequences of abiotic stress is the disruption of the balance between ros production and antioxidant defense systems which triggers the excessive accumulation of ros and induces oxidative stress in plants hasanuzzaman et al 2020 therefore mda and antioxidant enzymes including cat pod sod and t aoc were measured to investigate the oxidative damage of u vulgaris under concentration gradients of ps nps exposure mda is a secondary peroxidation product of membrane lipid peroxidation caused by excess reactive oxygen species and could indirectly respond to the degree of cell membrane damage and plant resilience wu et al 2020 zhang et al 2022 in this study the results fig 5 a showed that mda contents produced under low dose 0 1 mg l 1 exposure were 1 22 times higher than that in the control group and with increasing concentration mda contents in the high does 1 and 10 mg l 1 exposure groups increased to 2 03 and 2 66 times of the control group respectively moreover mda produced in the high dose 10 mg l 1 exposure group was significantly higher mann whitney u test p 0 01 than that in the control group which indicated that high doses of ps nps affected u vulgaris with potential membrane damage leading to an imbalance in lipid peroxidation and could not be rapidly alleviated yu et al 2020 antioxidant enzymes showed similar trends in the four exposure groups fig 5 b compared to the control group cat pod and sod production increased 62 4 75 9 35 4 72 8 and 18 4 49 2 respectively at high ps nps exposure groups 1 and 10 mg l 1 while the effect of low exposure group 0 1 mg l 1 was not significant when plants grow under stress superoxide radicals are gradually produced and accumulated in tissues and excess free radicals could bring dna damage as well as lipid oxidation lian et al 2021 wang et al 2010 cat pod and sod are the main acting enzymes of the enzymatic scavenging system and have been extensively characterized for their physiological roles in protecting cells from toxic oxygen species in response to environmental stresses such as ozone drought salinity and cold gill and tuteja 2010 hasanuzzaman et al 2020 zhang and kirkham 1994 specifically sod plays an important role in the cellular scavenging of superoxide radicals and could react with free radicals to produce the disproportionation product h2o2 than being broken down into the water by cat and pod singh et al 2006 our previous study found that u vulgaris is resistant to mps because ros is broken down by various scavengers yu et al 2022 further however when lowering the particle size this study showed that higher doses of ps nps caused more intense oxidative stress resulting in the contents of antioxidant enzymes in u vulgaris increasing with increasing ps nps exposure which may not be rapidly alleviated as an important component of the antioxidant defense system of plants t aoc responded to plant health wang et al 2020 results showed that the t aoc of u vulgaris increased first and then decreased with increasing ps nps exposure concentrations fig 5 c the increase in t aoc was due to the ps nps stress activating the defense system of plants to produce antioxidant substances and antioxidant enzymes hasanuzzaman et al 2020 compared with the control group t aoc contents increased by 10 7 under 0 1 mg l 1 exposure and by 19 3 under 1 mg l 1 exposure however as ps nps exposure concentration continued to increase from 1 to 10 mg l 1 t aoc contents decreased from 6 9 to 5 6 μmol g 1 similar trends were also found in lactuca sativa l showing that t aoc declined after high ps nps lian et al 2021 high doses of ps nps exposure excited too many superoxide radicals beyond the scavenging capacity of plant antioxidant enzymes damaging their antioxidant defense system racchi 2013 in other words low doses of stress might stimulate the plant to turn on its defense performance when the stress continues to increase beyond tolerance its defense system might be damaged without the possibility of recovery under environmental stress ros bursts can cause significant damage to cells and tissues such as apoptosis leading to organ degeneration and plant death hasanuzzaman et al 2020 h2o2 is one of the ros which could be toxic to plants at high doses and also act as a signaling molecule together with superoxide anion involved in regulating plant development yamada et al 2020 to further explore the extent of oxidative stimulation of plants by ps nps plant leaves were stained with dab thus locating the concentration and distribution of h2o2 in the tissues higher values of iod indicated higher levels of accumulated h2o2 in the leaves after staining the colors of plant leaves exposed to 0 1 mg l 1 were not significantly different from that of the control group with a light color fig 5 d and only 1 28 times the iod of the control group fig 5 e while starting from 1 mg l 1 the color of plants was significantly deepened fig 5 d showing the iod of 1 and 10 mg l 1 exposure groups were 1 79 and 1 88 times of the control group fig 5 e which indicated that high dose of ps nps induced a higher accumulation of h2o2 in the plants bringing more severe oxidative damage to u vulgaris yu et al 2022 to re establish ros homeostasis under environmental stress plants developed ros scavenging systems including antioxidant enzymes and non enzymatic antioxidants gill and tuteja 2010 in this way the trends of h2o2 and iod were consistent with the trend of mda contents since increased h2o2 levels lead to the production of lipid peroxides and the accumulation of mda as a final product chen et al 2019 the oxidative damage caused by plastic particles are influenced by particle size concentrations and the polymer type boots et al 2019 in this study h2o2 accumulation in plants leaves was not significantly different between the two exposure groups 1 and 10 mg l 1 which was consistent with the results of pod suggesting that possibly 1 mg l 1 is the ps nps concentration threshold leading to a complete change in plant antioxidant function sirová et al 2009 yamada et al 2020 moreover exposure to smaller size plastic particles 100 nm ps nps brought higher genotoxicity and oxidative damage than those of larger size 5 µm ps nps jiang et al 2019 3 4 nanoplastics disrupt metabolic pathways intracellular life activities such as cell signaling energy transfer and intercellular communication are regulated by metabolites vo et al 2021 thus metabolomics is closely related to the nutritional status of cells and the influence of external factors including external environmental stresses from contaminants deng et al 2019 both compositions and contents of small molecule metabolites e g sugars lipids amino acids aromatic hydrocarbons etc would change when plants are subjected to external stimuli and their quantitative analysis enables the inference of potential pathways through which ps nps affect the growth and metabolism of u vulgaris chen et al 2019 li et al 2021a in this study a total of 482 metabolites were detected in u vulgaris leaves in cationic mode after exposure to ps nps these metabolites were screened by partial least squares discriminant analysis pls da the variable important in projection vip value is the weight value of variables in the pls da model and vip 1 is a common metabolite screening criterion with a larger vip value representing a greater variety of metabolites between samples worley and powers 2012 thus based on vip values and p values vip 1 p 0 05 243 metabolites were screened in which about 39 of metabolites were all lower than that in the control group and about 55 of metabolites were higher than that in the control group in contrast 548 metabolites were detected in u vulgaris leaves in the anion mode and 291 metabolites were screened based on pls da of which about 41 metabolites were all lower than that in the control group and about 42 metabolites were higher than that in the control group the relative quantity of identified metabolites in cationic mode and anionic mode are listed in table s2 and table s3 heatmaps of the relative content of metabolites in cationic mode and anionic mode are presented in fig s2 overall large numbers of primary metabolites were significantly altered mann whitney u test p 0 05 after exposure to ps nps including amino acids sugars lipids organic acids etc compared to the control group about 34 of the metabolites were up regulated in metabolite expression and 32 were down regulated in metabolite expression under 0 1 mg l 1 ps nps exposure fig 6 a and metabolites involved in enrichment pathways including alanine aspartate and glutamate metabolic pathways fig 6 b which play a key role in plant nitrogen metabolism u vulgaris leaves under 1 mg l 1 ps nps exposure resulted in about 25 up regulation of metabolite expression and 40 metabolite expression was down regulated fig 6 c and the activities of key enzymes involved in the tricarboxylic acid tca cycle metabolism of arginine and proline were significantly affected fig 6 d tca cycle is the final metabolic pathway and the hub for the metabolic linkage of three major nutrients sugars lipids and amino acids li et al 2021a vo et al 2021 arginine is a precursor for the synthesis of substances such as polyamines and nitric oxide which are both important messenger molecules in plants involved in physiological and biochemical processes including growth and development signaling and environmental sensing etc winter et al 2015 u vulgaris leaves under 10 mg l 1 ps nps exposure resulted in the upregulation of about 29 metabolite expression and downregulation of 38 metabolite expression fig 6 e affecting metabolic pathways including the biosynthesis of alanine aspartate and glutamate metabolism flavonoid and flavonol fig 6 f in which β alanine is accumulated as a general stress response molecule involved in the protection of plants from extreme temperature hypoxia drought and biotic stresses parthasarathy et al 2019 aspartate synthesizes four essential amino acids lysine threonine methionine and isoleucine through several different branches of metabolism as well as the amino acid glycine a key photorespiratory intermediate kirma et al 2012 glutamate occupies a central position in plant amino acid metabolism and is involved in the synthesis of acidic amino acids forde and lea 2007 flavonoids and flavonols could scavenge free radicals and enhance antioxidant capacity panche et al 2016 similar to previous studies revealing that synergistic regulation of glutamate and alanine synthesis was an adaptive response of m truncatula seedlings to hypoxic stress limami et al 2008 these above significant effects on metabolic pathways suggest that ps nps had stimulatory effects on energy metabolic processes of u vulgaris especially in growth and stress resistance chen et al 2019 wu et al 2020 further analysis of the disturbed tca cycle and amino acid biosynthesis pathways in u vulgaris after ps nps exposure was conducted fig 7 showing the tca cycling and amino acid metabolism in u vulgaris were severely disrupted after exposure to different doses of ps nps which citric acid threonine and adenine contents decreased by 9 8 23 9 18 6 25 8 and 5 0 13 1 respectively with higher doses of ps nps leading to higher inhibition rates similar results were also found in caenorhabditis elegans human cells and rice suggesting the potential effects of nps on global metabolic shifts in organisms and expressed genes were usually enriched in the amino acid biosynthesis pathway wang et al 2022 wu et al 2020 the amino acid reduction can affect the different biological functions of proteins in cells which would affect protein biosynthesis and energy production for plants lian et al 2021 in addition many amino acid contents showed a trend of ascending then descending with increasing ps nps concentration indicating that low doses of ps nps induced an increase in metabolite content while high dose 10 mg l 1 ps nps inhibited metabolic activities for example contents of serine phenylalanine and histidine increased by 13 1 0 4 44 4 2 5 and 30 0 1 7 under 0 1 mg l 1 ps nps while decreasing by 11 7 0 3 17 3 1 1 and 4 0 0 1 under 10 mg l 1 ps nps amino acids such as proline lysine and isoleucine etc also showed a low promoting and high suppressing effect importantly plant amino acids have a role in signal transduction and anti stress defense therefore the dramatic decrease in t aoc might be attributed to the decrease in amino acids with antioxidant capacity lian et al 2021 although existing studies on the expression of metabolic pathways in organisms affected by ps nps exposure are not yet clear li et al 2021b wang et al 2022 the trends of these amino acids were similar to the expression of ion transport related genes in mycobacterium japonicum after exposure to ps nps as well as those of antioxidant enzymes in this study which were also important metabolites involved in the stress resistance system of organisms wang et al 2020 3 5 impacts on water properties and ecosystem functioning many aquatic plant species such as water hyacinth eichhornia crassipes floating duckweed lemnaspp and reed phragmites australis have been widely used to remove nutrients from polluted river water or wastewater su et al 2019 among them submerged plants have efficient removal rates of eutrophic substances such as nitrogen phosphorus and other nutrients showing the ability to effectively control eutrophication in water bodies su et al 2019 thiébaut 2008 however since mps or nps could interfere with the composition and abundance of environmental flora and pollutants they may have an impact on the function of plants to purify water sanz lázaro et al 2021 therefore concentrations of tn and tp in the exposure solution were measured every three days after the start of the exposure experiment tn and tp were obtained from hoagland solution with initial concentrations of 2 8 and 0 5 ppm respectively concerning the concentration range of tn and tp in cws li et al 2021c xing et al 2020 overall tn fig 8 a and tp fig 8 b decreased after 15 days of exposure indicating the uptake and removal of nutrient salts by u vulgaris within the first three days the removal effect of tn in the three exposure groups was not significant with the extension of exposure time the removal effects of tn in the 10 mg l 1 group started to decrease from the third day while the removal effects of 0 1 and 1 mg l 1 groups started to slow down from day 6 at the end of the experiment removal rates of tn in each group showed the trend of 0 mg l 1 25 8 1 3 0 1 mg l 1 22 4 1 1 1 mg l 1 21 4 1 3 10 mg l 1 19 2 0 7 for tp no significant difference in tp between the control and the three exposure groups during the first six days after 15 days removal rates of tp in the 10 mg l 1 group were only 23 3 0 6 which was only 72 7 8 4 of that in the control group after 15 days the removal rate of tp in the control group reached 31 7 3 2 and the removal rates of 0 1 and 1 mg l 1 groups also decreased to 29 7 2 1 and 27 0 2 4 respectively the trends in the removal rates of tn and tp might be due to the damaged roots of the newly transplanted plants which promoted the growth of new roots and subsequently the plants adapted to the ps nps exposed environment with reduced removal of tn and tp su et al 2019 although the removal rates of tn by u vulgaris were not as effective as those of ipomoea aquatica 90 6 salvinia natans 67 3 pistia stratiotes and lemna sp 63 2 and 36 2 in the removal of tn the removal rates of tp by u vulgaris were higher than those of ipomoea aquatica 8 8 and salvinia natans 14 2 even under ps nps pressure su et al 2019 sudiarto et al 2019 the main removal pathways of tn and tp involve the synergistic action of plant roots insect traps and microorganisms by microbial activity or directly absorbed by plants su et al 2019 furthermore mps or nps could alter the abundance and composition of microbial communities as well as the nitrogen cycling processes in plants or the aquatic environment fig 8 c which in turn affects the nutrient cycling processes in the freshwater ecosystem sanz lázaro et al 2021 seeley et al 2020 considering that in the field environment with sufficient light and suitable temperature u vulgaris reproduce very quickly growing 3 4 times their original length and reaching a total length of 1 m in a short time and that u vulgaris are community symbiotic plants existing in bulk in wetlands and ponds arnon 1949 kibriya and iwan jones 2007 they have relatively benign effects on water quality and aquatic ecosystems yu et al 2020 u vulgaris has great potential in the purification of eutrophic water thus the impacts of ps nps on their water properties and ecosystem functioning should be further seriously studied 4 conclusions ps nps 500 nm were absorbed by insect traps and further transported to stems and leaves which not only activated or even impaired the oxidative defense system and nutrient availability ultimately posing a threat to human health chen et al 2019 li et al 2020 but also reduced the purifying effect of aquatic plants on water quality ultimately posing an unknown ecological risk to aquatic environments specifically u vulgaris suffered from oxidative stress as evidenced by an increase in mda antioxidant enzymes cat pod and sod h2o2 and iod with increasing ps nps concentrations approximately 25 34 of metabolites were up regulated and 32 40 of metabolites were down regulated in metabolite expression after exposure the tca cycle and amino acid biosynthesis were severely disrupted citric acid threonine and adenine contents decreased with the increasing ps nps concentrations while amino acids such as serine phenylalanine histidine etc ascended then descended with increasing concentration indicating that low dose ps nps stimulated metabolic activities while high dose 10 mg l 1 ps nps inhibited metabolic activities ps nps affected the removal of nitrogen and phosphorus from water by u vulgaris bringing potential risks to water ecological functions field life cycle studies and long term effects of nps on multiple aquatic plants are needed to better understand the effects of nps in cws credit authorship contribution statement yang liu data curation methodology

15311,constructed wetlands cws are an important barrier to prevent nanoplastics nps and microplastics mps from entering receiving streams however little is known about how the accumulation of nps affects the growth photosynthesis oxidative stress responses and metabolism of plants especially submerged plants that are widely used in cws for water purification herein we adopted utricularia vulgaris u vulgaris a typical submerged macrophyte as the model plant to address the above knowledge gaps under exposure to polystyrene nps ps nps 500 nm 0 10 mg l 1 results showed that ps nps were

from oxidative stresses as evidenced by the increase in malondialdehyde antioxidant enzymes catalase peroxidase and superoxide dismutase and h2o2 especially under 1 and 10 mg l 1 abundances of 548 metabolites were quantified and 291 metabolites were detected with altered levels after exposure in which 25 34 metabolites were up regulated and 32 40 metabolites were down regulated in metabolite expression metabolic pathways of the tricarboxylic acid cycle and amino acid were disrupted in which citric acid threonine and adenine decreased while amino acids like serine phenylalanine histidine etc increased first and then decreased with increasing ps nps concentrations moreover ps nps reduced the removal efficiency of total nitrogen and phosphorus from water by u vulgaris bringing potential risks to aquatic ecosystems these findings have greatly enhanced our understanding of the metabolic mechanisms and interactions of aquatic macrophytes that are heavily used in cws in response to nps

freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems as well as their widespread involvement in almost all food webs mps and nps pollution has become a major global environmental issue alongside global warming ozone depletion and ocean acidification galloway and lewis 2016 in particular the plastic medical waste and protective supplies used in large quantities during the covid 19 pandemic have contributed to plastic pollution patrício silva et al 2022 prata et al 2020 polystyrene ps is one of the most abundant polymers dominating mps pollution in rivers from switzerland faure et al 2015 china liu et al 2020 and effluents from sewage plants discharging into receiving waters park et al 2020 chronic exposure to mps and nps can adversely affect individual organisms through reduced feeding and depletion of energy stores bringing knock on effects on fecundity and growth and further affecting deep sea carbon fluxes and the global carbon cycle galloway et al 2017 ecologically the microscopic size of nps allows them to cross biological barriers and enter cells while the high surface area to volume ratio enhances their reactivity nel et al 2009 moreover the trojan horse effect of nps enriches and carries pollutants from the aquatic environment into plants such as herbicides pesticides and antibiotics and promotes their uptake and accumulation in plants lim 2021 in addition nps aggregate more readily with plankton natural colloids and suspended particulate matter than mps making them more bioavailable for filter feeding and suspension feeding organisms brewer et al 2021 current toxicological studies indicate that nps are immunotoxic metabolically toxic endocrine toxic neurotoxic developmentally toxic and have other deleterious effects causing organ damage and behavioral changes in aquatic animals such as daphnia magna pacific oysters crassostrea gigas and monogonont rotifer brachionus koreanus cole and galloway 2015 nasser and lynch 2016 plants can take up engineered nanomaterials such as metals oxides etc and accumulate them in branches and roots cao et al 2021 du et al 2015 suggesting the potential for nps uptake by plants and cycles in terrestrial ecosystems which in turn bring direct ecological impacts on agricultural sustainability and food security sun et al 2020 a few studies chen et al 2019 li et al 2020 lian et al 2020 sun et al 2020 wu et al 2020 have focused on the effects of nps on terrestrial plants which are listed in table s1 for example sun et al 2020 found that ps nps ps nps induced the accumulation of reactive oxygen species ros in arabidopsis thaliana which strongly inhibited plant growth and seedling development li et al 2020 further revealed the crack entry mode and transpirational pull as the main drivers of submicron plastic uptake in wheat triticum aestivum and lettuce lactuca sativa terrestrial plants are exposed to nps mainly through sewage and sludge application sato et al 2013 agricultural land film lysis boots et al 2019 brewer et al 2021 and atmospheric deposition guo et al 2020 compared to them aquatic plants are directly under exposure to ubiquitous nps in the aquatic ecosystem however the effects of nps on aquatic plants and the aquatic ecosystem are not yet clear zhang et al 2022 environmental stress could cause the oxidative stress and further interferes with proteomic and metabolomic levels nasser and lynch 2016 vo et al 2021 wang et al 2010 environmental stresses including uv light drought herbicides and nps have been shown to increase the production of antioxidant enzymes e g catalase cat peroxidase pod and superoxide dismutase sod and in plants lozano and rillig 2020 zhang and kirkham 1994 although a few antioxidant enzymes were found to show a dose dependent relationship with nps li et al 2021a lian et al 2021 wu et al 2020 induced antioxidant response pathways and the role of the corresponding antioxidant enzyme activities are still unclear yamada et al 2020 when plants are subjected to abiotic stress metabolomics provides information on changes in their metabolites and metabolic pathways and thus has been proven to be an effective tool to understand changes in plant chemistry and further reveal the mechanisms cao et al 2021 vo et al 2021 worley and powers 2012 metabolomics revealed that energy production interfered and carbohydrate metabolism were the major sources of adverse effects for rice oryza sativa l and barley exposed to mps suggesting an important detoxification mechanism to protect plants from stress chen et al 2019 li et al 2021a wu et al 2020 however the effects of nps on key metabolite activities may be different from those of mps li et al 2021a and few studies have applied metabolomics to assess the feasibility of the effects of nps on plants especially aquatic plants utricularia vulgaris u vulgaris is a perennial rootless typical submerged aquatic insectivorous plant that is widely distributed in eutrophic mesotrophic to mildly eutrophic waters e g lakes fishponds dam reservoirs swamps in europe north africa and asia prausová et al 2022 as an important low trophic level producer u vulgaris demonstrates advantages in maintaining the water ecological balance and purifying water and therefore it has been widely used as a functional plant in constructed wetlands cws arnon 1949 kibriya and iwan jones 2007 u vulgaris have tiny insect traps which could intake nutrients and pollutants simultaneously sirová et al 2009 previous studies showed that mps inhibited the growth photosynthesis and cell viability of phytoplankton diatom and cryptophyte nava and leoni 2021 and submerged plants vallisneria natans zhang et al 2022 consequently we hypothesize that i plant growth photosynthesis antioxidant systems and metabolic systems would respond differently to high and low doses of nps exposure ii nps could inhibit the water purification function of plants by affecting enzymes involved in energy and ros metabolism indirectly causing adverse effects to aquatic ecosystems to our knowledge it is the first study to highlight the effects of nps on the growth metabolism oxidative stress and water purification of typical submerged plants and provide new insights into the potential health risks and ecological impacts of nps on aquatic plants and ecosystems 2 materials and methods 2 1

502 nm and an average of 500 5 nm fig s1 u vulgaris collected at beijing city park was selected as the target plant since it is a carnivorous rootless and submerged aquatic herb widely distributed in the freshwater system e g lakes ponds and wetlands and thus commonly utilized as one of the major plants in the freshwater ecosystem mieczan and bartkowska 2022 sirová et al 2009 the leaves of u vulgaris have tiny insect traps each of which contains microbial symbionts forming a plant microbe system sirová et al 2009 in addition to the normal uptake of nutrients through the plant surface the traps can also capture small phytoplankton becoming the main source of nutrient intake yu et al 2020 2 2 experimental design the collected u vulgaris were moved into glass containers φ160mm 250mm with

significant graphics were drawn using r studio 3 5 1 and origin pro version 9 1 origin lab 3 results and discussion 3 1 uptake and translocation of ps nps in this study exposure experiments of ps nps were conducted using four concentration gradients including 0 0 1 1 and 10 mg l 1 the results showed that the plant heights increased among all four concentration gradients of exposure fig 2 a in the control group ps nps at 0 mg l 1 the plant height increased from 10 cm to 15 9 0 5 cm and the plant heights in the 0 1 1 and 10 mg l 1 exposure groups were 15 5 0 3 14 3 0 5 and 11 6 0 4 cm respectively in particular compared with the other three groups the ps nps exposure at 10 mg l 1 significantly mann whitney u test p 0 05 inhibited the plant height the rgr of u vulgaris was also affected by the exposure concentrations of ps nps fig 2 b which was 17 2 1 2 15 6 0 4 12 8 1 2 and 7 4 1 6 at ps nps exposure concentrations of 0 0 1 1 and 10 mg l 1 respectively compared with the

enhanced with increasing ps nps concentrations on appearance u vulgaris in the control group were in good ecological condition with firm rhizomes and thick and luxuriant new branches while after the exposure to 10 mg l 1 ps nps u vulgaris grew up with thin sparse new leaves and severe capsular abscission in connection with previous studies showing that ps mps inhibited the growth of submerged plants only at very high exposure doses vallisneria natans 50 mg l 1 u vulgaris 140 mg l 1 while ps nps in this study inhibited u vulgaris even at low doses 0 1 10 mg l 1 yu et al 2020 zhang et al 2022 and the side shoot length root and rgr of macrophytes such as elodea sp and m spicatum were reduced under exposure to ps nps while no consistent dose effect relationships were found after exposure to ps mps van weert et al 2019 the above studies may indicate that compared with mps nps may have different exposure patterns and metabolic pathways thus leading to higher potential toxicity in addition even low doses of nps could negatively affect plant growth jiang et al 2020 trevisan et al 2022 given that the concentrations of nps in the aqueous environment are much higher than those of mps their ecotoxicity and environmental risks deserve further study liu et al 2020 plastics of the nanometer 1 100 nm submicron 100 nm to 1 µm and micron 1 µm to 5 mm sizes could be absorbed by plant roots under hydroponic conditions and subsequently transported from the roots to the shoots li et al 2020 lian et al 2020 these microplastics accumulated would hinder the growth of plants and disrupt the balance of ecosystems although u vulgaris are rhizosphere free aquatic plants they have insect traps that could capture insects and ingest mps nps simultaneously yu et al 2020 therefore insect traps stems and leaves of u vulgaris exposed to 10 mg l 1 ps nps were selected made into sections and observed under sem with images presented in fig 3 a large number of 500 nm spherical particles were found at the entrance and interior of insect traps fig 3 a and 3 b which confirmed for the first time that nps could enter the interior of the insect traps in addition the ps nps were also found in the vascular ducts of plant stems fig 3 c and 3 d as well as in the leaf veins fig 3 e and 3 f similar studies in wheat and arabidopsis thaliana also showed that both ps mps and ps nps accumulated in different tissues providing direct evidence for the internalization of nps in terrestrial plants li et al 2020 sun et al 2020 compared to terrestrial plants aquatic plants with multiform nutrient uptake structures and submerged modes are more susceptible to pollutant stress and therefore can be used as indicator species for water pollution kibriya and iwan jones 2007 wang et al 2020 the pathways of nps entering the stems and leaves of u vulgaris or plants are not fully understood li et al 2020 although existing studies have shown that when irrigated with treated wastewater the slit entry pattern is the basic pattern of ps mps uptake by plants li et al 2020 since u vulgaris are rootless and obtain nutrients primarily by capturing and digesting prey in the insect traps kibriya and iwan jones 2007 the insect traps or bladders absorb nutrients from the environment through the ducts attached to the leaves at the end they are transferred to the leaves and stems to supply plant growth and development in the process it will inevitably take in the ubiquitous nps from the aqueous environment which in turn will enter the leaves and stems with the nutrients yu et al 2020 moreover higher transpiration rates would enhance the uptake of plastic particles with the transpiration pull acting as the main driving force li et al 2020 to our knowledge the present study is the first to find that nps could enter from insect traps and transport through ductal tissue into plants which may not only limit the nutrient uptake and capture efficiency but also bring the risk of plastic contamination to the typical carnivorous plant u vulgaris magrì et al 2018 3 2 impacts on photosynthesis plant photosynthetic pigments such as chl a chl b and chl t play an important role in absorbing and converting energy during photosynthesis and since their contents reflect photosynthesis efficiency photosynthetic pigments are important indicators of plant growth status yu et al 2022 in addition to light quality chlorophyll production is influenced by mineral nutrition and chemical metabolites produced by plants ahmad et al 2018 thus when plants are stressed under adverse conditions the metabolic functions of chloroplasts and cysts would lead to a decrease in photosynthesis efficiency and correspondingly photosynthetic pigments du et al 2015 chlorophyll contents in u vulgaris leaves significantly decreased at 10 mg l 1 mann whitney u test p 0 01 after exposure to ps nps fig 4 with chl t only 75 2 0 2 of that from the control group indicating the inhibition from ps nps to plant photosynthesis to date there is little evidence to describe the direct pathway or mechanism of ps nps effects on plant photosynthesis lian et al 2020 the aggregation size of nps is one of the main factors decreasing the chlorophyll content du et al 2015 after being ingested by plants into their tissues plastic particles have a shading effect to reduce the contact area between plants and light and could cause damage to plant cell membranes altering the composition of pigments and proteins thereby reducing photosynthetic efficiency lian et al 2020 in addition nanoparticles tend to cause a decrease in the production of photons in photosynthesis and affect the expression of their functional genes tighe neira et al 2018 these changes have the potential to affect the growth and vigor of the plants du et al 2015 3 3 impacts on oxidative stress responses during the aerobic metabolism of organisms oxygen atoms could be converted into reactive oxygen containing compounds or ros through oxygen containing metabolism which catalyzes cell aging and brings irreversible damage li et al 2021a when plants are subjected to external stimuli ros would accumulate inside and plants have their antioxidant capacity producing antioxidants to eliminate the adverse effects of ros wang et al 2010 therefore levels of antioxidant enzymes and antioxidants are closely related to the degree of oxidative damage and are important indicators commonly used to assess damage to plant growth lian et al 2021 wu et al 2020 one of the most important consequences of abiotic stress is the disruption of the balance between ros production and antioxidant defense systems which triggers the excessive accumulation of ros and induces oxidative stress in plants hasanuzzaman et al 2020 therefore mda and antioxidant enzymes including cat pod sod and t aoc were measured to investigate the oxidative damage of u vulgaris under concentration gradients of ps nps exposure mda is a secondary peroxidation product of membrane lipid peroxidation caused by excess reactive oxygen species and could indirectly respond to the degree of cell membrane damage and plant resilience wu et al 2020 zhang et al 2022 in this study the results fig 5 a showed that mda contents produced under low dose 0 1 mg l 1 exposure were 1 22 times higher than that in the control group and with increasing concentration mda contents in the high does 1 and 10 mg l 1 exposure groups increased to 2 03 and 2 66 times of the control group respectively moreover mda produced in the high dose 10 mg l 1 exposure group was significantly higher mann whitney u test p 0 01 than that in the control group which indicated that high doses of ps nps affected u vulgaris with potential membrane damage leading to an imbalance in lipid peroxidation and could not be rapidly alleviated yu et al 2020 antioxidant enzymes showed similar trends in the four exposure groups fig 5 b compared to the control group cat pod and sod production increased 62 4 75 9 35 4 72 8 and 18 4 49 2 respectively at high ps nps exposure groups 1 and 10 mg l 1 while the effect of low exposure group 0 1 mg l 1 was not significant when plants grow under stress superoxide radicals are gradually produced and accumulated in tissues and excess free radicals could bring dna damage as well as lipid oxidation lian et al 2021 wang et al 2010 cat pod and sod are the main acting enzymes of the enzymatic scavenging system and have been extensively characterized for their physiological roles in protecting cells from toxic oxygen species in response to environmental stresses such as ozone drought salinity and cold gill and tuteja 2010 hasanuzzaman et al 2020 zhang and kirkham 1994 specifically sod plays an important role in the cellular scavenging of superoxide radicals and could react with free radicals to produce the disproportionation product h2o2 than being broken down into the water by cat and pod singh et al 2006 our previous study found that u vulgaris is resistant to mps because ros is broken down by various scavengers yu et al 2022 further however when lowering the particle size this study showed that higher doses of ps nps caused more intense oxidative stress resulting in the contents of antioxidant enzymes in u vulgaris increasing with increasing ps nps exposure which may not be rapidly alleviated as an important component of the antioxidant defense system of plants t aoc responded to plant health wang et al 2020 results showed that the t aoc of u vulgaris increased first and then decreased with increasing ps nps exposure concentrations fig 5 c the increase in t aoc was due to the ps nps stress activating the defense system of plants to produce antioxidant substances and antioxidant enzymes hasanuzzaman et al 2020 compared with the control group t aoc contents increased by 10 7 under 0 1 mg l 1 exposure and by 19 3 under 1 mg l 1 exposure however as ps nps exposure concentration continued to increase from 1 to 10 mg l 1 t aoc contents decreased from 6 9 to 5 6 μmol g 1 similar trends were also found in lactuca sativa l showing that t aoc declined after high ps nps lian et al 2021 high doses of ps nps exposure excited too many superoxide radicals beyond the scavenging capacity of plant antioxidant enzymes damaging their antioxidant defense system racchi 2013 in other words low doses of stress might stimulate the plant to turn on its defense performance when the stress continues to increase beyond tolerance its defense system might be damaged without the possibility of recovery under environmental stress ros bursts can cause significant damage to cells and tissues such as apoptosis leading to organ degeneration and plant death hasanuzzaman et al 2020 h2o2 is one of the ros which could be toxic to plants at high doses and also act as a signaling molecule together with superoxide anion involved in regulating plant development yamada et al 2020 to further explore the extent of oxidative stimulation of plants by ps nps plant leaves were stained with dab thus locating the concentration and distribution of h2o2 in the tissues higher values of iod indicated higher levels of accumulated h2o2 in the leaves after staining the colors of plant leaves exposed to 0 1 mg l 1 were not significantly different from that of the control group with a light color fig 5 d and only 1 28 times the iod of the control group fig 5 e while starting from 1 mg l 1 the color of plants was significantly deepened fig 5 d showing the iod of 1 and 10 mg l 1 exposure groups were 1 79 and 1 88 times of the control group fig 5 e which indicated that high dose of ps nps induced a higher accumulation of h2o2 in the plants bringing more severe oxidative damage to u vulgaris yu et al 2022 to re establish ros homeostasis under environmental stress plants developed ros scavenging systems including antioxidant enzymes and non enzymatic antioxidants gill and tuteja 2010 in this way the trends of h2o2 and iod were consistent with the trend of mda contents since increased h2o2 levels lead to the production of lipid peroxides and the accumulation of mda as a final product chen et al 2019 the oxidative damage caused by plastic particles are influenced by particle size concentrations and the polymer type boots et al 2019 in this study h2o2 accumulation in plants leaves was not significantly different between the two exposure groups 1 and 10 mg l 1 which was consistent with the results of pod suggesting that possibly 1 mg l 1 is the ps nps concentration threshold leading to a complete change in plant antioxidant function sirová et al 2009 yamada et al 2020 moreover exposure to smaller size plastic particles 100 nm ps nps brought higher genotoxicity and oxidative damage than those of larger size 5 µm ps nps jiang et al 2019 3 4 nanoplastics disrupt metabolic pathways intracellular life activities such as cell signaling energy transfer and intercellular communication are regulated by metabolites vo et al 2021 thus metabolomics is closely related to the nutritional status of cells and the influence of external factors including external environmental stresses from contaminants deng et al 2019 both compositions and contents of small molecule metabolites e g sugars lipids amino acids aromatic hydrocarbons etc would change when plants are subjected to external stimuli and their quantitative analysis enables the inference of potential pathways through which ps nps affect the growth and metabolism of u vulgaris chen et al 2019 li et al 2021a in this study a total of 482 metabolites were detected in u vulgaris leaves in cationic mode after exposure to ps nps these metabolites were screened by partial least squares discriminant analysis pls da the variable important in projection vip value is the weight value of variables in the pls da model and vip 1 is a common metabolite screening criterion with a larger vip value representing a greater variety of metabolites between samples worley and powers 2012 thus based on vip values and p values vip 1 p 0 05 243 metabolites were screened in which about 39 of metabolites were all lower than that in the control group and about 55 of metabolites were higher than that in the control group in contrast 548 metabolites were detected in u vulgaris leaves in the anion mode and 291 metabolites were screened based on pls da of which about 41 metabolites were all lower than that in the control group and about 42 metabolites were higher than that in the control group the relative quantity of identified metabolites in cationic mode and anionic mode are listed in table s2 and table s3 heatmaps of the relative content of metabolites in cationic mode and anionic mode are presented in fig s2 overall large numbers of primary metabolites were significantly altered mann whitney u test p 0 05 after exposure to ps nps including amino acids sugars lipids organic acids etc compared to the control group about 34 of the metabolites were up regulated in metabolite expression and 32 were down regulated in metabolite expression under 0 1 mg l 1 ps nps exposure fig 6 a and metabolites involved in enrichment pathways including alanine aspartate and glutamate metabolic pathways fig 6 b which play a key role in plant nitrogen metabolism u vulgaris leaves under 1 mg l 1 ps nps exposure resulted in about 25 up regulation of metabolite expression and 40 metabolite expression was down regulated fig 6 c and the activities of key enzymes involved in the tricarboxylic acid tca cycle metabolism of arginine and proline were significantly affected fig 6 d tca cycle is the final metabolic pathway and the hub for the metabolic linkage of three major nutrients sugars lipids and amino acids li et al 2021a vo et al 2021 arginine is a precursor for the synthesis of substances such as polyamines and nitric oxide which are both important messenger molecules in plants involved in physiological and biochemical processes including growth and development signaling and environmental sensing etc winter et al 2015 u vulgaris leaves under 10 mg l 1 ps nps exposure resulted in the upregulation of about 29 metabolite expression and downregulation of 38 metabolite expression fig 6 e affecting metabolic pathways including the biosynthesis of alanine aspartate and glutamate metabolism flavonoid and flavonol fig 6 f in which β alanine is accumulated as a general stress response molecule involved in the protection of plants from extreme temperature hypoxia drought and biotic stresses parthasarathy et al 2019 aspartate synthesizes four essential amino acids lysine threonine methionine and isoleucine through several different branches of metabolism as well as the amino acid glycine a key photorespiratory intermediate kirma et al 2012 glutamate occupies a central position in plant amino acid metabolism and is involved in the synthesis of acidic amino acids forde and lea 2007 flavonoids and flavonols could scavenge free radicals and enhance antioxidant capacity panche et al 2016 similar to previous studies revealing that synergistic regulation of glutamate and alanine synthesis was an adaptive response of m truncatula seedlings to hypoxic stress limami et al 2008 these above significant effects on metabolic pathways suggest that ps nps had stimulatory effects on energy metabolic processes of u vulgaris especially in growth and stress resistance chen et al 2019 wu et al 2020 further analysis of the disturbed tca cycle and amino acid biosynthesis pathways in u vulgaris after ps nps exposure was conducted fig 7 showing the tca cycling and amino acid metabolism in u vulgaris were severely disrupted after exposure to different doses of ps nps which citric acid threonine and adenine contents decreased by 9 8 23 9 18 6 25 8 and 5 0 13 1 respectively with higher doses of ps nps leading to higher inhibition rates similar results were also found in caenorhabditis elegans human cells and rice suggesting the potential effects of nps on global metabolic shifts in organisms and expressed genes were usually enriched in the amino acid biosynthesis pathway wang et al 2022 wu et al 2020 the amino acid reduction can affect the different biological functions of proteins in cells which would affect protein biosynthesis and energy production for plants lian et al 2021 in addition many amino acid contents showed a trend of ascending then descending with increasing ps nps concentration indicating that low doses of ps nps induced an increase in metabolite content while high dose 10 mg l 1 ps nps inhibited metabolic activities for example contents of serine phenylalanine and histidine increased by 13 1 0 4 44 4 2 5 and 30 0 1 7 under 0 1 mg l 1 ps nps while decreasing by 11 7 0 3 17 3 1 1 and 4 0 0 1 under 10 mg l 1 ps nps amino acids such as proline lysine and isoleucine etc also showed a low promoting and high suppressing effect importantly plant amino acids have a role in signal transduction and anti stress defense therefore the dramatic decrease in t aoc might be attributed to the decrease in amino acids with antioxidant capacity lian et al 2021 although existing studies on the expression of metabolic pathways in organisms affected by ps nps exposure are not yet clear li et al 2021b wang et al 2022 the trends of these amino acids were similar to the expression of ion transport related genes in mycobacterium japonicum after exposure to ps nps as well as those of antioxidant enzymes in this study which were also important metabolites involved in the stress resistance system of organisms wang et al 2020 3 5 impacts on water properties and ecosystem functioning many aquatic plant species such as water hyacinth eichhornia crassipes floating duckweed lemnaspp and reed phragmites australis have been widely used to remove nutrients from polluted river water or wastewater su et al 2019 among them submerged plants have efficient removal rates of eutrophic substances such as nitrogen phosphorus and other nutrients showing the ability to effectively control eutrophication in water bodies su et al 2019 thiébaut 2008 however since mps or nps could interfere with the composition and abundance of environmental flora and pollutants they may have an impact on the function of plants to purify water sanz lázaro et al 2021 therefore concentrations of tn and tp in the exposure solution were measured every three days after the start of the exposure experiment tn and tp were obtained from hoagland solution with initial concentrations of 2 8 and 0 5 ppm respectively concerning the concentration range of tn and tp in cws li et al 2021c xing et al 2020 overall tn fig 8 a and tp fig 8 b decreased after 15 days of exposure indicating the uptake and removal of nutrient salts by u vulgaris within the first three days the removal effect of tn in the three exposure groups was not significant with the extension of exposure time the removal effects of tn in the 10 mg l 1 group started to decrease from the third day while the removal effects of 0 1 and 1 mg l 1 groups started to slow down from day 6 at the end of the experiment removal rates of tn in each group showed the trend of 0 mg l 1 25 8 1 3 0 1 mg l 1 22 4 1 1 1 mg l 1 21 4 1 3 10 mg l 1 19 2 0 7 for tp no significant difference in tp between the control and the three exposure groups during the first six days after 15 days removal rates of tp in the 10 mg l 1 group were only 23 3 0 6 which was only 72 7 8 4 of that in the control group after 15 days the removal rate of tp in the control group reached 31 7 3 2 and the removal rates of 0 1 and 1 mg l 1 groups also decreased to 29 7 2 1 and 27 0 2 4 respectively the trends in the removal rates of tn and tp might be due to the damaged roots of the newly transplanted plants which promoted the growth of new roots and subsequently the plants adapted to the ps nps exposed environment with reduced removal of tn and tp su et al 2019 although the removal rates of tn by u vulgaris were not as effective as those of ipomoea aquatica 90 6 salvinia natans 67 3 pistia stratiotes and lemna sp 63 2 and 36 2 in the removal of tn the removal rates of tp by u vulgaris were higher than those of ipomoea aquatica 8 8 and salvinia natans 14 2 even under ps nps pressure su et al 2019 sudiarto et al 2019 the main removal pathways of tn and tp involve the synergistic action of plant roots insect traps and microorganisms by microbial activity or directly absorbed by plants su et al 2019 furthermore mps or nps could alter the abundance and composition of microbial communities as well as the nitrogen cycling processes in plants or the aquatic environment fig 8 c which in turn affects the nutrient cycling processes in the freshwater ecosystem sanz lázaro et al 2021 seeley et al 2020 considering that in the field environment with sufficient light and suitable temperature u vulgaris reproduce very quickly growing 3 4 times their original length and reaching a total length of 1 m in a short time and that u vulgaris are community symbiotic plants existing in bulk in wetlands and ponds arnon 1949 kibriya and iwan jones 2007 they have relatively benign effects on water quality and aquatic ecosystems yu et al 2020 u vulgaris has great potential in the purification of eutrophic water thus the impacts of ps nps on their water properties and ecosystem functioning should be further seriously studied 4 conclusions ps nps 500 nm were absorbed by insect traps and further transported to stems and leaves which not only activated or even impaired the oxidative defense system and nutrient availability ultimately posing a threat to human health chen et al 2019 li et al 2020 but also reduced the purifying effect of aquatic plants on water quality ultimately posing an unknown ecological risk to aquatic environments specifically u vulgaris suffered from oxidative stress as evidenced by an increase in mda antioxidant enzymes cat pod and sod h2o2 and iod with increasing ps nps concentrations approximately 25 34 of metabolites were up regulated and 32 40 of metabolites were down regulated in metabolite expression after exposure the tca cycle and amino acid biosynthesis were severely disrupted citric acid threonine and adenine contents decreased with the increasing ps nps concentrations while amino acids such as serine phenylalanine histidine etc ascended then descended with increasing concentration indicating that low dose ps nps stimulated metabolic activities while high dose 10 mg l 1 ps nps inhibited metabolic activities ps nps affected the removal of nitrogen and phosphorus from water by u vulgaris bringing potential risks to water ecological functions field life cycle studies and long term effects of nps on multiple aquatic plants are needed to better understand the effects of nps in cws credit authorship contribution statement yang liu data curation methodology

15312,perchlorate is a widely detected environmental contaminant in surface and underground water that seriously impacts human health by inhibiting the uptake of thyroidal radioiodine perchlorate reduction due to saline lake microorganisms is not as well understood as that in marine environments in this study we enriched a perchlorate reducing microbial consortium collected from saline lake sediments and found that the perchlorate reduction kinetics of the enriched consortium fit the michaelis menten kinetics well with a maximum specific substrate reduction rate qmax of 0 596 0 001 mg clo4 mg dw h and half saturation constant ks of 16 549 0 488 mg clo4 l furthermore we used improved metagenome binning to reconstruct high quality metagenome assembled genomes from the metagenomes of the microbial consortia including the perchlorate reducing bacteria prb dechloromonas agitata and wolinella succinogenes with the genome of w succinogenes harboring complete functional genes for perchlorate reduction being the first recovered given that the electrons were directly transferred to the electronic carrier cytochrome c 553 from the quinone pool the electron transfer pathway of w succinogenes was shorter and more efficient than the canonical pattern this finding provides a theoretical basis for microbial remediation of sites contaminated by high concentrations of perchlorate

graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords saline lake dissimilatory perchlorate reduction microbial community metagenomic binning synergetic metabolism data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction perchlorate clo4 is an inorganic contaminant with high solubility high chemical stability low adsorption affinity and strong oxidisability that can permanently exist in water and sediments cao et al 2019 vega et al 2018 and is usually produced during the production of rocket propellants fireworks and explosives choe et al 2013 however it can also be naturally generated in the atmosphere by photochemical processes ozone oxidation and electrical discharge of chlorides jiang et al 2021 removing perchlorate particularly from freshwater is difficult because of its environmental transferability and form flexibility such as its ability to exist as solid and or dissolved salts the ion radius of clo4 is very similar to that of i which makes perchlorate competitively inhibit iodine uptake in the thyroid by binding to the sodium iodide transporter na i symporter thereby affecting the synthesis and secretion of thyroid hormones and the metabolism of mammals zhang et al 2010 perchlorate is considered a globally important groundwater pollutant and the maximum concentration limit recommended by the federal government of united states is 1 µg l 1 youngblut et al 2016 due to the persistence of environmental perchlorates certain bacteria have evolved to strategically reduce perchlorates by connecting perchlorate reduction with energy

ginkel et al 2010 xiao et al 2010 contemporary studies have provided new insights into dark matter mining for the identification of microbial communities based on metagenome assembled genomes mags barnum et al 2020 barnum et al 2018 minimal information is available regarding to the functional genes and microbial interactions involved in perchlorate reduction by nonculturable species in enrichment cultures barnum et al 2018 stepanov et al 2014 a prb of wolinella succinogenes hap 1 was isolated from a municipal anaerobic digester which has excellent perchlorate reducing abilities and can eliminate degrade 1 2 mm perchlorate within 50 h wallace et al 1996 unfortunately the genomic information and perchlorate reductase operons of w succinogenes from perchlorate reducing consortia remains unknown in this study an acetate and perchlorate containing growth medium was used to enrich a perchlorate reducing microbial consortium derived from saline lake sediments which were anaerobically acclimated for 251 days batch experiments were conducted to investigate perchlorate reduction kinetics by the perchlorate reducing consortium high quality and near complete draft genomics of uncultured rare bacterial species were recovered via metagenomic binning with the near complete genome of w succinogenes being the first recovered the microbial community of enriched saline lake perchlorate reducing consortia was identified via phylogeny analyses of 120 concatenated proteins from isolates and recovered mags in this and previous studies synergistic enriched perchlorate reducing consortium interactions in saline lake sediments were firstly reconstructed based on the integration of genome binning and metatranscriptomics by chlorine nitrogen and sulfur

chemical analytical methods the water samples collected from the serum vial were filtered by 0 22 µm organic micron membranes perchlorate and chloride ions of water samples were detected by the ion

silva rrna database by bowtie2 v2 4 4 langmead and salzberg 2012 to delete the host contamination and rrna respectively the non rrna reads from all samples were de novo co assembled by trinity v2 13 2 grabherr et al 2011 without a reference genome using default parameters the assembled transcripts were submitted to metaprokka v1 14 6 seemann 2014 for gene prediction and functional annotation

discussion 3 1 enrichment of the saline lake perchlorate reducing consortium as shown in fig a1 the saline lake perchlorate reducing consortium was continuously enriched for 251 days with a gradient concentration of perchlorate the average perchlorate reduction efficiencies of the seven stages were 33 03 95 36 100 99 72 100 99 74 and 98 19 the average perchlorate conversion rates of stage vi 500 mg l clo4 and stage vii 1000 mg l clo4 were 93 46 and 105 75 based on eq 2 and the chlorine species mass balance closed within 10 lai et al 2021 the saline lake perchlorate reducing consortia demonstrated that a near complete perchlorate reduction was achieved after long term domestication meanwhile the perchlorate reduction efficiency remained 90 in the first two culture cycles of stage vii when the perchlorate load increased from 500 mg l to 1000 mg l these findings revealed that the saline lake consortia could resist a high concentration of perchlorate load thereby providing a reference for microbial remediation technologies for high concentration perchlorate contamination 3 2 kinetics of perchlorate reduction after 251 days of enrichment the perchlorate reduction batch experiments were conducted using the saline lake perchlorate reducing consortium within 100 1200 mg l clo4 fig 1 a the perchlorate reduction rate chloride yield and biomass increased as a function of the initial clo4 concentration figs 1a 1c and a2 fig 1b shows the best fit r2 0 99 of the specific perchlorate reduction rate to the michaelis menten equation eq 1 with qmax and ks values determined from fig 1b being 0 596 0 001 mg clo4 mg dw h and 16 546 0 488 mg clo4 l respectively indicating a high affinity of the saline lake enriched consortium for perchlorate table 1 table 1 shows that the qmax of the saline lake perchlorate reducing consortium was much higher than that under the high concentrations of perchlorate 1000 mg l lee et al 2015 patel et al 2008 which indicates that the perchlorate reducing consortium effectively utilized perchlorate with specific biomass the perchlorate conversion rates of the saline lake perchlorate reducing enriched consortium at different initial clo4 concentrations i e 100 1200 mg l showed near complete biological reduction of clo4 to cl as the final product lai et al 2021 however the perchlorate conversion rates were slightly lower than 100 at the initial clo4 concentrations of 300 and 500 mg l implying that the enriched consortium might have assimilated part of the chloride into the cells 3 3 reconstruction of mags taxonomy assignments and function annotation we retrieved 56 high quality mags completeness 70 and contamination 5 using the individual assembly and vamb binning of metagenomic data the ids of these mags were proposed based on their nearest taxonomies table a3 with the saline lake consortia microbes were primarily affiliated with the phyla proteobacteria 19 bacteroidetes 12 and firmicutes 8 fig 2 and the phylum level distribution patterns were consistent with those of previous research li and yu 2015 liu et al 2018 this finding further confirmed that the phylum acclimated microorganisms could be widely identified under hypersaline conditions 1 10 nacl salinity carlström et al 2016 stepanov et al 2014 proteobacteria abundances dramatically increased from 15 29 day 0 to 89 63 day 171 after enrichment for 171 days table a3 the dominance of these species wolinella succinogenes and dechloromonas agitata in proteobacteria may play the dominant function in the perchlorate reducing consortia fig a3 the abundance increase of proteobacteria was mainly ascribed to the enrichment of d agitata w succinogenes and geobacter lovleyi with their abundances in the ranges of 0 58 59 day 0 67 0 68 21 day 0 171 and 0 18 57 day 0 171 respectively table a3 we recovered three d agitata strains from day 67 day 105 and day 171 and conducted pairwise comparisons of their average nucleotide identities anis and amino acid identities aais demonstrated a high similarity between d agitata sl676 d agitata sl10514 and d agitata sl1719 with high ani and aai values of 99 19 and 99 34 respectively fig a4 d agitata sl676 d agitata sl10514 and d agitata sl1719 could be classified into the same genome based on their high ani aai 99 similarities since ani or aai 95 indicates intraspecies strains jain et al 2018 richter and rosselló móra 2009 d agitata is affiliated with dechloromonas which contains abundant canonical prb such as d agitata ckb bruce et al 1999 d aromatica rcb coates et al 2001 and dechloromonas sp miss r kucharzyk et al 2012 w succinogenes hap 1 was the first prb affiliated with epsilonproteobacteria isolated from a municipal anaerobic digester by wallace et al 1996 it has excellent perchlorate reduction ability and can completely degrade 1 2 mm perchlorate within 50 h wallace et al 1998 unfortunately the pure culture of hap 1 was no longer available and its whole genome sequence was also blank in this study the near complete genome of w succinogenes sl1712 completeness of 98 53 and contamination of 3 59 was first recovered from perchlorate reducing consortia in a saline lake 3 4 community overview and succession fig 3 shows that although 56 high quality mags were obtained by the individual assembly of samples with high phylogenetic diversity perchlorate reduction genes were largely absent from mags d agitata and w succinogenes are currently the only prb with complete functional genes of perchlorate reductase and chlorite dismutase in a saline lake sample fig 3 showing their perchlorate reduction potential additionally d agitata and w succinogenes were dominant species in the perchlorate reducing consortia with relative abundance 20 for example the relative abundance of w succinogenes sl1712 ranged from approximately 0 to 67 15 after 171 days of enrichment the dominant prb before day 105 was d agitate however after 171 days w succinogenes became the dominant prb which was suggesting that the change of perchlorate concentration from 375 mg l to 500 mg l may profoundly change the functional niches of prb abundant chlorate reducing bacteria usually co exist in the perchlorate reducing microbial consortia and the intermediate products clo3 clo2 and o2 of perchlorate reduction may support the growth of chlorate reducing bacteria barnum et al 2018 clark et al 2016 as reported by barnum et al 2018 the most abundant marine sediment community population i e azoarcus bm101 lacks perchlorate reductase and encodes a complete chlorate reductase pathway consisting of genes for chlorate reductase clrabcd chlorite dismutase cld and terminal oxygen reductase however the chlorate reducing bacteria in this study were not found in the saline lake perchlorate reducing microbial consortia the key chlorite dismutase gene cld was only found in the prb genomes in this study indicating a high affinity for the one step perchlorate reduction in the saline lake perchlorate reducing microbial consortia the metabolic potentials of supply based nutrients i e sodium acetate ammonia and sulfate in the perchlorate reducing microbial consortia of the saline lake samples was abundant as shown in fig 3 and supplementary material b mags with complete dissimilatory perchlorate reduction dissimilatory nitrate reduction and dissimilatory sulfate reduction genes were widely distributed before and after domestication the metabolic potentials of perchlorate reduction microbial consortia for carbon nitrogen and sulfur metabolism diversity in the saline lake were revealed 3 5 integration of metagenomics and metatranscriptomics to investigate the perchlorate reduction process the transcription of genes of mags was determined by mapping transcripts using blastn v2 12 0 against transcripts the identification of pcrabcd and cld transcripts by prb is shown in table a4 with the similarities between the genes of pcr and cld in prb i e d agitata and w succinogenes and their transcripts being nearly 100 and their e values being 0 this finding suggested that the evident expression of pcr and cld in d agitata and w succinogenes which were dominant in the saline lake enrichment culture the transcriptional expressions of the perchlorate reductase genes pcrabcd and chlorite dismutase gene cld of d agitata fig 4 a and w succinogenes fig 4b at 0 5 4 6 10 and 24 h were normalized using eq 3 the results showed that the transcriptional expression of genes pcrabcd and cld in d agitata was very low at 0 5 h subsequently the transcriptional expression increased considerably at 4 h indicating that the perchlorate reduction functional genes were highly expressed meanwhile the perchlorate concentration decreased from 532 77 5 28 to 234 65 12 32 mg l the transcriptional expression of pcrabcd and cld at 6 and 10 h was lower than that at 4 h indicating that the perchlorate reduction rate might have slowed down in terms of the effluent clo4 concentration below the detection limitation fig a5 however the w succinogenes did not contain the gene pcrc the transcriptional expression of genes pcrabcd and cld in w succinogenes at 0 h was the highest during the perchlorate reduction and the transcriptional expression of pcrabcd and cld gradually decreased being at the lowest at 24 h implying that w succinogenes responded quickly to perchlorate in the perchlorate reducing system additionally the average expression of pcrabcd and cld in w succinogenes was approximately twice as high as that in d agitata indicating that the w succinogenes may be main contributor to perchlorate reduction 3 6 synergistic interaction of enriched consortium from the saline lake sediment in perchlorate reduction since relative abundance of w succinogenes sharply increased after 171 days indicating that w succinogenes was enriched in system with higher perchlorate concentration 1000 mg l which was different from d agitate which is generally important in lower perchlorate concentration fig 5 a in the canonical dissimilatory perchlorate reduction perchlorate was reduced by pcrabcd and cld during the following the reactions clo 4 clo 3 clo 2 c l bardiya and bae 2011 this reduced high valence chlorine 7 to low valent chlorine 1 the pcra and pcrb reduces clo4 to clo3 and subsequently clo2 during perchlorate metabolism melnyk and coates 2015 the cld catalyzed clo2 and generate cl and o2 for both of d agitate and w succinogenes gene pcrab and cld showed high transcriptional expression in the time series notably electron transfer is essential for perchlorate reduction pcrq likely functions as a quinol dehydrogenase to transfer electrons from the quinone pool to an ethylbenzene dehydrogenase pcro after which electrons were transferred to the soluble tetraheme cytochrome pcrc which donates electrons to the catalytic subunit pcra these key genes were all present in d agitata and their corresponding transcriptional expressions increased with time however pcrc pcrq and pcro were missing in w succinogenes sl1712 and only a gene cytochrome c 553 was substituted for the upstream location of pcra on the same strand which was similar to arcobacter sp cab fig 5 and a6 nevertheless in the arcobacter sp cab cld was much further away from the pcr and on the opposite strand and there were three transposase genes between the genome location of pcr and cld carlström charlotte et al 2013 which were different from those of w succinogenes sl1712 fig a6 therefore the electron transfer pathway of w succinogenes sl1712 is likely to be different from the canonical pattern that is the electrons in the quinone pool are directly transferred to the periplasmic electron transfer cytochrome c 553 kashey et al 2014 using the donated electrons from cytochrome c 553 the pcra and pcrb promoted perchlorate reduction as previously description which have been verified melnyk and coates 2015 whose expressions increased along the time series shown in fig 5b the novel electron transfer pathway in w succinogenes was shorter than the canonical pathway in d agitata suggesting that the electron utilization by w succinogenes sl1712 might be highly efficient the nitrate reducing bacteria i e g lovleyi sl1716 were enriched after 171 days of treatment hydroxylamine dehydrogenase hao could oxidize hydroxylamine to nitrite and the gene hao was highly expressed in g lovleyi sl1716 the periplasmic nitrate reductase gene napa and nitrite reductase gene nrfa were highly expressed in d agitate however napa expression in w succinogenes sl1712 was very low showing that d agitata could effectively reduce nitrate and nitrite moreover w succinogenes sl1712 could only reduce nitrite and played a role in deletion excessive nitrite in the detoxification system accordingly small amount of nitrite and nitrate were detected in the perchlorate process fig a7 furthermore ammonia was the sole nitrogen source meaning that nitrification acted in the system under anoxic conditions previous studies have demonstrated that there are aerobic benzene bacterial biodegradation pathways under essentially anaerobic conditions involving the concerted action catalyzed by chlorite dismutase which provides the metabolic oxygen needed by aromatic activating and cleaving oxygenase coates et al 1998 weelink sander et al 2008 carlström charlotte et al 2013 also reported that arcobacter sp cab can use the molecular oxygen produced by chlorite reduction to oxidize catechol through catechol 2 dioxygenase 3 dioxygenase under the aerobic degradation pathway under anoxic conditions the prb sedimenticola selenatireducens cuz and chlorate reducing bacteria dechloromarinus chlorophilus nss can use the molecular oxygen produced by chlorite reduction to degrade catechol phenylacetate and benzoate through an oxygenase dependent pathway carlström charlotte et al 2015a carlström charlotte et al 2015b therefore the accumulated evidence of gene transcriptional expression and detected intermediates no2 and no3 indicates that endogenous molecular oxygen might be produced in the perchlorate reducing microbial system for nitrification furthermore the complete and high expression of nir nor and norz implied the possibility of denitrification mehta kolte misha et al 2017 and gregoire et al 2014 found that perchlorate reduction can be coupled with sulfide oxidation by perchlorate reductase which oxidizes hydrogen sulfide to elemental sulfur or polysulfide the addition of so4 2 decreased during the perchlorate reduction process from 440 15 3 44 to 361 03 8 58 mg l after 24 h fig a8 the decreased so4 2 can be reduced to hydrogen sulfide h2s by sulfate transferase sat adenylate reductase apr and dissimilatory sulfite reductase dsr the hydrogen in h2s can be transferred to quinone by sulfide quinone oxidoreductase sqr and formed polysulfide to alleviate acidification caused by h2s accumulation brito et al 2009 however polysulfide reductase psr can easily decompose polysulfides and release h2s which can be further oxidized to elemental sulfur by sulfide dehydrogenase fcc kostanjevecki et al 2000 the sulfate reduction predominantly results from desulfobacteraceae sl1713 and deltaproteobacteria sl17110 which completely express the dissimilatory sulfate reduction genes sat apr and dsr w succinogenes sl1712 could express that sqr oxidized h2s to polysulfide whereas d agitata sl1719 could expressed fcc to oxidize h2s to elemental sulfur therefore the synergistic bacterial interaction between the saline lake perchlorate reducing microbial consortium and other functional bacteria may involve various elements cycles fig 5c 4 conclusion the perchlorate reduction kinetics of the saline lake ecosystem were characterized by the enriched perchlorate reducing consortium after 251 days of acclimation indicating that the saline lake microbial consortium could effectively reduce high concentrations of perchlorate these findings provided a reference for the development of microbial remediation technologies for perchlorate contamination at high concentrations the near complete genome of w succinogenes was first recovered from the perchlorate reducing consortia in a saline lake thereby expanding the phylogenetic diversity of the current prb this is the first proposal of the metabolic mechanism of the saline lake perchlorate reducing consortium that further promotes the understanding of the synergistic interaction of nonculturable microbes in

15312,perchlorate is a widely detected environmental contaminant in surface and underground water that seriously impacts human health by inhibiting the uptake of thyroidal radioiodine perchlorate reduction due to saline lake microorganisms is not as well understood as that in marine environments in this study we enriched a perchlorate reducing microbial consortium collected from saline lake sediments and found that the perchlorate reduction kinetics of the enriched consortium fit the michaelis menten kinetics well with a maximum specific substrate reduction rate qmax of 0 596 0 001 mg clo4 mg dw h and half saturation constant ks of 16 549 0 488 mg clo4 l furthermore we used improved metagenome binning to reconstruct high quality metagenome assembled genomes from the metagenomes of the microbial consortia including the perchlorate reducing bacteria prb dechloromonas agitata and wolinella succinogenes with the genome of w succinogenes harboring complete functional genes for perchlorate reduction being the first recovered given that the electrons were directly transferred to the electronic carrier cytochrome c 553 from the quinone pool the electron transfer pathway of w succinogenes was shorter and more efficient than the canonical pattern this finding provides a theoretical basis for microbial remediation of sites contaminated by high concentrations of perchlorate

graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords saline lake dissimilatory perchlorate reduction microbial community metagenomic binning synergetic metabolism data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction perchlorate clo4 is an inorganic contaminant with high solubility high chemical stability low adsorption affinity and strong oxidisability that can permanently exist in water and sediments cao et al 2019 vega et al 2018 and is usually produced during the production of rocket propellants fireworks and explosives choe et al 2013 however it can also be naturally generated in the atmosphere by photochemical processes ozone oxidation and electrical discharge of chlorides jiang et al 2021 removing perchlorate particularly from freshwater is difficult because of its environmental transferability and form flexibility such as its ability to exist as solid and or dissolved salts the ion radius of clo4 is very similar to that of i which makes perchlorate competitively inhibit iodine uptake in the thyroid by binding to the sodium iodide transporter na i symporter thereby affecting the synthesis and secretion of thyroid hormones and the metabolism of mammals zhang et al 2010 perchlorate is considered a globally important groundwater pollutant and the maximum concentration limit recommended by the federal government of united states is 1 µg l 1 youngblut et al 2016 due to the persistence of environmental perchlorates certain bacteria have evolved to strategically reduce perchlorates by connecting perchlorate reduction with energy metabolism bioremediation of perchlorate contamination by these bacteria is vital to perchlorate reduction in wastewater treatment plants xu et al 2003 marine environment carlström et al 2016 groundwater kannan et al 2009 and soil tan et al 2004 perchlorate reducing bacteria prb are mainly restricted to certain bacterial classes such as alphaproteobacteria betaproteobacteria

barnum et al 2020 barnum et al 2018 minimal information is available regarding to the functional genes and microbial interactions involved in perchlorate reduction by nonculturable species in enrichment cultures barnum et al 2018 stepanov et al 2014 a prb of wolinella succinogenes hap 1 was isolated from a municipal anaerobic digester which has excellent perchlorate reducing abilities and can eliminate degrade 1 2 mm perchlorate within 50 h wallace et al 1996 unfortunately the genomic information and perchlorate reductase operons of w succinogenes from perchlorate reducing consortia remains unknown in this study an acetate and perchlorate containing growth medium was used to enrich a perchlorate reducing microbial consortium derived from saline lake sediments which were anaerobically acclimated for 251 days batch experiments were conducted to investigate perchlorate reduction kinetics by the perchlorate reducing consortium high quality and near complete draft genomics of uncultured rare bacterial species were recovered via metagenomic binning with the near complete genome of w succinogenes being the first recovered the microbial community of enriched saline lake perchlorate reducing consortia was identified via phylogeny analyses of 120 concatenated proteins from isolates and recovered mags in this and previous studies synergistic enriched

silva rrna database by bowtie2 v2 4 4 langmead and salzberg 2012 to delete the host contamination and rrna respectively the non rrna reads from all samples were de novo co assembled by trinity v2 13 2 grabherr et al 2011 without a reference genome using default parameters the assembled transcripts were submitted to metaprokka v1 14 6 seemann 2014 for gene prediction and functional annotation

discussion 3 1 enrichment of the saline lake perchlorate reducing consortium as shown in fig a1 the saline lake perchlorate reducing consortium was continuously enriched for 251 days with a gradient concentration of perchlorate the average perchlorate reduction efficiencies of the seven stages were 33 03 95 36 100 99 72 100 99 74 and 98 19 the average perchlorate conversion rates of stage vi 500 mg l clo4 and stage vii 1000 mg l clo4 were 93 46 and 105 75 based on eq 2 and the chlorine species mass balance closed within 10 lai et al 2021 the saline lake perchlorate reducing consortia demonstrated that a near complete perchlorate reduction was achieved after long term domestication meanwhile the perchlorate reduction efficiency remained 90 in the first two culture cycles of stage vii when the perchlorate load increased from 500 mg l to 1000 mg l these findings revealed that the saline lake consortia could resist a high concentration of perchlorate load thereby providing a reference for microbial remediation technologies for high concentration perchlorate contamination 3 2 kinetics of perchlorate reduction after 251 days of enrichment the perchlorate reduction batch experiments were conducted using the saline lake perchlorate reducing consortium within 100 1200 mg l clo4 fig 1 a the perchlorate reduction rate chloride yield and biomass increased as a function of the initial clo4 concentration figs 1a 1c and a2 fig 1b shows the best fit r2 0 99 of the specific perchlorate reduction rate to the michaelis menten equation eq 1 with qmax and ks values determined from fig 1b being 0 596 0 001 mg clo4 mg dw h and 16 546 0 488 mg clo4 l respectively indicating a high affinity of the saline lake enriched consortium for perchlorate table 1 table 1 shows that the qmax of the saline lake perchlorate reducing consortium was much higher than that under the high concentrations of perchlorate 1000 mg l lee et al 2015 patel et al 2008 which indicates that the perchlorate reducing consortium effectively utilized perchlorate with specific biomass the perchlorate conversion rates of the saline lake perchlorate reducing enriched consortium at different initial clo4 concentrations i e 100 1200 mg l showed near complete biological reduction of clo4 to cl as the final product lai et al 2021 however the perchlorate conversion rates were slightly lower than 100 at the initial clo4 concentrations of 300 and 500 mg l implying that the enriched consortium might have assimilated part of the chloride into the cells 3 3 reconstruction of mags taxonomy assignments and function annotation we retrieved 56 high quality mags completeness 70 and contamination 5 using the individual assembly and vamb binning of metagenomic data the ids of these mags were proposed based on their nearest taxonomies table a3 with the saline lake consortia microbes were primarily affiliated with the phyla proteobacteria 19 bacteroidetes 12 and firmicutes 8 fig 2 and the phylum level distribution patterns were consistent with those of previous research li and yu 2015 liu et al 2018 this finding further confirmed that the phylum acclimated microorganisms could be widely identified under hypersaline conditions 1 10 nacl salinity carlström et al 2016 stepanov et al 2014 proteobacteria abundances dramatically increased from 15 29 day 0 to 89 63 day 171 after enrichment for 171 days table a3 the dominance of these species wolinella succinogenes and dechloromonas agitata in proteobacteria may play the dominant function in the perchlorate reducing consortia fig a3 the abundance increase of proteobacteria was mainly ascribed to the enrichment of d agitata w succinogenes and geobacter lovleyi with their abundances in the ranges of 0 58 59 day 0 67 0 68 21 day 0 171 and 0 18 57 day 0 171 respectively table a3 we recovered three d agitata strains from day 67 day 105 and day 171 and conducted pairwise comparisons of their average nucleotide identities anis and amino acid identities aais demonstrated a high similarity between d agitata sl676 d agitata sl10514 and d agitata sl1719 with high ani and aai values of 99 19 and 99 34 respectively fig a4 d agitata sl676 d agitata sl10514 and d agitata sl1719 could be classified into the same genome based on their high ani aai 99 similarities since ani or aai 95 indicates intraspecies strains jain et al 2018 richter and rosselló móra 2009 d agitata is affiliated with dechloromonas which contains abundant canonical prb such as d agitata ckb bruce et al 1999 d aromatica rcb coates et al 2001 and dechloromonas sp miss r kucharzyk et al 2012 w succinogenes hap 1 was the first prb affiliated with epsilonproteobacteria isolated from a municipal anaerobic digester by wallace et al 1996 it has excellent perchlorate reduction ability and can completely degrade 1 2 mm perchlorate within 50 h wallace et al 1998 unfortunately the pure culture of hap 1 was no longer available and its whole genome sequence was also blank in this study the near complete genome of w succinogenes sl1712 completeness of 98 53 and contamination of 3 59 was first recovered from perchlorate reducing consortia in a saline lake 3 4 community overview and succession fig 3 shows that although 56 high quality mags were obtained by the individual assembly of samples with high phylogenetic diversity perchlorate reduction genes were largely absent from mags d agitata and w succinogenes are currently the only prb with complete functional genes of perchlorate reductase and chlorite dismutase in a saline lake sample fig 3 showing their perchlorate reduction potential additionally d agitata and w succinogenes were dominant species in the perchlorate reducing consortia with relative abundance 20 for example the relative abundance of w succinogenes sl1712 ranged from approximately 0 to 67 15 after 171 days of enrichment the dominant prb before day 105 was d agitate however after 171 days w succinogenes became the dominant prb which was suggesting that the change of perchlorate concentration from 375 mg l to 500 mg l may profoundly change the functional niches of prb abundant chlorate reducing bacteria usually co exist in the perchlorate reducing microbial consortia and the intermediate products clo3 clo2 and o2 of perchlorate reduction may support the growth of chlorate reducing bacteria barnum et al 2018 clark et al 2016 as reported by barnum et al 2018 the most abundant marine sediment community population i e azoarcus bm101 lacks perchlorate reductase and encodes a complete chlorate reductase pathway consisting of genes for chlorate reductase clrabcd chlorite dismutase cld and terminal oxygen reductase however the chlorate reducing bacteria in this study were not found in the saline lake perchlorate reducing microbial consortia the key chlorite dismutase gene cld was only found in the prb genomes in this study indicating a high affinity for the one step perchlorate reduction in the saline lake perchlorate reducing microbial consortia the metabolic potentials of supply based nutrients i e sodium acetate ammonia and sulfate in the perchlorate reducing microbial consortia of the saline lake samples was abundant as shown in fig 3 and supplementary material b mags with complete dissimilatory perchlorate reduction dissimilatory nitrate reduction and dissimilatory sulfate reduction genes were widely distributed before and after domestication the metabolic potentials of perchlorate reduction microbial consortia for carbon nitrogen and sulfur metabolism diversity in the saline lake were revealed 3 5 integration of metagenomics and metatranscriptomics to investigate the perchlorate reduction process the transcription of genes of mags was determined by mapping transcripts using blastn v2 12 0 against transcripts the identification of pcrabcd and cld transcripts by prb is shown in table a4 with the similarities between the genes of pcr and cld in prb i e d agitata and w succinogenes and their transcripts being nearly 100 and their e values being 0 this finding suggested that the evident expression of pcr and cld in d agitata and w succinogenes which were dominant in the saline lake enrichment culture the transcriptional expressions of the perchlorate reductase genes pcrabcd and chlorite dismutase gene cld of d agitata fig 4 a and w succinogenes fig 4b at 0 5 4 6 10 and 24 h were normalized using eq 3 the results showed that the transcriptional expression of genes pcrabcd and cld in d agitata was very low at 0 5 h subsequently the transcriptional expression increased considerably at 4 h indicating that the perchlorate reduction functional genes were highly expressed meanwhile the perchlorate concentration decreased from 532 77 5 28 to 234 65 12 32 mg l the transcriptional expression of pcrabcd and cld at 6 and 10 h was lower than that at 4 h indicating that the perchlorate reduction rate might have slowed down in terms of the effluent clo4 concentration below the detection limitation fig a5 however the w succinogenes did not contain the gene pcrc the transcriptional expression of genes pcrabcd and cld in w succinogenes at 0 h was the highest during the perchlorate reduction and the transcriptional expression of pcrabcd and cld gradually decreased being at the lowest at 24 h implying that w succinogenes responded quickly to perchlorate in the perchlorate reducing system additionally the average expression of pcrabcd and cld in w succinogenes was approximately twice as high as that in d agitata indicating that the w succinogenes may be main contributor to perchlorate reduction 3 6 synergistic interaction of enriched consortium from the saline lake sediment in perchlorate reduction since relative abundance of w succinogenes sharply increased after 171 days indicating that w succinogenes was enriched in system with higher perchlorate concentration 1000 mg l which was different from d agitate which is generally important in lower perchlorate concentration fig 5 a in the canonical dissimilatory perchlorate reduction perchlorate was reduced by pcrabcd and cld during the following the reactions clo 4 clo 3 clo 2 c l bardiya and bae 2011 this reduced high valence chlorine 7 to low valent chlorine 1 the pcra and pcrb reduces clo4 to clo3 and subsequently clo2 during perchlorate metabolism melnyk and coates 2015 the cld catalyzed clo2 and generate cl and o2 for both of d agitate and w succinogenes gene pcrab and cld showed high transcriptional expression in the time series notably electron transfer is essential for perchlorate reduction pcrq likely functions as a quinol dehydrogenase to transfer electrons from the quinone pool to an ethylbenzene dehydrogenase pcro after which electrons were transferred to the soluble tetraheme cytochrome pcrc which donates electrons to the catalytic subunit pcra these key genes were all present in d agitata and their corresponding transcriptional expressions increased with time however pcrc pcrq and pcro were missing in w succinogenes sl1712 and only a gene cytochrome c 553 was substituted for the upstream location of pcra on the same strand which was similar to arcobacter sp cab fig 5 and a6 nevertheless in the arcobacter sp cab cld was much further away from the pcr and on the opposite strand and there were three transposase genes between the genome location of pcr and cld carlström charlotte et al 2013 which were different from those of w succinogenes sl1712 fig a6 therefore the electron transfer pathway of w succinogenes sl1712 is likely to be different from the canonical pattern that is the electrons in the quinone pool are directly transferred to the periplasmic electron transfer cytochrome c 553 kashey et al 2014 using the donated electrons from cytochrome c 553 the pcra and pcrb promoted perchlorate reduction as previously description which have been verified melnyk and coates 2015 whose expressions increased along the time series shown in fig 5b the novel electron transfer pathway in w succinogenes was shorter than the canonical pathway in d agitata suggesting that the electron utilization by w succinogenes sl1712 might be highly efficient the nitrate reducing bacteria i e g lovleyi sl1716 were enriched after 171 days of treatment hydroxylamine dehydrogenase hao could oxidize hydroxylamine to nitrite and the gene hao was highly expressed in g lovleyi sl1716 the periplasmic nitrate reductase gene napa and nitrite reductase gene nrfa were highly expressed in d agitate however napa expression in w succinogenes sl1712 was very low showing that d agitata could effectively reduce nitrate and nitrite moreover w succinogenes sl1712 could only reduce nitrite and played a role in deletion excessive nitrite in the detoxification system accordingly small amount of nitrite and nitrate were detected in the perchlorate process fig a7 furthermore ammonia was the sole nitrogen source meaning that nitrification acted in the system under anoxic conditions previous studies have demonstrated that there are aerobic benzene bacterial biodegradation pathways under essentially anaerobic conditions involving the concerted action catalyzed by chlorite dismutase which provides the metabolic oxygen needed by aromatic activating and cleaving oxygenase coates et al 1998 weelink sander et al 2008 carlström charlotte et al 2013 also reported that arcobacter sp cab can use the molecular oxygen produced by chlorite reduction to oxidize catechol through catechol 2 dioxygenase 3 dioxygenase under the aerobic degradation pathway under anoxic conditions the prb sedimenticola selenatireducens cuz and chlorate reducing bacteria dechloromarinus chlorophilus nss can use the molecular oxygen produced by chlorite reduction to degrade catechol phenylacetate and benzoate through an oxygenase dependent pathway carlström charlotte et al 2015a carlström charlotte et al 2015b therefore the accumulated evidence of gene transcriptional expression and detected intermediates no2 and no3 indicates that endogenous molecular oxygen might be produced in the perchlorate reducing microbial system for nitrification furthermore the complete and high expression of nir nor and norz implied the possibility of denitrification mehta kolte misha et al 2017 and gregoire et al 2014 found that perchlorate reduction can be coupled with sulfide oxidation by perchlorate reductase which oxidizes hydrogen sulfide to elemental sulfur or polysulfide the addition of so4 2 decreased during the perchlorate reduction process from 440 15 3 44 to 361 03 8 58 mg l after 24 h fig a8 the decreased so4 2 can be reduced to hydrogen sulfide h2s by sulfate transferase sat adenylate reductase apr and dissimilatory sulfite reductase dsr the hydrogen in h2s can be transferred to quinone by sulfide quinone oxidoreductase sqr and formed polysulfide to alleviate acidification caused by h2s accumulation brito et al 2009 however polysulfide reductase psr can easily decompose polysulfides and release h2s which can be further oxidized to elemental sulfur by sulfide dehydrogenase fcc kostanjevecki et al 2000 the sulfate reduction predominantly results from desulfobacteraceae sl1713 and deltaproteobacteria sl17110 which completely express the dissimilatory sulfate reduction genes sat apr and dsr w succinogenes sl1712 could express that sqr oxidized h2s to polysulfide whereas d agitata sl1719 could expressed fcc to oxidize h2s to elemental sulfur therefore the synergistic bacterial interaction between the saline lake perchlorate reducing microbial consortium and other functional bacteria may involve various elements cycles fig 5c 4 conclusion the perchlorate reduction kinetics of the saline lake ecosystem were characterized by the enriched perchlorate reducing consortium after 251 days of acclimation indicating that the saline lake microbial consortium could effectively reduce high concentrations of perchlorate these findings provided a reference for the development of microbial remediation technologies for perchlorate contamination at high concentrations the near complete genome of w succinogenes was first recovered from the perchlorate reducing consortia in a saline lake thereby expanding the phylogenetic diversity of the current prb this is the first proposal of the metabolic mechanism of the saline lake perchlorate reducing consortium that further promotes the understanding of the synergistic interaction of nonculturable microbes in

15313,peracetic acid based advanced oxidation processes paa aops on metal free catalysts have emerged as charming strategies for water contaminant removal however the involved reactive species and their corresponding active sites are ambiguous herein using carbon nanotube cnt as a model carbocatalyst we demonstrated that under neutral conditions the cnt paa complex was the dominant reactive species to oxidize phenolic compounds via electron transfer process etp whereas the surface bound hydroxyl radicals ohsurface played a minor role on the basis of quenching and electrochemical tests as well as raman spectroscopy more importantly the experimental and density functional theory dft calculation results collaboratively proved that the active site for etp was the sp2 hybridized carbon on the cnt bulk while that for radical generation was the edge located hydroxyl group c oh which lowered the energy barrier for cleaving the o o bond in cnt paa complex we further discerned the oxidation kinetic constants k oxid of different pollutants from the apparent kinetic constants in cnt paa system the significant negative linear correlation between lnk oxid and half wave potential of phenolic compounds suggests that the pollutants with a lower one electron oxidation potential i e stronger electron donating ability are more easily oxidized overall this study scrutinizes the hybrid radical and non radical mechanism and the corresponding active sites of the cnt paa system providing insights into the application of paa aops and the development of etp in the remediation of emerging organic pollutants graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords nanocarbon paa nonradical oxidation catalytic sites environmental remediation data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction very recently peracetic acid paa ch3c o ooh has been spotlighted as an emerging oxidant in advanced oxidation processes aops as it possesses the same o o bond structure with peroxymonosulfate pms peroxydisulfate pds and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 moreover the lower activation energy of o o bond scission 170 kj mol 1 of paa makes it be easily activated and exhibit superiority in contaminant decay kim and huang 2020 to date assorted approaches including external energy heat uv irradiation electrolysis etc and metal based catalysts cr co fe ru etc have been adopted to activate paa bell et al 2022 cai et al 2017 kim et al 2019 2020 2022 li et al 2021 liu et al 2021 wang et al 2021a 2020b unfortunately intense energy input or toxic metal leaching makes the above approaches neither cost effective nor eco friendly wang et al 2021c benefitting from their abundant reserves excellent conductivity and large surface area carbonaceous materials have been successfully adopted as promising and green alternatives to the metal based catalysts in aops shentu et al 2022 yang et al 2020 yu et al 2020 inspired by this achievement some investigators turned to pay attention to the activation of paa by carbocatalyst zhou et al 2015 first used activated carbon fibers acfs to activate paa to generate hydroxyl radicals oh and alkoxyl radicals ch3co2 for the elimination of dye reactive brilliant red x 3b dai et al 2022 observed the decay of sulfamethoxazole by carbon centered radicals r c including ch3co2 and acetylperoxyl radical ch3co3 as well as electron transfer in a modified activated carbon ac catalyzed paa system yun et al 2017 proposed that a nonradical process was involved in single walled carbon nanotube cnt activated paa system despite the fact that these works showcased the effective organic removal by carbon driven paa activation process the identification of multiple reactive species was contentious this might be ascribed to three reasons i the different structures of carbon materials such as ac and cnt specifically ac has abundant oxygen functional groups and low graphitization degree wang et al 2019a 2022b while cnt owns a relatively low level of functional groups and high sp2 hybridized carbons ren et al 2019 this may result in the different reactive species formed in the carbon paa systems ii the improper selection of quenchers for radicals such as ascorbic acid aa and 2 4 hexadiene 2 4 hd the former scavenger may directly react with paa zhou et al 2018a while the latter may interfere with the adsorption of target pollutants by carbon materials due to the high hydrophobicity of 2 4 hd see more detail in section 3 2 thus the contribution of radicals toward pollutant decay might be overestimated iii the lack of information on the direct witness of the surface reactive complex this may result in the underestimation of the potential electron transfer process etp during paa activation more importantly due to the vague determination of reactive species it is difficult to establish the relationship between the reactive species and the active sites in carbocatalysis whose identification is quite limited by the experimental aspects to the best of our knowledge only dai et al 2022 concluded oxygen functional groups as the active site via xps analysis of the modified ac before and after the reaction therefore it motivated us to develop comprehensive analysis technologies to determine the hybrid reactive species and uncover the structure activity relationships in carbon driven paa activation system herein cnt was chosen as an apt model carbocatalyst to activate paa for the removal of organic pollutants considering its simple structure and tunable functionalized moieties that are conducive to precisely discerning the underlying hybrid mechanism ren et al 2022 the reactive species and the corresponding active sites in the cnt paa system were accurately identified by a combination of experimental and theoretical methods notably cnt paa complex was first detected via in situ raman test which formed at the sp2 hybridized carbon network and dominated the bpa oxidation through etp the surface bound hydroxyl radicals ohsurface played a minor role and the corresponding active site was determined as the edge located hydroxyl group c oh through density functional theory dft calculations the oxidation rate constants k oxid of six phenolic compounds pcs were accurately discerned from their apparent counterparts k obs and the selective oxidation nature of cnt paa was determined to be related to the half wave potential φ 1 2 of these pollutants thus the present study gauges the mechanism of carbocatalysis for paa activation which will provide the cornerstone for the development of this promising technology for environmental remediation 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents reagents used in this study are provided in text s1 of the supporting information 2 2 analytical methods the pollutants were analyzed by a high performance liquid chromatography hplc shimadzu lc 20a japan with a c 18 column the composition of the mobile phase and uv absorption wavelength of each pollutant are summarized in table s1 qualitative detection of radicals and singlet oxygen 1o2 was performed using a bruker a200 epr spectrometer details presented in text s2 residual paa was measured by a potassium iodide method open circuit potentiometry and chronoamperometry were measured on an electrochemical workstation chi 660e china details presented in text s3 2 3 preparation and characterization of catalysts three commercial cnts including cnt hydroxylated multi walled carbon nanotubes marked as cnt oh and carboxylated multi walled carbon nanotubes marked as cnt cooh were annealed at 400 c and 700 c respectively for 1 h to obtain cnt 400 cnt 700 cnt oh 400 cnt oh 700 cnt cooh 400 and cnt cooh 700 the selective chemical titration experiments for cnt were shown in detail in text s4 the specific characterization methods are provided in text s5 2 4 experimental procedures the experiments were carried out in a 100 ml magnetically stirred breaker unless otherwise stated the experimental conditions were pc concentration of 0 02 mm cnt dosage of 0 2 g l paa dosage of 0 25 mm and initial ph ph0 of 7 0 the solution containing paa and the target pollutant was initially adjusted to the desired ph afterward the reaction was started by adding cnt powder periodically 1 0 ml sample was withdrawn from the reaction and filtered by 0 22 μm filter membrane and then quenched with excessive na2s2o3 pre added into 2 ml glass vials for hplc analysis detailed kinetic discernment experiments are provided in text s6 the galvanic oxidation process gop was developed with the phenolics and paa separately present in two half cells see more details in text s7 for the stability tests the used cnts were collected after each run and washed with deionized water for several times and dried at 60 c for reuse all of the degradation experiments were conducted in duplicate or triplicate and the means with standard deviations were presented 3 results and discussion 3 1 catalytic performance of cnt for paa activation the performance of the cnt paa process was first investigated by using bpa as the target pollutant considering its ubiquitous presence in the environmental and endocrine disrupting properties naderi et al 2020 wang et al 2022a 2019b as shown in fig 1 a an inconspicuous amount of bpa less than 5 was degraded in the sole paa condition indicating that bpa elimination by direct oxidation of paa was insufficient despite the high redox potential of paa e 0 1 385 to 1 748 v zhang et al 2018 besides cnt exhibited a superior adsorption ability towards bpa around 56 note that h2o2 and ch3cooh coexist in the paa solution and their individual role in the oxidation of bpa should be evaluated as can be seen in fig 1a either of them was hard to be activated by cnt for bpa removal intriguingly the removal efficiency of bpa was dramatically increased to 96 4 once cnt and paa were applied simultaneously implying that paa could be effectively activated by cnt and more effective active species were generated in addition bpa could be efficaciously removed in a wide range of cnt dosage 0 1 to 0 5 g l and paa concentration 0 1 to 1 mm also with high ph versatility ph0 5 to 9 text s8 figs s1 and s2a more importantly cnt paa system showcased superior reusability and bpa decay only showed a slight decline of less than 4 even after four cycles fig s3 which was superior to almost all reported carbon activated persulfate systems lee et al 2016 besides the xrd pattern shows that no change in characteristic peaks was observed in the post reaction cnt fig s4 which illustrated that little to no passivation occurred on the cnt in addition the paa activation performance of cnt was almost insusceptible to the wastewater matrix such as the common anions e g cl hco3 no3 and h2po4 and the natural organic matter e g humic acid fig s5a e furthermore the bpa elimination was slightly inhibited in east lake water yangtze river water wuhan section and secondary effluent wastewater the characteristics shown in text s9 and table s2 as depicted in fig s5f suggesting that the cnt paa system had a strong anti interference ability and could be promising for applying to the practical water environment 3 2 identification of the reactive species in the cnt paa system to investigate the reactive species generated in the cnt paa system the epr tests with dmpo and temp as trapping agents for radicals and 1o2 were conducted separately no characteristic signal of 1o2 was detected when using temp fig s6 manifesting the absence of 1o2 formation as shown in fig 1b there was no radical signal appeared with the presence of sole dmpo or paa however when cnt and paa were added simultaneously for 30 s the signals of dmpo oh adducts a n a h 14 8 g dmpo ch3 adducts a n 15 9 g a hβ 22 4 g and dmpo ch3coo adducts a h 7 5 g a n 13 5 g appeared chen et al 2022 it firmly evidenced the generation of r c and oh in the cnt paa system additionally these signals became stronger when the time was extended to 120 s it should be noted the detection of these radicals in epr does not necessarily mean that it is majorly responsible for the target compound oxidation lee et al 2017 tao et al 2020 so the actual contribution of the reactive species to pollutant removal needs to be clarified to this end a series of scavengers were employed to discriminate the role of diverse reactive radicals first methanol meoh ethanol etoh and tert butanol tba were used to distinguish the contribution of free oh and r c which are considered to be the two most important radicals produced in the paa aops ao et al 2021 meoh and etoh serve as quenchers for both r c and oh while tba has a far higher reaction rate constant with oh than r c wang et al 2021b which could mainly scavenge oh it should be noted all the three scavengers did not affect the adsorption performance of cnt fig s7 besides their addition barely affected the decay of bpa figs 1c and s8 manifesting negligible contribution of free radicals in the cnt paa system oodles of nearest reports usually confirmed the major role of oh and r c by a sharp decline in the removal of target contaminant using 2 4 hd as a quencher which possesses high reactivity with both two radicals k 2 4 hd oh 9 16 109 m 1 s 1 k 2 4 hd r c 5 108 m 1 s 1 kim et al 2020 qian et al 2021 zhang et al 2021a surprisingly a complete inhibition of bpa removal was observed with the addition of 20 mm 2 4 hd figs 1c and s9a which might contradict with the above result that meoh etoh or tba hardly influenced bpa elimination this is because 2 4 hd would exert influence on the adsorption performance of cnt owing to its high hydrophobicity xlogp 2 9 thus resulting in the declined removal efficiency this can be verified by the fact that 2 4 hd caused severe inhibition on bpa adsorption as depicted in fig s9b and the dispersion of cnt powder in the solution became uneven and agglomeration occurred even at low concentration of 2 4 hd fig s10 hence 2 4 hd is not a suitable radical scavenger used in a heterogeneous system based on the above observations quenching experiments were further conducted to discern the possible surface bound radicals generated in the cnt paa system by applying potassium iodide ki as a commonly used scavenger adil et al 2020 as shown in figs 1c and s11a the addition of 20 mm ki significantly retarded the decay of bpa but meanwhile the decomposition of paa was moderately promoted and the residual paa dropped to 0 025 mm at 20 min fig s11b hence the additional consumption of paa by ki may be responsible for the suppression of bpa degradation to verify this point the elimination of bpa was performed in the cnt paa system but the initial paa concentration was adjusted to 0 025 mm as can be seen in fig s11b a much higher bpa removal was still achieved than the case when paa concentration was 0 25 mm but 20 mm ki was present the possible influence of 20 m ki on bpa adsorptive removal by cnt alone was also excluded as shown in fig s7 the above results indicate that the inhibition of bpa elimination by ki was attributed to the quenching of minor surface bound oh and r c rather than the additional consumption of paa despite the generation of r c being ascertained through epr results its exact role in bpa degradation was still ambiguous to this end bromotrichloromethane brccl3 was selected as an apt r c scavenger zhou et al 2018b benefiting from its trivial influence on either bpa adsorption or paa consumption fig 1d manifested that the elimination of bpa by r c could be neglected to further clarify the radical contribution benzoic acid ba and nitrobenzene nb were applied as typical radical probes since they can specifically react with oh k ba oh 2 1 109 m 1 s 1 k nb oh 4 7 109 m 1 s 1 neither ba nor nb could be eliminated in a bench mark r c system of heat paa tba as illustrated in fig s12 excluding its reaction with r c wang et al 2020a compared with the adsorptive removal of ba or nb their degradative elimination was moderately promoted after paa was added fig 1e manifesting the diminutive generation of surface bound oh with the elucidation of the reaction mechanism mentioned above the major contribution of radicals in the cnt paa system was ruled out and we speculated that an etp might contribute to bpa elimination to shed light on the regime electrochemical measurement was conducted using open circuit potential ocp it can be seen in fig 2 a that after the injection of paa the ocp of the cnt coated glassy carbon electrode cnt gce increased sharply until it reached equilibrium which derived from the electron transfer between cnt and paa to form the cnt paa complex cnt paa after the target pollutant bpa was added the ocp decreased immediately indicating that there exists an etp between cnt paa and bpa that is the complex captured electrons from bpa directly resulting in the decrease of the oxidation potential of cnt gce however the ocp in the bare gce system exhibited the same tendency as cnt gce which might be related to the intrinsic nature of gce as a carbon material then chronoamperometry tests were conducted to further confirm the etp ren et al 2019 as shown in fig 2b no detectable current response occurred on the surface of gce whether bpa was present or not at the equilibrium potential of 0 47 v this phenomenon firmly explained that the decrease of ocp after bpa injection was not due to the occurrence of the etp but maybe the desorption of paa note that when the equilibrium potential of cnt paa 0 61 v was applied an evident current jump appeared for cnt gce in the presence of bpa than that without bpa suggesting that the electrons did transfer from bpa to surface constrained cnt paa therefore we speculated that bpa with the electron donating group could act as an electron donor for the metastable complex and the catalytic elimination of bpa was achieved in turn to further verify the etp a galvanic oxidation process gop with a two chamber reactor was constructed fig 2c a proton exchange membrane pem was used to separate the bpa cell and the paa cell so that paa could not contact the bpa molecules directly in two separated cells paa and bpa underwent the redox reaction through the circuit where bpa could only be oxidized via an etp the current flow as well as simultaneous bpa degradation were monitored note that a surge in current was recorded upon the injection of paa and it reached the maximum 50 μa at 30 s fig s13 meanwhile 26 6 of bpa could be oxidized in the gop system within 12 h fig 2d compared with the single chamber system paa and bpa contact directly the reduced oxidation rate of bpa was due to the separated paa and bpa in two cells although the use of blank graphite electrodes without the cnt coating showed a subtle current at 30 s there was very limited bpa degradation less than 3 during 12 h fig 2d this phenomenon gave strong evidence that the bpa would be oxidized via the etp at present in situ raman spectroscopy is frequently performed in the detection of reactive complex adsorbed on the surface of catalysts by observing the stretching variation of the peroxo o o bond lo o length of peroxides as indicated in fig 2e a distinctive peak at 874 cm 1 appeared of sole paa compared with h2o2 and ch3cooh which represented a unique characteristic peak of paa notably when paa was dripped onto the cnt powder the peaks at around 890 cm 1 emerged whereas disappeared immediately with bpa addition fig s14 this phenomenon firmly corroborated the formation of the reactive complex and its interaction with bpa in addition the vibrational frequency at 927 cm 1 could be ascribed to the c c stretching mode of acetate ion ch3coo ramírez rodríguez et al 2013 ray and frost 2000 confirming the generation of ch3coo during the interaction of cnt with paa premixing experiment was then conducted to gain more insight into the involvement of etp in the cnt paa system by adding bpa at certain delayed time intervals after mixing the cnt and paa in general a decrease of bpa decay would be expected if radical species was generated in the cnt paa system otherwise the effect of premixing stage on bpa removal was negligible in an electron transfer regime the results displayed that the bpa decay decreased slightly with the bpa addition delay time fig s15 which might result from the generation of a small fraction of radicals even without bpa injection to sum up the cnt activated paa complex played a dominant role in bpa degradation via an etp while the role of surface bound oh was minor to distinguish the inner or outer sphere interaction between paa and cnt the effect of ionic strength on bpa removal was investigated generally a higher ionic strength tends to suppress outer sphere interaction by compressing the thickness of electric double layers while it hardly affects inner sphere complexation guo et al 2022 ma et al 2022 ren et al 2022 tan et al 2020 as shown in fig s16 the bpa elimination in the presence of 100 mm naclo4 was nearly the same as that when 10 mm naclo4 was present strongly illustrating the inner sphere interaction of etp 3 3 selective degradation of six pcs in cnt paa system nonradical dominated system showcases high selectivity toward electron rich organics ren et al 2022 thus several ubiquitous pcs with varying substituents including bpa 4 chlorophenol 4 cp phenol pe 4 nitrophenol 4 np 2 methoxyphenol 2 mop and 2 4 dichlorophenol 2 4 dcp were chosen and their structures are shown in fig s17 control experiments indicate that little to no degradation of six pcs with varying functionalities was observed by paa alone fig s18 while cnt performed various adsorption capacities for the six pcs fig 3 a as can be seen in fig 3b the decay of six different pcs exerted distinct disparity in the cnt paa process within 20 min with the removal efficiency varying from 57 6 to 100 showcasing high reactivity and selectivity towards contaminants for all the selected compounds the elimination process followed pseudo first order kinetics with widely varying k obs table s3 notably the etp behaves analogously to an anodic oxidation process of electrochemical reaction where the electrons transfer from pollutants to the reactive complexes due to their intrinsic potential differences hence it is expected that lnk obs would show a good relationship with half wave potential φ 1 2 however as depicted in fig 3c a poor correlation r 2 0 289 between lnk obs and φ 1 2 of the pcs was obtained this indicates that the apparent removal of pcs was not necessarily due to the oxidation that occurred in the cnt paa system and the adsorption may contribute to the pc removal to more or less extent to verify this assumption the fraction of pcs in the aqueous f aq and solid f ad phases was determined at each sampling point and then the oxidized fraction f oxid was calculated accordingly text s6 fig 4 shows that the f ad of bpa pe and 2 mop on cnt was nearly zero even at the reaction time of 2 min thus their elimination could be mainly ascribed to oxidative degradation rather than adsorption intriguingly a higher fraction of other pcs such as 4 np 4 cp and dcp still remained in the solid phase even though the apparent decay efficiencies were all above 70 implying that the oxidative removal might be overestimated after subtracting the adsorptive contribution k oxid values of six pcs were obtained then lnk oxid and φ 1 2 of the pcs were refitted and a well positive relation r 2 0 904 was obtained in fig 3d this phenomenon clearly shows a φ 1 2 dependent removal feature of the cnt paa system further implying the prime role of the etp in pc removal ho et al 2019 shao et al 2020 yun et al 2018 furthermore fig s19 illustrates that the oxidative performance of r c for the six pcs in the heat paa system behaves much inferior to the etp which indirectly proved the negligible role of r c 3 4 investigation of active sites and interfacial interaction regarding the investigation of the active sites in carbonaceous materials various methods such as chemical titration or annealing methods were frequently adopted in carbon driven aops duan et al 2019 qi et al 2013 ren et al 2022 generally raising the pyrolysis temperature will intensify the graphitization degree i e the extent of sp2 hybridized carbon network of the carbon material surface resulting in an increase in conductivity which is beneficial to activating peroxides via an electron transfer pathway shao et al 2021 thus in order to reveal the possible active sites of cnt activating paa nine analogical cnts were synthesized by changing the carbonization temperature these cnts were employed as catalysts for paa activation to study the relationship between the catalytic activity of cnts and graphitization degree or oxygen content and further explore the active sites of cnt first the degradation performance of the nine derived cnts for bpa was evaluated and the corresponding k oxid values were shown in figs s20 s22 then xrd was employed to characterize the degree of graphitization of cnts fig 5 a presents the xrd pattern of cnts at different pyrolysis temperatures where a very intense and narrow peak at 26 5o and a small peak at 43 4o were observed corresponding to the 002 and 101 lattice planes of the graphite carbon respectively wang et al 2017 highly graphitized samples own narrower full width at half maximum fwhm which acts as the standard to distinguish the crystallinity of cnts with the increasing calcination temperature the fhwm 002 of cnts slightly narrowed down while the fhwm 101 fluctuated fig s23 ai et al 2021 note that fwhm 002 exhibited a significant negative correlation with the lnk oxid of nine cnts fig 5b proving that sp2 hybridized carbon with conjugated π and great conductivity was the active site for the etp duan et al 2018 among all cnts cnt cooh was not taken into account due to the severe disturbance of its extremely high oxygen content on the degree of sp2 hybridization see more discussion later in this section which presented the lowest crystallinity shown by the largest fwhm 002 to decipher the active sites for radical generation benzoic anhydride bad phenylhydrazine ph and 2 bromo 1 phenylethanone brpe were used as titrants to selectively deactivate the functional groups on cnt as they could selectively react with c oh c o and o c o on cnt respectively detailed modification process was presented in text s4 and thereby we can distinguish the activity contributions from different oxygen functional groups chen et al 2021 the derived samples were labeled as cnt bad cnt ph and cnt brpe respectively noticeably cnt bad exhibited inferior bpa decay performance to the pristine cnt fig 5c suggesting that the titration reactions might eliminate partial active sites i e c oh species in contrast cnt ph and cnt brpe behaved similarly in activity attenuation with cnt the negligible inhibition thus excluding the role of c o and o c o species in the generation of radicals to further clarify the active sites for radical generation probe experiments were conducted in cnt paa and cnt bad paa systems as displayed in fig s24 approximately 15 of ba or nb degradation was achieved in cnt paa process verifying the minor generation of surface bound oh notably the chemical titration on the c oh groups resulted in great decrease of oxidative removal of ba or nb confirming that the c oh groups were the active sites for radical production in cnt paa system then the type and content of oxygen containing groups of nine cnts were analyzed by xps and summarized in fig s25 the broad o1s peak can be fitted into four components with binding energies 234 at 531 4 532 7 533 4 and 535 9 ev which correspond to carbonyl group c o carboxyl group o c o hydroxyl group c oh and adsorbed h2o respectively it was no wonder that the content of all oxygen species decreased gradually with the ascension of calcination temperature which was in accordance with previous reports ren et al 2020 furthermore we correlated the corresponding k oxid of nine cnts to the content of oxygen moieties a superior and negative linearity can be observed between lnk oxid and the content of o c o r 2 0 914 or c o r 2 0 931 group fig 5d and e indicating that the presence of these two oxygen groups might be detrimental to the reaction between cnt and paa further revealing that these two moieties should not be the active sites for the non radical or radical process that occurred on cnt it is intriguing to note that the lnk oxid and c oh groups represented a relatively poor negative linearity r 2 0 502 fig 5f which implied that different from the other two groups c oh might relate to the radical pathway in the cnt paa system which further verified the foregoing conjecture for non radical dominated reactions adsorption capacity towards oxidants is a key factor for catalysts to induce the etp yang et al 2021 paa consumption on the above nine cnts was also quantified to scrutinize the discrepancy in adsorption capacities fig s26a and b unlike the classical oxidant of persulfate or h2o2 paa an organic acid that maintains the molecular form under neutral conditions may display contrasting adsorptive behavior towards cnts thus it is necessary to explore the interaction between paa adsorption capacity and bpa oxidation interestingly a positive linear relationship was observed in fig s26c r 2 0 812 which indicated that the higher amount of paa adsorption of cnts is more conducive to the generation of reactive complex thus further abstracting electrons from electron rich organics to realize their decomposition 3 5 dft calculations dft calculations have been a vigorous tool to investigate the inherent mechanism between the catalysts and oxidants considerable reports have spotlighted on identifying the active sites in the radical dominated pathway through longer o o bond and stronger adsorption energy zhang et al 2021b nevertheless neither the vibration of binding energy nor o o bond of peroxide can truly justify the occurrence of cleavage of o o bond in paa especially for the differentiation of the radical pathway and etp based nonradical pathway nie et al 2020 the reaction energy barrier another descriptor in dft was adopted to determine whether a reaction occurs or not li et al 2020 all models were initially optimized in xtb package and density functional theory dft calculations were based on orca 4 2 1 software package the details for the calculation are presented in text s10 to further distinguish the active sites of the radical and non radical pathways and ascertain the role of c oh sites in paa activation to form radicals the possible adsorption configurations of paa molecules ch3c o ooh on the cnt matrix and cnt edge with the lowest energy are described in fig 6 a the o o bond length of sole paa is 1 32 å fig s27a while it could be elongated to 1 43 å when paa was adsorbed onto the surface of the cnt matrix fig s27b however it showed the same value when paa was adsorbed onto the edge of cnt specifically the c oh located on the edge of cnt fig s27c meanwhile the calculated binding energy of paa adsorbed on the cnt edge was stronger than that on cnt matrix 1 68 ev vs 1 51 ev fig 6a indicating there exists favorable interaction between paa and cnt edge due to the presence of c oh nevertheless whether the paa would undergo activation to form radicals or reactive complex is still unknown yet thus the energy barrier of o o bond scission was calculated under the above situations to clarify the active sites towards reactive species generation first the critical barrier energy of scission of o o bond in paa to form oh and r c was calculated to be 276 77 kj mol 1 figs 6b and s28 which served as the criterion value to judge the possibility of reaction occurrence as shown in fig 6c the relatively high energy barrier of 283 50 kj mol 1 when paa is adsorbed onto the cnt matrix implies that the scission of paa is impossible which explains the formation of cnt paa without the breakage of o o bond contrastingly in the case of paa adsorption sites on the cnt edge the ultralow reaction barrier of 197 71 kj mol 1 manifested that the o o bond of paa is easily cleaved in the presence of c oh giving rise to producing free radicals fig 6d this phenomenon is in good accordance with the result of radical probing experiments further confirming the significance of the c oh group on the radical pathway hence we proposed the sp2 hybridized carbon bulk and c oh groups as the active sites of the non radical and radical pathway respectively based on the above analysis a possible mechanism in fig s29 was proposed for the degradation of pollutants in the cnt paa system first of all paa was adsorbed onto the sp2 hybridized carbon of cnt to form the metastable complex i e cnt paa moreover a small fraction of the complex cnt paa would more easily be decomposed to form surface bound oh and r c when paa molecules were adsorbed at c oh groups located on the edge of cnt as described in eqs 1 7 finally the bpa oxidation was realized via a major cnt paa based etp combined with a minor ohsurface based radical pathway 1 cnt oh c h 3 c o ooh oh c h 3 c o o cnt o h 2 cnt oh c h 3 c o ooh c h 3 c o o cnt o h 2 o 3 c h 3 c o o ch 3 c o 2 4 c h 3 o 2 c h 3 o 2 5 c h 3 c o ooh oh c h 3 c o o o h 2 o 6 c h

usage in environmental food and other industries for their high disinfection ability and limited toxic byproduct formation in this work combining paa with carbocatalysis we found that the reactive complex cnt paa would snatch electrons from electron rich phenolics to achieve their efficient decay moreover the edge located c oh could serve as the active site for decomposing the complex to generate a few surface bound radicals e g ohsurface to attack the pollutant as well such a hybrid radical and non radical regime resulted in extraordinary reusability of over 93 after four cycles which holds promise for overcoming the bottleneck of carbon based aops of poor stability furthermore the relationship between the surface chemistry i e oxygen functionality and sp2 hybridization and reactive species in carbocatalysis was established which is decisive to modulate the radical nonradical regime the new knowledge gained in this study will also assist to elucidate the rational design of highly efficient carbocatalysts for efficient and selective degradation of emerging contaminants as well as the development of paa aops in water treatment declaration of competing interest the

15313,peracetic acid based advanced oxidation processes paa aops on metal free catalysts have emerged as charming strategies for water contaminant removal however the involved reactive species and their corresponding active sites are ambiguous herein using carbon nanotube cnt as a model carbocatalyst we demonstrated that under neutral conditions the cnt paa complex was the dominant reactive species to oxidize phenolic compounds via electron transfer process etp whereas the surface bound hydroxyl radicals ohsurface played a minor role on the basis of quenching and electrochemical tests as well as raman spectroscopy more importantly the experimental and density functional theory dft calculation results collaboratively proved that the active site for etp was the sp2 hybridized carbon on the cnt bulk while that for radical generation was the edge located hydroxyl group c oh which lowered the energy barrier for cleaving the o o bond in cnt paa complex we further discerned the oxidation kinetic constants k oxid of different pollutants from the apparent kinetic constants in cnt paa system the significant negative linear correlation between lnk oxid and half wave potential of phenolic compounds suggests that the pollutants with a lower one electron oxidation potential i e stronger electron donating ability are more easily oxidized overall this study scrutinizes the hybrid radical and non radical mechanism and the corresponding active sites of the cnt paa system providing insights into the application of paa aops and the development of etp in the remediation of emerging organic pollutants graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords nanocarbon paa nonradical oxidation catalytic sites environmental remediation data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction very recently peracetic acid paa ch3c o ooh has been spotlighted as an emerging oxidant in advanced oxidation processes aops as it possesses the same o o bond structure with peroxymonosulfate pms peroxydisulfate pds and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 moreover the lower activation energy of o o bond scission 170 kj mol 1 of paa makes it be easily activated and exhibit superiority in contaminant decay kim and huang 2020 to date assorted approaches including external energy heat uv irradiation electrolysis etc and metal based catalysts cr co fe ru etc have been adopted to activate paa bell et al 2022 cai et al 2017 kim et al 2019 2020 2022 li et al 2021 liu et al 2021 wang et al 2021a 2020b unfortunately intense energy input or toxic metal leaching makes the above approaches neither cost effective nor eco friendly wang et al 2021c benefitting from their abundant reserves excellent conductivity and large surface area carbonaceous materials have been successfully adopted as promising and green alternatives to the metal based catalysts in aops shentu et al 2022 yang et al 2020 yu et al 2020 inspired by this achievement some investigators turned to pay attention to the activation of paa by carbocatalyst zhou et al 2015 first used activated carbon fibers acfs to activate paa to generate hydroxyl radicals oh and alkoxyl radicals ch3co2 for the elimination of dye reactive brilliant red x 3b dai et al 2022 observed the decay of sulfamethoxazole by carbon centered radicals r c including ch3co2 and acetylperoxyl radical ch3co3 as well as electron transfer in a modified activated carbon ac catalyzed paa system yun et al 2017 proposed that a nonradical process was involved in single walled carbon nanotube cnt activated paa system despite the fact that these works showcased the effective organic removal by carbon driven paa activation process the identification of multiple reactive species was contentious this might be ascribed to three reasons i the different structures of carbon materials such as ac and cnt specifically ac has abundant oxygen functional groups and low graphitization degree wang et al 2019a 2022b while cnt owns a relatively low level of functional groups and high sp2 hybridized carbons ren et al 2019 this may result in the different reactive species formed in the carbon paa systems ii the improper selection of quenchers for radicals such as ascorbic acid aa and 2 4 hexadiene 2 4 hd the former scavenger may directly react with paa zhou et al 2018a while the latter may interfere with the adsorption of target pollutants by carbon materials due to the high hydrophobicity of 2 4 hd see more detail in section 3 2 thus the contribution of radicals toward pollutant decay might be overestimated iii the lack of information on the direct witness of the surface reactive complex this may result in the underestimation of the potential electron transfer process etp during paa activation more importantly due to the vague determination of reactive species it is difficult to establish the relationship between the reactive species and the active sites in carbocatalysis whose identification is quite limited by the experimental aspects to the best of our knowledge only dai et al 2022 concluded oxygen functional groups as the active site via xps analysis of the modified ac before and after the reaction therefore it motivated us to develop comprehensive analysis technologies to determine the hybrid reactive species and uncover the structure activity relationships in carbon driven paa activation system herein cnt was chosen as an apt model carbocatalyst to activate paa for the removal of organic pollutants considering its simple structure and tunable functionalized moieties that are conducive to precisely discerning the underlying hybrid mechanism ren et al 2022 the reactive species and the corresponding active sites in the cnt paa system were accurately identified by a combination of experimental and theoretical methods notably cnt paa complex was first detected via in situ raman test which formed at the sp2 hybridized carbon network and dominated the bpa oxidation through etp the surface bound hydroxyl radicals ohsurface played a minor role and the corresponding active site was determined as the edge located hydroxyl group c oh through density functional theory dft calculations the oxidation rate constants k oxid of six phenolic compounds pcs were accurately discerned from their apparent counterparts k obs and the selective oxidation nature of cnt paa was determined to be related to the half wave potential φ 1 2 of these pollutants thus the present study gauges the mechanism of carbocatalysis for paa activation which will provide the cornerstone for the development of this promising technology for environmental remediation 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents reagents used in this study are provided in text s1 of the supporting information 2 2 analytical methods the pollutants were analyzed by a high performance liquid chromatography hplc shimadzu lc 20a japan with a c 18 column the composition of the mobile phase and uv absorption wavelength of each pollutant are summarized in table s1 qualitative detection of radicals and singlet oxygen 1o2 was performed using a bruker a200 epr spectrometer details presented in text s2 residual paa was measured by a potassium iodide method open circuit potentiometry and chronoamperometry were measured on an electrochemical workstation chi 660e china details presented in text s3 2 3 preparation and characterization of catalysts three commercial cnts including cnt hydroxylated multi walled carbon nanotubes marked as cnt oh and carboxylated multi walled carbon nanotubes marked as cnt cooh were annealed at 400 c and 700 c respectively for 1 h to obtain cnt 400 cnt 700 cnt oh 400 cnt oh 700 cnt cooh 400 and cnt cooh 700 the selective chemical titration experiments for cnt were shown in detail in text s4 the specific characterization methods are provided in text s5 2 4 experimental procedures the experiments were carried out in a 100 ml magnetically stirred breaker unless otherwise stated the experimental conditions were pc concentration of 0 02 mm cnt dosage of 0 2 g l paa dosage of 0 25 mm and initial ph ph0 of 7 0 the solution containing paa and the target pollutant was initially adjusted to the desired ph afterward the reaction was started by adding cnt powder periodically 1 0 ml sample was withdrawn from the reaction and filtered by 0 22 μm filter membrane and then quenched with excessive na2s2o3 pre added into 2 ml glass vials for hplc analysis detailed kinetic discernment experiments are provided in text s6 the galvanic oxidation process gop was developed with the phenolics and paa separately present in two half cells see more details in text s7 for the stability tests the used cnts were collected after each run and washed with deionized water for several times and dried at 60 c for reuse all of the degradation experiments were conducted in duplicate or triplicate and the means with standard deviations were presented 3 results and discussion 3 1 catalytic performance of cnt for paa activation the performance of the cnt paa process was first investigated by using bpa as the target pollutant considering its ubiquitous presence in the environmental and endocrine disrupting properties naderi et al 2020 wang et al 2022a 2019b as shown in fig 1 a an inconspicuous amount of bpa less than 5 was degraded in the sole paa condition indicating that bpa elimination by direct oxidation of paa was insufficient despite the high redox potential of paa e 0 1 385 to 1 748 v zhang et al 2018 besides cnt exhibited a superior adsorption ability towards bpa around 56 note that h2o2 and ch3cooh coexist in the paa solution and their individual role in the oxidation of bpa should be evaluated as can be seen in fig 1a either of them was hard to be activated by cnt for bpa removal intriguingly the removal efficiency of bpa was dramatically increased to 96 4 once cnt and paa were applied simultaneously implying that paa could be effectively activated by cnt and more effective active species were generated in addition bpa could be efficaciously removed in a wide range of cnt dosage 0 1 to 0 5 g l and paa concentration 0 1 to 1 mm also with high ph versatility ph0 5 to 9 text s8 figs s1 and s2a more importantly cnt paa system showcased superior reusability and bpa decay only showed a slight decline of less than 4 even after four cycles fig s3 which was superior to almost all reported carbon activated persulfate systems lee et al 2016 besides the xrd pattern shows that no change in characteristic peaks was observed in the post reaction cnt fig s4 which illustrated that little to no passivation occurred on the cnt in addition the paa activation performance of cnt was almost insusceptible to the wastewater matrix such as the common anions e g cl hco3 no3 and h2po4 and the natural organic matter e g humic acid fig s5a e furthermore the bpa elimination was slightly inhibited in east lake water yangtze river water wuhan section and secondary effluent wastewater the characteristics shown in text s9 and table s2 as depicted in fig s5f suggesting that the cnt paa system had a strong anti interference ability and could be promising for applying to the practical water environment 3 2 identification of the reactive species in the cnt paa system to investigate the reactive species generated in the cnt paa system the epr tests with dmpo and temp as trapping agents for radicals and 1o2 were conducted separately no characteristic signal of 1o2 was detected when using temp fig s6 manifesting the absence of 1o2 formation as shown in fig 1b there was no radical signal appeared with the presence of sole dmpo or paa however when cnt and paa were added simultaneously for 30 s the signals of dmpo oh adducts a n a h 14 8 g dmpo ch3 adducts a n 15 9 g a hβ 22 4 g and dmpo ch3coo adducts a h 7 5 g a n 13 5 g appeared chen et al 2022 it firmly evidenced the generation of r c and oh in the cnt paa system additionally these signals became stronger when the time was extended to 120 s it should be noted the detection of these radicals in epr does not necessarily mean that it is majorly responsible for the target compound oxidation lee et al 2017 tao et al 2020 so the actual contribution of the reactive species to pollutant removal needs to be clarified to this end a series of scavengers were employed to discriminate the role of diverse reactive radicals first methanol meoh ethanol etoh and tert butanol tba were used to distinguish the contribution of free oh and r c which are considered to be the two most important radicals produced in the paa aops ao et al 2021 meoh and etoh serve as quenchers for both r c and oh while tba has a far higher reaction rate constant with oh than r c wang et al 2021b which could mainly scavenge oh it should be noted all the three scavengers did not affect the adsorption performance of cnt fig s7 besides their addition barely affected the decay of bpa figs 1c and s8 manifesting negligible contribution of free radicals in the cnt paa system oodles of nearest reports usually confirmed the major role of oh and r c by a sharp decline in the removal of target contaminant using 2 4 hd as a quencher which possesses high reactivity with both two radicals k 2 4 hd oh 9 16 109 m 1 s 1 k 2 4 hd r c 5 108 m 1 s 1 kim et al 2020 qian et al 2021 zhang et al 2021a surprisingly a complete inhibition of bpa removal was observed with the addition of 20 mm 2 4 hd figs 1c and s9a which might contradict with the above result that meoh etoh or tba hardly influenced bpa elimination this is because 2 4 hd would exert influence on the adsorption performance of cnt owing to its high hydrophobicity xlogp 2 9 thus resulting in the declined removal efficiency this can be verified by the fact that 2 4 hd caused severe inhibition on bpa adsorption as depicted in fig s9b and the dispersion of cnt powder in the solution became uneven and agglomeration occurred even at low concentration of 2 4 hd fig s10 hence 2 4 hd is not a suitable radical scavenger used in a heterogeneous system based on the above observations quenching experiments were further conducted to discern the possible surface bound radicals generated in the cnt paa system by applying potassium iodide ki as a commonly used scavenger adil et al 2020 as shown in figs 1c and s11a the addition of 20 mm ki significantly retarded the decay of bpa but meanwhile the decomposition of paa was moderately promoted and the residual paa dropped to 0 025 mm at 20 min fig s11b hence the additional consumption of paa by ki may be responsible for the suppression of bpa degradation to verify this point the elimination of bpa was performed in the cnt paa system but the initial paa concentration was adjusted to 0 025 mm as can be seen in fig s11b a much higher bpa removal was still achieved than the case when paa concentration was 0 25 mm but 20 mm ki was present the possible influence of 20 m ki on bpa adsorptive removal by cnt alone was also excluded as shown in fig s7 the above results indicate that the inhibition of bpa elimination by ki was attributed to the quenching of minor surface bound oh and r c rather than the additional consumption of paa despite the generation of r c being ascertained through epr results its exact role in bpa degradation was still ambiguous to this end bromotrichloromethane brccl3 was selected as an apt r c scavenger zhou et al 2018b benefiting from its trivial influence on either bpa adsorption or paa consumption fig 1d manifested that the elimination of bpa by r c could be neglected to further clarify the radical contribution benzoic acid ba and nitrobenzene nb were applied as typical radical probes since they can specifically react with oh k ba oh 2 1 109 m 1 s 1 k nb oh 4 7 109 m 1 s 1 neither ba nor nb could be eliminated in a bench mark r c system of heat paa tba as illustrated in fig s12 excluding its reaction with r c wang et al 2020a compared with the adsorptive removal of ba or nb their degradative elimination was moderately promoted after paa was added fig 1e manifesting the diminutive generation of surface bound oh with the elucidation of the reaction mechanism mentioned above the major contribution of radicals in the cnt paa system was ruled out and we speculated that an etp might contribute to bpa elimination to shed light on the regime electrochemical measurement was conducted using open circuit potential ocp it can be seen in fig 2 a that after the injection of paa the ocp of the cnt coated glassy carbon electrode cnt gce increased sharply until it reached equilibrium which derived from the electron transfer between cnt and paa to form the cnt paa complex cnt paa after the target pollutant bpa was added the ocp decreased immediately indicating that there exists an etp between cnt paa and bpa that is the complex captured electrons from bpa directly resulting in the decrease of the oxidation potential of cnt gce however the ocp in the bare gce system exhibited the same tendency as cnt gce which might be related to the intrinsic nature of gce as a carbon material then chronoamperometry tests were conducted to further confirm the etp ren et al 2019 as shown in fig 2b no detectable current response occurred on the surface of gce whether bpa was present or not at the equilibrium potential of 0 47 v this phenomenon firmly explained that the decrease of ocp after bpa injection was not due to the occurrence of the etp but maybe the desorption of paa note that when the equilibrium potential of cnt paa 0 61 v was applied an evident current jump appeared for cnt gce in the presence of bpa than that without bpa suggesting that the electrons did transfer from bpa to surface constrained cnt paa therefore we speculated that bpa with the electron donating group could act as an electron donor for the metastable complex and the catalytic elimination of bpa was achieved in turn to further verify the etp a galvanic oxidation process gop with a two chamber reactor was constructed fig 2c a proton exchange membrane pem was used to separate the bpa cell and the paa cell so that paa could not contact the bpa molecules directly in two separated cells paa and bpa underwent the redox reaction through the circuit where bpa could only be oxidized via an etp the current flow as well as simultaneous bpa degradation were monitored note that a surge in current was recorded upon the injection of paa and it reached the maximum 50 μa at 30 s fig s13 meanwhile 26 6 of bpa could be oxidized in the gop system within 12 h fig 2d compared with the single chamber system paa and bpa contact directly the reduced oxidation rate of bpa was due to the separated paa and bpa in two cells although the use of blank graphite electrodes without the cnt coating showed a subtle current at 30 s there was very limited bpa degradation less than 3 during 12 h fig 2d this phenomenon gave strong evidence that the bpa would be oxidized via the etp at present in situ raman spectroscopy is frequently performed in the detection of reactive complex adsorbed on the surface of catalysts by observing the stretching variation of the peroxo o o bond lo o length of peroxides as indicated in fig 2e a distinctive peak at 874 cm 1 appeared of sole paa compared with h2o2 and ch3cooh which represented a unique characteristic peak of paa notably when paa was dripped onto the cnt powder the peaks at around 890 cm 1 emerged whereas disappeared immediately with bpa addition fig s14 this phenomenon firmly corroborated the formation of the reactive complex and its interaction with bpa in addition the vibrational frequency at 927 cm 1 could be ascribed to the c c stretching mode of acetate ion ch3coo ramírez rodríguez et al 2013 ray and frost 2000 confirming the generation of ch3coo during the interaction of cnt with paa premixing experiment was then conducted to gain more insight into the involvement of etp in the cnt paa system by adding bpa at certain delayed time intervals after mixing the cnt and paa in general a decrease of bpa decay would be expected if radical species was generated in the cnt paa system otherwise the effect of premixing stage on bpa removal was negligible in an electron transfer regime the results displayed that the bpa decay decreased slightly with the bpa addition delay time fig s15 which might result from the generation of a small fraction of radicals even without bpa injection to sum up the cnt activated paa complex played a dominant role in bpa degradation via an etp while the role of surface bound oh was minor to distinguish the inner or outer sphere interaction between paa and cnt the effect of ionic strength on bpa removal was investigated generally a higher ionic strength tends to suppress outer sphere interaction by compressing the thickness of electric double layers while it hardly affects inner sphere complexation guo et al 2022 ma et al 2022 ren et al 2022 tan et al 2020 as shown in fig s16 the bpa elimination in the presence of 100 mm naclo4 was nearly the same as that when 10 mm naclo4 was present strongly illustrating the inner sphere interaction of etp 3 3 selective degradation of six pcs in cnt paa system nonradical dominated system showcases high selectivity toward electron rich organics ren et al 2022 thus several ubiquitous pcs with varying substituents including bpa 4 chlorophenol 4 cp phenol pe 4 nitrophenol 4 np 2 methoxyphenol 2 mop and 2 4 dichlorophenol 2 4 dcp were chosen and their structures are shown in fig s17 control experiments indicate that little to no degradation of six pcs with varying functionalities was observed by paa alone fig s18 while cnt performed various adsorption capacities for the six pcs fig 3 a as can be seen in fig 3b the decay of six different pcs exerted distinct disparity in the cnt paa process within 20 min with the removal efficiency varying from 57 6 to 100 showcasing high reactivity and selectivity towards contaminants for all the selected compounds the elimination process followed pseudo first order kinetics with widely varying k obs table s3 notably the etp behaves analogously to an anodic oxidation process of electrochemical reaction where the electrons transfer from pollutants to the reactive complexes due to their intrinsic potential differences hence it is expected that lnk obs would show a good relationship with half wave potential φ 1 2 however as depicted in fig 3c a poor correlation r 2 0 289 between lnk obs and φ 1 2 of the pcs was obtained this indicates that the apparent removal of pcs was not necessarily due to the oxidation that occurred in the cnt paa system and the adsorption may contribute to the pc removal to more or less extent to verify this assumption the fraction of pcs in the aqueous f aq and solid f ad phases was determined at each sampling point and then the oxidized fraction f oxid was calculated accordingly text s6 fig 4 shows that the f ad of bpa pe and 2 mop on cnt was nearly zero even at the reaction time of 2 min thus their elimination could be mainly ascribed to oxidative degradation rather than adsorption intriguingly a higher fraction of other pcs such as 4 np 4 cp and dcp still remained in the solid phase even though the apparent decay efficiencies were all above 70 implying that the oxidative removal might be overestimated after subtracting the adsorptive contribution k oxid values of six pcs were obtained then lnk oxid and φ 1 2 of the pcs were refitted and a well positive relation r 2 0 904 was obtained in fig 3d this phenomenon clearly shows a φ 1 2 dependent removal feature of the cnt paa system further implying the prime role of the etp in pc removal ho et al 2019 shao et al 2020 yun et al 2018 furthermore fig s19 illustrates that the oxidative performance of r c for the six pcs in the heat paa system behaves much inferior to the etp which indirectly proved the negligible role of r c 3 4 investigation of active sites and interfacial interaction regarding the investigation of the active sites in carbonaceous materials various methods such as chemical titration or annealing methods were frequently adopted in carbon driven aops duan et al 2019 qi et al 2013 ren et al 2022 generally raising the pyrolysis temperature will intensify the graphitization degree i e the extent of sp2 hybridized carbon network of the carbon material surface resulting in an increase in conductivity which is beneficial to activating peroxides via an electron transfer pathway shao et al 2021 thus in order to reveal the possible active sites of cnt activating paa nine analogical cnts were synthesized by changing the carbonization temperature these cnts were employed as catalysts for paa activation to study the relationship between the catalytic activity of cnts and graphitization degree or oxygen content and further explore the active sites of cnt first the degradation performance of the nine derived cnts for bpa was evaluated and the corresponding k oxid values were shown in figs s20 s22 then xrd was employed to characterize the degree of graphitization of cnts fig 5 a presents the xrd pattern of cnts at different pyrolysis temperatures where a very intense and narrow peak at 26 5o and a small peak at 43 4o were observed corresponding to the 002 and 101 lattice planes of the graphite carbon respectively wang et al 2017 highly graphitized samples own narrower full width at half maximum fwhm which acts as the standard to distinguish the crystallinity of cnts with the increasing calcination temperature the fhwm 002 of cnts slightly narrowed down while the fhwm 101 fluctuated fig s23 ai et al 2021 note that fwhm 002 exhibited a significant negative correlation with the lnk oxid of nine cnts fig 5b proving that sp2 hybridized carbon with conjugated π and great conductivity was the active site for the etp duan et al 2018 among all cnts cnt cooh was not taken into account due to the severe disturbance of its extremely high oxygen content on the degree of sp2 hybridization see more discussion later in this section which presented the lowest crystallinity shown by the largest fwhm 002 to decipher the active sites for radical generation benzoic anhydride bad phenylhydrazine ph and 2 bromo 1 phenylethanone brpe were used as titrants to selectively deactivate the functional groups on cnt as they could selectively react with c oh c o and o c o on cnt respectively detailed modification process was presented in text s4 and thereby we can distinguish the activity contributions from different oxygen functional groups chen et al 2021 the derived samples were labeled as cnt bad cnt ph and cnt brpe respectively noticeably cnt bad exhibited inferior bpa decay performance to the pristine cnt fig 5c suggesting that the titration reactions might eliminate partial active sites i e c oh species in contrast cnt ph and cnt brpe behaved similarly in activity attenuation with cnt the negligible inhibition thus excluding the role of c o and o c o species in the generation of radicals to further clarify the active sites for radical generation probe experiments were conducted in cnt paa and cnt bad paa systems as displayed in fig s24 approximately 15 of ba or nb degradation was achieved in cnt paa process verifying the minor generation of surface bound oh notably the chemical titration on the c oh groups resulted in great decrease of oxidative removal of ba or nb confirming that the c oh groups were the active sites for radical production in cnt paa system then the type and content of oxygen containing groups of nine cnts were analyzed by xps and summarized in fig s25 the broad o1s peak can be fitted into four components with binding energies 234 at 531 4 532 7 533 4 and 535 9 ev which correspond to carbonyl group c o carboxyl group o c o hydroxyl group c oh and adsorbed h2o respectively it was no wonder that the content of all oxygen species decreased gradually with the ascension of calcination temperature which was in accordance with previous reports ren et al 2020 furthermore we correlated the corresponding k oxid of nine cnts to the content of oxygen moieties a superior and negative linearity can be observed between lnk oxid and the content of o c o r 2 0 914 or c o r 2 0 931 group fig 5d and e indicating that the presence of these two oxygen groups might be detrimental to the reaction between cnt and paa further revealing that these two moieties should not be the active sites for the non radical or radical process that occurred on cnt it is intriguing to note that the lnk oxid and c oh groups represented a relatively poor negative linearity r 2 0 502 fig 5f which implied that different from the other two groups c oh might relate to the radical pathway in the cnt paa system which further verified the foregoing conjecture for non radical dominated reactions adsorption capacity towards oxidants is a key factor for catalysts to induce the etp yang et al 2021 paa consumption on the above nine cnts was also quantified to scrutinize the discrepancy in adsorption capacities fig s26a and b unlike the classical oxidant of persulfate or h2o2 paa an organic acid that maintains the molecular form under neutral conditions may display contrasting adsorptive behavior towards cnts thus it is necessary to explore the interaction between paa adsorption capacity and bpa oxidation interestingly a positive linear relationship was observed in fig s26c r 2 0 812 which indicated that the higher amount of paa adsorption of cnts is more conducive to the generation of reactive complex thus further abstracting electrons from electron rich organics to realize their decomposition 3 5 dft calculations dft calculations have been a vigorous tool to investigate the inherent mechanism between the catalysts and oxidants considerable reports have spotlighted on identifying the active sites in the radical dominated pathway through longer o o bond and stronger adsorption energy zhang et al 2021b nevertheless neither the vibration of binding energy nor o o bond of peroxide can truly justify the occurrence of cleavage of o o bond in paa especially for the differentiation of the radical pathway and etp based nonradical pathway nie et al 2020 the reaction energy barrier another descriptor in dft was adopted to determine whether a reaction occurs or not li et al 2020 all models were initially optimized in xtb package and density functional theory dft calculations were based on orca 4 2 1 software package the details for the calculation are presented in text s10 to further distinguish the active sites of the radical and non radical pathways and ascertain the role of c oh sites in paa activation to form radicals the possible adsorption configurations of paa molecules ch3c o ooh on the cnt matrix and cnt edge with the lowest energy are described in fig 6 a the o o bond length of sole paa is 1 32 å fig s27a while it could be elongated to 1 43 å when paa was adsorbed onto the surface of the cnt matrix fig s27b however it showed the same value when paa was adsorbed onto the edge of cnt specifically the c oh located on the edge of cnt fig s27c meanwhile the calculated binding energy of paa adsorbed on the cnt edge was stronger than that on cnt matrix 1 68 ev vs 1 51 ev fig 6a indicating there exists favorable interaction between paa and cnt edge due to the presence of c oh nevertheless whether the paa would undergo activation to form radicals or reactive complex is still unknown yet thus the energy barrier of o o bond scission was calculated under the above situations to clarify the active sites towards reactive species generation first the critical barrier energy of scission of o o bond in paa to form oh and r c was calculated to be 276 77 kj mol 1 figs 6b and s28 which served as the criterion value to judge the possibility of reaction occurrence as shown in fig 6c the relatively high energy barrier of 283 50 kj mol 1 when paa is adsorbed onto the cnt matrix implies that the scission of paa is impossible which explains the formation of cnt paa without the breakage of o o bond contrastingly in the case of paa adsorption sites on the cnt edge the ultralow reaction barrier of 197 71 kj mol 1 manifested that the o o bond of paa is easily cleaved in the presence of c oh giving rise to producing free radicals fig 6d this phenomenon is in good accordance with the result of radical probing experiments further confirming the significance of the c oh group on the radical pathway hence we proposed the sp2 hybridized carbon bulk and c oh groups as the active sites of the non radical and radical pathway respectively based on the above analysis a possible mechanism in fig s29 was proposed for the degradation of pollutants in the cnt paa system first of all paa was adsorbed onto the sp2 hybridized carbon of cnt to form the metastable complex i e cnt paa moreover a small fraction of the complex cnt paa would more easily be decomposed to form surface bound oh and r c when paa molecules were adsorbed at c oh groups located on the edge of cnt as described in eqs 1 7 finally the bpa oxidation was realized via a major cnt paa based etp combined with a minor ohsurface based radical pathway 1 cnt oh c h 3 c o ooh oh c h 3 c o o cnt o h 2 cnt oh c h 3 c o ooh c h 3 c o o cnt o h 2 o 3 c h 3 c o o ch 3 c o 2 4 c h 3 o 2 c h 3 o 2 5 c h 3 c o ooh oh c h 3 c o o o h 2 o 6 c h 3 c o ooh oh c h 3 c o h 2 o o 2 7 c h 3 c o ooh c h 3 c o o c h 3 c o o o c h 3 c o oh 4 conclusion paa is the most common member in the group of peroxy acid oxidants which are gaining increasing usage in environmental food and other industries for their high disinfection ability and limited toxic byproduct formation in this work combining paa with carbocatalysis we found that the reactive complex cnt paa would snatch electrons from electron rich phenolics to achieve their efficient decay moreover the edge located c oh could serve as the active site for decomposing the complex to generate a few surface bound radicals e g ohsurface to attack the pollutant as well such a hybrid radical and non radical regime resulted in extraordinary reusability of over 93 after four cycles which holds promise for overcoming the bottleneck of carbon based aops of poor stability furthermore the relationship between the surface chemistry i e oxygen functionality and sp2 hybridization and reactive species in carbocatalysis was established which is decisive to modulate the radical nonradical regime the new knowledge gained in this study will also assist to elucidate the rational design of highly efficient carbocatalysts for efficient and selective degradation of emerging contaminants as well as the development of paa aops in water treatment declaration of competing interest the

15314,glycerol is abundantly present in wastewater from industries such as biodiesel production facilities glycerol is also a potential carbon source for microbes that are involved in wastewater nutrient removal processes the conversion of glycerol in biological phosphorus removal of aerobic granular sludge processes has not been explored to date the current study describes glycerol utilization by aerobic granular sludge and enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr robust granules with good phosphorus removal capabilities were formed in an aerobic granular sludge sequencing batch reactor fed with glycerol the interaction between the fermentative conversion of glycerol and product uptake by polyphosphate accumulating organisms pao was studied using stoichiometric and microbial community analysis metagenomic metaproteomic and microscopic analysis identified a community dominated by actinobacteria tessaracoccus and micropruina and a typical pao known as ca accumulibacter glycerol uptake facilitator glpf and glycerol kinase glpk two proteins involved in the transport of glycerol into the cellular metabolism were only observed in the genome of the actinobacteria the anaerobic conversion appeared to be a combination of a substrate fermentation and product uptake type reaction initially glycerol fermentation led mainly to the production of 1 3 propanediol 1 3 pdo which was not taken up under anaerobic conditions despite the aerobic conversion of 1 3 pdo stable granulation was observed over time 1 3 pdo production decreased and complete anaerobic cod uptake was observed the results demonstrate that glycerol containing wastewater can effectively be treated by the aerobic granular sludge process and that fermentative and polyphosphate accumulating organisms can form a food chain in glycerol based ebpr processes graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords ebpr pao actinobacteria consortium glycerol fermentative organisms data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction aerobic granular sludge ags is a state of the art biological wastewater treatment technology that performs simultaneous carbon nitrogen and phosphorus removal de kreuk et al 2007 pronk et al 2015 several factors distinguish ags from conventional activated sludge systems for instance due to the compact structure and smooth surface of the granules settling occurs rapidly and the redox gradient across the biofilm accommodates simultaneous conversions to take place within the granules bengtsson et al 2018 de bruin et al 2004 de kreuk and van loosdrecht 2006 these features reduce the treatment time significantly enhance the solid liquid separation and eliminate the need for multiple reactor compartments pronk et al 2015 the formation of aerobic granules was first demonstrated in 1998 and applying certain environmental pressures was reported to be key in achieving granules heijnen and van loosdrecht 1998 the underlying mechanisms for granulation and achieving a system with stable performance are extensively studied and described in the literature etterer and wilderer 2001 yu liu et al 2005 morgenroth et al 1997 picioreanu et al 1997 van dijk et al 2022 winkler et al 2013 several parameters are important for obtaining stable and smooth granules of prime importance is the selection of slow growing microorganisms such as polyphosphate accumulating organisms pao and glycogen accumulating organisms gao that form dense smooth granules de kreuk and van loosdrecht 2004 when biodegradable organic carbon usually volatile fatty acids vfa is supplied to the system under anaerobic conditions it is converted by certain microorganisms paos for instance into storage polymers known as poly hydroxy alkanoates pha oehmen et al 2005 microorganisms growing on storage polymers have a slower growth rate than heterotrophic bacteria growing on readily biodegradable organic carbon in the presence of an electron acceptor van loosdrecht et al 1997 generally slow growing microorganisms such as methanogens nitrifiers anammox paos gaos form a more compact structure and smoother granular biomass than fast growing microorganisms in the subsequent aerobic phase the stored organic carbon is oxidized to provide energy for the formation of biomass and replenishment of the intracellular polymer pool oehmen et al 2007 tarayre et al 2016 similarity in operational parameters such as anaerobic aerobic cycles in both ags and enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr is also a common link between the two system which selects organisms that are important for the successful application of these technologies ebpr is an environmentally sustainable and economically competitive technology bunce et al 2018 ketchum et al 1987 the technology is based on the enrichment of the sludge with paos that can excessively accumulate phosphorus p in the form of poly phosphate poly p after which p removal is achieved through excess sludge discharge smolders et al 1994 however the stability of these systems depends on various factors such as the carbon source which act as the electron donor guerrero et al 2011 wei et al 2014 in literature an overwhelming amount of information exists on ebpr with vfas mainly acetate and propionate as the carbon source bunce et al 2018 oehmen et al 2007 oehmen et al 2005 oehmen d et al 2005 pijuan et al 2004 pijuan et al 2005 smolders et al 1994 however when other sources of carbon such as alcohol or sugars are used these systems manifest different behaviours for instance a period of adaptation is required by paos when ethanol is used puig et al 2008 whereas methanol can be used via a syntrophic consortium between acetogens and paos tayà et al 2013 in a study by begum and batista 2012 the authors reported ebpr deterioration due to the proliferation of gaos over paos with glucose as substrate in addition to traditional paos the presence of fermentative microorganisms in dynamic feast famine conditions that can perform fermentation and anaerobically accumulate storage compounds without cycling polyphosphate has been reported carucci et al 1999 mcilroy et al 2018 these fermentative gaos fgao play a potentially important role in ebpr systems since they can convert the substrate into pao utilizable product enabling pao proliferation or they can compete for substrate uptake compromising the phosphorus removal efficiency of the system therefore the carbon source in the wastewater plays a decisive role in the success of the ebpr process glycerol is a compound that can be dominant in a variety of industrial wastewaters such as biodiesel and epoxy resin production pinto and de araujo mota 2014 for instance the production of every 10 kilograms of biodiesel generates about 1 kilogram of glycerol plácido and capareda 2016 and the wastewater generated from the epoxy resin production facilities contain a significant amount of glycerol due to its abundance and relatively low price the use of glycerol has attracted the attention of different engineering communities for various applications lima et al 2021 in wastewater treatment glycerol has been reported to be a suitable source of carbon for the removal of nitrogen and phosphorus coats et al 2015 smyk and ignatowicz 2017 yuan et al 2010 however the conversion of glycerol in ags ebpr processes or the formation of ags using glycerol has not been studied in detail the anaerobic conversion of glycerol by both mixed and pure microbial cultures has been extensively studied over the years barbirato et al 1995 gupta et al 2009 katarzyna leja et al 2011 temudo et al 2008 and 1 3 propanediol 1 3 pdo is the most common reported product among the products of glycerol fermentation in literature clomburg and gonzalez 2013 moscoviz et al 2016 several studies have also reported the production of propionate from the fermentation of glycerol using mixed microbial cultures chen et al 2016 yuan et al 2010 in ebpr systems glycerol could directly be taken up by paos but also potentially fermented to a variety of products that can subsequently be utilized by the paos or only be converted under aerobic conditions the latter process could potentially harm the granulation process as fast aerobic growth would lead to less favourable sludge morphologies pronk et al 2015 given that 1 3 pdo is a more reduced compound than glycerol microorganisms are required to generate more oxidized compounds e g co2 to maintain their redox balance propionate synthesis from glycerol is both redox neutral table 1 and energy positive with 1 or more mol atp produced per mol glycerol fermented barbirato et al 1997 gonzalez garcia et al 2017 yin liu et al 2011 versus no atp

r k m a n c y c l e information on the effect and conversion of glycerol in ags and ebpr processes is lacking which is important for a wider application of the technology here we study the potential of glycerol as an electron donor to promote aerobic granular sludge formation and evaluate the carbon and phosphorus removal of the system we further elucidate the anaerobic aerobic conversions by linking process stoichiometry to microbial community analysis 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup and reactor operation the experiments were conducted in a bubble column reactor and operated in a sequencing batch reactor sbr configuration the working volume of the reactor was 2 8 l with an internal diameter of 5 6 cm and a total height of 90 cm after effluent withdrawal 1 3 l

nadh balances were made for each organism the balance was made based on the assumption 1 that glycerol is anaerobically converted to propionate and glycogen and that the produced propionate is subsequently taken up by the pao community to synthesize pha verified via mass balances and 2 the majority of the community was dominated by paos using fish and proteomics indicating minor contribution to substrate distribution by other potential communities see discussions for further elaborations the parameters used in the calculations to estimate propionate production are listed through equations 3 6 derived from principles of biochemistry nelson et al 2000 note that the degree of reduction of glycerol and propionate are the same and thus the nadh balance is a conserved

for propionate uptake and pha synthesis through poly p and glycogen hydrolysis the latter process also generates reducing equivalents i e nadh required for the maintenance of redox balance within the cell 3 results 3 1 reactor operation granular sludge from a pilot municipal wastewater treatment plant wwtp in the netherlands performing ebpr was used to inoculate the reactor after a few weeks of reactor operation and the formation of new biomass the sludge colour changed from dark brown to light brown orange the settling time was step wise decreased from 20 to 5 minutes within 4 weeks of operation with the development of granular sludge the effluent became clearer and the flocculent biomass disappeared from the system once granular biomass formation stabilized from day 65 onwards a solids retention time srt of 12 days was maintained by manual sludge removal and solids washout via the effluent after the reactor reached a pseudo steady state an average sludge volume index svi5 of 33 4 ml g was obtained from the sludge settled bed in the reactor after 5 minutes of settling the tss and vss concentration in the reactor stabilized at an average of 7 3 and 5 5 g l i e 24 ash content respectively once a pseudo steady state was achieved day 126 onwards an average p release of 64 3 mg l was obtained with a specific p release and uptake rate of 10 9 and 16 3 mgp gvss h respectively pseudo steady state was defined on the basis of stable conversion of substrates and phosphate throughout the cycles the anaerobic glycerol uptake rate was 2 c mmol gvss h 76 mgcod gvss h the anaerobic p release to complete carbon uptake p c ratio during a typical cycle was 0 23 p mol c mol with an aerobic ammonium consumption rate of 0 8 mgn gvss h for biomass growth no nitrification fig 2 shows the concentrations of 1 3 pdo and orthophosphate in the bulk liquid at the end of the anaerobic phase versus the percentage of rbcod representing glycerol removed anaerobically coupled with increased anaerobic glycerol removal and the reduction of 1 3 pdo production p release was increased initially the leftover cod from the anaerobic phase was oxidized in the subsequent aerobic phase the aerobic conversion caused floc formation that was washed out once the settling time decreased to 5 minutes as the anaerobic production of 1 3 pdo decreased a sludge bed with smooth granules was formed fig 1 anaerobic 1 3 pdo formation decreased over time indicating formation of other fermentation products such as propionate the formation of a different fermentation product was also reflected in increasing p release likely due to uptake of formed propionate by paos 3 2 chemical transformations in a typical cycle fig 3 shows the anaerobic aerobic chemical transformations during a cycle in the anaerobic phase glycerol uptake p release pha accumulation and minor glycogen degradation occurred concurrently in the aerobic phase pha oxidation p uptake and glycogen replenishment were observed the ratio of glycogen degraded and pha accumulated to glycerol consumed in the anaerobic phase was 0 27 c molglycogen c molglycerol and 0 97 c molpha c molglycerol the average distribution of the pha content in the biomass at the end of the anaerobic phase was 54 phv and 46 ph2mv no phb was detected the mass balance performed over the anaerobic glycerol uptake pha production and glycogen degradation closed with a recovery of 77 and 81 for carbon and electron cod respectively the incomplete carbon and electron recovery was assumed to be due to co2 losses and anaerobic growth on the stored glycogen the anaerobic growth was calculated using the theoretical glycogen production of 0 5 molglycogen molglycerol based on atp calculations and the anaerobic biomass yield of 0 2 gcod gcod for propionibacterium sykes 1975 see discussion for the explanation of anaerobic glycogen production and growth 3 3 batch experiments to identify the products formed from glycerol fermentation in the anaerobic phase a batch test with excess glycerol 14 mmol l and an extended anaerobic period of 23 hours was conducted once glycerol was completely removed the formation of mainly propionate 74 molar basis along with minor amounts of lactate formate acetate valerate iso butyrate and 1 3 pdo was observed the mass balance performed over the entire anaerobic phase with glycerol uptake product formation pha production and glycogen degradation closed with a recovery of 98 and 106 for carbon and electron balance respectively the distribution of the pha at the end of the anaerobic phase was 9 phb 53 phv and 38 ph2mv further information regarding the batch experiment can be found in the supplementary material to compare the results obtained from the conversion of glycerol a batch test with propionate similar initial concentration was conducted fig 4 similar to the glycerol reactor propionate uptake p release pha accumulation and glycogen degradation occurred in the anaerobic phase in the aerobic phase pha oxidation p uptake and glycogen replenishment were observed the anaerobic balance performed over propionate uptake pha production and glycogen degradation closed with a recovery of 87 and 92 for carbon and electron cod balance the incomplete carbon and electron recovery was assumed to be due to co2 losses and possibly anaerobic growth the distribution of the pha content in the biomass at the end of the anaerobic phase was 60 phv and 40 ph2mv with no phb detection 3 4 atp nadh balances the atp nadh balances were made over the anaerobic phase to estimate substrate distribution among the fgaos and the paos we assumed a two step process fermentation of glycerol to propionate and glycogen by fgaos and propionate uptake by paos first an atp balance was made over the fgaos by assuming that the atp generated via propionate formation from glycerol is used for substrate uptake and possibly storage processes table 3 second the amount of glycogen hydrolyzed by the paos was estimated based on the nadh required for the synthesis of pha produced in the anaerobic phase table 4 third by taking the theoretical propionate yield and the estimated hydrolyzed glycogen into account an atp balance was made over the paos table 5 3 5 microbial community biomass samples from the reactor were frequently observed under the microscope to track the evolution of the microbial community during the experimental period visually two morphologically distinct types of microorganisms were observed fig 5 gram staining was performed as the first identification technique and for fish protocol adjustment tetrad shaped microorganisms were identified as gram positive and the microorganisms growing in pairs were gram negative the presence of storage compounds dark spots was only observed in the latter morphotype fig 5a gram staining showed a sparse presence of the tetrad shaped microorganisms fig 5d fish analysis of the biomass indicated the dominant presence of paos along with tetrad shaped microorganisms in the sludge sample fig 6 the presence of both gram positive and negative made hybridization difficult thus to visualize both types of microorganisms in one sample the protocol to hybridize the cells was adjusted and several strategies were tested to prevent gram negative cells disintegration and ensuring hybridization of gram positive cells permeabilization was not performed instead the hybridization duration was increased to 3 days other probes have also been tested to visualize the tetrad shaped microorganisms but no signal was observed to determine the composition of the microbial community a whole metagenome sequencing was performed genome information of the functional bins has been submitted to the ncbi database under the accession number prjna891235 among all identified taxonomies data not shown see supplementary material 2 of the most abundant genera matched microscopic observations namely tessaracoccus and ca accumulibacter fig 5 subsequently metaproteomics was performed that provided the expressed pathways these furthermore enabled to track the biochemical conversions of the respective genera first the metaproteome raw data were analysed using the complete metagenome constructed sequence database the 3 most abundant genera based on spectral counts and with 2 or 2 unique peptides per protein were ca accumulibacter tessaracoccus and micropruina with approx 55 7 and 5 respectively however other 30 were extremely low abundant taxa with only a few protein matches and very low protein sequence coverage therefore the database searching was repeated with uniprot genomes from only the 3 most abundant genera this as expected increased the coverage towards those taxa significantly considering this result the fact that most other taxonomies showed only a very small number of significant protein matches as well as the microscopy data we hypothesised that 90 of the protein biomass may originate from the 3 main microorganisms among this protein mass over 90 of the expressed proteins are associated with ca accumulibacter the remaining fraction was approximately 9 and 1 for tessaracoccus and micropruina collectively referred to as fgaos respectively the key anaerobic functioning metabolic pathways such as substrate uptake fermentation pha synthesis and polyphosphate metabolism in the genome of ca accumulibacter tessaracoccus and micropruina were analysed based on the expressed proteins involved in the reactions summarized in table 6 central metabolic pathways such as the tca cycle glycolysis and gluconeogenesis were not tracked as they are shared by the majority of microorganisms 4 discussions overall the experimental results have indicated that glycerol can be a good substrate for biological phosphorus removal and that good granulation can be achieved the observed microbial community is more complex when compared to traditional studied laboratory ebpr communities with acetate or propionate as substrate 4 1 anaerobic conversions as shown in fig 2 the system achieved a pseudo steady state after 4 months of operation which was likely due to a small competitive difference between different fermentative organisms leading to 1 3 pdo production in the initial months the conversion seemed to be a combination of a substrate fermentation and product uptake type of reaction fig 7 in stable conditions the main fermentation product was likely propionate since phv ph2mv were the synthesized storage polymers that corresponded to the uptake of propionate oehmen et al 2005 these results are also in agreement with similar studies that used glycerol as the carbon source for ebpr yang et al 2018 yuan et al 2010 where propionate was also identified as the main glycerol fermentation product additionally two batch tests indicated that propionate was likely the main intermediate product first in a batch test where an excess amount of glycerol was fed to the system to saturate the product utilizing organisms such as the paos propionate accumulation was observed unlike a normal cycle a minor amount of phb formation 0 3 c mmol gtss was observed towards the end of the anaerobic phase which might have been the result of redox imbalances phb is formed from the condensation of 2 acetyl coa molecules which can be derived from acetate part of the glycerol in the batch test was converted into acetate 7 mol fraction thus phb formation can be expected however in a normal cycle with lower glycerol concentration less acetate is produced which can explain absence of phb detection similarly a small amount of phb was also observed at the end of the anaerobic phase in a batch test with excess propionate data not shown see supplementary material this observation indicates that the duration of the anaerobic phase and or the initial concentration of carbon substrate may affect pha distribution second the direct uptake of propionate in a separate batch test fig 4 supports the argument that the microbial community was able to take up propionate as substrate the fraction of glycerol ending up as propionate was estimated based on an atp balance over the fgaos by inferring the balance half of the consumed glycerol is directly converted into propionate 0 5 molpropionate molglycerol similar to the yield reported by guerrero et al 2012 the other half is assumed to be used for the accumulation of storage compounds such as glycogen both tessaracoccus and micropruina are facultative anaerobes that can metabolize glycerol and accumulate glycogen maszenan et al 1999 therefore due to this potential occurrence of simultaneous accumulation and consumption of glycogen in the biomass the hydrolysed glycogen by the pao was estimated based on the amount of pha synthesized assuming that pha was only synthesised by the paos the estimated hydrolysed glycogen 3 3 c mmol and the measured value 3 2 c mmol did not differ significantly which supports the arguments for both simultaneous accumulation and consumption of glycogen during the anaerobic period and pha synthesis by the paos using the estimated amount of hydrolysed glycogen by the paos and the theoretical propionate yield an atp balance was made over the paos with 101 recovery as shown in table 5 the paos produced most of their atp requirement through poly p hydrolysis manifesting a typical pao metabolism the amount of atp required for vfa coa activation and transport of substrate into the cell was calculated based on pha measurements the amount of atp produced was calculated using the total p release assuming that p release was only due to pao activity and glycogen hydrolysis estimation of substrate utilization between paos and fgaos from the fermentation of anaerobically stored glycogen is further discussed below 4 2 propionate vs glycerol as substrate as shown in table 2 the p c ratio increased from 0 23 to 0 47 p mol c mol 51 when propionate was used as the substrate which is likely due to the direct uptake of propionate by the paos the pha yields however only increased from 0 97 c mol c molglycerol to 1 13 c mol c molpropionate 14 which is likely the result of higher glycogen degradation the extra p release during the batch experiment could be explained by the uncoupling effect of higher propionate concentration in the bulk liquid than the propionate generated from the fermentation of glycerol in a normal cycle the increased propionate concentration likely induces a shift in the energy metabolism of paos also known as the overflow metabolism which leads to higher substrate uptake rates that is reflected in higher poly p hydrolysis verhagen et al 2020 the extra atp generation was also observed when a balance was made over the paos during the propionate batch experiment with an excess of 49 corresponding well to the increased p c ratio data not shown moreover during cycle measurements a considerable secondary p release with a rate of 4 6 mgp gvss h was observed after complete glycerol uptake a secondary p release was also observed during the batch test with propionate at a similar rate of 4 8 mgp gvss h in literature the reported secondary p release rates vary between 0 6 3 5 mgp gvss h oehmen et al 2005 puig et al 2008 smolders et al 1995 and seem to be related to the maintenance needs of the microorganisms the higher rate observed in this study is an indication for the uptake of an extra substrate by the paos after all carbon substrate has been sequestered we postulate that fgaos have initially stored glycogen which was fermented after the depletion of glycerol with the released energy used for growth thus in the anaerobic phase a fraction of stored glycogen is fermented into products and used by paos which can be calculated using the secondary p release combining the propionate yield with the fraction of glycogen fermented into pao utilizable products indicated that 90 of the substrate was available for paos for the production of pha while the remaining fraction was used by the fgaos for biomass synthesis however the anaerobic biomass formation by fgaos is based on our postulation and thus requires further investigations 4 3 glycerol driven ebpr in the majority of ebpr studies simple substrates such as acetate and propionate have been used as carbon sources using vfas as substrate results in the selection of one group of microorganisms performing carbon uptake and storage with the energy and reducing power derived from poly p and glycogen hydrolysis respectively such an approach is based on a simple system that is convenient for metabolic studies but it fails to fully describe more complicated ebpr narratives in ebpr studies where a different substrate such as glycerol is used the fermentative organisms are traditionally thought to anaerobically generate the acetate and propionate for the pao population this consortium of fermentative organisms and substrate hoarders might also be a feature shared by similar ebpr systems where substrates other than glycerol are used for example tayà et al 2013 reported a successful methanol driven ebpr that was achieved by a syntrophic consortium of methanol fermenters and paos in our study a glycerol driven ebpr system was achieved with a microbial consortium of glycerol fermenters and paos over time p release and uptake improved as the anaerobic cod removal increased which could be due to a shift in the microbial population and the formation of a stable granular sludge bed with vfa producing microorganisms incomplete anaerobic cod uptake in the initial days of reactor operation was likely because a larger fraction of glycerol was fermented into 1 3 pdo that was not taken up by the paos fig 2 the produced 1 3 pdo was oxidized immediately in the aerobic phase which lead to some filamentous growth fig 1b generally rapid substrate uptake in the presence of an electron acceptor e g oxygen could lead to filamentous growth on the outer fraction of granules beun et al 1999 the slow replacement of the 1 3 pdo fermentative bacteria by propionate fermentative bacteria indicates that the competitive difference between the both is small it seemed that lowering the srt control to 12 days after day 65 helped to outcompete the 1 3 pdo fermentation process this srt control could be a potentially practical way to select for good conditions in full scale reactors where glycerol is an important substrate for ebpr processes 4 4 substrate storing fermentative anaerobes many microorganisms are capable of accumulating internal storage compounds van loosdrecht et al 1997 the storage in aerobic feast famine processes and in anaerobic aerobic processes have been well described anaerobic feast famine conditions and substrate storage got only limited attention in the literature for instance shimada et al 2007 showed the accumulation and degradation of trehalose by a mixed microbial culture growing in a sequencing batch reactor converting glucose into methane recently in a similar study where sucrose rich synthetic wastewater was used anaerobic accumulation of glycogen and glycogen like compounds was reported ni et al 2015 in this study we observed the fermentation of glycerol and accumulation of glycogen at the end of the anaerobic phase presumably by the fgaos the anaerobic uptake of glycerol could lead to the accumulation of storage compounds not pha by tessaracoccus maszenan et al 1999 the degree of this accumulation can partly be explained by the mechanism by which microorganisms derive their energy from the fermentation process for instance several catabolic pathways exist in the conversion of glycerol into propionate a common pathway found predominantly in propionibacterium is the wood werkman cycle which involves a transcarboxylase transferring a carboxyl group from methylmalonyl coa to pyruvate to generate propionyl coa gonzalez garcia et al 2017 as shown in table 6 the transcarboxylase enzymes are also expressed in the genome of tessaracoccus this cycle conserves an atp which is otherwise lost to the fixation of co2 to oxaloacetate and thus the energy can be used for growth and storage processes likely half of the glycerol is fermented to propionate while the other half is stored as glycogen or poly glucose when glycerol is depleted the fgaos start to grow fermentative on the stored compound resulting in the production of vfas such as propionate in the bulk liquid that is subsequently taken up by the paos in line with the accumulation of propionate observed in a batch experiment after glycerol depletion the formation of propionate from glucose fermentation using granular sludge was also reported by shimada et al 2007 thus it is likely that the stored glycogen was also fermented into propionate 4 5 microbial community a metabolic pathway for glycerol conversion was hypothesised based on the metaproteome data obtained for the microbial community fig 8 although ca accumulibacter possesses a diverse metabolic potential these microorganisms seem to lack the enzymatic machinery required for uptake and conversion of glycerol table 6 glycerol uptake facilitator glpf and glycerol kinase glpk two proteins involved in the transport of glycerol into cellular metabolism voegele et al 1993 were observed in the genome of tessaracoccus and micropruina both of these organisms belong to the propionibactericeae family which is one of the suborders of the class actinobacteria as the name suggests the production of propionic acid is the hallmark of propionibacteria stackebrandt et al 2006 and illustrated in a study by barbirato et al 1997 where propionate production from glycerol fermentation by different strains of propionibacterium was reported interestingly these microorganisms have been also commonly observed in activated sludge samples with phosphorus removal capabilities around the world nielsen et al 2019 genomic analysis of tessaracoccus and micropruina showed that these organisms lack pha synthase phac a key enzyme encoding for pha synthesis zher neoh et al 2022 in an earlier study by maszenan et al 1999 absence of poly p and pha granules in tessaracoccus was also reported as these compounds were not observed when stained by methylene blue and nile blue respectively however staining methods are prone to error due to false positive results and provide limited information about the potential of enzymatic machinery of the organisms here through proteomics we have investigated the presence or absence of storage compounds by searching for the existence of key enzymatic reactions in each organism tessaracoccus have the capacity to produce poly glucose but pha production proteins were not identified although poly p granules were not observed in tessaracoccus and micropruina they seem to possess some of the enzymes involved in poly p metabolism indicated by the presence of polyphosphate kinase ppk these microorganisms can likely accumulate poly p but are not able to utilize it for energy generation since amp phosphotransferase pap is absent further study on the capabilities of these fgaos in the future could elucidate their full potential 4 6 practical implications stable granulation by pao dominated microbial community can be achieved by steering glycerol fermentation to propionate over 1 3 propanediol potentially the srt can be a control parameter the dominance of polyphosphate accumulating organisms in the culture indicates that the extracellular matrix is likely similar to those produced using municipal wastewater indicating that glycerol based sludge might also be used to extract the kaumera bio polymers glycerol as a relatively cheap carbon source could be dosed to wastewater treatment plants to overcome carbon deficiency 5 conclusion successful and stable granulation with glycerol as the sole carbon source was shown glycerol driven ebpr was achieved by a microbial consortium of glycerol fermenters and paos lack of glpf glpd and glpk in the genome of ca accumulibacter implied that these organisms are likely not able to directly utilize glycerol over 90 of the expressed proteins in glycerol based aerobic granular sludge belonged to ca accumulibacter declaration of

15314,glycerol is abundantly present in wastewater from industries such as biodiesel production facilities glycerol is also a potential carbon source for microbes that are involved in wastewater nutrient removal processes the conversion of glycerol in biological phosphorus removal of aerobic granular sludge processes has not been explored to date the current study describes glycerol utilization by aerobic granular sludge and enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr robust granules with good phosphorus removal capabilities were formed in an aerobic granular sludge sequencing batch reactor fed with glycerol the interaction between the fermentative conversion of glycerol and product uptake by polyphosphate accumulating organisms pao was studied using stoichiometric and microbial community analysis metagenomic metaproteomic and microscopic analysis identified a community dominated by actinobacteria tessaracoccus and micropruina and a typical pao known as ca accumulibacter glycerol uptake facilitator glpf and glycerol kinase glpk two proteins involved in the transport of glycerol into the cellular metabolism were only observed in the genome of the actinobacteria the anaerobic conversion appeared to be a combination of a substrate fermentation and product uptake type reaction initially glycerol fermentation led mainly to the production of 1 3 propanediol 1 3 pdo which was not taken up under anaerobic conditions despite the aerobic conversion of 1 3 pdo stable granulation was observed over time 1 3 pdo production decreased and complete anaerobic cod uptake was observed the results demonstrate that glycerol containing wastewater can effectively be treated by the aerobic granular sludge process and that fermentative and polyphosphate accumulating organisms can form a food chain in glycerol based ebpr processes graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords ebpr pao actinobacteria consortium glycerol fermentative organisms data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction aerobic granular sludge ags is a state of the art biological wastewater treatment technology that performs simultaneous carbon nitrogen and phosphorus removal de kreuk et al 2007 pronk et al 2015 several factors distinguish ags from conventional activated sludge systems for instance due to the compact structure and smooth surface of the granules settling occurs rapidly and the redox gradient across the biofilm accommodates simultaneous conversions to take place within the granules bengtsson et al 2018 de bruin et al 2004 de kreuk and van loosdrecht 2006 these features reduce the treatment time significantly enhance the solid liquid separation and eliminate the need for multiple reactor compartments pronk et al 2015 the formation of aerobic granules was first demonstrated in 1998 and applying certain environmental pressures was reported to be key in achieving granules heijnen and van loosdrecht 1998 the underlying mechanisms for granulation and achieving a system with stable performance are extensively studied and described in the literature etterer and wilderer 2001 yu liu et al 2005 morgenroth et al 1997 picioreanu et al 1997 van dijk et al 2022 winkler et al 2013 several parameters are important for obtaining stable and smooth granules of prime importance is the selection of slow growing microorganisms such as polyphosphate accumulating organisms pao and glycogen accumulating organisms gao that form dense smooth granules de kreuk and van loosdrecht 2004 when biodegradable organic carbon usually volatile fatty acids vfa is supplied to the system under anaerobic conditions it is converted by certain microorganisms paos for instance into storage polymers known as poly hydroxy alkanoates pha oehmen et al 2005 microorganisms growing on storage polymers have a slower growth rate than heterotrophic bacteria growing on readily biodegradable organic carbon in the presence of an electron acceptor van loosdrecht et al 1997 generally slow growing microorganisms such as methanogens nitrifiers anammox paos gaos form a more compact structure and smoother granular biomass than fast growing microorganisms in the subsequent aerobic phase the stored organic carbon is oxidized to provide energy for the formation of biomass and replenishment of the intracellular polymer pool oehmen et al 2007 tarayre et al 2016 similarity in operational parameters such as anaerobic aerobic cycles in both ags and enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr is also a common link between the two system which selects organisms that are important for the successful application of these technologies ebpr is an environmentally sustainable and economically competitive technology bunce et al 2018 ketchum et al 1987 the technology is based on the enrichment of the sludge with paos that can excessively accumulate phosphorus p in the form of poly phosphate poly p after which p removal is achieved through excess sludge discharge smolders et al 1994 however the stability of these systems depends on various factors such as the carbon source which act as the electron donor guerrero et al 2011 wei et al 2014 in literature an overwhelming amount of information exists on ebpr with vfas mainly acetate and propionate as the carbon source bunce et al 2018 oehmen et al 2007 oehmen et al 2005 oehmen d et al 2005 pijuan et al 2004 pijuan et al 2005 smolders et al 1994 however when other sources of carbon such as alcohol or sugars are used these systems manifest different behaviours for instance a period of adaptation is required by paos when ethanol is used puig et al 2008 whereas methanol can be used via a syntrophic consortium between acetogens and paos tayà et al 2013 in a study by begum and batista 2012 the authors reported ebpr deterioration due to the proliferation of gaos over paos with glucose as substrate in addition to traditional paos the presence of fermentative microorganisms in dynamic feast famine conditions that can perform fermentation and anaerobically accumulate storage compounds without cycling polyphosphate has been reported carucci et al 1999 mcilroy et al 2018 these fermentative gaos fgao play a potentially important role in ebpr systems since they can convert the substrate into pao utilizable product enabling pao proliferation or they can compete for substrate uptake compromising the phosphorus removal efficiency of the system therefore the carbon source in the wastewater plays a decisive role in the success of the ebpr process glycerol is a compound that can be dominant in a variety of industrial wastewaters such as biodiesel and epoxy resin production pinto and de araujo mota 2014 for instance the production of every 10 kilograms of biodiesel generates about 1 kilogram of glycerol plácido and capareda 2016 and the wastewater generated from the epoxy resin production facilities contain a significant amount of glycerol due to its abundance and relatively low price the use of glycerol has attracted the attention of different engineering communities for various applications lima et al 2021 in wastewater treatment glycerol has been reported to be a suitable source of carbon for the removal of nitrogen and phosphorus coats et al 2015 smyk and ignatowicz 2017 yuan et al 2010 however the conversion of glycerol in ags ebpr processes or the formation of ags using glycerol has not been studied in detail the anaerobic conversion of glycerol by both mixed and pure microbial cultures has been extensively studied over the years barbirato et al 1995 gupta et al 2009 katarzyna leja et al 2011 temudo et al 2008 and 1 3 propanediol 1 3 pdo is the most common reported product among the products of glycerol fermentation in literature clomburg and gonzalez 2013 moscoviz et al 2016 several studies have also reported the production of propionate from the fermentation of glycerol using mixed microbial cultures chen et al 2016 yuan et al 2010 in ebpr systems glycerol could directly be taken up by paos but also potentially fermented to a variety of products that can subsequently be utilized by the paos or only be converted under aerobic conditions the latter process could potentially harm the granulation process as fast aerobic growth would lead to less favourable sludge morphologies pronk et

nadh balances were made for each organism the balance was made based on the assumption 1 that glycerol is anaerobically converted to propionate and glycogen and that the produced propionate is subsequently taken up by the pao community to synthesize pha verified via mass balances and 2 the majority of the community was dominated by paos using fish and proteomics indicating minor contribution to substrate distribution by other potential communities see discussions for further elaborations the parameters used in the calculations to estimate propionate production are listed through equations 3 6 derived from principles of biochemistry nelson et al 2000 note that the degree of reduction of glycerol and propionate are the same and thus the nadh balance is a conserved

for propionate uptake and pha synthesis through poly p and glycogen hydrolysis the latter process also generates reducing equivalents i e nadh required for the maintenance of redox balance within the cell 3 results 3 1 reactor operation granular sludge from a pilot municipal wastewater treatment plant wwtp in the netherlands performing ebpr was used to inoculate the reactor after a few weeks of reactor operation and the formation of new biomass the sludge colour changed from dark brown to light brown orange the settling time was step wise decreased from 20 to 5 minutes within 4 weeks of operation with the development of granular sludge the effluent became clearer and the flocculent biomass disappeared from the system once granular biomass formation stabilized from day 65 onwards a solids retention time srt of 12 days was maintained by manual sludge removal and solids washout via the effluent after the reactor reached a pseudo steady state an average sludge volume index svi5 of 33 4 ml g was obtained from the sludge settled bed in the reactor after 5 minutes of settling the tss and vss concentration in the reactor stabilized at an average of 7 3 and 5 5 g l i e 24 ash content respectively once a pseudo steady state was achieved day 126 onwards an average p release of 64 3 mg l was obtained with a specific p release and uptake rate of 10 9 and 16 3 mgp gvss h respectively pseudo steady state was defined on the basis of stable conversion of substrates and phosphate throughout the cycles the anaerobic glycerol uptake rate was 2 c mmol gvss h 76 mgcod gvss h the anaerobic p release to complete carbon uptake p c ratio during a typical cycle was 0 23 p mol c mol with an aerobic ammonium consumption rate of 0 8 mgn gvss h for biomass growth no nitrification fig 2 shows the concentrations of 1 3 pdo and orthophosphate in the bulk liquid at the end of the anaerobic phase versus the percentage of rbcod representing glycerol removed anaerobically coupled with increased anaerobic glycerol removal and the reduction of 1 3 pdo production p release was increased initially the leftover cod from the anaerobic phase was oxidized in the subsequent aerobic phase the aerobic conversion caused floc formation that was washed out once the settling time decreased to 5 minutes as the anaerobic production of 1 3 pdo decreased a sludge bed with smooth granules was formed fig 1 anaerobic 1 3 pdo formation decreased over time indicating formation of other fermentation products such as propionate the formation of a different fermentation product was also reflected in increasing p release likely due to uptake of formed propionate by paos 3 2 chemical transformations in a typical cycle fig 3 shows the anaerobic aerobic chemical transformations during a cycle in the anaerobic phase glycerol uptake p release pha accumulation and minor glycogen degradation occurred concurrently in the aerobic phase pha oxidation p uptake and glycogen replenishment were observed the ratio of glycogen degraded and pha accumulated to glycerol consumed in the anaerobic phase was 0 27 c molglycogen c molglycerol and 0 97 c molpha c molglycerol the average distribution of the pha content in the biomass at the end of the anaerobic phase was 54 phv and 46 ph2mv no phb was detected the mass balance performed over the anaerobic glycerol uptake pha production and glycogen degradation closed with a recovery of 77 and 81 for carbon and electron cod respectively the incomplete carbon and electron recovery was assumed to be due to co2 losses and anaerobic growth on the stored glycogen the anaerobic growth was calculated using the theoretical glycogen production of 0 5 molglycogen molglycerol based on atp calculations and the anaerobic biomass yield of 0 2 gcod gcod for propionibacterium sykes 1975 see discussion for the explanation of anaerobic glycogen production and growth 3 3 batch experiments to identify the products formed from glycerol fermentation in the anaerobic phase a batch test with excess glycerol 14 mmol l and an extended anaerobic period of 23 hours was conducted once glycerol was completely removed the formation of mainly propionate 74 molar basis along with minor amounts of lactate formate acetate valerate iso butyrate and 1 3 pdo was observed the mass balance performed over the entire anaerobic phase with glycerol uptake product formation pha production and glycogen degradation closed with a recovery of 98 and 106 for carbon and electron balance respectively the distribution of the pha at the end of the anaerobic phase was 9 phb 53 phv and 38 ph2mv further information regarding the batch experiment can be found in the supplementary material to compare the results obtained from the conversion of glycerol a batch test with propionate similar initial concentration was conducted fig 4 similar to the glycerol reactor propionate uptake p release pha accumulation and glycogen degradation occurred in the anaerobic phase in the aerobic phase pha oxidation p uptake and glycogen replenishment were observed the anaerobic balance performed over propionate uptake pha production and glycogen degradation closed with a recovery of 87 and 92 for carbon and electron cod balance the incomplete carbon and electron recovery was assumed to be due to co2 losses and possibly anaerobic growth the distribution of the pha content in the biomass at the end of the anaerobic phase was 60 phv and 40 ph2mv with no phb detection 3 4 atp nadh balances the atp nadh balances were made over the anaerobic phase to estimate substrate distribution among the fgaos and the paos we assumed a two step process fermentation of glycerol to propionate and glycogen by fgaos and propionate uptake by paos first an atp balance was made over the fgaos by assuming that the atp generated via propionate formation from glycerol is used for substrate uptake and possibly storage processes table 3 second the amount of glycogen hydrolyzed by the paos was estimated based on the nadh required for the synthesis of pha produced in the anaerobic phase table 4 third by taking the theoretical propionate yield and the estimated hydrolyzed glycogen into account an atp balance was made over the paos table 5 3 5 microbial community biomass samples from the reactor were frequently observed under the microscope to track the evolution of the microbial community during the experimental period visually two morphologically distinct types of microorganisms were observed fig 5 gram staining was performed as the first identification technique and for fish protocol adjustment tetrad shaped microorganisms were identified as gram positive and the microorganisms growing in pairs were gram negative the presence of storage compounds dark spots was only observed in the latter morphotype fig 5a gram staining showed a sparse presence of the tetrad shaped microorganisms fig 5d fish analysis of the biomass indicated the dominant presence of paos along with tetrad shaped microorganisms in the sludge sample fig 6 the presence of both gram positive and negative made hybridization difficult thus to visualize both types of microorganisms in one sample the protocol to hybridize the cells was adjusted and several strategies were tested to prevent gram negative cells disintegration and ensuring hybridization of gram positive cells permeabilization was not performed instead the hybridization duration was increased to 3 days other probes have also been tested to visualize the tetrad shaped microorganisms but no signal was observed to determine the composition of the microbial community a whole metagenome sequencing was performed genome information of the functional bins has been submitted to the ncbi database under the accession number prjna891235 among all identified taxonomies data not shown see supplementary material 2 of the most abundant genera matched microscopic observations namely tessaracoccus and ca accumulibacter fig 5 subsequently metaproteomics was performed that provided the expressed pathways these furthermore enabled to track the biochemical conversions of the respective genera first the metaproteome raw data were analysed using the complete metagenome constructed sequence database the 3 most abundant genera based on spectral counts and with 2 or 2 unique peptides per protein were ca accumulibacter tessaracoccus and micropruina with approx 55 7 and 5 respectively however other 30 were extremely low abundant taxa with only a few protein matches and very low protein sequence coverage therefore the database searching was repeated with uniprot genomes from only the 3 most abundant genera this as expected increased the coverage towards those taxa significantly considering this result the fact that most other taxonomies showed only a very small number of significant protein matches as well as the microscopy data we hypothesised that 90 of the protein biomass may originate from the 3 main microorganisms among this protein mass over 90 of the expressed proteins are associated with ca accumulibacter the remaining fraction was approximately 9 and 1 for tessaracoccus and micropruina collectively referred to as fgaos respectively the key anaerobic functioning metabolic pathways such as substrate uptake fermentation pha synthesis and polyphosphate metabolism in the genome of ca accumulibacter tessaracoccus and micropruina were analysed based on the expressed proteins involved in the reactions summarized in table 6 central metabolic pathways such as the tca cycle glycolysis and gluconeogenesis were not tracked as they are shared by the majority of microorganisms 4 discussions overall the experimental results have indicated that glycerol can be a good substrate for biological phosphorus removal and that good granulation can be achieved the observed microbial community is more complex when compared to traditional studied laboratory ebpr communities with acetate or propionate as substrate 4 1 anaerobic conversions as shown in fig 2 the system achieved a pseudo steady state after 4 months of operation which was likely due to a small competitive difference between different fermentative organisms leading to 1 3 pdo production in the initial months the conversion seemed to be a combination of a substrate fermentation and product uptake type of reaction fig 7 in stable conditions the main fermentation product was likely propionate since phv ph2mv were the synthesized storage polymers that corresponded to the uptake of propionate oehmen et al 2005 these results are also in agreement with similar studies that used glycerol as the carbon source for ebpr yang et al 2018 yuan et al 2010 where propionate was also identified as the main glycerol fermentation product additionally two batch tests indicated that propionate was likely the main intermediate product first in a batch test where an excess amount of glycerol was fed to the system to saturate the product utilizing organisms such as the paos propionate accumulation was observed unlike a normal cycle a minor amount of phb formation 0 3 c mmol gtss was observed towards the end of the anaerobic phase which might have been the result of redox imbalances phb is formed from the condensation of 2 acetyl coa molecules which can be derived from acetate part of the glycerol in the batch test was converted into acetate 7 mol fraction thus phb formation can be expected however in a normal cycle with lower glycerol concentration less acetate is produced which can explain absence of phb detection similarly a small amount of phb was also observed at the end of the anaerobic phase in a batch test with excess propionate data not shown see supplementary material this observation indicates that the duration of the anaerobic phase and or the initial concentration of carbon substrate may affect pha distribution second the direct uptake of propionate in a separate batch test fig 4 supports the argument that the microbial community was able to take up propionate as substrate the fraction of glycerol ending up as propionate was estimated based on an atp balance over the fgaos by inferring the balance half of the consumed glycerol is directly converted into propionate 0 5 molpropionate molglycerol similar to the yield reported by guerrero et al 2012 the other half is assumed to be used for the accumulation of storage compounds such as glycogen both tessaracoccus and micropruina are facultative anaerobes that can metabolize glycerol and accumulate glycogen maszenan et al 1999 therefore due to this potential occurrence of simultaneous accumulation and consumption of glycogen in the biomass the hydrolysed glycogen by the pao was estimated based on the amount of pha synthesized assuming that pha was only synthesised by the paos the estimated hydrolysed glycogen 3 3 c mmol and the measured value 3 2 c mmol did not differ significantly which supports the arguments for both simultaneous accumulation and consumption of glycogen during the anaerobic period and pha synthesis by the paos using the estimated amount of hydrolysed glycogen by the paos and the theoretical propionate yield an atp balance was made over the paos with 101 recovery as shown in table 5 the paos produced most of their atp requirement through poly p hydrolysis manifesting a typical pao metabolism the amount of atp required for vfa coa activation and transport of substrate into the cell was calculated based on pha measurements the amount of atp produced was calculated using the total p release assuming that p release was only due to pao activity and glycogen hydrolysis estimation of substrate utilization between paos and fgaos from the fermentation of anaerobically stored glycogen is further discussed below 4 2 propionate vs glycerol as substrate as shown in table 2 the p c ratio increased from 0 23 to 0 47 p mol c mol 51 when propionate was used as the substrate which is likely due to the direct uptake of propionate by the paos the pha yields however only increased from 0 97 c mol c molglycerol to 1 13 c mol c molpropionate 14 which is likely the result of higher glycogen degradation the extra p release during the batch experiment could be explained by the uncoupling effect of higher propionate concentration in the bulk liquid than the propionate generated from the fermentation of glycerol in a normal cycle the increased propionate concentration likely induces a shift in the energy metabolism of paos also known as the overflow metabolism which leads to higher substrate uptake rates that is reflected in higher poly p hydrolysis verhagen et al 2020 the extra atp generation was also observed when a balance was made over the paos during the propionate batch experiment with an excess of 49 corresponding well to the increased p c ratio data not shown moreover during cycle measurements a considerable secondary p release with a rate of 4 6 mgp gvss h was observed after complete glycerol uptake a secondary p release was also observed during the batch test with propionate at a similar rate of 4 8 mgp gvss h in literature the reported secondary p release rates vary between 0 6 3 5 mgp gvss h oehmen et al 2005 puig et al 2008 smolders et al 1995 and seem to be related to the maintenance needs of the microorganisms the higher rate observed in this study is an indication for the uptake of an extra substrate by the paos after all carbon substrate has been sequestered we postulate that fgaos have initially stored glycogen which was fermented after the depletion of glycerol with the released energy used for growth thus in the anaerobic phase a fraction of stored glycogen is fermented into products and used by paos which can be calculated using the secondary p release combining the propionate yield with the fraction of glycogen fermented into pao utilizable products indicated that 90 of the substrate was available for paos for the production of pha while the remaining fraction was used by the fgaos for biomass synthesis however the anaerobic biomass formation by fgaos is based on our postulation and thus requires further investigations 4 3 glycerol driven ebpr in the majority of ebpr studies simple substrates such as acetate and propionate have been used as carbon sources using vfas as substrate results in the selection of one group of microorganisms performing carbon uptake and storage with the energy and reducing power derived from poly p and glycogen hydrolysis respectively such an approach is based on a simple system that is convenient for metabolic studies but it fails to fully describe more complicated ebpr narratives in ebpr studies where a different substrate such as glycerol is used the fermentative organisms are traditionally thought to anaerobically generate the acetate and propionate for the pao population this consortium of fermentative organisms and substrate hoarders might also be a feature shared by similar ebpr systems where substrates other than glycerol are used for example tayà et al 2013 reported a successful methanol driven ebpr that was achieved by a syntrophic consortium of methanol fermenters and paos in our study a glycerol driven ebpr system was achieved with a microbial consortium of glycerol fermenters and paos over time p release and uptake improved as the anaerobic cod removal increased which could be due to a shift in the microbial population and the formation of a stable granular sludge bed with vfa producing microorganisms incomplete anaerobic cod uptake in the initial days of reactor operation was likely because a larger fraction of glycerol was fermented into 1 3 pdo that was not taken up by the paos fig 2 the produced 1 3 pdo was oxidized immediately in the aerobic phase which lead to some filamentous growth fig 1b generally rapid substrate uptake in the presence of an electron acceptor e g oxygen could lead to filamentous growth on the outer fraction of granules beun et al 1999 the slow replacement of the 1 3 pdo fermentative bacteria by propionate fermentative bacteria indicates that the competitive difference between the both is small it seemed that lowering the srt control to 12 days after day 65 helped to outcompete the 1 3 pdo fermentation process this srt control could be a potentially practical way to select for good conditions in full scale reactors where glycerol is an important substrate for ebpr processes 4 4 substrate storing fermentative anaerobes many microorganisms are capable of accumulating internal storage compounds van loosdrecht et al 1997 the storage in aerobic feast famine processes and in anaerobic aerobic processes have been well described anaerobic feast famine conditions and substrate storage got only limited attention in the literature for instance shimada et al 2007 showed the accumulation and degradation of trehalose by a mixed microbial culture growing in a sequencing batch reactor converting glucose into methane recently in a similar study where sucrose rich synthetic wastewater was used anaerobic accumulation of glycogen and glycogen like compounds was reported ni et al 2015 in this study we observed the fermentation of glycerol and accumulation of glycogen at the end of the anaerobic phase presumably by the fgaos the anaerobic uptake of glycerol could lead to the accumulation of storage compounds not pha by tessaracoccus maszenan et al 1999 the degree of this accumulation can partly be explained by the mechanism by which microorganisms derive their energy from the fermentation process for instance several catabolic pathways exist in the conversion of glycerol into propionate a common pathway found predominantly in propionibacterium is the wood werkman cycle which involves a transcarboxylase transferring a carboxyl group from methylmalonyl coa to pyruvate to generate propionyl coa gonzalez garcia et al 2017 as shown in table 6 the transcarboxylase enzymes are also expressed in the genome of tessaracoccus this cycle conserves an atp which is otherwise lost to the fixation of co2 to oxaloacetate and thus the energy can be used for growth and storage processes likely half of the glycerol is fermented to propionate while the other half is stored as glycogen or poly glucose when glycerol is depleted the fgaos start to grow fermentative on the stored compound resulting in the production of vfas such as propionate in the bulk liquid that is subsequently taken up by the paos in line with the accumulation of propionate observed in a batch experiment after glycerol depletion the formation of propionate from glucose fermentation using granular sludge was also reported by shimada et al 2007 thus it is likely that the stored glycogen was also fermented into propionate 4 5 microbial community a metabolic pathway for glycerol conversion was hypothesised based on the metaproteome data obtained for the microbial community fig 8 although ca accumulibacter possesses a diverse metabolic potential these microorganisms seem to lack the enzymatic machinery required for uptake and conversion of glycerol table 6 glycerol uptake facilitator glpf and glycerol kinase glpk two proteins involved in the transport of glycerol into cellular metabolism voegele et al 1993 were observed in the genome of tessaracoccus and micropruina both of these organisms belong to the propionibactericeae family which is one of the suborders of the class actinobacteria as the name suggests the production of propionic acid is the hallmark of propionibacteria stackebrandt et al 2006 and illustrated in a study by barbirato et al 1997 where propionate production from glycerol fermentation by different strains of propionibacterium was reported interestingly these microorganisms have been also commonly observed in activated sludge samples with phosphorus removal capabilities around the world nielsen et al 2019 genomic analysis of tessaracoccus and micropruina showed that these organisms lack pha synthase phac a key enzyme encoding for pha synthesis zher neoh et al 2022 in an earlier study by maszenan et al 1999 absence of poly p and pha granules in tessaracoccus was also reported as these compounds were not observed when stained by methylene blue and nile blue respectively however staining methods are prone to error due to false positive results and provide limited information about the potential of enzymatic machinery of the organisms here through proteomics we have investigated the presence or absence of storage compounds by searching for the existence of key enzymatic reactions in each organism tessaracoccus have the capacity to produce poly glucose but pha production proteins were not identified although poly p granules were not observed in tessaracoccus and micropruina they seem to possess some of the enzymes involved in poly p metabolism indicated by the presence of polyphosphate kinase ppk these microorganisms can likely accumulate poly p but are not able to utilize it for energy generation since amp phosphotransferase pap is absent further study on the capabilities of these fgaos in the future could elucidate their full potential 4 6 practical implications stable granulation by pao dominated microbial community can be achieved by steering glycerol fermentation to propionate over 1 3 propanediol potentially the srt can be a control parameter the dominance of polyphosphate accumulating organisms in the culture indicates that the extracellular matrix is likely similar to those produced using municipal wastewater indicating that glycerol based sludge might also be used to extract the kaumera bio polymers glycerol as a relatively cheap carbon source could be dosed to wastewater treatment plants to overcome carbon deficiency 5 conclusion successful and stable granulation with glycerol as the sole carbon source was shown glycerol driven ebpr was achieved by a microbial consortium of glycerol fermenters and paos lack of glpf glpd and glpk in the genome of ca accumulibacter implied that these organisms are likely not able to directly utilize glycerol over 90 of the expressed proteins in glycerol based aerobic granular sludge belonged to ca accumulibacter declaration of
