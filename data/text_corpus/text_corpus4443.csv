22215,the j lay method is a comparatively feasible way to install offshore pipelines with larger diameter and heavier submerged weight in deepwater and ultra deepwater area in this paper a full finite element model fem for deepwater j lay systems was established using the software orcaflex to study the actual dynamic pipelay effects which are mainly caused by hydrodynamic forces and pipelay vessel motions meanwhile a nonlinear hysteretic soil model was employed to characterise the vertical pipe seabed interactions and the modified coulomb friction model was applied to simulate the lateral pipe seabed interactions an explanatory example about a steel pipeline being installed to the seabed of 1500 m water depth in the lw3 1 gas field of south china sea was introduced to carry out the numerical analysis the dynamic behaviour of the j lay pipeline in terms of top effective tension bending moment seabed resistance and pipeline embedment in the touchdown zone tdz was quantitatively evaluated the comparisons between static and dynamic results of j lay pipelines and between j lay and s lay dynamic results with identical pipelay conditions except for the departure points were carried out respectively in which the more noticeable dynamic effects are observed for deepwater j lay pipelines keywords offshore pipeline dynamic behaviour j lay pipe seabed interaction pipelay vessel 1 introduction s lay and j lay are currently the most commonly used techniques for pipeline installations in deepwater and ultra deepwater area in view of the pipelay characteristics of deepwater s lay method the pipeline has to undergo a large plastic deformation in the upper curved part and produce the detrimental residual stress in order to compensate for this deficiency the tensioning capacity of tensioners need be significantly enhanced which generally results in a greater horizontal thrust supplied by the pipelay vessel and limits the applicable water depth of s lay li et al 2008 gong et al 2014 bruschi et al 2015 gong and xu 2016 in the j lay method as shown in fig 1 the pipeline departs from the pipelay system in a nearly vertical way and is only bent once from the welding and testing ramp to the seabed which characterises a j shaped curve in comparison with the conventional s lay method the j lay method can not only drastically reduce the required horizontal tension but also remarkably shorten the distance between the touchdown point tdp of the pipeline and the pipelay vessel which facilitate the dynamic positioning systems of the pipelay vessel and conveniently control the overall stability of the vessel thus the j lay technique is deemed to be the most suitable method especially for ultra deepwater pipeline installations kashani and young 2005 for the purpose of ensuring the safety of deepwater j lay systems it is extremely necessary to sufficiently understand the mechanical behaviour of the pipelines in the process of the pipelay operations in recent years many researchers have addressed the deepwater j lay analysis to obtain the stress and strain responses of the pipeline using analytical solutions and numerical simulations lenci and callegari 2005 combined the classical catenary theory with the winkler elastic foundation beam model to comparatively analyse the mechanical behaviour of the j lay pipeline similarly wang et al 2010 put forward a simplified numerical model to analyse the j lay problems and studied the influence of current velocity water depth top inclination angle and seabed stiffness on the axial force and bending moment of the pipeline then wang et al 2012 used this numerical model to further investigate the influence of the mechanical property of seabed soil on the configuration embedment and internal force of j lay pipeline in the tdz furthermore wang et al 2013 applied the singular perturbation approach to solve the nonlinear governing differential equation of j lay pipeline then they analysed the influence of the unit weight and flexural stiffness of the pipe pipelay tower angle water depth and seabed slope on the axial force and bending moment of the pipeline in addition li et al 2015 employed the large deflection beam theory and the winkler elastic foundation beam model to develop a simple mechanical model of j lay pipeline and the high order shear effect was taken into consideration to improve the computational accuracy in this model based upon the catenary and large deflection beam theory kang et al 2015 proposed the sectional mechanics model to assess the sensitivity of wet weight stiffness and top axial tension on j lay steel catenary risers lately trapper 2019 applied minimum total potential energy principle to develop a simple numerical model for the structural analysis of pipeline configurations during j lay and s lay installations and evaluated the effects of departure angle top tension water depth and seabed stiffness on the whole pipeline configuration and seabed resistance the dynamic laying effects of the pipeline during deepwater installations induced by hydrodynamic forces and vessel motions should be fully taken into consideration which will directly dominate the feasibility of deepwater pipelay operations based upon the reissner simo beam theory yazdchi and crisfield 2002 developed a 3d finite element model considering the hydrodynamic forces to perform the nonlinear analyses of flexible pipeline and j lay riser then callegari et al 2003 investigated the static and dynamic behaviour of j lay pipelines using the finite difference method to find out the significant responses of bending moment and deformation in the touchdown zone jensen et al 2010 developed a 3d beam model of a suspended pipe string for j lay pipeline installations in which the effects of the hydrodynamic forces restoring forces and seabed interactions were added and the pipelay vessel dynamics were regarded as an upper boundary condition subsequently szczotka 2011 proposed a rigid finite element model to quickly simulate the dynamic responses of j lay pipelines in which material nonlinearity hydrodynamic forces wave and sea current loads were taken into consideration using the software orcaflex senthil and selvam 2015 established a simplified numerical model of j lay pipelines to evaluate the dynamic effects of effective tension bending moment and stress in addition zan et al 2016a proposed a real time dynamic analysis model to simulate the mechanical behaviour of j lay pipelines and analysed the effects of sea current and vessel motions on top tension and configuration of the pipelines then zan et al 2016b applied the real time numerical model to investigate the influences of the outer diameter of the pipe the mudline shear strength and strength gradient of the seabed soil on the j lay solution additionally sun et al 2018 performed a series of model tests for a light j lay vessel and coupled dynamic analysis for j lay operation and evaluated the light j lay vessel motion behaviour and the dynamic loads and stresses of the pipeline in a specified sea state kwon et al 2018 carried out a series of model tests on a rigid pipe installation using j lay method and they concluded that the dynamic response of the top tension for a rigid pipe was strongly affected by the vessel motion and the suspended pipe length recently kim and kim 2019 employed fem and minimum energy principle to establish an efficient linearised dynamic analysis method for j lay and s lay pipeline installations in this study a full fem for deepwater j lay systems was established to model the dynamic responses of the pipeline under random sea state using the software orcaflex orcina 2014 the hydrodynamic forces pipelay vessel motions and pipe seabed interactions were completely taken into consideration meanwhile a nonlinear hysteretic soil model suggested by randolph and quiggin 2009 was employed to characterise the vertical pipe seabed interactions and the modified coulomb friction model was applied to simulate the lateral pipe seabed interactions then an explanatory example about a steel pipeline being installed to the seabed of 1500 m water depth in the lw3 1 gas field of south china sea was introduced to carry out the numerical analysis the dynamic behaviour of j lay pipeline in terms of top effective tension bending moment seabed resistance and pipeline embedment in the tdz was quantitatively evaluated the comparisons between static and dynamic results of j lay pipelines and between j lay and s lay dynamic results with identical pipelay conditions except for the departure points were carried out respectively in which the more noticeable dynamic effects are observed for deepwater j lay pipelines 2 j lay modelling 2 1 sea states a random sea state varying with time can generally be characterised by the statistics involving the power spectrum wave height and period some standard wave spectrums such as issc pm jonswap etc have been proposed to describe various random sea states according to the surface wave characteristics of marine environments in the lw3 1 gas field jonswap hasselmann 1973 spectrum was chosen to forecast the sea state then the wave spectrum was discretised into a sequence of linear wave components by the equal energy approach the linear airy wave theory was used to predict the velocity and acceleration of the fluid and the vertical stretching approach was employed to forecast the kinematics of water particles over the mean sea level the current velocity at the different depths were obtained from the measured data and the linear interpolation was used to calculate the velocity at the intermediate depths thus the hydrodynamic forces acting on the pipeline can be calculated by the morison s equation morison et al 1950 2 2 pipeline model within the framework of the software orcaflex orcina 2014 a reasonable fem should be established to predict the dynamic responses of deepwater j lay pipeline first of all the pipeline from the j lay tower to the seabed is discretised into a number of line segments consisting of massless spring elements and mass nodes at each end as shown in fig 2 the properties of mass weight buoyancy and so on for each half segment are concentrated on the adjacent node each node denotes two half segments on both sides except for two end nodes which only denote one half segment then all the forces and moments certainly act on these nodes different types of springs and dampers are adopted to simulate the mechanical properties of j lay pipelines in the middle of each line segment the axial spring and damper are employed to simulate the axial stiffness and damping of the line and the torsional spring and damper are employed to simulate the torsional stiffness and damping of the line at each side of the node the rotational springs and dampers are used to simulate the bending properties which result from the spanning of axial direction between the node and the line segment 2 3 vessel motions the 2 8000 t semi submersible lifting pipelay vessel with dp3 level dynamic positioning measured 225 m in length 90 m in breadth and 47 m in depth was used to install the pipelines in deep waters the main hull consists of two submerged floating bodies from the left and right which provides the buoyancy to four rectangular columns and the upper platform on each floating body and the total length of the columns is 65 of the vessel length two cranes are located on the left and right sides of the main deck at the stern with maximum lifting capacity of 2 8000 t the j lay tower is fixed at the vessel bow the displacement of the vessel is 264585 4 tons under the full load pipelay condition according to the response amplitude operators raos of 2 8000 t pipelay vessel the response spectrums of the vessel motions at the j lay tower base were derived as shown in fig 3 for the quartering seas the pitch sway and heave motions are comparatively noticeable under the beam seas the sway heave and roll are naturally the dominant motions for the head and stern seas the surge pitch and heave motions are most significant in particular the heave motion behaves drastically it is observed that the heave motion at the bow of the vessel is extremely remarkable for all seas furthermore the dynamic positioning of the pipelay vessel was not taken into consideration because it has only limited impact on the unobvious surge and sway motions 2 4 pipe seabed interactions according to the hyperbolic secant stiffness formulations the nonlinear hysteretic soil model suggested by randolph and quiggin 2009 was employed to characterise the vertical pipe seabed interactions under cyclic motions which can capture the nature of the soil stiffness varying with the increased penetration of the pipeline this model contains four kinds of penetration modes namely not in contact initial penetration uplift and repenetration and its main characteristics are illustrated in fig 4 for the not in contact mode the reaction force of the seabed is naturally zero for other three modes the seabed resistance p z asymptotically approaches the ultimate penetration resistance or the ultimate suction resistance of the soil when repenetration or uplift starts hysteresis loops concerning the seabed resistance versus the pipeline penetration will be generated as uplift and repenetration cycles repeat in general the deepwater pipeline installations are performed under the mild seas the modified coulomb friction model was applied to simulate the lateral pipe seabed interactions the lateral seabed resistance is represented as the product of the soil friction coefficient μ and the vertical seabed resistance p z as shown in fig 5 when the lateral displacement y is in between y breakout and y breakout the linear friction force f y k s ay is applied in which k s is the lateral shear stiffness of soil and a is the contact area of pipe seabed when the displacement y is larger than y breakout the friction force of the pipe is equal to μp z 2 5 numerical solution for the purpose of determining the global equilibrium configuration of j lay systems under weight buoyancy and internal forces and providing an initial starting position for the subsequent dynamic simulation the static analysis need be carried out first in general which can be divided into two steps the first step calculates an initial configuration of the j lay pipeline using the catenary method which takes no into account the influences of torsional and bending stiffness of the pipeline and contact forces between the line and solids but it includes the effects of seabed touchdown and friction the second step is to perform the full static analysis including all forces modelled in the j lay system especially it considers these effects of interactions with pipelay vessel and bending and torsional stiffness then a true static equilibrium position of j lay systems would be found through the iterative calculation following the full static analysis the dynamic time history response analysis of deepwater j lay systems under random sea state is then carried out using the explicit dynamic integration method which is a forward euler integration with a constant time step at the beginning of time simulation initial position and orientation of all objects in the numerical model containing the nodes springs and dampers in the pipeline are known beforehand from the static analysis and the time history simulation takes into consideration all geometric nonlinearity and the spatial variation of contact forces and hydrodynamic loads at every time step all the forces and moments acting on the vessel and the nodes of the line are calculated which include hydrodynamic forces weight buoyancy bending moment and torque moment axial tension and shear force contact forces with the vessel seabed reaction and friction and so on then the motion equations are formed for the vessel and all the line nodes which are solved for the acceleration vector at the beginning of time step the position and orientation of the vessel and all nodes at the end of each time step are known through the forward euler integration of acceleration in addition the critical damping and target damping are applied to remove those spurious non physical high frequency responses 3 results and discussion 3 1 static analysis the static analysis can provide an intuitive perception on the global configuration of deepwater j lay pipeline and the distribution of axial force and bending moment along the line caused by weight buoyancy seabed reaction and friction in order to validate the practicability and effectiveness of the finite element model developed using the software orcaflex orcina 2014 the numerical results were compared to the analytical solutions presented by lenci and callegari 2005 which were usually used as the references for the static analysis of j lay pipelines in this explanatory example a flooded steel pipeline with external diameter of 0 600 m and wall thickness of 0 025 m would be installed to a winkler like elastic seabed of 2000 m water depth and the ramp inclination with the horizontal plane was 80 as shown in fig 6 a the global configurations of the pipeline from the j lay tower to the seabed are almost identical and both look like a realistic j shaped curve it is also observed from fig 6 b and c that the differences of effective tension and bending moment between both are rather small and completely acceptable these sufficiently illustrates that the present numerical model can provide a very dependable response prediction of j lay pipelines the top effective tension of the pipeline is naturally maximum and supports all weight of the suspended segment then the effective tension gradually decreases along the line the top bending moment of the pipeline is minimum and progressively increases along the suspended segment until the touchdown point reaches when the pipeline is contacted with the seabed the inflection point of the distribution curve of bending moment comes into being due to the supporting action of the seabed then the bending moment promptly reduces to zero in addition the distribution of the equivalent von mises stress along the pipeline is shown in fig 6 d and the stress first starts to gradually decrease along the line due to the reduction of effective tension as the water depth increases the bending moment and the hydrostatic pressure play a more and more significant role then the stress starts to increase along the suspended segment near the tdp region the equivalent stress reaches the peak value under the combined bending moment hydrostatic pressure and effective tension subsequently the stress quickly decreases due to the effect of bending moment finally the equivalent stress of the pipeline laid on the winkler like elastic seabed little varies under axial tension and hydrostatic pressure 3 2 dynamic analysis 3 2 1 model parameters in order to evaluate the dynamic pipelay effects using the j lay method the basic parameters of the pipeline being installed to the seabed of 1500 m water depth in the lw3 1 gas field of south china sea are listed in table 1 which includes the density ρ c and thickness t c of anticorrosive coating geometric characteristics such as density ρ p external diameter d p and wall thickness t p and material properties such as elastic modulus e effective yield stress σ y and poisson s ratio v for the steel pipe the weight in air w a and submerged weight w s per unit length according to the mechanical properties of the pipe in the lw3 1 gas filed the ramberg osgood model shown in fig 7 was employed to describe the stress strain relationship of x65 pipe steel which can be defined as 1 ε σ σ e b σ σ y n where the power exponent n and the coefficient b are 11 3 and 0 0028 respectively for the 2 8000 t semi submersible lifting pipelay vessel the head sea state is the most adverse seas for deepwater pipeline installations because it brings about the most drastic vessel motions at the bow in the numerical models the surface wave heading direction θ was taken as 180 the significant wave height h s and average zero up crossing period t z or peak period t p were used to define the random sea state the wind direction was supposed to be exactly the same as the wave direction and the annual average wind speed 6 8 m s was applied with regard to the jonswap spectrum parameters the previous experiences were applied to specify the spectral width parameters σ 1 σ 2 and peak enhancement factor γ if the fetch length and the wind speed in a sea area are known the spectral energy parameter α and the peak frequency f m could be figured out for a sea state of given h s and t p table 2 lists all these parameter values mentioned above the jonswap spectrum is shown in fig 8 for a specific sea state then the wave spectrum was discretised into a hundred linear wave components using the equal energy method and a random wave train was generated by the linear superpositions of all wave components the random wave time history curve ranging from 0 s to 1800 s was shown in fig 9 which contained the maximum wave height 5 71 m occurring at the time 510 s the time starting point of numerical simulation for the random wave time history was 0 s and the duration was 10800 s as shown in fig 10 the annual mean current velocity in the vertical profile was adopted in the numerical model based upon marine environment statistics and the current direction was supposed to be opposite to the pipelay direction in order to maximise the dynamic laying effects of the line in the tdz in the following hydrodynamic analysis the normal and axial added mass coefficients were set as 1 0 and 0 0 orcina 2014 which were commonly standard values in normal and axial flows respectively the normal drag coefficient varies with the influencing factors such as reynolds number surface roughness of the pipe and vortex induced vibration etc and it was taken as 1 2 in this study berteaux 1976 wilson 1960 suggested that the ratio between axial and normal drag coefficients ranged from 0 01 to 0 03 for cables and cylinders thus a median ratio value of 0 02 was chosen and the normal drag coefficient was taken as 0 024 the nonlinear hysteretic soil model suggested by randolph and quiggin 2009 was employed to characterise the vertical pipe seabed interactions the ultimate penetration resistance p u z and the nominal bearing capacity factor n c z d are related to the penetration z and they can be expressed as 2 p u z n c z d s u z d 3 n c z d a z d b where d is the external diameter of pipe s u z is the undrained shear strength of seabed soil and non dimensional penetration resistance coefficients a 6 and b 0 25 were proposed by randolph and white 2008 according to geological conditions of the lw3 1 gas field in the south china sea most of the seabed soil is silted soft clay thus the mudline shear strength of the seabed soil was taken to be 0 75 kpa and its strength gradient to be 1 5 kpa m the friction coefficient μ generally ranged from 0 2 to 0 8 for soft clay in deepwater areas and it was taken as a moderate value of 0 55 since the displacement to mobilise the resistance y breakout was typically one tenth of the pipe diameter the lateral shear stiffness of the seabed k s was estimated as 33 3 kn m3 white and cheuk 2008 the remaining parameters for this soil model being associated with cyclic uplift and repenetration suction resistance took the default values in the software orcaflex orcina 2014 in addition the saturated soil density was 1500 kg m3 3 2 2 comparison between static and dynamic results for the sake of identifying the dynamic effects of deepwater j lay pipelines the static and dynamic analyses were performed respectively the comparisons between the calculated results in terms of the configuration effective tension bending moment bending strain equivalent stress and strain of the line are displayed in fig 11 meanwhile the corresponding maximum static and dynamic response results are summarised in table 3 it is seen from fig 11 a that the global configurations of the pipeline from the j lay tower to the seabed are almost no difference and look like a j shaped curve in the vertical profile as shown in fig 11 b there is a remarkable increase in the effective tension along the pipeline and the maximum top effective tension increases 10 60 from 1716 45 kn to 1898 37 kn in the suspended segment the bending moment of the pipeline gradually starts to rise however the equivalent stress and strain decrease first and then steadily increase in the touchdown zone as shown in fig 11 c there is a rapid increase and sharp drop in the bending moment meanwhile the bending strain equivalent stress and strain appear the similar variations as shown in fig 11 d f the maximum dynamic bending moment reaches 207 09 kn m and enhances 25 53 in contrast with its static result in addition the maximum bending strain equivalent stress and strain increase 25 79 11 69 and 11 69 respectively thus the noticeable dynamic effects of deepwater j lay pipeline are observed at the top end and in the touchdown zone 3 2 3 time history responses of j lay systems based upon the vessel raos the motion time history responses of the 2 8000 t semi submersible lifting pipelay vessel at the j lay tower base were obtained under the head seas with h s 2 50 m and t p 9 0 s the motion amplitudes of yaw and roll are extremely small while the motion amplitude of pitch takes pride of place as shown in fig 12 which will significantly affect the dynamic behaviour of j lay systems in addition the motion amplitude of sway is almost negligible while the motion amplitude of surge is relatively remarkable and the motion amplitude of heave is most noticeable and directly dominates the dynamic responses of deepwater j lay pipeline as shown in fig 13 the time history response of the top effective tension for the j lay pipeline varies drastically under the hydrodynamic forces and vessel motions and the amplitude ranges from 1502 65 kn to 1898 37 kn and is always positive the tensioners installed on the j lay tower were utilised to apply an axial tension to the top end of the pipe and should have sufficient tensioning capacity to accommodate such a great variation of the top axial tension of the pipe in case the pipeline slides from the tensioners the most critical location of the j lay pipeline is near the touchdown point due to the complicated force and deformation situations as shown in fig 14 the time history responses of the pipeline at this point in terms of effective tension bending moment equivalent stress and bending strain vary intensely the effective tension ranges from 197 81 kn to 336 96 kn and the maximum dynamic effective tension enhances 22 26 compared to its static value 275 60 kn the bending moment changes from 142 75 kn m to 207 09 kn m and the maximum dynamic bending moment is 25 53 larger than its static result 164 97 kn m taking into account the combined effects of hydrostatic pressure axial tension bending moment and seabed reaction the maximum equivalent stress attains 138 70 mpa and is far less than 0 87σy which meets well the deepwater pipelay requirement of offshore standard dnv gl 2017 simultaneously the maximum bending strain is 0 065 and less than the limited value 0 15 which also complies with the pipelay criteria of api standard api 2015 the stress level of the line from the j lay tower to the seabed was all along in the elastic range and the pipeline would not undergo any plastic deformation 3 2 4 pipe seabed dynamic interactions the vertical pipe seabed dynamic interaction has a significant influence on the seabed resistance and the pipeline embedment which will directly dominate the dynamic behaviour of j lay pipeline in the touchdown zone the nonlinear hysteretic soil model suggested by randolph and quiggin 2009 was employed to characterise the vertical pipe seabed interactions under cyclic reversed motions the seabed resistance per unit length p and the pipeline embedment z were normalised by the submerged weight per unit length w s and the external diameter d of the pipe respectively as shown in fig 15 a and b aforementioned two parameters are seen as a function of overall horizontal coordinate x measured from the barge bow and the tdp of the j lay pipeline locates at x 760 0 m it is observed that the maximum static pipeline embedment is 0 058 m 0 175d under the submerged self weight and the seabed reaction and the corresponding seabed resistance is 1 112 kn m 1 24 w s while the maximum dynamic pipeline embedment under the hydrodynamic forces and vessel motions attains 0 173 m 0 525d which is 199 16 larger than the static value and the maximum dynamic seabed resistance reaches 1 612 kn m 1 80 w s with an increase of 45 05 compared to the static value fig 15 c shows the horizontal motion time history response of the pipeline at the tdp in which the motion amplitude ranges from 759 95 m to 745 95 m and the length of the tdz is approximately equal to the difference of two motion amplitudes i e 14 00 m under cyclic reversed motions the line in the tdz continuously undergoes the uplift and repenetration thus in each cycle the seabed resistance changes with the penetration of the pipeline as shown in fig 15 d the hysteresis loops concerning the seabed resistance versus the pipeline embedment at the tdp naturally reveal the mechanical mechanisms of the nonlinear soil model and veritably simulate the process of dynamic interactions between the pipeline and the seabed 3 2 5 comparisons between j lay and s lay dynamic responses in order to further gain the insights into the dynamic laying effects of deepwater pipelines a comparative study was carried out between j lay and s lay methods with identical pipelay conditions except for the departure points it was noted that the stinger of s lay was fixed at the stern of the same pipelay vessel based upon the numerical model of s lay systems proposed by gong and xu 2017 the dynamic responses of s lay pipeline were compared to those of j lay pipeline under the head seas as shown in fig 16 a the s lay pipeline configuration from the tensioner via the stinger to the seabed is comparatively gentle and the tdp of the pipeline is nearly 1985 91 m away from the vessel stern while the j lay pipeline configuration from the ramp to the seabed is extremely steep the tdp of the pipeline is only 745 95 m away from the vessel bow it signifies that the s lay method has higher requirements on the overall stability of pipelay vessel the difference of the effective tension between s lay and j lay pipelines is very large as shown in fig 16 b for the s lay pipeline the maximum top effective tension attains 3195 47 kn and the effective tension of the pipe at the tdp still needs to be maintained at 1650 06 kn while for the j lay pipeline the maximum top effective tension is 1898 37 kn and the effective tension of the pipe at the tdp is reduced to 333 96 kn this indicates that for s lay method the pipelay vessel has to provide a very large horizontal thrust and for j lay method the pipelay vessel only needs to supply very small horizontal thrust because the top effective tension of the pipeline is mostly vertical as seen in fig 16 c for the s lay pipeline the bending moment reaches a maximum value 483 57 kn m in the roller support position of upper curved part and the maximum value of bending moment is only 46 86 kn m in the tdz while for the j lay pipeline the top bending moment of the line is nearly zero the maximum value of bending moment locates at the tdz and is 207 09 kn m thus the maximum equivalent stress of the s lay pipeline attains 394 49 mpa in the overbend section as shown in fig 16 d while the maximum equivalent stress of the j lay pipeline occurs at the tdz and is only 138 70 mpa which is greatly smaller than the yield strength of steel pipe the results reveal that for deepwater s lay the pipeline will be more liable to undergo the plastic deformation and produce the adverse residual stress while for deepwater j lay the pipeline will be all along in the elastic stress state as shown in fig 16 e and f for the s lay pipeline the maximum value of the dynamic embedment in the tdz is 0 084 m 0 254d and the corresponding maximum value of seabed resistance is 1 198 kn m 1 34 w s while for the j lay pipeline the maximum dynamic embedment reaches 0 173 m 0 525d and the maximum value of seabed resistance attains 1 612 kn m 1 80 w s which are much larger than the results of s lay pipeline thus for the s lay method the overbend section of the pipeline under the combined axial force bending and roller supporting reaction is the most serious region on the contrary for the j lay method the tdz of the pipeline under the combined external pressure bending and seabed reaction is the most critical region 4 conclusions a full fem for deepwater j lay systems was established to model the actual dynamic responses of the pipeline under random sea state using the software orcaflex the numerical model sufficiently considered the hydrodynamic forces pipelay vessel motions and pipe seabed interactions meanwhile a nonlinear hysteretic soil model was employed to characterise the vertical pipe seabed interactions then an explanatory example about a steel pipeline being installed to the seabed of 1500 m water depth in the lw3 1 gas field of south china sea was introduced to carry out the numerical analysis the dynamic behaviour of the j lay pipeline in terms of top effective tension bending moment seabed resistance and pipeline embedment in the tdz was quantitatively evaluated the comparisons between static and dynamic results of j lay pipeline and between j lay and s lay dynamic results with identical pipelay conditions except for the departure points were carried out respectively some significant conclusions from this study were outlined as follows 1 the static analysis results of the present numerical model were compared to the analytical solutions for deepwater j lay pipeline good agreements on aspects of global configuration effective tension and bending moment demonstrate that the numerical model can provide a comparatively dependable response prediction of j lay pipelines 2 based upon the raos of 2 8000 t semi submersible lifting pipelay vessel the response spectrums of vessel motions at the j lay tower base were derived specially the surge pitch and heave motions are most significant under the head seas the heave motion at the bow of vessel is extremely noticeable for all seas 3 at the top end of pipeline the effective tension drastically varies with time from 1502 65 kn to 1898 37 kn the maximum dynamic tension is 10 60 larger than the static value 1716 45 kn the tensioners mounted on the j lay tower should have sufficient tensioning capacity to accommodate such a great variation of the top axial tension of the pipe in case the pipeline slides from the tensioners 4 in the tdz the maximum dynamic bending moment equivalent stress and strain of the line increase 25 53 11 69 and 11 69 compared to their static values respectively meanwhile the maximum dynamic seabed resistance and pipeline embedment are 45 05 and 199 16 larger than their static values respectively the noticeable dynamic laying effects are intuitively perceived for deepwater j lay pipelines 5 in comparison with the s lay method for the j lay method the pipelay vessel only needs to supply very small horizontal thrust and the pipeline is all along in the elastic stress state the dynamic laying effects of the pipeline are more noticeable in the touchdown zone besides the top axial tension acknowledgements financial supports from the national natural science foundation of china grant numbers 51779223 51479176 51009122 were greatly

22215,the j lay method is a comparatively feasible way to install offshore pipelines with larger diameter and heavier submerged weight in deepwater and ultra deepwater area in this paper a full finite element model fem for deepwater j lay systems was established using the software orcaflex to study the actual dynamic pipelay effects which are mainly caused by hydrodynamic forces and pipelay vessel motions meanwhile a nonlinear hysteretic soil model was employed to characterise the vertical pipe seabed interactions and the modified coulomb friction model was applied to simulate the lateral pipe seabed interactions an explanatory example about a steel pipeline being installed to the seabed of 1500 m water depth in the lw3 1 gas field of south china sea was introduced to carry out the

evaluated the comparisons between static and dynamic results of j lay pipelines and between j lay and s lay dynamic results with identical pipelay conditions except for the departure points were carried out respectively in which the more noticeable dynamic effects are observed for deepwater j lay pipelines keywords offshore pipeline dynamic behaviour j lay pipe seabed interaction pipelay vessel 1 introduction s lay and j lay are currently the most commonly used techniques for pipeline installations in deepwater and ultra deepwater area in view of the pipelay characteristics of deepwater s lay method the pipeline has to undergo a large plastic deformation in the upper curved part and produce the detrimental residual stress in order to compensate for this deficiency the tensioning capacity of tensioners need be significantly enhanced which generally results in a greater horizontal thrust supplied by the pipelay vessel and limits the applicable water depth of s lay li et al 2008 gong et al 2014 bruschi et al 2015 gong and xu 2016 in the j lay method as shown in fig 1 the pipeline departs from the pipelay system in a nearly vertical way and is only bent once from the welding and testing ramp to the seabed which characterises a j shaped curve in comparison with the conventional s lay method the j lay method can not only drastically reduce the required horizontal tension but also remarkably shorten the distance between the touchdown point tdp of the pipeline and the pipelay vessel which facilitate the dynamic positioning systems of the pipelay vessel and conveniently control the overall stability of the vessel thus the j lay technique is deemed to be the most suitable method especially for ultra deepwater pipeline installations kashani and young 2005 for the purpose of ensuring the safety of deepwater j lay systems it is extremely necessary to sufficiently understand the mechanical behaviour of the pipelines in the process of the pipelay operations in recent years many researchers have addressed the deepwater j lay analysis to obtain the stress and strain responses of the pipeline using analytical solutions and numerical simulations lenci and callegari 2005 combined the classical catenary theory with the winkler elastic foundation beam model to comparatively analyse the mechanical behaviour of the j lay pipeline similarly wang et al 2010 put forward a simplified numerical model to analyse the j lay problems and studied the influence of current velocity water depth top inclination angle and seabed stiffness on the axial force and bending moment of the pipeline then wang et al 2012 used this numerical model to further investigate the influence of the mechanical property of seabed soil on the configuration embedment and internal force of j lay pipeline in the tdz furthermore wang et al 2013 applied the singular perturbation approach to solve the nonlinear governing differential equation of j lay pipeline then they analysed the influence of the unit weight and flexural stiffness of the pipe pipelay tower angle water depth and seabed slope on the axial force and bending moment of the pipeline in addition li et al 2015 employed the large deflection beam theory and the winkler elastic foundation beam model to develop a simple mechanical model of j lay pipeline and the high order shear effect was taken into consideration to improve the computational accuracy in this model based upon the catenary and large deflection beam theory kang et al 2015 proposed the sectional mechanics model to assess the sensitivity of wet weight stiffness and top axial tension on j lay steel catenary risers lately trapper 2019 applied minimum total potential energy principle to develop a simple numerical model for the structural analysis of pipeline configurations during j lay and s lay installations and evaluated the effects of departure angle top tension water depth and seabed stiffness on the whole pipeline configuration and seabed resistance the dynamic laying effects of the pipeline during deepwater installations induced by hydrodynamic forces and vessel motions should be fully taken into consideration which will directly dominate the feasibility of deepwater pipelay operations based upon the reissner simo beam theory yazdchi and crisfield 2002 developed a 3d finite element model considering the hydrodynamic forces to perform the nonlinear analyses of flexible pipeline and j lay riser then callegari et al 2003 investigated the static and dynamic behaviour of j lay pipelines using the finite difference method to find out the significant responses of bending moment and deformation in the touchdown zone jensen et al 2010 developed a 3d beam model of a suspended pipe string for j lay pipeline installations in which the effects of the hydrodynamic forces restoring forces and seabed interactions were added and the pipelay vessel dynamics were regarded as an upper boundary condition subsequently szczotka 2011 proposed a rigid finite element model to quickly simulate the dynamic responses of j lay pipelines in which material nonlinearity hydrodynamic forces wave and sea current loads were taken into consideration using the software orcaflex senthil and selvam 2015 established a simplified numerical model of j lay pipelines to evaluate the dynamic effects of effective tension bending moment and stress in addition zan et al 2016a proposed a real time dynamic analysis model to simulate the mechanical behaviour of j lay pipelines and analysed the effects of sea current and vessel motions on top tension and configuration of the pipelines then zan et al 2016b applied the real time numerical model to investigate the influences of the outer diameter of the pipe the mudline shear strength and strength gradient of the seabed soil on the j lay solution additionally sun et al 2018 performed a series of model tests for a light j lay vessel and coupled dynamic analysis for j lay operation and evaluated the light j lay vessel motion behaviour and the dynamic loads and stresses of the pipeline in a specified sea state kwon et al 2018 carried out a series of model tests on a rigid pipe installation using j lay method and they concluded that the dynamic response of the top tension for a rigid pipe was strongly affected by the vessel motion and the suspended pipe length recently kim and kim 2019 employed fem and minimum energy principle to establish an efficient linearised dynamic analysis method for j lay and s lay pipeline installations in this study a full fem for deepwater j lay systems was established to model the dynamic responses of the pipeline under random sea state using the software orcaflex orcina 2014 the hydrodynamic forces pipelay vessel motions and pipe seabed interactions were completely taken into consideration meanwhile a nonlinear hysteretic soil model suggested by randolph and quiggin 2009 was employed to characterise the vertical pipe seabed interactions and the modified coulomb friction model was applied to simulate the lateral pipe seabed interactions then an explanatory example about a steel pipeline being installed to the seabed of 1500 m water depth in the lw3 1 gas field of south china sea was introduced to carry out the numerical analysis the dynamic behaviour of j lay pipeline in terms of top effective tension bending moment seabed resistance and pipeline embedment in the tdz was quantitatively evaluated the comparisons between static and dynamic results of j lay pipelines and between j lay and s lay dynamic results with identical pipelay conditions except for the departure points were carried out respectively in which the more noticeable dynamic effects are observed for deepwater j lay pipelines 2 j lay modelling 2 1 sea states a random sea state varying with time can generally be characterised by the statistics involving the power spectrum wave height and period some standard wave spectrums such as issc pm jonswap etc have been proposed to describe various random sea states according to the surface wave characteristics of marine environments in the lw3 1 gas field jonswap hasselmann 1973 spectrum was chosen to forecast the sea state then the wave spectrum was discretised into a sequence of linear wave components by the equal energy approach the linear airy wave theory was used to predict the velocity and acceleration of the fluid and the vertical stretching approach was employed to forecast the kinematics of water particles over the mean sea level the current velocity at the different depths were obtained from the measured data and the linear interpolation was used to calculate the velocity at the intermediate depths thus the hydrodynamic forces acting on the pipeline can be calculated by the morison s equation morison et al 1950 2 2 pipeline model within the framework of the software orcaflex orcina 2014 a reasonable fem should be established to predict the dynamic responses of deepwater j lay pipeline first of all the pipeline from the j lay tower to the seabed is discretised into a number of line segments consisting of massless spring elements and mass nodes at each end as shown in fig 2 the properties of mass weight buoyancy and so on for each half segment are concentrated on the adjacent node each node denotes two half segments on both sides except for two end nodes which only denote one half segment then all the forces and moments certainly act on these nodes different types of springs and dampers are adopted to simulate the mechanical properties of j lay pipelines in the middle of each line segment the axial spring and damper are employed to simulate the axial stiffness and damping of the line and the torsional spring and damper are employed to simulate the torsional stiffness and damping of the line at each side of the node the rotational springs and dampers are used to simulate the bending properties which result from the spanning of axial direction between the node and the line segment 2 3 vessel motions the 2 8000 t semi submersible lifting pipelay vessel with dp3 level dynamic positioning measured 225 m in length 90 m in breadth and 47 m in depth was used to install the pipelines in deep waters the main hull consists of two submerged floating bodies from the left and right which provides the buoyancy to four rectangular columns and the upper platform on each floating body and the total length of the columns is 65 of the vessel length two cranes are located on the left and right sides of the main deck at the stern with maximum lifting capacity of 2 8000 t the j lay tower is fixed at the vessel bow the displacement of the vessel is 264585 4 tons under the full load pipelay condition according to the response amplitude operators raos of 2 8000 t pipelay vessel the response spectrums of the vessel motions at the j lay tower base were derived as shown in fig 3 for the quartering seas the pitch sway and heave motions are comparatively noticeable under the beam seas the sway heave and roll are naturally the dominant motions for the head and stern seas the surge pitch and heave motions are most significant in particular the heave motion behaves drastically it is observed that the heave motion at the bow of the vessel is extremely remarkable for all seas furthermore the dynamic positioning of the pipelay vessel was not taken into consideration because it has only limited impact on the unobvious surge and sway motions 2 4 pipe seabed interactions according to the hyperbolic secant stiffness formulations the nonlinear hysteretic soil model suggested by randolph and quiggin 2009 was employed to characterise the vertical pipe seabed interactions under cyclic motions which can capture the nature of the soil stiffness varying with the increased penetration of the pipeline this model contains four kinds of penetration modes namely not in contact initial penetration uplift and repenetration and its main characteristics are illustrated in fig 4 for the not in contact mode the reaction force of the seabed is naturally zero for other three modes the seabed resistance p z asymptotically approaches the ultimate penetration resistance or the ultimate suction resistance of the soil when repenetration or uplift starts hysteresis loops concerning the seabed resistance versus the pipeline penetration will be generated as uplift and repenetration cycles repeat in general the deepwater pipeline installations are performed under the mild seas the modified coulomb friction model was applied to simulate the lateral pipe seabed interactions the lateral seabed resistance is represented as the product of the soil friction coefficient μ and the vertical seabed resistance p z as shown in fig 5 when the lateral displacement y is in between y breakout and y breakout the linear friction force f y k s ay is applied in which k s is the lateral shear stiffness of soil and a is the contact area of pipe seabed when the displacement y is larger than y breakout the friction force of the pipe is equal to μp z 2 5 numerical solution for the purpose of determining the global equilibrium configuration of j lay systems under weight buoyancy and internal forces and providing an initial starting position for the subsequent dynamic simulation the static analysis need be carried out first in general which can be divided into two steps the first step calculates an initial configuration of the j lay pipeline using the catenary method which takes no into account the influences of torsional and bending stiffness of the pipeline and contact forces between the line and solids but it includes the effects of seabed touchdown and friction the second step is to perform the full static analysis including all forces modelled in the j lay system especially it considers these effects of interactions with pipelay vessel and bending and torsional stiffness then a true static equilibrium position of j lay systems would be found through the iterative calculation following the full static analysis the dynamic time history response analysis of deepwater j lay systems under random sea state is then carried out using the explicit dynamic integration method which is a forward euler integration with a constant time step at the beginning of time simulation initial position and orientation of all objects in the numerical model containing the nodes springs and dampers in the pipeline are known beforehand from the static analysis and the time history simulation takes into consideration all geometric nonlinearity and the spatial variation of contact forces and hydrodynamic loads at every time step all the forces and moments acting on the vessel and the nodes of the line are calculated which include hydrodynamic forces weight buoyancy bending moment and torque moment axial tension and shear force contact forces with the vessel seabed reaction and friction and so on then the motion equations are formed for the vessel and all the line nodes which are solved for the acceleration vector at the beginning of time step the position and orientation of the vessel and all nodes at the end of each time step are known through the forward euler integration of acceleration in addition the critical damping and target damping are applied to remove those spurious non physical high frequency responses 3 results and discussion 3 1 static analysis the static analysis can provide an intuitive perception on the global configuration of deepwater j lay pipeline and the distribution of axial force and bending moment along the line caused by weight buoyancy seabed reaction and friction in order to validate the practicability and effectiveness of the finite element model developed using the software orcaflex orcina 2014 the numerical results were compared to the analytical solutions presented by lenci and callegari 2005 which were usually used as the references for the static analysis of j lay pipelines in this explanatory example a flooded steel pipeline with external diameter of 0 600 m and wall thickness of 0 025 m would be installed to a winkler like elastic seabed of 2000 m water depth and the ramp inclination with the horizontal plane was 80 as shown in fig 6 a the global configurations of the pipeline from the j lay tower to the seabed are almost identical and both look like a realistic j shaped curve it is also observed from fig 6 b and c that the differences of effective tension and bending moment between both are rather small and completely acceptable these sufficiently illustrates that the present numerical model can provide a very dependable response prediction of j lay pipelines the top effective tension of the pipeline is naturally maximum and supports all weight of the suspended segment then the effective tension gradually decreases along the line the top bending moment of the pipeline is minimum and progressively increases along the suspended segment until the touchdown point reaches when the pipeline is contacted with the seabed the inflection point of the distribution curve of bending moment comes into being due to the supporting action of the seabed then the bending moment promptly reduces to zero in addition the distribution of the equivalent von mises stress along the pipeline is shown in fig 6 d and the stress first starts to gradually decrease along the line due to the reduction of effective tension as the water depth increases the bending moment and the hydrostatic pressure play a more and more significant role then the stress starts to increase along the suspended segment near the tdp region the equivalent stress reaches the peak value under the combined bending moment hydrostatic pressure and effective tension subsequently the stress quickly decreases due to the effect of bending moment finally the equivalent stress of the pipeline laid on the winkler like elastic seabed little varies under axial tension and hydrostatic pressure 3 2 dynamic analysis 3 2 1 model parameters in order to evaluate the dynamic pipelay effects using the j lay method the basic parameters of the pipeline being installed to the seabed of 1500 m water depth in the lw3 1 gas field of south china sea are listed in table 1 which includes the density ρ c and thickness t c of anticorrosive coating geometric characteristics such as density ρ p external diameter d p and wall thickness t p and material properties such as elastic modulus e effective yield stress σ y and poisson s ratio v for the steel pipe the weight in air w a and submerged weight w s per unit length according to the mechanical properties of the pipe in the lw3 1 gas filed the ramberg osgood model shown in fig 7 was employed to describe the stress strain relationship of x65 pipe steel which can be defined as 1 ε σ σ e b σ σ y n where the power exponent n and the coefficient b are 11 3 and 0 0028 respectively for the 2 8000 t semi submersible lifting pipelay vessel the head sea state is the most adverse seas for deepwater pipeline installations because it brings about the most drastic vessel motions at the bow in the numerical models the surface wave heading direction θ was taken as 180 the significant wave height h s and average zero up crossing period t z or peak period t p were used to define the random sea state the wind direction was supposed to be exactly the same as the wave direction and the annual average wind speed 6 8 m s was applied with regard to the jonswap spectrum parameters the previous experiences were applied to specify the spectral width parameters σ 1 σ 2 and peak enhancement factor γ if the fetch length and the wind speed in a sea area are known the spectral energy parameter α and the peak frequency f m could be figured out for a sea state of given h s and t p table 2 lists all these parameter values mentioned above the jonswap spectrum is shown in fig 8 for a specific sea state then the wave spectrum was discretised into a hundred linear wave components using the equal energy method and a random wave train was generated by the linear superpositions of all wave components the random wave time history curve ranging from 0 s to 1800 s was shown in fig 9 which contained the maximum wave height 5 71 m occurring at the time 510 s the time starting point of numerical simulation for the random wave time history was 0 s and the duration was 10800 s as shown in fig 10 the annual mean current velocity in the vertical profile was adopted in the numerical model based upon marine environment statistics and the current direction was supposed to be opposite to the pipelay direction in order to maximise the dynamic laying effects of the line in the tdz in the following hydrodynamic analysis the normal and axial added mass coefficients were set as 1 0 and 0 0 orcina 2014 which were commonly standard values in normal and axial flows respectively the normal drag coefficient varies with the influencing factors such as reynolds number surface roughness of the pipe and vortex induced vibration etc and it was taken as 1 2 in this study berteaux 1976 wilson 1960 suggested that the ratio between axial and normal drag coefficients ranged from 0 01 to 0 03 for cables and cylinders thus a median ratio value of 0 02 was chosen and the normal drag coefficient was taken as 0 024 the nonlinear hysteretic soil model suggested by randolph and quiggin 2009 was employed to characterise the vertical pipe seabed interactions the ultimate penetration resistance p u z and the nominal bearing capacity factor n c z d are related to the penetration z and they can be expressed as 2 p u z n c z d s u z d 3 n c z d a z d b where d is the external diameter of pipe s u z is the undrained shear strength of seabed soil and non dimensional penetration resistance coefficients a 6 and b 0 25 were proposed by randolph and white 2008 according to geological conditions of the lw3 1 gas field in the south china sea most of the seabed soil is silted soft clay thus the mudline shear strength of the seabed soil was taken to be 0 75 kpa and its strength gradient to be 1 5 kpa m the friction coefficient μ generally ranged from 0 2 to 0 8 for soft clay in deepwater areas and it was taken as a moderate value of 0 55 since the displacement to mobilise the resistance y breakout was typically one tenth of the pipe diameter the lateral shear stiffness of the seabed k s was estimated as 33 3 kn m3 white and cheuk 2008 the remaining parameters for this soil model being associated with cyclic uplift and repenetration suction resistance took the default values in the software orcaflex orcina 2014 in addition the saturated soil density was 1500 kg m3 3 2 2 comparison between static and dynamic results for the sake of identifying the dynamic effects of deepwater j lay pipelines the static and dynamic analyses were performed respectively the comparisons between the calculated results in terms of the configuration effective tension bending moment bending strain equivalent stress and strain of the line are displayed in fig 11 meanwhile the corresponding maximum static and dynamic response results are summarised in table 3 it is seen from fig 11 a that the global configurations of the pipeline from the j lay tower to the seabed are almost no difference and look like a j shaped curve in the vertical profile as shown in fig 11 b there is a remarkable increase in the effective tension along the pipeline and the maximum top effective tension increases 10 60 from 1716 45 kn to 1898 37 kn in the suspended segment the bending moment of the pipeline gradually starts to rise however the equivalent stress and strain decrease first and then steadily increase in the touchdown zone as shown in fig 11 c there is a rapid increase and sharp drop in the bending moment meanwhile the bending strain equivalent stress and strain appear the similar variations as shown in fig 11 d f the maximum dynamic bending moment reaches 207 09 kn m and enhances 25 53 in contrast with its static result in addition the maximum bending strain equivalent stress and strain increase 25 79 11 69 and 11 69 respectively thus the noticeable dynamic effects of deepwater j lay pipeline are observed at the top end and in the touchdown zone 3 2 3 time history responses of j lay systems based upon the vessel raos the motion time history responses of the 2 8000 t semi submersible lifting pipelay vessel at the j lay tower base were obtained under the head seas with h s 2 50 m and t p 9 0 s the motion amplitudes of yaw and roll are extremely small while the motion amplitude of pitch takes pride of place as shown in fig 12 which will significantly affect the dynamic behaviour of j lay systems in addition the motion amplitude of sway is almost negligible while the motion amplitude of surge is relatively remarkable and the motion amplitude of heave is most noticeable and directly dominates the dynamic responses of deepwater j lay pipeline as shown in fig 13 the time history response of the top effective tension for the j lay pipeline varies drastically under the hydrodynamic forces and vessel motions and the amplitude ranges from 1502 65 kn to 1898 37 kn and is always positive the tensioners installed on the j lay tower were utilised to apply an axial tension to the top end of the pipe and should have sufficient tensioning capacity to accommodate such a great variation of the top axial tension of the pipe in case the pipeline slides from the tensioners the most critical location of the j lay pipeline is near the touchdown point due to the complicated force and deformation situations as shown in fig 14 the time history responses of the pipeline at this point in terms of effective tension bending moment equivalent stress and bending strain vary intensely the effective tension ranges from 197 81 kn to 336 96 kn and the maximum dynamic effective tension enhances 22 26 compared to its static value 275 60 kn the bending moment changes from 142 75 kn m to 207 09 kn m and the maximum dynamic bending moment is 25 53 larger than its static result 164 97 kn m taking into account the combined effects of hydrostatic pressure axial tension bending moment and seabed reaction the maximum equivalent stress attains 138 70 mpa and is far less than 0 87σy which meets well the deepwater pipelay requirement of offshore standard dnv gl 2017 simultaneously the maximum bending strain is 0 065 and less than the limited value 0 15 which also complies with the pipelay criteria of api standard api 2015 the stress level of the line from the j lay tower to the seabed was all along in the elastic range and the pipeline would not undergo any plastic deformation 3 2 4 pipe seabed dynamic interactions the vertical pipe seabed dynamic interaction has a significant influence on the seabed resistance and the pipeline embedment which will directly dominate the dynamic behaviour of j lay pipeline in the touchdown zone the nonlinear hysteretic soil model suggested by randolph and quiggin 2009 was employed to characterise the vertical pipe seabed interactions under cyclic reversed motions the seabed resistance per unit length p and the pipeline embedment z were normalised by the submerged weight per unit length w s and the external diameter d of the pipe respectively as shown in fig 15 a and b aforementioned two parameters are seen as a function of overall horizontal coordinate x measured from the barge bow and the tdp of the j lay pipeline locates at x 760 0 m it is observed that the maximum static pipeline embedment is 0 058 m 0 175d under the submerged self weight and the seabed reaction and the corresponding seabed resistance is 1 112 kn m 1 24 w s while the maximum dynamic pipeline embedment under the hydrodynamic forces and vessel motions attains 0 173 m 0 525d which is 199 16 larger than the static value and the maximum dynamic seabed resistance reaches 1 612 kn m 1 80 w s with an increase of 45 05 compared to the static value fig 15 c shows the horizontal motion time history response of the pipeline at the tdp in which the motion amplitude ranges from 759 95 m to 745 95 m and the length of the tdz is approximately equal to the difference of two motion amplitudes i e 14 00 m under cyclic reversed motions the line in the tdz continuously undergoes the uplift and repenetration thus in each cycle the seabed resistance changes with the penetration of the pipeline as shown in fig 15 d the hysteresis loops concerning the seabed resistance versus the pipeline embedment at the tdp naturally reveal the mechanical mechanisms of the nonlinear soil model and veritably simulate the process of dynamic interactions between the pipeline and the seabed 3 2 5 comparisons between j lay and s lay dynamic responses in order to further gain the insights into the dynamic laying effects of deepwater pipelines a comparative study was carried out between j lay and s lay methods with identical pipelay conditions except for the departure points it was noted that the stinger of s lay was fixed at the stern of the same pipelay vessel based upon the numerical model of s lay systems proposed by gong and xu 2017 the dynamic responses of s lay pipeline were compared to those of j lay pipeline under the head seas as shown in fig 16 a the s lay pipeline configuration from the tensioner via the stinger to the seabed is comparatively gentle and the tdp of the pipeline is nearly 1985 91 m away from the vessel stern while the j lay pipeline configuration from the ramp to the seabed is extremely steep the tdp of the pipeline is only 745 95 m away from the vessel bow it signifies that the s lay method has higher requirements on the overall stability of pipelay vessel the difference of the effective tension between s lay and j lay pipelines is very large as shown in fig 16 b for the s lay pipeline the maximum top effective tension attains 3195 47 kn and the effective tension of the pipe at the tdp still needs to be maintained at 1650 06 kn while for the j lay pipeline the maximum top effective tension is 1898 37 kn and the effective tension of the pipe at the tdp is reduced to 333 96 kn this indicates that for s lay method the pipelay vessel has to provide a very large horizontal thrust and for j lay method the pipelay vessel only needs to supply very small horizontal thrust because the top effective tension of the pipeline is mostly vertical as seen in fig 16 c for the s lay pipeline the bending moment reaches a maximum value 483 57 kn m in the roller support position of upper curved part and the maximum value of bending moment is only 46 86 kn m in the tdz while for the j lay pipeline the top bending moment of the line is nearly zero the maximum value of bending moment locates at the tdz and is 207 09 kn m thus the maximum equivalent stress of the s lay pipeline attains 394 49 mpa in the overbend section as shown in fig 16 d while the maximum equivalent stress of the j lay pipeline occurs at the tdz and is only 138 70 mpa which is greatly smaller than the yield strength of steel pipe the results reveal that for deepwater s lay the pipeline will be more liable to undergo the plastic deformation and produce the adverse residual stress while for deepwater j lay the pipeline will be all along in the elastic stress state as shown in fig 16 e and f for the s lay pipeline the maximum value of the dynamic embedment in the tdz is 0 084 m 0 254d and the corresponding maximum value of seabed resistance is 1 198 kn m 1 34 w s while for the j lay pipeline the maximum dynamic embedment reaches 0 173 m 0 525d and the maximum value of seabed resistance attains 1 612 kn m 1 80 w s which are much larger than the results of s lay pipeline thus for the s lay method the overbend section of the pipeline under the combined axial force bending and roller supporting reaction is the most serious region on the contrary for the j lay method the tdz of the pipeline under the combined external pressure bending and seabed reaction is the most critical region 4 conclusions a full fem for deepwater j lay systems was established to model the actual dynamic responses of the pipeline under random sea state using the software orcaflex the numerical model sufficiently considered the hydrodynamic forces pipelay vessel motions and pipe seabed interactions meanwhile a nonlinear hysteretic soil model was employed to characterise the vertical pipe seabed interactions then an explanatory example about a steel pipeline being installed to the seabed of 1500 m water depth in the lw3 1 gas field of south china sea was introduced to carry out the numerical analysis the dynamic behaviour of the j lay pipeline in terms of top effective tension bending moment seabed resistance and pipeline embedment in the tdz was quantitatively evaluated the comparisons between static and dynamic results of j lay pipeline and between j lay and s lay dynamic results with identical pipelay conditions except for the departure points were carried out respectively some significant conclusions from this study were outlined as follows 1 the static analysis results of the present numerical model were compared to the analytical solutions for deepwater j lay pipeline good agreements on aspects of global configuration effective tension and bending moment demonstrate that the numerical model can provide a comparatively dependable response prediction of j lay pipelines 2 based upon the raos of 2 8000 t semi submersible lifting pipelay vessel the response spectrums of vessel motions at the j lay tower base were derived specially the surge pitch and heave motions are most significant under the head seas the heave motion at the bow of vessel is extremely noticeable for all seas 3 at the top end of pipeline the effective tension drastically varies with time from 1502 65 kn to 1898 37 kn the maximum dynamic tension is 10 60 larger than the static value 1716 45 kn the tensioners mounted on the j lay tower should have sufficient tensioning capacity to accommodate such a great variation of the top axial tension of the pipe in case the pipeline slides from the tensioners 4 in the tdz the maximum dynamic bending moment equivalent stress and strain of the line increase 25 53 11 69 and 11 69 compared to their static values respectively meanwhile the maximum dynamic seabed resistance and pipeline embedment are 45 05 and 199 16 larger than their static values respectively the noticeable dynamic laying effects are intuitively perceived for deepwater j lay pipelines 5 in comparison with the s lay method for the j lay method the pipelay vessel only needs to supply very small horizontal thrust and the pipeline is all along in the elastic stress state the dynamic laying effects of the pipeline are more noticeable

22216,a two dimensional model based on opentidalfarm is applied to simulate tidal stream flow around turbines the model is governed by shallow water equations and is able to optimize the layout of the deployed turbine array in terms of maximizing the energy outputs three turbine array layouts including two structured layouts regular and staggered and one unstructured layout optimized are simulated to investigate the effect of turbine layouts on energy extraction the present study shows that more energy could be extracted when lateral spacing decreases and longitudinal spacing increases within the same domain namely the effective turbine layout is to deploy more turbines in the first row to extract energy from undisturbed tidal stream while larger longitudinal spacing will make it possible for tidal stream to recover more before reaching the next turbines row taking the tidal stream turbines array around zhoushan islands as a case study results show that the optimized layout can extract 106 8 energy of that extracted by the regular and staggered layout for a full tide in the same marine area additionally the turbine array has a great influence on tidal stream velocities immediately behind the array and has little effect on far field wake flow keywords turbine array layout tidal stream energy shallow water equations zhoushan islands 1 introduction with the increasing attentions to the environmental issue fossil fuels which are unfriendly to the environment and have limited storage will generally be replaced by renewable energy though offshore wind farms have been substantially built around the world lin et al 2017 tidal stream energy is becoming more and more popular partly due to its predictable feature zhang et al 2013 the potential tidal stream energy around the zhoushan islands china is abundant the maximum tidal stream velocity in the channel between the hulu island and putuoshan island is above 1 7 m s with water depth varying between 20 m and 60 m wang et al 2010 as a result the first million watt mw size tidal stream energy demonstrative project of china is located here in this paper different turbine array layouts are compared in order to seek for the most suitable one to effectively extract the tidal stream energy tidal stream turbines must be deployed in the form of array in the field this raises questions about how to deploy the turbines in an array to maximize the energy output and to minimize the environment impacts caused by the deployment of tidal turbines array there is a huge difference between deploying one turbine and deploying one array comprising of tens of turbines vennell et al 2015 once the type of a turbine is fixed the turbine can be maximized in terms of its energy output by deploying at the point where the tidal stream velocity is the maximum however as one array may contain tens of turbines the interaction between these turbines cannot be neglected o doherty et al 2011 in other words the maximum energy output cannot be achieved by just deploying the whole array at the area in which the tidal stream velocity is high because the spacing between these turbines should also be considered extensive studies have been carried out to investigate the recovery of the tidal stream velocity in the wake of a single turbine in order to examine the optimum spacing between two turbines for maximizing the tidal stream energy outputs zhang et al 2017 xin et al 2011 chen 2015 an 2012 malki et al 2013 these studies found that the tidal stream velocity could recover up to 80 about 20d d is the diameter of the turbine downstream of the turbine and 100 tidal stream velocity could recover at 40d downstream of the turbine as the turbine can be significantly affected by the turbines around it mycek et al 2012 both the longitudinal spacing and the lateral spacing between the turbines in an array have effect on the tidal stream velocity recovery o doherty et al 2011 studied the interaction between closely deployed turbines by simulating a small array of turbines they found that the optimum of turbine array in terms of the efficiency of extracting tidal stream energy was achieved when the lateral spacing was about 2d and streamwise spacing was around 5d when the second row was staggered it could extract 80 energy of that of the first row by simplifying the tidal stream model the turbine array layouts can be investigated analytically an optimized simple model was used by garrett and cummins 2008 to estimate the maximum energy that could be extracted from the tidal stream along a channel vennell 2010 2011 applied one dimensional models to investigate the effect of tuning each turbine in the array to consider the effect of the channel geometry turbine position and the tidal forcing on the turbine array energy extraction efficiency however these simple models could not simulate the complex interaction between the turbines which is important for tidal stream energy extraction funke et al 2014 many mathematical optimization strategies and models have also been proposed to optimize the layout of turbine array the gradient based optimization method was developed to improve the layout in which the energy output was considered to be the function of interest funke et al 2014 2016 gonzález gorbeña et al 2016 2018 applied a surrogate based optimization of computational fluid dynamic experiments to optimize the uniform turbine array layout however to the best of authors knowledge little explanation was given for the optimized turbine array layout about why they extracted more energy furthermore few studies have been conducted to compare the impacts on environment caused by different turbine array layouts in this paper a numerical model based on opentidalfarm opentidalfarm 2014 is used to investigate the tidal stream around zhoushan islands china and the impacts that may be caused by different turbine array layouts as the turbine array layout optimized by opentidalfarm is unstructured which is novel comparing to the structured layouts it is important to investigate the physical mechanism of this new layout type and its advantages and disadvantages to this end a turbine array consisting of 18 turbines is used and arranged in three layouts in order not only to compare the energy extraction efficiency but also to analyze their wake characteristics it is expected that this study will provide some adequate advice for deployment of tidal stream turbines around zhoushan islands in terms of maximum exploiting tidal stream energy 2 numerical model the numerical simulation is carried out using the opentidalfarm which is an open source software and has the capability of flow prediction and efficient tidal turbine layout optimization opentidalfarm was recently developed for improving the energy extracting ability of the layout funke et al 2014 and seeking for the maximum number of turbines in a given deployment area funke et al 2016 it was further developed to consider the cost of deployment culley et al 2016 and the size of the arrays with a surrogate model culley et al 2017 as well as the trade off between energy yield and impact on flow feu et al 2017 although opentidalfarm has some limitations 1 the ignorance of the turbine s blades and the support structure may lead to certain errors in simulating tidal current and 2 the initial layout can affect the final optimization as the optimization algorithm can only just find a local optimal result it can provide the appropriate and effective turbine array layout with acceptable error 2 1 treatment of turbine array in this study the two dimensional 2d hydrodynamic model based on opentidalfarm is used to simulate the tidal stream around the zhoushan islands the initial structured turbine array layout is optimized by using the sequential quadratic programming which is considered to be one of the most efficient optimization algorithms boggs and tolle 1995 the turbine is modelled as a bottom friction in a square area whose side length is the same as the turbine s diameter this bottom friction coefficient increases from zero at the side to a given value k i at the center divett et al 2013 therefore for the i th turbine it can be parameterized as 1 c i k i ψ x i y i r 2 ψ p r x e 1 1 1 x p r 2 f o r x p r 0 o t h e r w i s e where c i is the friction of the i th turbine k i is a friction coefficient centered at the point x i y i ψ x i y i r is a two dimensional bump function obtained by multiplying equation 2 in both independent dimensions p is the center point s coordinate of the bump function r is the radius of the turbine a turbine array consisting of many turbines can be parameterized as 3 c t m i 1 n c i where c t m is the total friction of all the turbines n is the number of the turbines m is a 2n long vector which contains the coordinates of all the turbines 2 2 governing equations in this model the governing equations are the 2d shallow water equations 4 κ u t u u υ 2 u g η c b c t m h u u 0 5 κ η t h u 0 where κ is the parameter which specifies whether the problem is stationary κ 0 or non stationary κ 1 u is the depth averaged velocity in m s η is the free surface displacement in m h is the water depth at rest in m g is gravitational acceleration in m s2 υ is the viscosity coefficient in m2 s c b is the bottom friction in newton these equations are discretized with the finite element method the weak form is derived by multiplying the shallow water equations with test functions integrating over the computational domain and applying integration by parts to select terms for the velocity and the free surface displacement piecewise quadratic functions and piecewise linear functions are used respectively on each triangle over the suitable triangulation of the computational domain in terms of the time discretization the implicit euler method is used because of its unconditional stability and simplicity 2 3 initial and boundary conditions 2 3 1 initial conditions the initial conditions are controlled by following equations 6a u x x y t t t 0 u x 0 x y t 0 6b u y x y t t t 0 u y 0 x y t 0 6c η x y t t t 0 η 0 x y t 0 where u x 0 x y t 0 and u y 0 x y t 0 is respectively the velocity component in x and y direction at initial time t 0 η 0 x y t 0 is the tidal height at initial time t 0 in this study they are all set as zero 2 3 2 boundary conditions a dirichlet boundary condition is applied to specify the velocity at the inlet boundary the free surface displacement of the outflow boundary is set to zero on the boundaries of the island and inland the normal component of the velocity is set to zero while for the tangential component a free slip condition is imposed the tidal condition is determined by combining the eight main tidal constituents namely q1 u1 p1 k1 n2 m2 s2 and k2 which are provided by the global tidal model tpx08 atlas zhang et al 2018 2 4 optimization model the model developed by funke et al 2014 which optimizes the turbine array layout to maximize the energy extraction is used in this study max j z m 7 subject to f z m 0 b l m b u g m 0 where j z m is the function of interest f z m is a partial differential equations pde operator containing the shallow water equations equation 4 and equation 5 z u η is the solution of the shallow water equations b l and b u are the bounds of the area where turbines are deployed g m is used to keep the spacing between two turbines beyond the minimum distance in this model the coordinates of each turbine m are treated as the control parameters the time averaged energy extracted by turbine array which is also the function of interest sutherland et al 2007 vennell 2012 funke

iteration the coordinates of each turbine are updated to improve the extraction of more energy p m 2 5 description of the study area the zhoushan islands are situated in zhejiang province china the channel as shown in fig 1 is between the hulu island and putuoshan island and is chosen as the study area to deploy the turbines in order to avoid the influence from the boundary effect in this model the computational domain is much larger than the study area which varies from 122 295 to 122 568 at east longitude and from 29 848 to 30 160 at north latitude both the hulu island and the putuoshan island which belong to the zhoushan islands are included the mesh element used in this model is unstructured triangle which allows the flexible assignment and refine in the concerned regions of meshes guo et al 2012 2014 the resolution of the mesh varies from 500 m at the model boundaries to 2m near the study channel the final meshes have 39002 nodes and 79788 triangle elements as shown in fig 2 the roughness coefficient is considered to be constant and set as 0 0025 wang 2018 the eddy viscosity coefficient is taken as 10 m2 s to ensure numerical stability the boundaries viscosity coefficient is set to be 100 m2 s and the computational time step is set to be 30 s 3 results and discussion 3 1 model validation 3 1 1 tidal stream model validation to evaluate the model capability on simulating tidal stream field observed data of the tidal heights and tidal stream velocities are used to validate the model these data are gained from the demonstrative project of tidal stream energy in zhoushan island zhejiang province the measured tidal heights data are from 12 august to 27 august 2013 at station b see fig 1 the measured tidal stream velocities data including the neap tides the middle tides and the spring tides are collected from 16 august to 24 august 2013 fig 3 is the comparison of simulated solid line and measured open circles tidal elevations it is seen from fig 3 that the simulated tidal heights agree well with the measurements some deviation between the simulation and measurement is seen to take place during the spring tide the relative maximum error calculated as the ratio of the difference between the measured and simulated tidal heights over the measured local tidal range is about 10 which meets the uk model validation criteria 15 of the spring tidal range evans 1993 zhang et al 2019 fig 4 is the comparison between simulated solid lines and measured open circles tidal stream velocity a and tidal stream direction b at tide monitoring station a5 fig 4 shows that in general the simulated tidal flow direction agrees well with the measurements the largest error takes place at the neap tide fig 4 a demonstrates that the simulated velocity magnitude favorably agrees with the measured velocity magnitude though some discrepancy between simulation and observation exists with the relative maximum error 45 taking place at 21pm 16 august the reasons for this large simulation error are 1 the computational mesh nodes from which the velocity is outputted may not exactly coincide with the tide observation monitoring stations which will generate some error 2 due to the limitation of the field data the seabed roughness coefficient is considered as constant for the whole computational domain which may not be the real situation and 3 the model didn t consider the effect of wind on the sea surface for simplification on the other hand some error may come from the field measurements which were carried out in the harsh and difficult control marine environment in addition to analysis of relative error the statistical errors namely the mean absolute error mae and the root mean square error rmse between the simulated and observed data are also calculated and listed in table 1 generally speaking the model can be considered to have the capability of predicting the tidal stream around zhoushan islands with reasonable accuracy 3 1 2 turbine model validation the turbine model validation was carried out by the authors who conducted laboratory experiments to investigate the wake characteristics of a horizontal tidal turbine zhang et al 2020 in the laboratory experiment the three bladed horizontal tidal stream turbine with 27 cm in diameter was put in a re circulation flume which has a working section of 50 m in length 1 2 m in width and 1 2 m in depth the numerical model with the same size is run in the opentidalfarm fig 5 shows the comparison of the simulated solid lines and the measured velocity profiles open circles in general fig 5 shows that the simulated velocity in the wake region agrees well with the measurements it is noticeable that the recover tendency of the velocity in the wake area is well simulated especially for the minimum velocity in each cross section some errors are seen to appear in the near wake area e g 1d 2d behind the turbine this deviation is perhaps ascribed to the fact that the turbine blades and the support structure are ignored in the simulation 3 2 sensitivity analysis of mesh size on computational results the reliability and accuracy of simulation results of numerical models are normally evaluated through mesh size sensitivity analysis in this study four mesh sizes as listed in table 2 are designed to investigate the mesh dependency ranging from 4310 nodes and 8964 cells mesh 4 to 130280 nodes and 263747 cells mesh 1 in the computational domain as this study focuses on simulating the velocity field only the accuracy of the simulated velocity is compared with the measurements fig 6 shows the comparison the simulated solid lines and field observed open circles velocity for various mesh sizes fig 6 demonstrates that there is a relatively large difference between the simulated and observed velocity for very coarse mesh e g mesh 4 4310 nodes and 8964 cells the simulation is greatly improved when the mesh density increases from 4310 nodes and 8964 cells to 39002 nodes and 79788 cells mesh 2 using the same analysis method mentioned by chen et al 2013 the maximum mean absolute error mae and the maximum root mean square error rmse between the simulated and measured velocity are both improved from 0 1215 to 0 0918 and from 0 1250 to 0 1125 respectively when the mesh is continuously refined from mesh 2 to mesh 1 no noticeable improvement is achieved while the computational time increases a magnitude of an order therefore considering the computational efficiency and accuracy the finalized mesh used in this study has 39002 nodes and 79788 cells mesh 2 this mesh configuration enables the model to provide tidal velocity with sufficient accuracy which is of significance in terms of evaluating the potential tidal stream energy 3 3 turbine array layout description the validated model is applied to evaluate the tidal stream energy around zhoushan islands in which 18 turbines with the same diameter of 20 m are planned to deploy as the type of the turbine is not main topic in this study the friction coefficients of all turbines are set as the default value i e 12 the minimum spacing between two turbines is set as 30m the simulation starts at 8 30am 22 august 2013 and runs for 35 h to include a 12 h full tide from 5 30am 23 august 2013 to 17 30pm 23 august 2013 the computational time step is set as 30min for the structured regular layout the turbines are deployed in a way that the lateral spacing is 2d and the vertical spacing is 5d as shown in fig 7 a for the structured staggered layout the spacing is the same as that with structured regular layout see fig 7 b with the turbines in the even row being deployed at the gap between the turbines in the odd row this staggered layout is expected to be the most effective structured layout in terms of extracting tidal stream energy o doherty et al 2011 for the optimized layout the turbines are deployed in an unstructured pattern which looks like a barrage with three layers as shown in fig 8 each row is perpendicular to the flowing direction for all three layouts 3 4 energy extraction fig 9 shows the power extraction by three turbine layouts over 12 h as the extracted power is proportional to the cube of the velocity the power extraction by these three turbine layouts vary mainly with the tidal stream velocity when the velocity at the target area reaches the peak e g 9 30am the gap between ability to extract tidal stream energy by these three layouts is likely to widen integrating the power over time in fig 9 yields the energy extracted by the structured regular layout and staggered layout during 12 h being 6 15 10 4 kw h and 6 24 10 4 kw h respectively and 6 56 10 4 kw h for the optimized layout the optimized layout has been achieved after 47 times simulations until the improvements of the energy outputs from the last layout to the immediate previous layout is less than 0 1 shown in fig 8 comparing the normal staggered layout with 2d lateral spacing and 5d vertical spacing and the optimized staggered layout the latter can extract 5 more tidal stream energy than the former showing a great energy extraction efficiency this demonstrates that higher energy extraction could be achieved when the tidal turbine layout is deployed in an unrestricted way which is interpreted as follows as shown in fig 10 a the first row turbines in structured regular layout can extract the energy from undisturbed tidal stream indicating that these turbines are fully utilized the other turbine rows behind the first row are deployed in the tidal stream velocity deceleration area and thus the energy extracted by these turbines is less the structured staggered layout as shown in fig 10 b is similar to that in fig 10 a however as the odd rows interlace with the even row turbines in the downstream row are able to extract energy from the locally accelerated tidal stream due to the narrowing effect of the front row this makes the structured staggered layout extract more energy than that the structured regular layout does for the optimized layout showed in fig 10 c the turbine array is deployed in 3 rows three turbines are placed in the first row which extract energy from undisturbed tidal stream in the second row four turbines are divided into two parts with three turbines being placed on the west and one turbine on the east these turbines are deployed in the local tidal flow accelerating area behind the first row enabling these turbines to extract more energy the third row has eleven turbines and is placed behind the first row though tidal stream velocity downstream of the first row is reduced due to some tidal stream energy extracted the large spacing between the first and third rows makes it possible that the tidal stream velocity recovers to a high level furthermore blockage induced by the second row may increase the tidal stream velocity downstream these make the eleven turbines in the third row to extract more tidal stream energy as a result the unstructured optimized layout extracts more energy than the other two structured layouts the above analysis demonstrates that to increase the tidal stream energy extraction turbines should be placed in the area where the tidal stream velocity is not significantly decelerated or the tidal flow is locally accelerated this means for the turbines placed in the upstream turbines wake region the spacing between these two turbines rows should be sufficiently large so that the tidal flow velocity could be significantly recovered to this end it is important to understand the wake structure downstream of turbine row 3 5 wake characteristics the distribution of the peak tidal stream velocity over an ebb period with no turbine is showed in fig 11 a in which the red dotted rectangle is the turbine deployment area fig 11 shows the velocity distribution around the turbine deployment area fig 11 b is the situation without turbine while fig 11 c d and e demonstrate the velocity distribution for turbines deployed in regular staggered and optimized layout at the same time respectively it is seen that there is no obvious difference of the velocity field for various situations at far field significant decrease of the tidal velocity however appears at the channel between huoshashan island and reefs after the deployment of the turbine array slight increase of the tidal velocity is seen to occur at the channel between smallhulu island and reefs when the turbine array is deployed in the area just behind the turbine array and at the channel between hulu island and putuoshan island there is no significant velocity difference for these three turbine layouts the locations of various islands are shown in fig 8 they all show a large deceleration area behind turbine array with locally acceleration at the two side of the wake area the result is similar to the work by chen et al 2013 to further investigate the effect of these three turbine array layouts five points are selected as shown in fig 12 where velocity field is simulated for a full tide in fig 12 points 1 2 and 3 are located at the center of the regular turbine array layout and are 10d 20d and 30d behind the last row respectively simulated velocity at these three locations is used to examine the effect of the distance away from the turbine array on the velocity field point 4 is at the channel between huoshashan island and reefs while the point 5 is at the channel between smallhulu island and reefs the velocity data at these two points demonstrate the impacts on the two channels due to the deployment of the turbine array the simulation of this period begins at 5 30am 23 august 2013 and the simulated velocity field is shown in fig 13 fig 13 a shows the simulated velocity at point 1 during a full tide it is seen that all three turbine array layouts cause significant decrease of tidal stream velocity at 10d behind them the largest velocity decrease appears at about 10 00am for the regular layout and staggered layout at that time tidal stream velocity decreases from 1 34 m s to 0 21 m s namely an 84 decrease as the actual flowing direction of tidal stream is not always perpendicular to the turbine array the difference between the regular and staggered layout is negligible therefore the deceleration of the tidal stream velocity caused by the regular and staggered layout is almost the same as such fig 13 shows that the lines represent the velocity profiles induced by the deployment of the regular and staggered turbine layouts overlap each other for the optimized layout tidal velocity decreases from 1 34 m s to 0 31 m s namely a 76 decrease which is smaller than other two layouts this can be ascribed to the fact that the optimized turbine array layout is deployed closer to the center of the turbine deployment area and thus the tidal stream has sufficient distance to recover before reaching the point 1 a smaller decline of tidal stream velocity can also be found after 13 30 p m when the tide begins to rise the different layouts of turbine array lead to the same decline about 16 the reason for this phenomenon is that the placement of the turbine array slows down the rising tide before the tide reaches the turbine array furthermore it can be seen that the deceleration of the velocity varies with the initial velocity the faster the initial velocity is the greater deceleration takes place however various turbines layouts have no obvious impact on the tidal stream phase fig 13 b shows that the maximum velocity decrease is 92 namely from 1 17 m s to 0 09 m s for the regular and staggered turbine array layouts while for the optimized layout the maximum deceleration is 85 the reason is that in the far wake area the tidal stream flowing through the turbines mixes well with the tidal stream flowing through the gap between turbines such as the tidal stream flowing through point 1 leading to a greater decline than that for point 1 in terms of the tidal stream velocity during the flooding phase it shows a slight decrease and the maximum decline is about 7 similar results are shown in fig 13 c however one notable thing is that the difference between the influences caused by these three turbine array layouts becomes more negligible fig 13 d shows a great deceleration of the tidal stream velocity in the channel between huoshashan island and reefs due to the deployment of turbines although this channel is far away from the turbine array the maximum velocity at point 4 decreases from 1 57 m s to 1 00 m s name about 36 decline the velocity variation during the tidal period becomes flat differences caused by different turbine array layout are negligible fig 13 e shows that the deployment of the turbine array has insignificant effect on the tidal stream velocity in the channel between smallhulu island and reefs which is far away from the turbines peak velocity however appears slightly earlier during the ebb tide and decreases a little during the flooding phase 4 conclusion in this paper a two dimensional numerical model is developed based on opentidalfarm the measured data from the demonstrative project of tidal stream energy in zhoushan island are used to validate the numerical model the validated model is then used to simulate the tidal steam around zhoushan islands and to calculate the energy extractions by 18 turbines with three layouts the wake characteristics of these three turbine array layouts are also studied the optimal layout for extracting tidal stream energy is the unstructured layout in this layout both the first row and second row of the turbines can extract energy from not decelerated tidal stream the tidal stream velocity at the third row also recovers after a long distance away from second row of turbines as well as accelerated by the blockage effect induced by the second row for the two structured regular and staggered layouts their energy extractions are almost the same namely 6 15 10 4 kw h for the regular layout and 6 24 10 4 kw h for the staggered layout this is partly because the direction of the tidal stream is not always perpendicular to the tidal turbines which reduces the difference between the regular layout and staggered layout in this study the energy extraction from the optimized layout is much higher at 6 56 10 4 kw h which is about 5 higher than the energy outputs of those two structured layouts five locations are selected to investigate the peak velocity variation in the wake area results show that the maximum deceleration in the wake of the turbine array not only takes place behind the last row of the turbine array it may also occurs at locations e g point 2 where the wake flow mixes completely in the far area such as at point 4 and 5 the difference of the influence between these three layouts is insignificant this means that the deployment of the turbine array can make a huge difference to the velocity distribution but there is no big difference for the velocity distribution variations caused by these three layouts this study shows that in the real ocean field tidal stream turbines can be deployed in unstructured layout in order to achieve a high energy extraction efficiency therefore it is important to deploy turbines in a way that the spacing between the adjacent rows is sufficiently large so that the downstream turbines can benefit from the great tidal flow velocity recovery authors contribution section authors contribution towards the paper investigation of array layout of tidal

22216,a two dimensional model based on opentidalfarm is applied to simulate tidal stream flow around turbines the model is governed by shallow water equations and is able to optimize the layout of the deployed turbine array in terms of maximizing the energy outputs three turbine array layouts including two structured layouts regular and staggered and one unstructured layout optimized are simulated to investigate the effect of turbine layouts on energy extraction the present study shows that more energy could be extracted when lateral spacing decreases and longitudinal spacing increases within the same domain namely the effective turbine layout is to deploy more turbines in the first row to extract energy from undisturbed tidal stream while larger longitudinal spacing will make it possible for tidal stream to recover more before reaching the next turbines row taking the tidal stream turbines array around zhoushan islands as a case study results show that the optimized layout can extract 106 8 energy of that extracted by the regular and staggered layout for a full tide in the same marine area additionally the turbine array has a great influence on tidal stream velocities immediately behind the array and has little effect on far field wake flow keywords turbine array layout tidal stream energy shallow water equations zhoushan islands 1 introduction with the increasing attentions to the environmental issue fossil fuels which are unfriendly to the environment and have limited storage will generally be replaced by renewable energy though offshore wind farms have been substantially built around the world lin et al 2017 tidal stream energy is becoming more and more popular partly due to its predictable feature zhang et al 2013 the potential tidal stream energy around the zhoushan islands china is abundant the maximum tidal stream velocity in the channel between the hulu island and putuoshan island is above 1 7 m s with water depth varying between 20 m and 60 m wang et al 2010 as a result the first million watt mw size tidal stream energy demonstrative project of china is located here in this paper different turbine array layouts are compared in order to seek for the most suitable one to effectively extract the tidal stream energy tidal stream turbines must be deployed in the form of array in the field this raises questions about how to deploy the turbines in an array to maximize the energy output and to minimize the environment impacts caused by the deployment of tidal turbines array there is a huge difference between deploying one turbine and deploying one array comprising of tens of turbines vennell et al 2015 once the type of a turbine is fixed the turbine can be maximized in terms of its energy output by deploying at the point where the tidal stream velocity is the maximum however as one array may contain tens of turbines the interaction between these turbines cannot be neglected o doherty et al 2011 in other words the maximum energy output cannot be achieved by just deploying the whole array at the area in which the tidal stream velocity is high because the spacing between these turbines should also be considered extensive studies have been carried out to investigate the recovery of the tidal stream velocity in the wake of a single turbine in order to examine the optimum spacing between two turbines for maximizing the tidal stream energy outputs zhang et al 2017 xin et al 2011 chen 2015 an 2012 malki et al 2013 these studies found that the tidal stream velocity could recover up to 80 about 20d d is the diameter of the turbine downstream of the turbine and 100 tidal stream velocity could recover at 40d downstream of the turbine as the turbine can be significantly affected by the turbines around it mycek et al 2012 both the longitudinal spacing and the lateral spacing between the turbines in an array have effect on the tidal stream velocity recovery o doherty et al 2011 studied the interaction between closely deployed turbines by simulating a small array of turbines they found that the optimum of turbine array in terms of the efficiency of extracting tidal stream energy was achieved when the lateral spacing was about 2d and streamwise spacing was around 5d when the second row was staggered it could extract 80 energy of that of the first row by simplifying the tidal stream model the turbine array layouts can be investigated analytically an optimized simple model was used by garrett and cummins 2008 to estimate the maximum energy that could be extracted from the tidal stream along a channel vennell 2010 2011 applied one dimensional models to investigate the effect of tuning each turbine in the array to consider the effect of the channel geometry turbine position and the tidal forcing on the turbine array energy extraction efficiency however these simple models could not simulate the complex interaction between the turbines which is important for tidal stream energy extraction funke et al 2014 many mathematical optimization strategies and models have also been proposed to optimize the layout of turbine array the gradient based optimization method was developed to improve the layout in which the energy output was considered to be the function of interest funke et al 2014 2016 gonzález gorbeña et al 2016 2018 applied a surrogate based optimization of computational fluid dynamic experiments to optimize the uniform turbine array layout however to the best of authors knowledge little explanation was given for the optimized turbine array layout about why they extracted more energy furthermore few studies have been conducted to compare the impacts on environment caused by different turbine array layouts in this paper a numerical model based on opentidalfarm opentidalfarm 2014 is used to investigate the tidal stream around zhoushan islands china and the impacts that may be caused by different turbine array layouts as the turbine array layout optimized by opentidalfarm is unstructured which is novel comparing to the structured layouts it is important to investigate the physical mechanism of this new layout type and its advantages and disadvantages to this end a turbine array consisting of 18 turbines is used and arranged in three layouts in order not only to compare the energy extraction efficiency but also to analyze their wake characteristics it is expected that this study will provide some adequate advice for deployment of tidal stream turbines around zhoushan islands in terms of maximum exploiting tidal stream energy 2 numerical model the numerical simulation is carried out using the opentidalfarm which is an open source software and has the capability of flow prediction and efficient tidal turbine layout optimization opentidalfarm was recently developed for improving the energy extracting ability of the layout funke et al 2014 and seeking for the maximum number of turbines in a given deployment area funke et al 2016 it was further developed to consider the cost of deployment culley et al 2016 and the size of the arrays with a surrogate model culley et al 2017 as well as the trade off between energy yield and impact on flow feu et al 2017 although opentidalfarm has some limitations 1 the ignorance of the turbine s blades and the support structure may lead to certain errors in simulating tidal current and 2 the initial layout can affect the final optimization as the optimization algorithm can only just find a local optimal result it can provide the appropriate and effective turbine array layout with acceptable error 2 1 treatment of turbine array in this study the two dimensional 2d hydrodynamic model based on opentidalfarm is used to simulate the tidal stream around the zhoushan islands the initial structured turbine array layout is optimized by using the sequential quadratic programming which is considered to be one of the most efficient optimization algorithms boggs and tolle 1995 the turbine is modelled as a bottom friction in a square area whose side length is the same as the turbine s diameter this bottom friction coefficient increases from zero at the side to a given value k i at the center divett et al 2013 therefore for the i th turbine it can be parameterized as 1 c i k i ψ x i y i r 2 ψ p r x e 1 1 1 x p r 2 f o r x p r 0 o t h e r w i s e where c i is the friction of the i th turbine k i is a friction coefficient centered at the point x i y i ψ x i y i r is a two dimensional bump function obtained by multiplying equation 2 in both independent dimensions p is the center point s coordinate of the bump function r is the radius of the turbine a turbine array consisting of many turbines can be parameterized as 3 c t m i 1 n c i where c t m is the total friction of all the turbines n is the number of the turbines m is a 2n long vector which contains the coordinates of all the turbines 2 2 governing equations in this model the governing equations are the 2d shallow water equations 4 κ u t u u υ 2 u g η c b c t m h u u 0 5 κ η t h u 0 where κ is the parameter which specifies whether the problem is stationary κ 0 or non stationary κ 1 u is the depth averaged velocity in m s η is the free surface displacement in m h is the water depth at rest in m g is gravitational acceleration in m s2 υ is the viscosity coefficient in m2 s c b is the bottom friction in newton these equations are discretized with the finite element method the weak form is derived by multiplying the shallow water equations with test functions integrating over the computational domain and applying integration by parts to select terms for the velocity and the free surface displacement piecewise quadratic functions and piecewise linear functions are used respectively on each triangle over the suitable triangulation of the computational domain in terms of the time discretization the implicit euler method is used because of its unconditional stability and simplicity 2 3 initial and boundary conditions 2 3 1 initial conditions the initial conditions are controlled by following equations 6a u x x y t t t 0 u x 0 x y t 0 6b u y x y t t t 0 u y 0 x y t 0 6c η x y t t t 0 η 0 x y t 0 where u x 0 x y t 0 and u y 0 x y t 0 is respectively the velocity component in x and y direction at initial time t 0 η 0 x y t 0 is the tidal height at initial time t 0 in this study they are all set as zero 2 3 2 boundary conditions a dirichlet boundary condition is applied to specify the velocity at the inlet boundary the free surface displacement of the outflow boundary is set to zero on the boundaries of the island and inland the normal component of the velocity is set to zero while for the tangential component a free slip condition is imposed the tidal condition is determined by combining the eight main tidal constituents namely q1 u1 p1 k1 n2 m2 s2 and k2 which are provided by the global tidal model tpx08 atlas zhang et al 2018 2 4 optimization model the model developed by funke et al 2014 which optimizes the turbine array layout to maximize the energy extraction is used in this study max j z m 7 subject to f z m

iteration the coordinates of each turbine are updated to improve the extraction of more energy p m 2 5 description of the study area the zhoushan islands are situated in zhejiang province china the channel as shown in fig 1 is between the hulu island and putuoshan island and is chosen as the study area to deploy the turbines in order to avoid the influence from the boundary effect in this model the computational domain is much larger than the study area which varies from 122 295 to 122 568 at east longitude and from 29 848 to 30 160 at north latitude both the hulu island and the putuoshan island which belong to the zhoushan islands are included the mesh element used in this model is unstructured triangle which allows the flexible assignment and refine in the concerned regions of meshes guo et al 2012 2014 the resolution of the mesh varies from 500 m at the model boundaries to 2m near the study channel the final meshes have 39002 nodes and 79788 triangle elements as shown in fig 2 the roughness coefficient is considered to be constant and set as 0 0025 wang 2018 the eddy viscosity coefficient is taken as 10 m2 s to ensure numerical stability the boundaries viscosity coefficient is set to be 100 m2 s and the computational time step is set to be 30 s 3 results and discussion 3 1 model validation 3 1 1 tidal stream model validation to evaluate the model capability on simulating tidal stream field observed data of the tidal heights and tidal stream velocities are used to validate the model these data are gained from the demonstrative project of tidal stream energy in zhoushan island zhejiang province the measured tidal heights data are from 12 august to 27 august 2013 at station b see fig 1 the measured tidal stream velocities data including the neap tides the middle tides and the spring tides are collected from 16 august to 24 august 2013 fig 3 is the comparison of simulated solid line and measured open circles tidal elevations it is seen from fig 3 that the simulated tidal heights agree well with the measurements some deviation between the simulation and measurement is seen to take place during the spring tide the relative maximum error calculated as the ratio of the difference between the measured and simulated tidal heights over the measured local tidal range is about 10 which meets the uk model validation criteria 15 of the spring tidal range evans 1993 zhang et al 2019 fig 4 is the comparison between simulated solid lines and measured open circles tidal stream velocity a and tidal stream direction b at tide monitoring station a5 fig 4 shows that in general the simulated tidal flow direction agrees well with the measurements the largest error takes place at the neap tide fig 4 a demonstrates that the simulated velocity magnitude favorably agrees with the measured velocity magnitude though some discrepancy between simulation and observation exists with the relative maximum error 45 taking place at 21pm 16 august the reasons for this large simulation error are 1 the computational mesh nodes from which the velocity is outputted may not exactly coincide with the tide observation monitoring stations which will generate some error 2 due to the limitation of the field data the seabed roughness coefficient is considered as constant for the whole computational domain which may not be the real situation and 3 the model didn t consider the effect of wind on the sea surface for simplification on the other hand some error may come from the field measurements which were carried out in the harsh and difficult control marine environment in addition to analysis of relative error the statistical errors namely the mean absolute error mae and the root mean square error rmse between the simulated and observed data are also calculated and listed in table 1 generally speaking the model can be considered to have the capability of predicting the tidal stream around zhoushan islands with reasonable accuracy 3 1 2 turbine model validation the turbine model validation was carried out by the authors who conducted laboratory experiments to investigate the wake characteristics of a horizontal tidal turbine zhang et al 2020 in the laboratory experiment the three bladed horizontal tidal stream turbine with 27 cm in diameter was put in a re circulation flume which has a working section of 50 m in length 1 2 m in width and 1 2 m in depth the numerical model with the same size is run in the opentidalfarm fig 5 shows the comparison of the simulated solid lines and the measured velocity profiles open circles in general fig 5 shows that the simulated velocity in the wake region agrees well with the measurements it is noticeable that the recover tendency of the velocity in the wake area is well simulated especially for the minimum velocity in each cross section some errors are seen to appear in the near wake area e g 1d 2d behind the turbine this deviation is perhaps ascribed to the fact that the turbine blades and the support structure are ignored in the simulation 3 2 sensitivity analysis of mesh size on computational results the reliability and accuracy of simulation results of numerical models are normally evaluated through mesh size sensitivity analysis in this study four mesh sizes as listed in table 2 are designed to investigate the mesh dependency ranging from 4310 nodes and 8964 cells mesh 4 to 130280 nodes and 263747 cells mesh 1 in the computational domain as this study focuses on simulating the velocity field only the accuracy of the simulated velocity is compared with the measurements fig 6 shows the comparison the simulated solid lines and field observed open circles velocity for various mesh sizes fig 6 demonstrates that there is a relatively large difference between the simulated and observed velocity for very coarse mesh e g mesh 4 4310 nodes and 8964 cells the simulation is greatly improved when the mesh density increases from 4310 nodes and 8964 cells to 39002 nodes and 79788 cells mesh 2 using the same analysis method mentioned by chen et al 2013 the maximum mean absolute error mae and the maximum root mean square error rmse between the simulated and measured velocity are both improved from 0 1215 to 0 0918 and from 0 1250 to 0 1125 respectively when the mesh is continuously refined from mesh 2 to mesh 1 no noticeable improvement is achieved while the computational time increases a magnitude of an order therefore considering the computational efficiency and accuracy the finalized mesh used in this study has 39002 nodes and 79788 cells mesh 2 this mesh configuration enables the model to provide tidal velocity with sufficient accuracy which is of significance in terms of evaluating the potential tidal stream energy 3 3 turbine array layout description the validated model is applied to evaluate the tidal stream energy around zhoushan islands in which 18 turbines with the same diameter of 20 m are planned to deploy as the type of the turbine is not main topic in this study the friction coefficients of all turbines are set as the default value i e 12 the minimum spacing between two turbines is set as 30m the simulation starts at 8 30am 22 august 2013 and runs for 35 h to include a 12 h full tide from 5 30am 23 august 2013 to 17 30pm 23 august 2013 the computational time step is set as 30min for the structured regular layout the turbines are deployed in a way that the lateral spacing is 2d and the vertical spacing is 5d as shown in fig 7 a for the structured staggered layout the spacing is the same as that with structured regular layout see fig 7 b with the turbines in the even row being deployed at the gap between the turbines in the odd row this staggered layout is expected to be the most effective structured layout in terms of extracting tidal stream energy o doherty et al 2011 for the optimized layout the turbines are deployed in an unstructured pattern which looks like a barrage with three layers as shown in fig 8 each row is perpendicular to the flowing direction for all three layouts 3 4 energy extraction fig 9 shows the power extraction by three turbine layouts over 12 h as the extracted power is proportional to the cube of the velocity the power extraction by these three turbine layouts vary mainly with the tidal stream velocity when the velocity at the target area reaches the peak e g 9 30am the gap between ability to extract tidal stream energy by these three layouts is likely to widen integrating the power over time in fig 9 yields the energy extracted by the structured regular layout and staggered layout during 12 h being 6 15 10 4 kw h and 6 24 10 4 kw h respectively and 6 56 10 4 kw h for the optimized layout the optimized layout has been achieved after 47 times simulations until the improvements of the energy outputs from the last layout to the immediate previous layout is less than 0 1 shown in fig 8 comparing the normal staggered layout with 2d lateral spacing and 5d vertical spacing and the optimized staggered layout the latter can extract 5 more tidal stream energy than the former showing a great energy extraction efficiency this demonstrates that higher energy extraction could be achieved when the tidal turbine layout is deployed in an unrestricted way which is interpreted as follows as shown in fig 10 a the first row turbines in structured regular layout can extract the energy from undisturbed tidal stream indicating that these turbines are fully utilized the other turbine rows behind the first row are deployed in the tidal stream velocity deceleration area and thus the energy extracted by these turbines is less the structured staggered layout as shown in fig 10 b is similar to that in fig 10 a however as the odd rows interlace with the even row turbines in the downstream row are able to extract energy from the locally accelerated tidal stream due to the narrowing effect of the front row this makes the structured staggered layout extract more energy than that the structured regular layout does for the optimized layout showed in fig 10 c the turbine array is deployed in 3 rows three turbines are placed in the first row which extract energy from undisturbed tidal stream in the second row four turbines are divided into two parts with three turbines being placed on the west and one turbine on the east these turbines are deployed in the local tidal flow accelerating area behind the first row enabling these turbines to extract more energy the third row has eleven turbines and is placed behind the first row though tidal stream velocity downstream of the first row is reduced due to some tidal stream energy extracted the large spacing between the first and third rows makes it possible that the tidal stream velocity recovers to a high level furthermore blockage induced by the second row may increase the tidal stream velocity downstream these make the eleven turbines in the third row to extract more tidal stream energy as a result the unstructured optimized layout extracts more energy than the other two structured layouts the above analysis demonstrates that to increase the tidal stream energy extraction turbines should be placed in the area where the tidal stream velocity is not significantly decelerated or the tidal flow is locally accelerated this means for the turbines placed in the upstream turbines wake region the spacing between these two turbines rows should be sufficiently large so that the tidal flow velocity could be significantly recovered to this end it is important to understand the wake structure downstream of turbine row 3 5 wake characteristics the distribution of the peak tidal stream velocity over an ebb period with no turbine is showed in fig 11 a in which the red dotted rectangle is the turbine deployment area fig 11 shows the velocity distribution around the turbine deployment area fig 11 b is the situation without turbine while fig 11 c d and e demonstrate the velocity distribution for turbines deployed in regular staggered and optimized layout at the same time respectively it is seen that there is no obvious difference of the velocity field for various situations at far field significant decrease of the tidal velocity however appears at the channel between huoshashan island and reefs after the deployment of the turbine array slight increase of the tidal velocity is seen to occur at the channel between smallhulu island and reefs when the turbine array is deployed in the area just behind the turbine array and at the channel between hulu island and putuoshan island there is no significant velocity difference for these three turbine layouts the locations of various islands are shown in fig 8 they all show a large deceleration area behind turbine array with locally acceleration at the two side of the wake area the result is similar to the work by chen et al 2013 to further investigate the effect of these three turbine array layouts five points are selected as shown in fig 12 where velocity field is simulated for a full tide in fig 12 points 1 2 and 3 are located at the center of the regular turbine array layout and are 10d 20d and 30d behind the last row respectively simulated velocity at these three locations is used to examine the effect of the distance away from the turbine array on the velocity field point 4 is at the channel between huoshashan island and reefs while the point 5 is at the channel between smallhulu island and reefs the velocity data at these two points demonstrate the impacts on the two channels due to the deployment of the turbine array the simulation of this period begins at 5 30am 23 august 2013 and the simulated velocity field is shown in fig 13 fig 13 a shows the simulated velocity at point 1 during a full tide it is seen that all three turbine array layouts cause significant decrease of tidal stream velocity at 10d behind them the largest velocity decrease appears at about 10 00am for the regular layout and staggered layout at that time tidal stream velocity decreases from 1 34 m s to 0 21 m s namely an 84 decrease as the actual flowing direction of tidal stream is not always perpendicular to the turbine array the difference between the regular and staggered layout is negligible therefore the deceleration of the tidal stream velocity caused by the regular and staggered layout is almost the same as such fig 13 shows that the lines represent the velocity profiles induced by the deployment of the regular and staggered turbine layouts overlap each other for the optimized layout tidal velocity decreases from 1 34 m s to 0 31 m s namely a 76 decrease which is smaller than other two layouts this can be ascribed to the fact that the optimized turbine array layout is deployed closer to the center of the turbine deployment area and thus the tidal stream has sufficient distance to recover before reaching the point 1 a smaller decline of tidal stream velocity can also be found after 13 30 p m when the tide begins to rise the different layouts of turbine array lead to the same decline about 16 the reason for this phenomenon is that the placement of the turbine array slows down the rising tide before the tide reaches the turbine array furthermore it can be seen that the deceleration of the velocity varies with the initial velocity the faster the initial velocity is the greater deceleration takes place however various turbines layouts have no obvious impact on the tidal stream phase fig 13 b shows that the maximum velocity decrease is 92 namely from 1 17 m s to 0 09 m s for the regular and staggered turbine array layouts while for the optimized layout the maximum deceleration is 85 the reason is that in the far wake area the tidal stream flowing through the turbines mixes well with the tidal stream flowing through the gap between turbines such as the tidal stream flowing through point 1 leading to a greater decline than that for point 1 in terms of the tidal stream velocity during the flooding phase it shows a slight decrease and the maximum decline is about 7 similar results are shown in fig 13 c however one notable thing is that the difference between the influences caused by these three turbine array layouts becomes more negligible fig 13 d shows a great deceleration of the tidal stream velocity in the channel between huoshashan island and reefs due to the deployment of turbines although this channel is far away from the turbine array the maximum velocity at point 4 decreases from 1 57 m s to 1 00 m s name about 36 decline the velocity variation during the tidal period becomes flat differences caused by different turbine array layout are negligible fig 13 e shows that the deployment of the turbine array has insignificant effect on the tidal stream velocity in the channel between smallhulu island and reefs which is far away from the turbines peak velocity however appears slightly earlier during the ebb tide and decreases a little during the flooding phase 4 conclusion in this paper a two dimensional numerical model is developed based on opentidalfarm the measured data from the demonstrative project of tidal stream energy in zhoushan island are used to validate the numerical model the validated model is then used to simulate the tidal steam around zhoushan islands and to calculate the energy extractions by 18 turbines with three layouts the wake characteristics of these three turbine array layouts are also studied the optimal layout for extracting tidal stream energy is the unstructured layout in this layout both the first row and second row of the turbines can extract energy from not decelerated tidal stream the tidal stream velocity at the third row also recovers after a long distance away from second row of turbines as well as accelerated by the blockage effect induced by the second row for the two structured regular and staggered layouts their energy extractions are almost the same namely 6 15 10 4 kw h for the regular layout and 6 24 10 4 kw h for the staggered layout this is partly because the direction of the tidal stream is not always perpendicular to the tidal turbines which reduces the difference between the regular layout and staggered layout in this study the energy extraction from the optimized layout is much higher at 6 56 10 4 kw h which is about 5 higher than the energy outputs of those two structured layouts five locations are selected to investigate the peak velocity variation in the wake area results show that the maximum deceleration in the wake of the turbine array not only takes place behind the last row of the turbine array it may also occurs at locations e g point 2 where the wake flow mixes completely in the far area such as at point 4 and 5 the difference of the influence between these three layouts is insignificant this means that the deployment of the turbine array can make a huge difference to the velocity distribution but there is no big difference for the velocity distribution variations caused by these three layouts this study shows that in the real ocean field tidal stream turbines can be deployed in unstructured layout in order to achieve a high energy extraction efficiency therefore it is important to deploy turbines in a way that the spacing between the adjacent rows is sufficiently large so that the downstream turbines can benefit from the great tidal flow velocity recovery authors contribution section authors contribution towards the paper investigation of array layout of tidal

22217,the wake characteristics of an axial flow hydrokinetic turbine were investigated for various tip speed ratios using velocity measurements and a flow visualization technique the experimental results showed that the structures of the wake within six rotor diameters downstream of the turbine are significantly affected by a change in the tip speed ratio as a tip speed ratio decreases the core region of the wake that is featured by low axial velocity near the turbine rotor hub became more unstable producing higher turbulence levels in the radial and azimuthal directions it resulted in different growth rates of the shear layer that expands from the core region toward the outer part of the wake and that interacts with the tip vortices to trigger wake meandering it turns out that the swirl number of the wake is a key factor that determines the stability of the core region in the near wake region at locations more than six rotor diameters away from the turbines the mean and turbulence characteristics became nearly independent of the change in the tip speed ratio this was due to large scale turbulent mixing whose size was in the order of the rotor diameter keywords hydrokinetic energy axial flow turbine wake turbulence 1 introduction over the last decade hydrokinetic energy has received international attention as a viable source of renewable energy because of its advantages over other renewable energy sources which include its lower dependence on weather conditions and lower impact on the human society and the environment compared to wind farms or hydroelectric power plants the amount of globally available hydrokinetic energy from waves and tidal currents is estimated to be approximately 1550 tw h yr yuce and muratoglu 2015 over the last decade there has been significant progress in the development of hydrokinetic energy conversion technologies examples of industrial hydrokinetic turbines include the verdant power turbine installed in the east river new york city usa gunawan et al 2014 openhydro hs1000 ar1000 and voith turbines at the european marine energy centre emec tidal energy test site facility zhou et al 2014 and the seagen s turbine installed in strangford lough in northern ireland zhou et al 2014 nevertheless until now only a few pre commercial turbine arrays have been installed yuce and muratoglu 2015 laws and epps 2016 comprehensive reviews on recent advances in the hydrokinetic energy technology can be found in khan et al 2009 lago et al 2010 yuce and muratoglu 2015 and laws and epps 2016 various types of hydrokinetic devices have been proposed so far which include horizontal and vertical axis turbines cross flow turbines and devices based on vortex induced vibrations khan et al 2009 horizontal axis or axial flow turbines among others have been studied extensively by researchers over the past several decades because of their similarity to wind turbines which enables efficient extraction of the flow energy in rivers or tidal channels although many of the previous studies on axial turbines have focused on measuring or predicting the thrust torque or power of turbine blades bahaj et al 2007a batten et al 2008 maganga et al 2010 birjandi et al 2013 mycek et al 2014 kolekar and banerjee 2015 blackmore et al 2016 ouro et al 2017 another group of studies has been directed toward a better understanding of the turbulence and flow structures in the wake of the turbines the latter research area is particularly important for a more efficient design of hydrokinetic turbine arrays where the mean velocity and turbulence levels in the wake of a turbine in a row can significantly affect the power output and load of the turbines in the next row s to date several studies have attempted to investigate the wake characteristics of an axial flow hydrokinetic turbine myers and bahaj 2007 bahaj et al 2007b kang et al 2012 chamorro et al 2013b neary et al 2013 chamorro et al 2013a kang et al 2014 stallard et al 2015 morandi et al 2016 chen et al 2017 chawdhary et al 2017 myers and bahaj 2007 measured the water surface elevation profiles in the wake of a 1 40 scale d 0 4 m d is the diameter three bladed marine current turbine with diameter of 0 4 m in an open channel flume to study the interaction between the water surface and turbine wake bahaj et al 2007b measured the mean streamwise velocity and turbulence intensity in the wake of a porous mesh disc of d 0 1 m in an open channel flume using an acoustic doppler velocimetry adv while the above studies investigated the wake characteristics using water surface measurements or an unrealistic model turbine recent studies have attempted to investigate the flow field in the wake of realistic axial flow hydrokinetic turbines using detailed velocity measurements or high resolution eddy resolving numerical simulations kang et al 2012 simulated the flow past a field scale three bladed commercial axial flow turbine d 5 m installed in the east river new york city usa using a large eddy simulation les model by using 185 million grid nodes the les was capable of resolving the full turbine geometry including the blades and nacelle the computed result showed that the turbine wake consisted of the three distinct regions the outer layer featured by the blade tip vortices the inner layer rotating in the opposite direction to the rotor and the core layer with very low axial velocity near the hub later neary et al 2013 measured the velocity profiles in the wake of a 1 10 scale d 0 5 m hydrokinetic turbine in an open channel flume which had the same blade design as in kang et al 2012 using an adv and acoustic doppler profiler adp they reported that 80 recovery of the inflow velocity was achieved approximately ten diameters downstream from the turbine rotor chamorro et al 2013b measured the instantaneous flow around a miniature hydrokinetic turbine using volumetric three component velocimetry and observed the instability of the wake caused by the interaction between the blade tip vortices chamorro et al 2013a measured the velocity fields using an adv in the wake of the same turbine as that of neary et al 2013 the experimental result showed a sign of the wake meandering phenomenon downstream of the turbine which manifested itself as a low frequency peak in the measured velocity spectra the large scale meandering of the wake which had been observed also for wind turbines medici and alfredsson 2006 2008 okulov et al 2014 was further investigated by kang et al 2014 using high resolution numerical simulations they carried out a turbine geometry resolved les for the experiment of chamorro et al 2013a and discovered that the wake meandering phenomenon can be initiated by the merging of the rotor tip shear layers or the collision of the precessing vortex system near the hub with blade tip vortices they also found that the wake meandering caused significant increase in turbulence levels in the wake recently chen et al 2017 experimentally studied the wake characteristics of a three bladed model hydrokinetic turbine using an adv they observed that the maximum circumferential velocity was approximately 20 of the streamwise velocity in the wake and showed that it had a significant influence on the process of the near wake mixing in addition to the above studies significant research efforts have been made for understanding the wake characteristics of wind turbines iungo et al 2013 howard et al 2015 ashton et al 2016 santoni et al 2017 foti et al 2016 2018 yang and sotiropoulos 2018 wind turbines typically have a lower nacelle to rotor diameter ratio than hydrokinetic turbines howard et al 2015 foti et al 2016 despite their different turbine design compared to hydrokinetic turbines recent studies showed that wind turbines may exhibit similar wake characteristics as those observed for hydrokinetic turbines more specifically iungo et al 2013 howard et al 2015 and foti et al 2016 observed the far wake meandering of wind turbines can be caused by large scale spiral instability of the hub vortex in a similar way as observed for hydrokinetic turbines kang et al 2014 this suggests suggest that the hub vortex instability could be ubiquitous in both wind and hydrokinetic turbine wakes howard et al 2015 despite the above mentioned previous studies our current understanding of the wake characteristics of an axial flow hydrokinetic turbine is far from being complete it is not only because only a few studies have presented detailed velocity measurements around such a turbine but also because the previous studies have mostly focused on a turbine operating at the specific tip speed ratio tsr that typically maximizes the rotor power stallard et al 2013 chamorro et al 2013a kang et al 2014 tedds et al 2014 chen et al 2017 however an optimal tsr will not necessarily yield the overall maximum power output in turbine arrays for example adaramola and krogstad 2011 showed that the performance of a downstream wind turbine depends strongly on the tsr of the upstream turbine more specifically they observed the lowest power coefficient of a downstream turbine when the upstream turbine was operated at its peak efficiency optimal tsr at low or high tsrs for the upstream turbine more energy was extracted from the downstream turbine likewise the optimal design of hydrokinetic turbine arrays should be preceded by the understanding of the wake characteristics for different tsrs so far only a few studies have investigated the effect of the tsr on the wake characteristics chamorro et al 2013a compared the mean velocity deficit at the hub height for different tsrs ranging from 2 9 to 7 7 they found that a change in tsr slightly affects the wake recovery patterns up to fifteen rotor diameters downstream okulov et al 2014 examined the instantaneous flow field around a three bladed wind turbine rotor submerged in water for three different tsrs they found that velocity spectra in the wake shows almost a constant strouhal number approximately 0 23 for different tsrs this study is motivated by the need to investigate in detail the wake structures downstream of an axial flow hydrokinetic turbine under different tsr conditions to that end we performed open channel flume experiments for a three bladed axial flow hydrokinetic turbine with d 0 16 m which has the same blade geometry as those studied in other previous works kang et al 2012 neary et al 2013 chamorro et al 2013a kang et al 2014 chawdhary et al 2017 four tsrs 4 15 5 10 6 10 and 7 17 were considered the velocities were measured using an adv from x d 2 to 20 where x is the streamwise distance from the rotor plane using the measured velocity data the contours and profiles of the first and second order velocity statistics were obtained and compared for different tsrs the velocity spectra at various locations were analyzed to identify the dominant frequency components and characteristic scales of turbulence in the wake region dye release experiments were performed to visualize the wake structure near the hub height rotor axis the effect of the turbine supporting structures was also examined by conducting two additional experiments for a turbine without a rotor and a turbine without a rotor and nacelle 2 experimental set up the experiment was conducted in an open channel flume athanyang university seoul south korea the dimension of the flume was of 18 m 0 9 m and 0 4 m in the streamwise spanwise and vertical directions respectively the sidewalls of the flume were made of glass and the bed was made of polyvinyl chloride pvc the turbine used in this study has the same blade geometry as the gen4 verdant power turbine three bladed horizontal axis turbines with 5 m in diameter the turbine was developed by verdant power as part of the roosevelt island tidal energy rite project which aims to install a 1 05 mw arrays of thirty 35 kw turbines in the east channel of the east river see kang et al 2012 gunawan et al 2014 for more details currently the individual turbines have been successfully deployed in the channel and turbine arrays are planned to be installed in 10 triframe arrangements sets of three turbines mounted on the apexes of a common triangular base similar model turbines based on the gen4 turbine have been also used in other previous studies kang et al 2012 neary et al 2013 chamorro et al 2013a kang et al 2014 hill et al 2016 chawdhary et al 2017 the model turbine with the diameter of d 0 16 m approximately a 1 31 scale model of the gen4 turbine was manufactured using an ultimaker 2 3d printer with polylactic acid pla plastic filament then the 3d printed rotor nacelle and tower were assembled with a dc motor that was connected to an external power supply because pla is insoluble in water the turbine could be operated underwater for long periods of time without any problem the geometry of the turbine is presented in fig 1 as seen the turbine consists of the tower nacelle and rotor with the three blades and nose a tsr λ is defined as the ratio of the tangential speed of the blade tip to the mean incoming flow speed at the hub height u 0 flume experiments were conducted for four different tsrs under the same inflow condition according to the curve of the power coefficient as a function of the tsr for a turbine with the same blade geometry presented in chamorro et al 2013a the optimal tsr was approximately 5 8 in the present study the four tsrs were determined in such a way that two tsrs 4 15 and 5 10 are lower than and the other two 6 10 and 7 17 are higher than the optimal tsr during each experiment by adjusting the current from an external power supply to the dc motor the angular speed of the turbine rotor was changed to a fixed value which yielded a specific tsr the experimental conditions are summarized in table 1 the schematic of the turbine and flume are shown in fig 2 as can be seen the turbine is installed at the spanwise center and 7 m downstream of the inlet in a way that the rotor axis is aligned with the streamwise direction in the figure x y and z indicate the coordinates in the axial streamwise spanwise and vertical directions respectively x 0 is located at the rotor plane y 0 is at the spanwise center and z 0 is at the bed another variable r is defined to be a distance from the hub height in the z direction therefore r 0 indicates the rotor axis and r 0 and r 0 denote the region above and below the hub height respectively instantaneous three dimensional velocities were collected using an adv nortek vectrino profiler at the sampling rate of 100 hz for 480 s for all cases the velocities were measured in the x z plane through the center of the rotor for the tsrs of λ 5 10 and 7 17 the velocities were collected in the range of 0 32 m x 3 2 m and 0 016 m z 0 316 m which corresponds to 2 x d 20 and 0 1 z d 1 975 or 0 75 r d 1 125 in the other two cases with λ 4 15 and 6 10 the velocities were measured along the straight line through the rotor axis y 0 and r 0 for all cases the streamwise measurement locations were x d 2 1 0 5 0 8 1 2 1 6 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 12 5 15 17 5 and 20 the vertical measurement resolution for the cases with λ 5 10 and 7 17 was 0 01 m the number of measurement points for the cases with λ 5 10 and 7 17 was 31 19 589 and that for the other two cases with λ 4 15 and 6 10 was 19 therefore the total number of measurement points for all cases was 1216 because the velocity was sampled for 480 s the total measurement time was approximately 162 h to avoid measurement errors and also to check reproducibility of the results the velocity at each point was measured several times on different days 3 results and discussions in this section the experimental results will be presented and analyzed to investigate the flow dynamics in the wake of the axial flow turbine for different tsrs before advancing in the investigation we define the variables and notations that will be used in the rest of this paper u v and w are the instantaneous velocity components in the x y and z direction respectively q indicates the time averaging operation for a variable q and q denotes the fluctuating component of q i e q q q 3 1 effect of turbine supporting structure before investigating the flow field in the wake of the turbine with the rotating blades the effect of the turbine supporting structure is investigated for the turbine with the rotor removed to separately assess the effects of the nacelle and tower in a quantitative manner velocities were measured at x 0 5 d for the two incomplete turbines one without the nacelle and rotor i e with the tower alone and the other without the rotor i e with the tower and nacelle fig 3 shows the vertical profiles of u u u v v and w w at x d 1 and 0 5 the measured inflow profile shows that the streamwise turbulence intensity u u u 0 of the incoming flow at and above the hub height was approximately 4 and that near the bottom tip was approximately 7 as can be seen the maximum velocity deficit produced by the tower is approximately 30 of the hub height velocity u 0 and occurs near the bottom blade tip height r 0 5 d at this location high reynolds stresses are also observed which indicate the presence of turbulent shear layers moreover it can also be seen that the nacelle introduces approximately a 20 additional mean velocity deficit near the hub height the nacelle also creates additional reynolds stress peaks near the hub height which are the signatures of the shear layer generated around the nacelle the present result suggests that the presence of the tower and nacelle gives rise to the development of multiple turbulent shear layers emanating from the surfaces of the nacelle and tower which are shown to significantly increase the turbulence level particularly in the spanwise direction and produce a considerable large velocity deficit at locations below the hub height such effects are likely to exist even when the rotating rotor blades are present especially in the lower half of the wake which may disrupt the evolution of the tip vortices near the bottom tip fig 4 shows the dimensionless power spectral density of the spanwise and vertical velocity fluctuations e v v and e w w respectively at the hub and bottom tip heights in the case with the tower and nacelle at the hub height a noticeable spectral peak is found in the v spectra at the frequency f of 2 3 hz which corresponds to the strouhal number of s t h u b 0 26 based on the nacelle diameter and the hub height velocity in both cases at the bottom tip height spectral peaks are found at similar frequencies in the v spectra for the cases with only the tower and with the tower and nacelle the peaks occur at f 2 5 and 2 9 hz respectively the presence of the nacelle seems to slightly modify the frequency but not significantly the strouhal numbers for those frequencies based on the approach velocity at the bottom tip height 0 9 u 0 and the tower diameter are in the range between 0 16 and 0 18 it is worth comparing the above observed strouhal numbers with those observed in the wake of two and three dimensional bluff bodies the reynolds numbers based on the approach velocities and dimensions of the nacelle and tower are approximately 5000 and 2000 respectively at reynolds numbers of the order of 1 0 3 the strouhal numbers of the vortex shedding from a sphere sakamoto and haniu 1990 and circular cylinder catalano et al 2003 are approximately 0 2 and that from a square cylinder is approximately 0 15 okajima 1982 the fact that the strouhal numbers at the hub height and bottom tip are of a similar order of magnitude to those values suggests that the above observed spectral peaks are associated with vortex shedding around the hub and tower moreover the presence of the peaks only in the v spectra not in the w spectra indicates that the vortex shedding motions at those two locations are nearly two dimensional in the x y planes 3 2 mean velocity and reynolds stress fields in what follows the detailed measurements of the mean velocity and reynolds stresses in the wake for the λ 5 10 and 7 17 cases will be presented and the differences in the mean flow structures for the two cases will be investigated 3 2 1 mean velocity field the contours for the dimensionless mean velocities in the x and y directions are shown and compared for the two tsrs λ 5 10 and 7 17 in fig 5 the u and v contours for both tsrs clearly show that the near wake consists of the outer wake region r 0 5 d generated by the blade tip vortices which rotates in the same direction as the blades the inner wake region r 0 25 d that counter rotates with respect to the outer one and the core region r 0 having a low axial velocity this observation for the mean flow is consistent with the instantaneous wake structure of a field scale gen4 turbine which had the same blade geometry observed by kang et al 2012 the main differences in the velocity contours for the two tsrs are as follows at λ 5 10 the azimuthal velocity magnitude is much lower in the outer wake region but higher in the inner wake region moreover the axial velocity in the core region is much lower at this tsr it is worth observing that the v contours are not symmetric around the rotor axis at both tsrs the magnitudes of v near the lower tip height are much smaller than those at the top tip height this is possibly due to the influence of the vortex shedding induced by the tower upstream of the rotor which was discussed in section 3 1 the above observations demonstrate that a change in tsr can significantly affect the mean velocity field in the wake of the turbine especially within five rotor diameters more specifically with a decreasing tsr the outer wake region becomes weaker while the inner and core wake regions become much stronger according to kang et al 2014 the spatial growth of the core region is associated with the onset of wake meandering in the far wake thus the differences in the size of the core region may lead to different wake meandering processes which will be investigated in section 3 2 2 3 2 2 reynolds stress fields the contours of the dimensionless reynolds stresses u u v v w w and u w are shown in fig 6 for the cases λ 5 10 and 7 17 in both cases the development of a very thin shear layer marked by high turbulent stresses is seen near the top tip height r 0 5 d this shear layer is associated with the tip vortices induced by the rotation of the blades near the bottom tip however such a thin shear layer is not observed this is due to the influence of the vortex shedding by the upstream tower which interacts with the tip vortices increasing the incoming turbulence levels that may cause the breakdown of the tip vortices the shear layers at both the top and bottom tips gradually expand toward the rotor axis as the flow moves downstream another region with high turbulent stresses is found in the core region near the rotor axis it is remarkable that a thin layer with the high v v and w w reynolds stresses is seen near the hub height between 0 5 d x 4 d and their magnitudes are much larger in the lower tsr case this indicates that the core region of the wake is associated with high turbulent fluctuations in the lateral i e radial and azimuthal directions a signature of the core region can be also found in the u w contours in the λ 5 10 case thin layers with positive and negative values of u w form around the rotor axis which imply increased turbulence levels due to large axial velocity gradients near the core region the reynolds stress contours clearly show that the development of the core region is largely different for the two cases in the λ 5 10 case the core region expands radially toward the outer wake as the flow moves downstream and the enlarged core region interacts with the top tip shear layer between x 2 d and 3 d to generate a significant increase in the u u this process is quite similar to that observed in the les by kang et al 2014 who demonstrated that the wake meandering phenomenon is initiated by means of the interactions of the shear layers from the blade tips and core region contrarily in the λ 7 17 case the size of the core region remains nearly the same over a distance and consequently the core region shows little interaction with the shear layers from the blade tips until x 4 d where the shear layers from the top and bottom tips merge together because of the different behaviors of the core region the λ 7 17 case shows a delayed onset of wake meandering and significantly lower maximum u u compared to the other case the present result indicates that a change in tsr affects the stability of the core region which also affects the onset of wake meandering 3 2 3 swirl numbers it has been well documented in the literature that the stability of swirling flow depends on the swirl number which is the relative strength of the rotational swirling velocity component to the axial component although there can be various ways to define that number the simplest expression for that is the ratio of the maximum tangential velocity u θ m a x to the minimum axial one u m i n alekseenko et al 1999 i e u θ m a x u m i n using this definition the swirl number was calculated for each streamwise location using the velocity data the velocities within the region of 0 4 d r 0 4 d were used for the calculation to assess the stability of the inner wake region the streamwise variations of the swirl number for the cases λ 5 10 and 7 17 are plotted in fig 7 between the rotor plane and x 4 d the λ 5 10 case shows a much higher swirl number than the other case the maximum swirl number of the λ 5 10 case is nearly four times larger than that of the other case in both cases the swirl number is largest at the location closest to the rotor x 0 5 d in between 0 5 d x 5 d the swirl numbers for λ 5 10 and 7 17 decay over a dimensionless distance x d with the exponential decay rates of approximately 0 7 and 0 5 respectively a key finding from figs 6 and 7 is that the stability of the core region largely depends on the tsr and moreover the core region structure can significantly affect the near wake structure particularly under low tsr conditions namely a decreasing tsr tends to increase the swirl number and destabilize the core region of the wake which results in the formation of shear layers around the rotor axis that expands radially toward the blade tips at λ 5 10 those shear layers from the core region collide with that from the blade tips at between x d 2 and 3 which leads to an abrupt and significant increase in the reynolds stresses this is the mechanism of the onset of wake meandering that was previously discovered for hydrokinetic kang et al 2014 and wind turbines iungo et al 2013 howard et al 2015 foti et al 2016 our result strongly supports that the location of the onset of wake meandering largely depends on the tsr value after the onset of wake meandering the entire wake region experiences high levels of turbulent mixing as a result at approximately x 6 d the influence of the tsr on the wake becomes negligible and the velocity and reynolds stress contours for the two different tsrs become nearly indistinguishable 3 2 4 wake characteristics at the hub height in fig 8 the streamwise variations of the mean axial velocity deficit 1 u u 0 and reynolds normal stresses measured at the hub height are plotted for the cases λ 4 15 5 10 6 10 and 7 17 the figure clearly shows that the mean velocity deficit decreases with the tsr in the region x 5 d based on such a trend it can be speculated that the core region size also decreases with the tsr this figure further reinforces our previous finding that the wake characteristics become nearly independent of the tsr downstream of x d 6 it is worth comparing the velocity deficit at a specific location with those reported in other studies for instance the velocity deficit at the hub height at x 10 d is approximately 18 for all tsrs in our case this number is nearly the same as the value reported by neary et al 2013 who conducted experiments for a hydrokinetic turbine which had the same blade design as the current one operating under the condition of λ 5 8 r e 4 6 1 0 5 and 6 blockage chen et al 2017 however reported a significantly lower velocity deficit i e faster wake recovery 11 1 at x 10 d for a different three bladed turbine under the condition of λ 3 53 r e 3 19 1 0 5 and 16 blockage the difference might have been due to either a different blade design or a larger blockage ratio compared to that in our case a large blockage ratio typically causes an acceleration of the flow outside the wake which in turn increases the rate of turbulent mixing across the boundaries of the wake and also increases the rate of the wake recovery given that the wake characteristics at x 10 d are unlikely to be significantly affected by a rotor design the lower velocity deficit observed by chen et al 2017 could be due to the high blockage ratio in the experiment this suggests that the choice of a sufficiently low blockage ratio is important both in the experimental as well as numerical studies of hydrokinetic turbines in a finite width channel since a higher blockage ratio may result in a faster wake recovery or under prediction of the velocity deficit in the wake the streamwise variations of the reynolds stresses show that all normal stress components tend to decrease with the tsr in the region of x 5 d however the patterns of the variations are markedly different between u u and v v and w w u u rapidly decays from the rotor plane to x 3 d and subsequently increases up to x 6 d however v v and w w tend to increase from the rotor plane to x 1 2 d 1 6 d and subsequently decrease up to x 6 d high values of u u are presumably associated with large scale wake meandering whereas high values of v v and w w might be associated with the instability of the core region which gives rise to lateral fluctuations at approximately six rotor diameters downstream all three reynolds stress components become nearly independent of the tsr 3 3 flow visualization to identify the instantaneous wake structures in the near wake flow visualization experiments were performed for the cases λ 5 10 and 7 17 a red colored dye was released in the vicinity of the hub while the turbine was rotating and photographs were taken to capture the instantaneous wake structures the result is shown in fig 9 at λ 5 10 the released dye expands radially toward the outer wakes but at λ 7 17 the dye remains near the rotor axis up to x 1 5 d the distributions of the dye for both cases are qualitatively similar to the v v and w w contours shown in fig 6 the radial spreading of the dye with respect to the rotor axis shown in fig 9 may be induced by the radial turbulent fluctuations in the y z plane which is measured by w w for that reason the contour lines of w w u 0 2 0 003 were embedded in the figure as can be observed the extent of the dye cloud shows remarkably good agreement with the contour lines of the constant w w the flow visualization result clearly demonstrates that the core region size grows with a decreasing tsr it is also shown that the radial turbulence fluctuations play an important role for the growth of the core region 3 4 analysis of velocity spectra in this section the power spectral densities of velocity fluctuations e for the velocity fluctuations in the x y and z directions which are denoted as e u u e v v and e w w respectively are investigated at various locations in the wake fig 10 shows the dimensionless premultiplied power spectral densities f e u 0 2 for the three velocity fluctuations at the hub height the spectra are plotted for the locations x 0 5 d which is closest to the rotor x 1 2 d and 1 6 d where the lateral turbulent fluctuations v v and w w showed maximum values for the λ 4 15 5 10 and 6 10 cases see fig 8 and x 7 d and 10 d where both velocity and reynolds stresses became independent of the tsrs at x 0 5 d spectral peaks appear at approximately f 1 hz for the cases λ 4 15 and 5 10 which corresponds to the strouhal number s t f d u 0 of approximately 0 8 iungo et al 2013 and viola et al 2014 observed a spectral peak connected to hub vortex oscillations at the frequency equal to 0 34 times the rotor rotational frequency near the hub of a wind turbine d 0 15 m howard et al 2015 on the other hand observed a spectral peak at s t 0 8 for a wind turbine d 0 128 m and foti et al 2016 observed a spectral peak at s t 0 8 for wind turbines of variable sizes d 0 128 m 1 1 m 27 m and 96 m and designs the comparison shows that the peak strouhal numbers observed at x 0 5 d and r 0 in the cases λ 4 15 and 5 10 are very similar to those observed by howard et al 2015 and foti et al 2016 unlike the findings of iungo et al 2013 and viola et al 2014 however the strouhal number associated with the hub vortex instability seems to be independent of the rotor frequency in our cases at x 1 2 d and 1 6 d spectral peaks are clearly visible at f 0 4 hz in the e v v and e w w spectra for all tsrs that frequency corresponds to the strouhal number of approximately 0 3 it can be concluded that those two locations in the core region exhibit nearly the same strouhal number which is independent of the tsr i e blade frequency the e v v and e w w spectra at x 7 d and 10 d also show the existence of spectral peaks at similar frequencies to that found in the previous two locations with significantly smaller energy density the occurrence of the spectral peaks at s t 0 3 both in the near and far wake regions indicates that the turbulence fluctuations at the location where the core region instability is initiated have the same frequency as that of the wake meandering in the far wake such as those observed in chamorro et al 2013a and kang et al 2014 and the meandering frequency is observed as early as x 1 d the strouhal number s t 0 3 observed herein is similar to that s t 0 28 measured four rotor diameters downstream of an axial flow turbine having the same blade geometry chamorro et al 2013a in fig 11 the e v v spectra across the vertical extent of the wake region see the top figure are compared for the cases λ 5 10 and 7 17 the velocity spectra for the case without the turbine rotor see fig 3 are also shown for comparison purposes at the top tip height r 0 5 d of profile 1 x 0 5 d spectral peaks are clearly observed at the frequency of the blades f b l a d e and its harmonics for both tsrs they are signatures of the tip vortices at the top tip height as can be seen at λ 7 17 the tip vortices at the top tip persist for up to x 2 d while at λ 5 10 they are clearly visible only at x 0 5 d this can be explained by a trend of increasing strength of the tip vortices with a higher tsr observed for a wind turbine whale et al 2000 the spectra near the bottom tip show no sign of the tip vortices instead spectral peaks occur at between f 2 and 3 hz where the vortex shedding due to the upstream tower occurs this result demonstrates that the incoming turbulence induced by the turbine supporting structure causes the breakdown of the tip vortices near the hub height it is seen in profile 1 that as the location becomes closer from the hub height to the bottom tip height the spectra also become similar to that measured without the rotor at r 0 6 d of profile 1 the spectra look nearly identical to that without the rotor dashed line at the hub height r 0 of profile 1 x 0 5 d spectral peaks at the frequency of the blades are not seen which means that the motion of the core region is decoupled from the blade rotation instead there is a notable increase in the energy densities at frequencies lower than 1 hz which is possibly associated with the onset of wake meandering motion at s t 0 3 at r 0 125 d and r 0 25 d which are part of the inner wake region where the azimuthal velocity has the opposite sign to that of the blades and turbulence levels are very low see figs 5 and 6 the spectral peaks for the blade frequency are still observed although they show lower energy density levels than that at the top tip this indicates that the inner wake can be viewed as a core rotating as a solid body in the opposite direction to the blades with low turbulence levels it can also be seen from the spectra in the inner wake region that the energy densities in low frequency ranges f 1 hz tend to increase with an increasing axial distance this is associated with the expansion of the core region while moving downstream which decreases the frequencies of the energy containing eddies to quantitatively assess the distributions of turbulence energy across different scales the cumulative energy fraction γ u u guala et al 2006 for the axial velocity fluctuations is calculated γ u u is defined as 1 γ u u f f e u u f d f 0 e u u f d f which implies the cumulative contribution to u u from all frequencies from f to γ u u f at the hub height is compared for λ 4 15 5 10 6 10 and 7 17 in fig 12 the horizontal axis shows the frequency made dimensionless by the local mean velocity u and d as can be seen the γ u u curves tend to move toward the low frequency side in the regions between x 0 5 d and x 5 d with an increasing tsr in this region therefore a frequency of turbulence for the same value of γ u u becomes smaller with an increasing tsr downstream of x 5 d however the curves nearly collapse into single curves which means the frequency of turbulence seldom depends on the tsr the above result clearly shows the dependence of the scale of turbulence on the tsr to quantify the representative turbulence scales for different tsrs the characteristic frequency of turbulence f 50 is defined to be the frequency that yields γ u u f 50 0 5 namely the energy fraction contained in f f 50 or f f 50 accounts for 50 of the total energy the streamwise variations of the dimensionless frequency f 50 d u is plotted in fig 13 by using taylor s frozen turbulence hypothesis one can convert a frequency f to f u k k is the wavenumber which yields f 50 d u k 50 d therefore the dimensionless frequency on the vertical axes in fig 13 can be viewed as the characteristic wavenumber made dimensionless by d or the inverse of the characteristic eddy size made dimensionless by d the figure shows that in the region of x 2 d the dimensionless wavenumbers for all tsrs decay nearly exponentially with a dimensionless distance see the bottom figure in semi logarithmic scale with he exponential decay rate of approximately 1 5 it means that the spatial scale of turbulence rapidly grows which must be associated with the expansion of the core region observed in the reynolds stress contours in 2 d x 6 d the wavenumbers still decay exponentially but with a smaller decay rate approximately 0 5 in this region the growth rate of the eddy size becomes moderate as it is related to the turbulent mixing process across the entire wake i e wake meandering induced by the merging of the shear layers from the tips and core region downstream of x 6 d the decay rate is negligibly small and the curves for different tsrs look almost identical to each other the dimensionless wavenumber at locations more than ten rotor diameters away from the rotor is approximately between 0 4 and 0 5 indicating that the characteristic eddy size in the far wake region is approximately equal to two rotor diameters 4 summary and conclusion laboratory experiments were carried out to investigate the wake characteristics of axial flow hydrokinetic turbines under the same inflow condition with different tsrs the velocities were measured using an adv up to twenty rotor diameters downstream of the turbine and flow visualization experiments were also conducted to reveal the flow structures in the near wake the experimental results provided evidences that a change in tsr can significant affect the mean flow and reynolds stress fields along with the scale of turbulence especially in the region within six rotor diameters downstream the findings of the present study are summarized below the turbine supporting structure was found to have rather significant effects on the turbine wake in the absence of the rotating rotor the nacelle and tower generated separate shear layers introducing a velocity deficit of up to 30 the velocity spectra showed that the shear layers induce periodic motions associated with vortex shedding around the structures the vortex shedding from the tower structure was found to interact with the wake near the bottom tip height to cause the breakdown of the tip vortices it is important to mention that those effects will certainly depend on the location and geometry of the tower and nacelle which means they can be mitigated to some extent the mean velocity and reynolds stress contours for λ 5 10 and 7 17 showed that the wake consisted of the outer wake surrounded by the tip vortices the inner wake that counter rotates with respect to the outer one and the core region with very low velocity the flow field for the lower tsr showed a larger mean velocity deficit near the hub height and a larger azimuthal velocity magnitude in the inner wake region the lower tsr case also showed a more unstable core region featured by radially expanding shear layers around the rotor axis with increased turbulent stresses in the azimuthal and radial directions the expansions of the shear layers continued until they collided with the other shear layers originating from the blade tips which triggered the wake meandering phenomenon the different behaviors of the core region led to the different locations of the wake meandering the different turbulence characteristics in the core region for the above mentioned two cases λ 5 10 and 7 17 were explained using the swirl number which has been known to be responsible for the stability of the swirling flow the maximum swirl number of the turbine wake for the λ 5 10 case was approximately four times larger than that for the λ 7 17 case in both cases the swirl number decayed exponentially in the streamwise direction and it became negligibly small at locations more than six rotor diameters away from the turbine the dye release experiment for the λ 5 10 revealed the formation of a core region rapidly expanding toward the top and bottom tips which was consistent with the reynolds stress contours at λ 7 17 on the contrary the core region was nearly stable in both cases the extent of the core region marked by the released dye showed very good correlation with a constant value of w w which means the velocity fluctuations in the radial direction is responsible for the radial diffusion of the core the premultiplied velocity spectra at the hub height for λ 4 15 5 10 6 10 and 7 17 showed that the same spectral peaks were found at s t 0 3 for all cases both in the near and far wake locations this result indicates that the core region in the vicinity of the rotor plane also has the same frequency as that of the wake meandering found in the far wake and that frequency is observed as early as x 1 d the velocity spectra for λ 5 10 and 7 17 showed that spectral peaks were found at the frequency of the blade at the top tip height as a result of the evolution of the tip vortices the spectra in the inner wake region also showed peaks at the blade frequency suggesting that the region rotates at the same frequency as that of the blades meanwhile the core region showed a significant increase in the energy especially in the low frequency side in the spectra near the bottom tip signatures of the tip vortices were not seen because of the influence of the vortex shedding generated by the tower the streamwise profiles of the cumulative energy fraction for the axial velocity fluctuations γ u u showed that the wake at the hub height consists of three distinct regions with different rates of change in turbulence scale the first region was in 0 x 2 d where the characteristic frequency decayed almost exponentially this region was associated with the increase in the spatial scale of turbulence owing to the radial expansion of the core region the second region was in 2 d x 6 d where the frequency decayed more gradually in this region the change in turbulence scale was presumably due to the merging of the multiple shear layers from the blade tips and the core region which gives rise to turbulence mixing across the entire wake the third region was in x 6 d where the characteristic turbulence scale seldom changed the characteristic eddy size responsible in this region was found to be approximately twice the rotor diameter it is noteworthy that the third region begins where the curves of the streamwise variations of the swirl number mean velocity deficit and reynolds stresses collapsed into single curves regardless of the tsr as evidenced by the characteristic eddy size of 2 d at these locations the wake more than six rotor diameters away from the turbine location is dominated by very large eddies whose size is in the order of the rotor diameter in these locations both the mean velocity field and turbulence characteristics are no longer sensitive to the tsr because the flow is dominated by large scale turbulent mixing whose size is that of the rotor diameter the findings in this paper especially from figs 5 6 and 8 can provide useful insights for a minimum distance between axial flow hydrokinetic turbines in an array between x 0 5 d and 6 d a significant mean velocity deficit and high turbulent stresses were observed and they were found to strongly depend on tsr at x 6 d the velocity at the hub recovered to approximately 65 of the inflow velocity for all tsrs between x 6 d and 10 d the velocity recovered from 65 and 80 of the inflow velocity and between x 10 d and 15 d it recovered up to 90 of the inflow velocity based on the above results it is not recommended to place the present turbine at a distance less than 6 d in the streamwise direction because of the still large mean velocity deficit and turbulent stresses at x 6 d the turbines could be installed at a distance between x 6 d and 10 d depending on the dimension and shape of the channel where the turbine arrays are to be installed however placing them at a distance larger than 10 d may not provide significant gains since the velocity at the hub height recovered from 80 to 90 between x 10 d and 15 d although this study reports some new significant findings concerning the effects of a change in tsr on the wake characteristics of an axial flow hydrokinetic turbine it also has limitations in that the experiments were conducted for one specific turbine under the same inflow condition for a more comprehensive understanding of the roles of the tsr on the wake structures additional studies for a turbine with different blade geometries and different incoming turbulence levels will be necessary nevertheless the findings of the present study will be able to provide useful insights into the wake dynamics of an axial flow hydrokinetic turbine and furthermore the experimental results presented herein could serve as useful data for the validation of numerical models for simulating flows around axial flow hydrokinetic turbines using either the turbine geometry resolving approach kang et al 2014 or turbine

22217,the wake characteristics of an axial flow hydrokinetic turbine were investigated for various tip speed ratios using velocity measurements and a flow visualization technique the experimental results showed that the structures of the wake within six rotor diameters downstream of the turbine are significantly affected by a change in the tip speed ratio as a tip speed ratio decreases the core region of the wake that is featured by low axial velocity near the turbine rotor hub became more unstable producing higher turbulence levels in the radial and azimuthal directions it resulted in different growth rates of the shear layer that expands from the core region toward the outer part of the wake and that interacts with the tip vortices to trigger wake meandering it turns out that the swirl number of the wake is a key factor that determines the stability of the core region in the near wake region at locations more than six rotor diameters away from the turbines the mean and turbulence characteristics became nearly independent of the change in the tip speed ratio this was due to large scale turbulent mixing whose size was in the order of the rotor diameter keywords hydrokinetic energy axial flow turbine wake turbulence 1 introduction over the last decade hydrokinetic energy has received international attention as a viable source of renewable energy because of its advantages over other renewable energy sources which include its lower dependence on weather conditions and lower impact on the human society and the environment compared to wind farms or

axial flow turbines among others have been studied extensively by researchers over the past several decades because of their similarity to wind turbines which enables efficient extraction of the flow energy in rivers or tidal channels although many of the previous studies on axial turbines have focused on measuring or predicting the thrust torque or power of turbine blades bahaj et al 2007a batten et al 2008 maganga et al 2010 birjandi et al 2013 mycek et al 2014 kolekar and banerjee 2015 blackmore et al 2016 ouro et al 2017 another group of studies has been directed toward a better understanding of the turbulence and flow structures in the wake of the turbines the latter research area is particularly important for a more efficient design of hydrokinetic turbine arrays where the mean velocity and turbulence levels in the wake of a turbine in a row can significantly affect the power output and load of the turbines in the next row s to date several studies have attempted to investigate the wake characteristics of an axial flow hydrokinetic turbine myers and bahaj 2007 bahaj et al 2007b kang et al 2012 chamorro et al 2013b neary et al 2013 chamorro et al 2013a kang et al 2014 stallard et al 2015 morandi et al 2016 chen et al 2017 chawdhary et al 2017 myers and bahaj 2007 measured the water surface elevation profiles in the wake of a 1 40 scale d 0 4 m d is the diameter three bladed marine current turbine with diameter of 0 4 m in an open channel flume to study the interaction between the water surface and turbine wake bahaj et al 2007b measured the mean streamwise velocity and turbulence intensity in the wake of a porous mesh disc of d 0 1 m in an open channel flume using an acoustic doppler velocimetry adv while the above studies investigated the wake characteristics using water surface measurements or an unrealistic model turbine recent studies have attempted to investigate the flow field in the wake of realistic axial flow hydrokinetic turbines using detailed velocity measurements or high resolution eddy resolving numerical simulations kang et al 2012 simulated the flow past a field scale three bladed commercial axial flow turbine d 5 m installed in the east river new york city usa using a large eddy simulation les model by using 185 million grid nodes the les was capable of resolving the full turbine geometry including the blades and nacelle the computed result showed that the turbine wake consisted of the three distinct regions the outer layer featured by the blade tip vortices the inner layer rotating in the opposite direction to the rotor and the core layer with very low axial velocity near the hub later neary et al 2013 measured the velocity profiles in the wake of a 1 10 scale d 0 5 m hydrokinetic turbine in an open channel flume which had the same blade design as in kang et al 2012 using an adv and acoustic doppler profiler adp they reported that 80 recovery of the inflow velocity was achieved approximately ten diameters downstream from the turbine rotor chamorro et al 2013b measured the instantaneous flow around a miniature hydrokinetic turbine using volumetric three component velocimetry and observed the instability of the wake caused by the interaction between the blade tip vortices chamorro et al 2013a measured the velocity fields using an adv in the wake of the same turbine as that of neary et al 2013 the experimental result showed a sign of the wake meandering phenomenon downstream of the turbine which manifested itself as a low frequency peak in the measured velocity spectra the large scale meandering of the wake which had been observed also for wind turbines medici and alfredsson 2006 2008 okulov et al 2014 was further investigated by kang et al 2014 using high resolution numerical simulations they carried out a turbine geometry resolved les for the experiment of chamorro et al 2013a and discovered that the wake meandering phenomenon can be initiated by the merging of the rotor tip shear layers or the collision of the precessing vortex system near the hub with blade tip vortices they also found that the wake meandering caused significant increase in turbulence levels in the wake recently chen et al 2017 experimentally studied the wake characteristics of a three bladed model hydrokinetic turbine using an adv they observed that the maximum circumferential velocity was approximately 20 of the streamwise velocity in the wake and showed that it had a significant influence on the process of the near wake mixing in addition to the above studies significant research efforts have been made for understanding the wake characteristics of wind turbines iungo et al 2013 howard et al 2015 ashton et al 2016 santoni et al 2017 foti et al 2016 2018 yang and sotiropoulos 2018 wind turbines typically have a lower nacelle to rotor diameter ratio than hydrokinetic turbines howard et al 2015 foti et al 2016 despite their different turbine design compared to hydrokinetic turbines recent studies showed that wind turbines may exhibit similar wake characteristics as those observed for hydrokinetic turbines more specifically iungo et al 2013 howard et al 2015 and foti et al 2016 observed the far wake meandering of wind turbines can be caused by large scale spiral instability of the hub vortex in a similar way as observed for hydrokinetic turbines kang et al 2014 this suggests suggest that the hub vortex instability could be ubiquitous in both wind and hydrokinetic turbine wakes howard et al 2015 despite the above mentioned previous studies our current understanding of the wake characteristics of an axial flow hydrokinetic turbine is far from being complete it is not only because only a few studies have presented detailed velocity measurements around such a turbine but also because the previous studies have mostly focused on a turbine operating at the specific tip speed ratio tsr that typically maximizes the rotor power stallard et al 2013 chamorro et al 2013a kang et al 2014 tedds et al 2014 chen et al 2017 however an optimal tsr will not necessarily yield the overall maximum power output in turbine arrays for example adaramola and krogstad 2011 showed that the performance of a downstream wind turbine depends strongly on the tsr of the upstream turbine more specifically they observed the lowest power coefficient of a downstream turbine when the upstream turbine was operated at its peak efficiency optimal tsr at low or high tsrs for the upstream turbine more energy was extracted from the downstream turbine likewise the optimal design of hydrokinetic turbine arrays should be preceded by the understanding of the wake characteristics for different tsrs so far only a few studies have investigated the effect of the tsr on the wake characteristics chamorro et al 2013a compared the mean velocity deficit at the hub height for different tsrs ranging from 2 9 to 7 7 they found that a change in tsr slightly affects the wake recovery patterns up to fifteen rotor diameters downstream okulov et al 2014 examined the instantaneous flow field around a three bladed wind turbine rotor submerged in water for three different tsrs they found that velocity spectra in the wake shows almost a constant strouhal number approximately 0 23 for different tsrs this study is motivated by the need to investigate in detail the wake structures downstream of an axial flow hydrokinetic turbine under different tsr conditions to that end we performed open channel flume experiments for a three bladed axial flow hydrokinetic turbine with d 0 16 m which has the same blade geometry as those studied in other previous works kang et al 2012 neary et al 2013 chamorro et al 2013a kang et al 2014 chawdhary et al 2017 four tsrs 4 15 5 10 6 10 and 7 17 were considered the velocities were measured using an adv from x d 2 to 20 where x is the streamwise distance from the rotor plane using the measured velocity data the contours and profiles of the first and second order velocity statistics were obtained and compared for different tsrs the velocity spectra at various locations were analyzed to identify the dominant frequency components and characteristic scales of turbulence in the wake region dye release experiments were performed to visualize the wake structure near the hub height rotor axis the effect of the turbine supporting structures was also examined by conducting two additional experiments for a turbine without a rotor and a turbine without a rotor and nacelle 2 experimental set up the experiment was conducted in an open channel flume athanyang university seoul south korea the dimension of the flume was of 18 m 0 9 m and 0 4 m in the streamwise spanwise and vertical directions respectively the sidewalls of the flume were made of glass and the bed was made of polyvinyl chloride pvc the turbine used in this study has the same blade geometry as the gen4 verdant power turbine three bladed horizontal axis turbines with 5 m in diameter the turbine was developed by verdant power as part of the roosevelt island tidal energy rite project which aims to install a 1 05 mw arrays of thirty 35 kw turbines in the east channel of the east river see kang et al 2012 gunawan et al 2014 for more details currently the individual turbines have been successfully deployed in the channel and turbine arrays are planned to be installed in 10 triframe arrangements sets of three turbines mounted on the apexes of a common triangular base similar model turbines based on the gen4 turbine have been also used in other previous studies kang et al 2012 neary et al 2013 chamorro et al 2013a kang et al 2014 hill et al 2016 chawdhary et al 2017 the model turbine with the diameter of d 0 16 m approximately a 1 31 scale model of the gen4 turbine was manufactured using an ultimaker 2 3d printer with polylactic acid pla plastic filament then the 3d printed rotor nacelle and tower were assembled with a dc motor that was connected to an external power supply because pla is insoluble in water the turbine could be operated underwater for long periods of time without any problem the geometry of the turbine is presented in fig 1 as seen the turbine consists of the tower nacelle and rotor with the three blades and nose a tsr λ is defined as the ratio of the tangential speed of the blade tip to the mean incoming flow speed at the hub height u 0 flume experiments were conducted for four different tsrs under the same inflow condition according to the curve of the power coefficient as a function of the tsr for a turbine with the same blade geometry presented in chamorro et al 2013a the optimal tsr was approximately 5 8 in the present study the four tsrs were determined in such a way that two tsrs 4 15 and 5 10 are lower than and the other two 6 10 and 7 17 are higher than the optimal tsr during each experiment by adjusting the current from an external power supply to the dc motor the angular speed of the turbine rotor was changed to a fixed value which yielded a specific tsr the experimental conditions are summarized in table 1 the schematic of the turbine and flume are shown in fig 2 as can be seen the turbine is installed at the spanwise center and 7 m downstream of the inlet in a way that the rotor axis is aligned with the streamwise direction in the figure x y and z indicate the coordinates in the axial streamwise spanwise and vertical directions respectively x 0 is located at the rotor plane y 0 is at the spanwise center and z 0 is at the bed another variable r is defined to be a distance from the hub height in the z direction therefore r 0 indicates the rotor axis and r 0 and r 0 denote the region above and below the hub height respectively instantaneous three dimensional velocities were collected using an adv nortek vectrino profiler at the sampling rate of 100 hz for 480 s for all cases the velocities were measured in the x z plane through the center of the rotor for the tsrs of λ 5 10 and 7 17 the velocities were collected in the range of 0 32 m x 3 2 m and 0 016 m z 0 316 m which corresponds to 2 x d 20 and 0 1 z d 1 975 or 0 75 r d 1 125 in the other two cases with λ 4 15 and 6 10 the velocities were measured along the straight line through the rotor axis y 0 and r 0 for all cases the streamwise measurement locations were x d 2 1 0 5 0 8 1 2 1 6 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 12 5 15 17 5 and 20 the vertical measurement resolution for the cases with λ 5 10 and 7 17 was 0 01 m the number of measurement points for the cases with λ 5 10 and 7 17 was 31 19 589 and that for the other two cases with λ 4 15 and 6 10 was 19 therefore the total number of measurement points for all cases was 1216 because the velocity was sampled for 480 s the total measurement time was approximately 162 h to avoid measurement errors and also to check reproducibility of the results the velocity at each point was measured several times on different days 3 results and discussions in this section the experimental results will be presented and analyzed to investigate the flow dynamics in the wake of the axial flow turbine for different tsrs before advancing in the investigation we define the variables and notations that will be used in the rest of this paper u v and w are the instantaneous velocity components in the x y and z direction respectively q indicates the time averaging operation for a variable q and q denotes the fluctuating component of q i e q q q 3 1 effect of turbine supporting structure before investigating the flow field in the wake of the turbine with the rotating blades the effect of the turbine supporting structure is investigated for the turbine with the rotor removed to separately assess the effects of the nacelle and tower in a quantitative manner velocities were measured at x 0 5 d for the two incomplete turbines one without the nacelle and rotor i e with the tower alone and the other without the rotor i e with the tower and nacelle fig 3 shows the vertical profiles of u u u v v and w w at x d 1 and 0 5 the measured inflow profile shows that the streamwise turbulence intensity u u u 0 of the incoming flow at and above the hub height was approximately 4 and that near the bottom tip was approximately 7 as can be seen the maximum velocity deficit produced by the tower is approximately 30 of the hub height velocity u 0 and occurs near the bottom blade tip height r 0 5 d at this location high reynolds stresses are also observed which indicate the presence of turbulent shear layers moreover it can also be seen that the nacelle introduces approximately a 20 additional mean velocity deficit near the hub height the nacelle also creates additional reynolds stress peaks near the hub height which are the signatures of the shear layer generated around the nacelle the present result suggests that the presence of the tower and nacelle gives rise to the development of multiple turbulent shear layers emanating from the surfaces of the nacelle and tower which are shown to significantly increase the turbulence level particularly in the spanwise direction and produce a considerable large velocity deficit at locations below the hub height such effects are likely to exist even when the rotating rotor blades are present especially in the lower half of the wake which may disrupt the evolution of the tip vortices near the bottom tip fig 4 shows the dimensionless power spectral density of the spanwise and vertical velocity fluctuations e v v and e w w respectively at the hub and bottom tip heights in the case with the tower and nacelle at the hub height a noticeable spectral peak is found in the v spectra at the frequency f of 2 3 hz which corresponds to the strouhal number of s t h u b 0 26 based on the nacelle diameter and the hub height velocity in both cases at the bottom tip height spectral peaks are found at similar frequencies in the v spectra for the cases with only the tower and with the tower and nacelle the peaks occur at f 2 5 and 2 9 hz respectively the presence of the nacelle seems to slightly modify the frequency but not significantly the strouhal numbers for those frequencies based on the approach velocity at the bottom tip height 0 9 u 0 and the tower diameter are in the range between 0 16 and 0 18 it is worth comparing the above observed strouhal numbers with those observed in the wake of two and three dimensional bluff bodies the reynolds numbers based on the approach velocities and dimensions of the nacelle and tower are approximately 5000 and 2000 respectively at reynolds numbers of the order of 1 0 3 the strouhal numbers of the vortex shedding from a sphere sakamoto and haniu 1990 and circular cylinder catalano et al 2003 are approximately 0 2 and that from a square cylinder is approximately 0 15 okajima 1982 the fact that the strouhal numbers at the hub height and bottom tip are of a similar order of magnitude to those values suggests that the above observed spectral peaks are associated with vortex shedding around the hub and tower moreover the presence of the peaks only in the v spectra not in the w spectra indicates that the vortex shedding motions at those two locations are nearly two dimensional in the x y planes 3 2 mean velocity and reynolds stress fields in what follows the detailed measurements of the mean velocity and reynolds stresses in the wake for the λ 5 10 and 7 17 cases will be presented and the differences in the mean flow structures for the two cases will be investigated 3 2 1 mean velocity field the contours for the dimensionless mean velocities in the x and y directions are shown and compared for the two tsrs λ 5 10 and 7 17 in fig 5 the u and v contours for both tsrs clearly show that the near wake consists of the outer wake region r 0 5 d generated by the blade tip vortices which rotates in the same direction as the blades the inner wake region r 0 25 d that counter rotates with respect to the outer one and the core region r 0 having a low axial velocity this observation for the mean flow is consistent with the instantaneous wake structure of a field scale gen4 turbine which had the same blade geometry observed by kang et al 2012 the main differences in the velocity contours for the two tsrs are as follows at λ 5 10 the azimuthal velocity magnitude is much lower in the outer wake region but higher in the inner wake region moreover the axial velocity in the core region is much lower at this tsr it is worth observing that the v contours are not symmetric around the rotor axis at both tsrs the magnitudes of v near the lower tip height are much smaller than those at the top tip height this is possibly due to the influence of the vortex shedding induced by the tower upstream of the rotor which was discussed in section 3 1 the above observations demonstrate that a change in tsr can significantly affect the mean velocity field in the wake of the turbine especially within five rotor diameters more specifically with a decreasing tsr the outer wake region becomes weaker while the inner and core wake regions become much stronger according to kang et al 2014 the spatial growth of the core region is associated with the onset of wake meandering in the far wake thus the differences in the size of the core region may lead to different wake meandering processes which will be investigated in section 3 2 2 3 2 2 reynolds stress fields the contours of the dimensionless reynolds stresses u u v v w w and u w are shown in fig 6 for the cases λ 5 10 and 7 17 in both cases the development of a very thin shear layer marked by high turbulent stresses is seen near the top tip height r 0 5 d this shear layer is associated with the tip vortices induced by the rotation of the blades near the bottom tip however such a thin shear layer is not observed this is due to the influence of the vortex shedding by the upstream tower which interacts with the tip vortices increasing the incoming turbulence levels that may cause the breakdown of the tip vortices the shear layers at both the top and bottom tips gradually expand toward the rotor axis as the flow moves downstream another region with high turbulent stresses is found in the core region near the rotor axis it is remarkable that a thin layer with the high v v and w w reynolds stresses is seen near the hub height between 0 5 d x 4 d and their magnitudes are much larger in the lower tsr case this indicates that the core region of the wake is associated with high turbulent fluctuations in the lateral i e radial and azimuthal directions a signature of the core region can be also found in the u w contours in the λ 5 10 case thin layers with positive and negative values of u w form around the rotor axis which imply increased turbulence levels due to large axial velocity gradients near the core region the reynolds stress contours clearly show that the development of the core region is largely different for the two cases in the λ 5 10 case the core region expands radially toward the outer wake as the flow moves downstream and the enlarged core region interacts with the top tip shear layer between x 2 d and 3 d to generate a significant increase in the u u this process is quite similar to that observed in the les by kang et al 2014 who demonstrated that the wake meandering phenomenon is initiated by means of the interactions of the shear layers from the blade tips and core region contrarily in the λ 7 17 case the size of the core region remains nearly the same over a distance and consequently the core region shows little interaction with the shear layers from the blade tips until x 4 d where the shear layers from the top and bottom tips merge together because of the different behaviors of the core region the λ 7 17 case shows a delayed onset of wake meandering and significantly lower maximum u u compared to the other case the present result indicates that a change in tsr affects the stability of the core region which also affects the onset of wake meandering 3 2 3 swirl numbers it has been well documented in the literature that the stability of swirling flow depends on the swirl number which is the relative strength of the rotational swirling velocity component to the axial component although there can be various ways to define that number the simplest expression for that is the ratio of the maximum tangential velocity u θ m a x to the minimum axial one u m i n alekseenko et al 1999 i e u θ m a x u m i n using this definition the swirl number was calculated for each streamwise location using the velocity data the velocities within the region of 0 4 d r 0 4 d were used for the calculation to assess the stability of the inner wake region the streamwise variations of the swirl number for the cases λ 5 10 and 7 17 are plotted in fig 7 between the rotor plane and x 4 d the λ 5 10 case shows a much higher swirl number than the other case the maximum swirl number of the λ 5 10 case is nearly four times larger than that of the other case in both cases the swirl number is largest at the location closest to the rotor x 0 5 d in between 0 5 d x 5 d the swirl numbers for λ 5 10 and 7 17 decay over a dimensionless distance x d with the exponential decay rates of approximately 0 7 and 0 5 respectively a key finding from figs 6 and 7 is that the stability of the core region largely depends on the tsr and moreover the core region structure can significantly affect the near wake structure particularly under low tsr conditions namely a decreasing tsr tends to increase the swirl number and destabilize the core region of the wake which results in the formation of shear layers around the rotor axis that expands radially toward the blade tips at λ 5 10 those shear layers from the core region collide with that from the blade tips at between x d 2 and 3 which leads to an abrupt and significant increase in the reynolds stresses this is the mechanism of the onset of wake meandering that was previously discovered for hydrokinetic kang et al 2014 and wind turbines iungo et al 2013 howard et al 2015 foti et al 2016 our result strongly supports that the location of the onset of wake meandering largely depends on the tsr value after the onset of wake meandering the entire wake region experiences high levels of turbulent mixing as a result at approximately x 6 d the influence of the tsr on the wake becomes negligible and the velocity and reynolds stress contours for the two different tsrs become nearly indistinguishable 3 2 4 wake characteristics at the hub height in fig 8 the streamwise variations of the mean axial velocity deficit 1 u u 0 and reynolds normal stresses measured at the hub height are plotted for the cases λ 4 15 5 10 6 10 and 7 17 the figure clearly shows that the mean velocity deficit decreases with the tsr in the region x 5 d based on such a trend it can be speculated that the core region size also decreases with the tsr this figure further reinforces our previous finding that the wake characteristics become nearly independent of the tsr downstream of x d 6 it is worth comparing the velocity deficit at a specific location with those reported in other studies for instance the velocity deficit at the hub height at x 10 d is approximately 18 for all tsrs in our case this number is nearly the same as the value reported by neary et al 2013 who conducted experiments for a hydrokinetic turbine which had the same blade design as the current one operating under the condition of λ 5 8 r e 4 6 1 0 5 and 6 blockage chen et al 2017 however reported a significantly lower velocity deficit i e faster wake recovery 11 1 at x 10 d for a different three bladed turbine under the condition of λ 3 53 r e 3 19 1 0 5 and 16 blockage the difference might have been due to either a different blade design or a larger blockage ratio compared to that in our case a large blockage ratio typically causes an acceleration of the flow outside the wake which in turn increases the rate of turbulent mixing across the boundaries of the wake and also increases the rate of the wake recovery given that the wake characteristics at x 10 d are unlikely to be significantly affected by a rotor design the lower velocity deficit observed by chen et al 2017 could be due to the high blockage ratio in the experiment this suggests that the choice of a sufficiently low blockage ratio is important both in the experimental as well as numerical studies of hydrokinetic turbines in a finite width channel since a higher blockage ratio may result in a faster wake recovery or under prediction of the velocity deficit in the wake the streamwise variations of the reynolds stresses show that all normal stress components tend to decrease with the tsr in the region of x 5 d however the patterns of the variations are markedly different between u u and v v and w w u u rapidly decays from the rotor plane to x 3 d and subsequently increases up to x 6 d however v v and w w tend to increase from the rotor plane to x 1 2 d 1 6 d and subsequently decrease up to x 6 d high values of u u are presumably associated with large scale wake meandering whereas high values of v v and w w might be associated with the instability of the core region which gives rise to lateral fluctuations at approximately six rotor diameters downstream all three reynolds stress components become nearly independent of the tsr 3 3 flow visualization to identify the instantaneous wake structures in the near wake flow visualization experiments were performed for the cases λ 5 10 and 7 17 a red colored dye was released in the vicinity of the hub while the turbine was rotating and photographs were taken to capture the instantaneous wake structures the result is shown in fig 9 at λ 5 10 the released dye expands radially toward the outer wakes but at λ 7 17 the dye remains near the rotor axis up to x 1 5 d the distributions of the dye for both cases are qualitatively similar to the v v and w w contours shown in fig 6 the radial spreading of the dye with respect to the rotor axis shown in fig 9 may be induced by the radial turbulent fluctuations in the y z plane which is measured by w w for that reason the contour lines of w w u 0 2 0 003 were embedded in the figure as can be observed the extent of the dye cloud shows remarkably good agreement with the contour lines of the constant w w the flow visualization result clearly demonstrates that the core region size grows with a decreasing tsr it is also shown that the radial turbulence fluctuations play an important role for the growth of the core region 3 4 analysis of velocity spectra in this section the power spectral densities of velocity fluctuations e for the velocity fluctuations in the x y and z directions which are denoted as e u u e v v and e w w respectively are investigated at various locations in the wake fig 10 shows the dimensionless premultiplied power spectral densities f e u 0 2 for the three velocity fluctuations at the hub height the spectra are plotted for the locations x 0 5 d which is closest to the rotor x 1 2 d and 1 6 d where the lateral turbulent fluctuations v v and w w showed maximum values for the λ 4 15 5 10 and 6 10 cases see fig 8 and x 7 d and 10 d where both velocity and reynolds stresses became independent of the tsrs at x 0 5 d spectral peaks appear at approximately f 1 hz for the cases λ 4 15 and 5 10 which corresponds to the strouhal number s t f d u 0 of approximately 0 8 iungo et al 2013 and viola et al 2014 observed a spectral peak connected to hub vortex oscillations at the frequency equal to 0 34 times the rotor rotational frequency near the hub of a wind turbine d 0 15 m howard et al 2015 on the other hand observed a spectral peak at s t 0 8 for a wind turbine d 0 128 m and foti et al 2016 observed a spectral peak at s t 0 8 for wind turbines of variable sizes d 0 128 m 1 1 m 27 m and 96 m and designs the comparison shows that the peak strouhal numbers observed at x 0 5 d and r 0 in the cases λ 4 15 and 5 10 are very similar to those observed by howard et al 2015 and foti et al 2016 unlike the findings of iungo et al 2013 and viola et al 2014 however the strouhal number associated with the hub vortex instability seems to be independent of the rotor frequency in our cases at x 1 2 d and 1 6 d spectral peaks are clearly visible at f 0 4 hz in the e v v and e w w spectra for all tsrs that frequency corresponds to the strouhal number of approximately 0 3 it can be concluded that those two locations in the core region exhibit nearly the same strouhal number which is independent of the tsr i e blade frequency the e v v and e w w spectra at x 7 d and 10 d also show the existence of spectral peaks at similar frequencies to that found in the previous two locations with significantly smaller energy density the occurrence of the spectral peaks at s t 0 3 both in the near and far wake regions indicates that the turbulence fluctuations at the location where the core region instability is initiated have the same frequency as that of the wake meandering in the far wake such as those observed in chamorro et al 2013a and kang et al 2014 and the meandering frequency is observed as early as x 1 d the strouhal number s t 0 3 observed herein is similar to that s t 0 28 measured four rotor diameters downstream of an axial flow turbine having the same blade geometry chamorro et al 2013a in fig 11 the e v v spectra across the vertical extent of the wake region see the top figure are compared for the cases λ 5 10 and 7 17 the velocity spectra for the case without the turbine rotor see fig 3 are also shown for comparison purposes at the top tip height r 0 5 d of profile 1 x 0 5 d spectral peaks are clearly observed at the frequency of the blades f b l a d e and its harmonics for both tsrs they are signatures of the tip vortices at the top tip height as can be seen at λ 7 17 the tip vortices at the top tip persist for up to x 2 d while at λ 5 10 they are clearly visible only at x 0 5 d this can be explained by a trend of increasing strength of the tip vortices with a higher tsr observed for a wind turbine whale et al 2000 the spectra near the bottom tip show no sign of the tip vortices instead spectral peaks occur at between f 2 and 3 hz where the vortex shedding due to the upstream tower occurs this result demonstrates that the incoming turbulence induced by the turbine supporting structure causes the breakdown of the tip vortices near the hub height it is seen in profile 1 that as the location becomes closer from the hub height to the bottom tip height the spectra also become similar to that measured without the rotor at r 0 6 d of profile 1 the spectra look nearly identical to that without the rotor dashed line at the hub height r 0 of profile 1 x 0 5 d spectral peaks at the frequency of the blades are not seen which means that the motion of the core region is decoupled from the blade rotation instead there is a notable increase in the energy densities at frequencies lower than 1 hz which is possibly associated with the onset of wake meandering motion at s t 0 3 at r 0 125 d and r 0 25 d which are part of the inner wake region where the azimuthal velocity has the opposite sign to that of the blades and turbulence levels are very low see figs 5 and 6 the spectral peaks for the blade frequency are still observed although they show lower energy density levels than that at the top tip this indicates that the inner wake can be viewed as a core rotating as a solid body in the opposite direction to the blades with low turbulence levels it can also be seen from the spectra in the inner wake region that the energy densities in low frequency ranges f 1 hz tend to increase with an increasing axial distance this is associated with the expansion of the core region while moving downstream which decreases the frequencies of the energy containing eddies to quantitatively assess the distributions of turbulence energy across different scales the cumulative energy fraction γ u u guala et al 2006 for the axial velocity fluctuations is calculated γ u u is defined as 1 γ u u f f e u u f d f 0 e u u f d f which implies the cumulative contribution to u u from all frequencies from f to γ u u f at the hub height is compared for λ 4 15 5 10 6 10 and 7 17 in fig 12 the horizontal axis shows the frequency made dimensionless by the local mean velocity u and d as can be seen the γ u u curves tend to move toward the low frequency side in the regions between x 0 5 d and x 5 d with an increasing tsr in this region therefore a frequency of turbulence for the same value of γ u u becomes smaller with an increasing tsr downstream of x 5 d however the curves nearly collapse into single curves which means the frequency of turbulence seldom depends on the tsr the above result clearly shows the dependence of the scale of turbulence on the tsr to quantify the representative turbulence scales for different tsrs the characteristic frequency of turbulence f 50 is defined to be the frequency that yields γ u u f 50 0 5 namely the energy fraction contained in f f 50 or f f 50 accounts for 50 of the total energy the streamwise variations of the dimensionless frequency f 50 d u is plotted in fig 13 by using taylor s frozen turbulence hypothesis one can convert a frequency f to f u k k is the wavenumber which yields f 50 d u k 50 d therefore the dimensionless frequency on the vertical axes in fig 13 can be viewed as the characteristic wavenumber made dimensionless by d or the inverse of the characteristic eddy size made dimensionless by d the figure shows that in the region of x 2 d the dimensionless wavenumbers for all tsrs decay nearly exponentially with a dimensionless distance see the bottom figure in semi logarithmic scale with he exponential decay rate of approximately 1 5 it means that the spatial scale of turbulence rapidly grows which must be associated with the expansion of the core region observed in the reynolds stress contours in 2 d x 6 d the wavenumbers still decay exponentially but with a smaller decay rate approximately 0 5 in this region the growth rate of the eddy size becomes moderate as it is related to the turbulent mixing process across the entire wake i e wake meandering induced by the merging of the shear layers from the tips and core region downstream of x 6 d the decay rate is negligibly small and the curves for different tsrs look almost identical to each other the dimensionless wavenumber at locations more than ten rotor diameters away from the rotor is approximately between 0 4 and 0 5 indicating that the characteristic eddy size in the far wake region is approximately equal to two rotor diameters 4 summary and conclusion laboratory experiments were carried out to investigate the wake characteristics of axial flow hydrokinetic turbines under the same inflow condition with different tsrs the velocities were measured using an adv up to twenty rotor diameters downstream of the turbine and flow visualization experiments were also conducted to reveal the flow structures in the near wake the experimental results provided evidences that a change in tsr can significant affect the mean flow and reynolds stress fields along with the scale of turbulence especially in the region within six rotor diameters downstream the findings of the present study are summarized below the turbine supporting structure was found to have rather significant effects on the turbine wake in the absence of the rotating rotor the nacelle and tower generated separate shear layers introducing a velocity deficit of up to 30 the velocity spectra showed that the shear layers induce periodic motions associated with vortex shedding around the structures the vortex shedding from the tower structure was found to interact with the wake near the bottom tip height to cause the breakdown of the tip vortices it is important to mention that those effects will certainly depend on the location and geometry of the tower and nacelle which means they can be mitigated to some extent the mean velocity and reynolds stress contours for λ 5 10 and 7 17 showed that the wake consisted of the outer wake surrounded by the tip vortices the inner wake that counter rotates with respect to the outer one and the core region with very low velocity the flow field for the lower tsr showed a larger mean velocity deficit near the hub height and a larger azimuthal velocity magnitude in the inner wake region the lower tsr case also showed a more unstable core region featured by radially expanding shear layers around the rotor axis with increased turbulent stresses in the azimuthal and radial directions the expansions of the shear layers continued until they collided with the other shear layers originating from the blade tips which triggered the wake meandering phenomenon the different behaviors of the core region led to the different locations of the wake meandering the different turbulence characteristics in the core region for the above mentioned two cases λ 5 10 and 7 17 were explained using the swirl number which has been known to be responsible for the stability of the swirling flow the maximum swirl number of the turbine wake for the λ 5 10 case was approximately four times larger than that for the λ 7 17 case in both cases the swirl number decayed exponentially in the streamwise direction and it became negligibly small at locations more than six rotor diameters away from the turbine the dye release experiment for the λ 5 10 revealed the formation of a core region rapidly expanding toward the top and bottom tips which was consistent with the reynolds stress contours at λ 7 17 on the contrary the core region was nearly stable in both cases the extent of the core region marked by the released dye showed very good correlation with a constant value of w w which means the velocity fluctuations in the radial direction is responsible for the radial diffusion of the core the premultiplied velocity spectra at the hub height for λ 4 15 5 10 6 10 and 7 17 showed that the same spectral peaks were found at s t 0 3 for all cases both in the near and far wake locations this result indicates that the core region in the vicinity of the rotor plane also has the same frequency as that of the wake meandering found in the far wake and that frequency is observed as early as x 1 d the velocity spectra for λ 5 10 and 7 17 showed that spectral peaks were found at the frequency of the blade at the top tip height as a result of the evolution of the tip vortices the spectra in the inner wake region also showed peaks at the blade frequency suggesting that the region rotates at the same frequency as that of the blades meanwhile the core region showed a significant increase in the energy especially in the low frequency side in the spectra near the bottom tip signatures of the tip vortices were not seen because of the influence of the vortex shedding generated by the tower the streamwise profiles of the cumulative energy fraction for the axial velocity fluctuations γ u u showed that the wake at the hub height consists of three distinct regions with different rates of change in turbulence scale the first region was in 0 x 2 d where the characteristic frequency decayed almost exponentially this region was associated with the increase in the spatial scale of turbulence owing to the radial expansion of the core region the second region was in 2 d x 6 d where the frequency decayed more gradually in this region the change in turbulence scale was presumably due to the merging of the multiple shear layers from the blade tips and the core region which gives rise to turbulence mixing across the entire wake the third region was in x 6 d where the characteristic turbulence scale seldom changed the characteristic eddy size responsible in this region was found to be approximately twice the rotor diameter it is noteworthy that the third region begins where the curves of the streamwise variations of the swirl number mean velocity deficit and reynolds stresses collapsed into single curves regardless of the tsr as evidenced by the characteristic eddy size of 2 d at these locations the wake more than six rotor diameters away from the turbine location is dominated by very large eddies whose size is in the order of the rotor diameter in these locations both the mean velocity field and turbulence characteristics are no longer sensitive to the tsr because the flow is dominated by large scale turbulent mixing whose size is that of the rotor diameter the findings in this paper especially from figs 5 6 and 8 can provide useful insights for a minimum distance between axial flow hydrokinetic turbines in an array between x 0 5 d and 6 d a significant mean velocity deficit and high turbulent stresses were observed and they were found to strongly depend on tsr at x 6 d the velocity at the hub recovered to approximately 65 of the inflow velocity for all tsrs between x 6 d and 10 d the velocity recovered from 65 and 80 of the inflow velocity and between x 10 d and 15 d it recovered up to 90 of the inflow velocity based on the above results it is not recommended to place the present turbine at a distance less than 6 d in the streamwise direction because of the still large mean velocity deficit and turbulent stresses at x 6 d the turbines could be installed at a distance between x 6 d and 10 d depending on the dimension and shape of the channel where the turbine arrays are to be installed however placing them at a distance larger than 10 d may not provide significant gains since the velocity at the hub height recovered from 80 to 90 between x 10 d and 15 d although this study reports some new significant findings concerning the effects of a change in tsr on the wake characteristics of an axial flow hydrokinetic turbine it also has limitations in that the experiments were conducted for one specific turbine under the same inflow condition for a more comprehensive understanding of the roles of the tsr on the wake structures additional studies for a turbine with different blade geometries and different incoming turbulence levels will be necessary nevertheless the findings of the present study will be able to provide useful insights into the wake dynamics of an axial flow hydrokinetic turbine and furthermore the experimental results presented herein could serve as useful data for the validation of numerical models for simulating flows around axial flow hydrokinetic turbines using either the turbine geometry resolving approach kang et al 2014 or turbine

22218,an optimal design scheme of excitation signals is presented to determine the training data that provides the maximum dynamic information to improve the stability and accuracy of the identification of ship manoeuvring models a multi level pseudo random sequence is selected as the optimized object for covering the maximum nonlinear dynamic characteristics the amount of information is quantified by the d optimality criterion and the optimal solution is calculated by the ant colony optimization algorithm monte carlo analysis and generalization validation are conducted to evaluate the optimized signals the superiority of the optimized excitation signal is demonstrated by comparing with the widely used zigzag manoeuvre signal in the presence of noise interference the application of the optimized training data reduces the variance of parameter estimation and improves the generalization ability of the identified model especially for the surge equation keywords input design ship manoeuvring modelling system identification design of experiments 1 introduction mathematical modelling of manoeuvring motion is a key technology in ship manoeuvring and control research an accurate model is crucial for the conventional model based solution such as predicting the ship trajectories with manoeuvring models and the design of model based controllers sutulo and guedes soares 2011 since ship s dynamic characteristics are affected by operating conditions such as payload water depth and environmental factors it is of great value to build and to update the model in an easy to operate way among the modelling methods system identification si based on the free running test provides a practical and efficient way that requires low experiment time and cost this method only requires state information and inertia terms of the ship and does not require measuring forces besides it can also be applied to a full scale vessel to avoid the scale effects system identification is a data driven method that uses the measurements of input and output variables to model dynamic systems in the identification of ship manoeuvring motion a parametric model is typically selected and its parameters are estimated based on the training data these training data are measured from the free running tests that perform a specific input signal in this process the input signal i e the excitation signal defines how the system is excited thereby determining the amount of information contained in the training data only a dataset that can provide enough dynamic information allows the identification of a reliable model therefore to ensure the stability and generalization ability of the identified model the design of the input signal is critical much research on ship manoeuvring identification has focused on developing identification algorithms to estimate parameters the excitation signals are typically from the standard manoeuvres such as those of the zigzag test and the turning circle test zhang and zou 2011 revestido herrero and velasco gonzález 2012 luo et al 2014 sutulo and guedes soares 2014 xu et al 2018 bai et al 2019 these tests are required by the standards for ship manoeuvrability imo 2002 to predict ship manoeuvrability at the design stage thus the datasets are relatively convenient to obtain because researchers can use available databases however some studies have pointed out that these manoeuvres may have insufficient excitation to estimate the parameters of nonlinear models besides the reliability of the identified models cannot often be ensured under noise disturbance perera et al 2016 mentioned that even smooth zigzag and turning manoeuvres might not be able to excite the ship steering models effectively thus they used the persistent excitation manoeuvre to identify a reduced order model revestido herrero and velasco gonzález 2012 pointed out that the zigzag test is not designed for identification modelling to deal with the problem of insufficient excitation they reconstructed a model to adapt the zigzag test yoon and rhee 2003 argued that it is difficult to identify the hydrodynamic coefficients with the standard manoeuvre data because predictor variables are closely related in this situation moreover insufficient information can also affect the generalization ability of the model wang and zou 2018 analysed from the perspective of quantifying multicollinearity that single standard manoeuvre should be used with caution as the dataset under different rudder angle ranges may contain different dynamic characteristics wang et al 2019 suggested using multiple standard manoeuvres datasets simultaneously to improve the generalization performance under noise disturbance since the information contained in the dataset determines the essential performance of the model it is difficult to further improve the model performance without increasing the training data to further improve the reliability of identification modelling the design of the input signal also known as design of experiments doe is critical for identification modelling only a few studies have considered the doe for ship identification modelling yoon and rhee 2003 designed input signals based on the pseudo random binary sequence prbs to provide more information the result is a bang bang type rudder angle sequence then the optimized signal is carried out in a free running test to validate the effectiveness rhee et al 2004 yeon et al 2006 designed the input signal of side thrusters by comparing a and d optimal criteria through an exhaustive search also achieving a bang bang type signal after applying the designed signal the collinearity among the parameters in the low speed manoeuvring mathematical model is suppressed the doe is also studied in the adjacent research area sutulo and guedes soares 2002 proposed a doe approach based on adjusted mitchell s algorithm for optimizing manoeuvring experiments then the approach was applied to the optimal design of captive model pmm tests sutulo and guedes soares 2004 2006 it is worth mentioning that nouri et al 2018 optimized the input signal based on the amplitude modulated prbs aprbs for estimating the hydrodynamic derivatives of autonomous underwater vehicles auv and applying the a optimal criteria to minimize the variance of the coefficient estimation nouri and valadi 2017 employed a bayesian design strategy to design input signals on the auv system however in consideration of the dynamic characteristics of auv the range of rudder angle research is limited between 10 and 10 in the ship identification problem the studies applying doe only used steering sequence with a single or two amplitudes that is the bang bang type signal however this bang bang type signal is not well suited for nonlinear identification since it may not contain sufficient information to reveal the nonlinear behaviour of the system godfrey 1993 for identifying the nonlinear system the excitation signal should try to cover the area of the input space and relevant frequencies the excitation signals that can meet the requirements include multi level pseudo random sequences m level prs sine signals and chirp signals among them m level prs is more practical because other signals require an actuation at every time step to the best of our knowledge the optimal input design based on m level prs has not been investigated for identification modelling of ship manoeuvring motions for improving the generalization and stability of the model it is meaningful to design and apply this optimal input signal to excite the system with maximum information the present study proposes an optimal design scheme to design the excitation signals for system identification of ship manoeuvring the aim is to improve the performance of identification models by applying informative training data for covering more nonlinear dynamic characteristics multi level pseudo random sequences m level prs is selected as the type of excitation signal the amount of information in data is quantified by the d optimality criterion the optimal solution is ultimately calculated by the ant colony optimization aco algorithm for research purposes a mariner class vessel is taken as the study object the rest of the paper is organized as follows section 2 briefly introduces the manoeuvring model and derives the training data format which is the basis for the optimal design approach section 3 describes the methodology of optimal input design section 4 analyses the case study of the method to evaluate the results monte carlo analysis and generalization validation are carried out meanwhile a comparison study is given between the optimized signal and the signal of the zigzag test finally section 5 summarises with conclusions 2 mathematical model this section deduces the format of the training dataset from the three degrees of freedom model of ship manoeuvring motion the identification of the parametric model can be considered as a special case of multiple linear regression in this problem the training dataset is composed of variables collected by the sensor and the format is defined by the regression model structure the model structure is chosen with a trade off between model capacity and model complexity for improving the stability of the identified model the model structure should be appropriately simplified while ensuring that the modelling requirements are met in this study the model is expected to be able to predict the normal manoeuvres under design speed with rudder angles ranging from zero to full rudder and then can be applied to simulators model based controllers and planning algorithms in the future in order to better investigate the input design problem it is assumed that a good model structure has been chosen as prior knowledge this paper takes the mariner class vessel as the study object and employs the three degrees of freedom abkowitz model proposed in strom tejsen 1965 the reliability of this model has been verified by comparison with experiments the ship manoeuvring model in the surge sway and yaw can be expressed as 1 a m x u u x 1 b m y v v m x g y r r y 1 c m x g n v v i z n r r n where m is the ship s mass i z is the moment of inertia about the z axis x g is the longitudinal coordinate of the centre of gravity of the ship x u et al are the acceleration derivatives u v r are the surge velocity sway velocity and yaw rate respectively x y n are the components of external force and moment acting on the ship which represent as hydrodynamic force moment in calm water the nondimensional forms are expressed as 2 x 1 2 ρ l 2 u 2 x y 1 2 ρ l 2 u 2 y n 1 2 ρ l 3 u 2 n where ρ is the water density l is ship length and u is the total ship velocity expressed as u u 0 u 2 v 2 u is the change from the surge speed of the initial steady state u 0 thereby the surge speed can be expressed as u u 0 u the hydrodynamic forces moments are expressed as 3rd order polynomial expressions with 8 coefficients in surge equation and 9 coefficients in sway and yaw equations respectively the nondimensional forms of the x y n are represented as 3 a x x u u x u u u 2 x u u u u 3 x v v v 2 x r r r 2 x δ δ δ 2 x v r v r x v δ v δ 3 b y y v v y r r y v v v v 3 y v v r v 2 r y δ δ y δ δ δ δ 3 y

motions can be rewritten as 4 a u x m x u 4 b v i z n r y m x g y r n s 4 c r m y v n m x g n v y s where s i z n r m y v m x g y r m x g n v the inertia terms and the added mass coefficients are assumed to be known since they can all be measured or calculated by some effective methods such as the inertial measurement unit and the slender body theory luo 2016 as constants they can be combined with the unknown hydrodynamic coefficients as new parameters by this way the mathematical model eq 1 is converted to a regression form as 5 a u θ 1 x 1 u v r δ 5 b v θ 2 x 2 v r δ 5 c r θ 3 x 3 v r δ where x 1 x 2 x 3 are the vectors of regressors and θ 1 θ 2 θ 3 are the parameter vectors based on the known model structure identification modelling is to estimate these parameters for the convenience of computer simulation the velocity terms u v r are restored to the dimensional form by multiplying u 2 l in eq 5 a and eq 5 b and multiplying u 2 l 2 in eq 5 c in this way other terms are still in non dimensional forms further discretizing by euler s stepping method with time step h multiple linear regression models are obtained as a vector form 6 a u t 1 u t θ 1 x 1 t 6 b v t 1 v t θ 2 x 2 t 6 c r t 1 r t θ 3 x 3 t where the regressor vectors can be written as 7 a x 1 t u t u t l u 2 t l u 3 t u t l v 2 t l r 2 t l δ 2 t u 2 t l r t v t v t δ t u t l t h m x u 7 b x 2 t v t u t l

l t h l s eq 7 is the format of the training data for each time step integrating all time steps of eq 6 the regression model can be obtained in matrix form expressed as y x θ training data is the collection of response vectors y and the regressor matrix x the regressor matrix x is also called the design matrix which will be used to evaluate the amount of information provided by training data it should be mentioned that one limitation of the abkowitz model is that it only considers small changes around the longitudinal velocity u 0 the propeller thrust is set to be constant therefore the model is more suitable for predicting manoeuvring motion around the design speed consequently the input signal will only consider steering command as mentioned earlier the choice of the model structure is a trade off between forecasting ability and model complexity although this model is not suitable for the manoeuvres with significant changes in speed it can meet the forecasting requirements of most shipping manoeuvres and it can also be applied to design model based controllers as can be seen the data collected by the sensors include input and state variables i e rudder angle surge and sway velocity and yaw rate once the rudder angle sequence is determined other state variables in training data can be indirectly determined 3 optimal design method for maximizing the information in the training data the essential is to design the steering sequence δ s e q δ 1 δ n namely the excitation signal this section introduces the development of the optimal design scheme 3 1 fisher information and optimal criteria fisher information can be used to measure the amount of information that the observations x carry about the parameter θ according to the cramér rao lower bound kay 1993 the variance of unbiased parameters estimation is limited by the inverse of the fisher information i θ 8 var θ ˆ 1 i θ in other words fisher information determines the upper bound of the accuracy that can be achieved by parameter estimation under the premise of achieving the cramér rao lower bound by effective unbiased estimation the variance of the parameter estimation can be minimized by maximizing the fisher information the fisher information is defined as 9 i θ e ℓ 2 x θ θ 2 where θ is an unknown parameter that will be estimated from observations x ℓ x θ log x θ is the log likelihood function for identifying ship manoeuvring motion multiple parameters need to be estimated thus the fisher information takes the form of a matrix m the elements can be calculated by 10 m m n e ℓ x θ θ m ℓ x θ θ n t the cramér rao lower bound is then extended as cov θ ˆ m 1 consider the case where the model structure f θ u is approximated enough and the measurement noise is known to be gaussian white noise with zero mean and variance σ the fisher information matrix can be calculated by 11 m i 1 n 1 σ 2 f θ u i t θ f θ u i θ to maximize the information of the training data hence minimizing the variance of the estimation the fisher information matrix must be maximized since maximizing a matrix is complicated the approximation approach is often used in practice that is applying optimality criteria to transform the optimized objective from a matrix to a simpler scalar various optimality criteria can be considered atkinson et al 2007 a optimality criterion minimizes the trace of the inverse of the fisher information matrix i e t r m 1 it is equivalent to minimize the average variance of the parameter estimation e optimality maximizes λ min m which represents the minimum eigenvalue of the information matrix m d optimality criterion aims at minimizing the generalized variance of the estimates of the parameters namely minimizing the determinant of m 1 these criteria are mainly from the perspective of improving parameter estimation besides some criteria are proposed to improve prediction capabilities named output space criterion for instance g optimality and v optimality minimize the maximum and averaged variance of the predicted response respectively among the above criteria d optimality has an advantage over a optimality and e optimality because it is not affected by the parameter scaling and linear transformations of the output mehra 1974 for the application of ship manoeuvring modelling the output space criteria are a good choice since the generalization ability is significant for the predictive model nevertheless the d optimality criterion is also applicable which is very close to g optimality for the quality of the response estimate welch 1984 besides by using d optimal the influence of excitation signal on parameter estimation and parameter drift can be investigated simultaneously therefore this paper selects d optimality as the criterion to quantify the amount of information which expresses as j det m 1 for the multiple linear regression y x θ the d optimality can be expressed as 12 j det x t x 1 the objective of optimal design is to minimize the value of eq 12 which is independent of the unknown hydrodynamic coefficients 3 2 multi level pseudo random sequences the choice of the type of excitation signal is fundamental for the optimal design high quality excitation signal should cover all required ranges of the input space and all relevant frequencies for the ship nonlinear dynamic system multiple amplitudes of steering angle and the different steering frequencies should be considered this requirement can be satisfied by the multi level pseudo random sequences m level prs the m level prs covers the input space by setting multiple amplitudes thereby highlighting the nonlinear behaviour its generation can be seen as a series of step functions that are determined by n amplitude values d n and durations t n see fig 1 corresponding to the input signal of ship manoeuvring motion each amplitude change in the m level prs is a steering operation the gradient of each ramp is set as a constant of the steady steering speed in the following text one steering operation is called one factor which is a terminology of doe the number of factors n is predetermined for designing the excitation signal with maximum information the amplitudes of steering angles δ n and the duration t n will be determined in the optimization problem 3 3 optimization problem the optimal input design can be formulated as an optimization problem determining the shape of m level prs with the maximum information the optimal m level prs is ultimately used as the input signal this target is achieved by minimizing the determinant of the inverse of the information matrix i e det m 1 the optimization problem is formulated as follows 13 min j logdet m 1 δ i t i δ i ℕ n int t i ℕ m int n int m int ℕ i 0 n subject to δ l δ i δ u δ l δ u ℕ n int l t i t u t l t u ℕ m int the objective function is minimized over the decision variables δ i and t i to make the excitation signal easy to implement the decision variables are discretized in the input space the values δ l δ u and t l t u are the box constraints for the amplitudes and duration of the steering angle since det m 1 is a nonconvex function of the decision variables this minimization problem belongs to the nonconvex nonlinear integer programming theoretically this optimization problem can be solved in two ways deterministic and stochastic methods common deterministic methods include branch and bound techniques outer approximation and others grossmann 2002 however only a few commercial software can achieve a global optimization solution with non convex conditions bussieck and vigerske 2010 kronqvist et al 2018 besides these methods often require explicit mathematical expressions of the optimization problem for the ship input design it is hard to derive an explicit formula of the objective function since the information matrix is deduced from the training data collected in a dynamic process in stochastic methods there is a class of approach called metaheuristics glover and kochenberger 2006 this type of method belongs to the black box solver which does not need to express the optimization problem as a mathematical formula explicitly this property makes them flexible and widely used by practitioners in addition the input design problem is non deterministic polynomial time hardness that is as the design factors increases the optimal design is solved in exponential time to solve the problem practically this paper employs a metaheuristic algorithm ant colony algorithm aco to find high quality solutions in a reasonable time aco was originally developed as a nature inspired method for solving combinatorial optimization problems dorigo et al 1996 its availability and practicability have been demonstrated by successful applications to many academic and industrial problems dorigo and birattari 2010 the idea of aco comes from the optimal path selection of ants in foraging behaviour in the beginning ants randomly explore the path and leave a chemical signal called pheromone as the accumulation of pheromones gradually changes the probability of the selected path the optimal path is selected through positive feedback this characteristic is exploited by aco to solve computational problems through artificial ant colonies it is worth noting that the design of excitation signals can be regarded as a special case of the combinatorial optimization problem that is the solution is defined by a combination of several steering angles and their duration the framework of aco is expressed as follows the first step is to determine the search space including the number of factors the discrete scheme of the steering angles δ and the duration t at the start of the algorithm all pheromone values are initialized as constant values in each iteration m ants probabilistically seek solutions from the search space based on the pheromone values these solutions are used for performing a pheromone update for the next iteration a pseudo code of the aco algorithm is presented in table 1 in this work the aco algorithm is programmed with matlab the following are some details of the algorithm the probability of each steering command to be selected is decided by pheromone values τ δ t n where superscript n refer to the factor number i e the n th times of steering operation it is defined as 14 p δ t n t τ δ t n t δ t τ δ t n t before the next iteration the pheromone update is implemented as the following formula 15 τ δ t n t 1 ρ τ δ t n t τ δ t n where ρ is the evaporation rate that represents the reduction of pheromone values after each iteration the τ δ t n is the added value of the pheromone after being selected by ants 16 τ δ t n i 1 m τ δ t i n where τ δ t i n is the i th solution in the search space 17 τ δ t i n q logdet m 1 i c d o f selected by i th ant 0 otherwise where q and c d o f are constants related to the effect of the objective function the probability of the input sequences is gradually changing under positive feedback until the optimal input sequence is constructed by solving the optimization problem the amplitudes and durations of steering angles are determined to define the shape of the excitation signal 4 application to the mariner class ship this section implements the optimal input design for the mariner ship as a case study table 2 shows the main dimensions of the mariner class ship the excitation signals are designed to provide informative training data in order to evaluate the performance a comparison study is conducted between optimized training data and the widely used 20 20 zigzag manoeuvre the model mentioned in section 2 is applied to simulate the data its reliability has been verified with experimental results more details about the model such as the values of hydrodynamic coefficients and inertia terms can be found in the literature strom tejsen 1965 for easy implementation in practice the steering angles and the dwell time are discretized with an interval of 5 and 25 s respectively the range of rudder angle is between 30 and 30 and the dwell time is up to 100 s 18 δ 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 dwell time 25 50 75 100 the m level prs signal is designed with six factors to cover the input space thus providing as much dynamic information as possible in this way an input sequence with six steering angles and six corresponding dwell times needs to be optimized it should be mentioned that the greater the number of factors the more dynamic features may be included but at the same time the more variables that need to be optimized since the aco algorithm requires random samplings to obtain high quality results more iterations may be needed to complete the optimization process therefore there is a trade off between the amount of information and computation complexity this paper sets the factor number as a larger number the intention is to explore the effective form of the excitation signal and the general nature of the results as these conclusions may also apply to other series of ships the optimal designs are applied to three degrees of freedom respectively since the objective function values calculated from datasets are different for each degree of freedom the parameters in the aco algorithm are set as follows the number of ants per iteration is 10 and the max iteration number is 450 the initial pheromone value τ 0 is 0 5 and the evaporation rate ρ is 0 05 to validate the convergence of the algorithm the optimizations are repeated ten times fig 2 shows the convergence of optimal values in sway motion similar results are obtained in other degrees of freedom high quality results are obtained within a reasonable operating time all these optimized input signals cover as many rudder angles as possible and the differences are reflected in the sequence and the duration of steering operations although local optimal solutions are sometimes obtained due to the non convexity of the problem the final values of the objective function are close and convergent the low values indicate that these solutions are all informative fig 3 shows the optimal input signal for surge model and fig 4 shows the optimal input signal for sway and yaw models the results show that the maximum information can be obtained simultaneously for sway and yaw equations but it is hard to balance with the surge equation this indicates that some trade offs are needed to make the excitation signal highly informative for three degrees of freedom at the same time alternatively two sets of free running tests can be used to collect data one for the surge model and another for sway and yaw models for the excitation of surge motion two consecutive 30 degree steering angles are contained in the optimized result the optimized input signal for sway and yaw motion tends to include more rudder angles table 3 compares the values of the objective function between the optimized m level prs and the input signal of the 20 20 zigzag manoeuvre which has been widely used in this identification problem luo and zou 2009 sutulo and guedes soares 2014 zhu et al 2017 moreno salinas et al 2019 xu et al 2019 as can be seen cost function values of the m level prs are smaller than that of the 20 20 zigzag signal especially for the surge motion this result implies that the optimized m level prs contains more dynamic information than the 20 20 zigzag signal it is worth noting that even the cost function value of the signal during the iteration is still better than that of the zigzag test this also indicates that the m level prs is more effective than the zigzag signal to further test the properties of the optimized input sequence monte carlo analysis and generalization validation are performed to analyse the impact of the new training data on the variances of parameter estimation and the generalization ability the optimal input in fig 3 is used to excite the surge motion equation and the optimal input in fig 4 is used to train the sway and yaw motion equations the training dataset of the surge equation contains 1150 data points and the training dataset of the sway and yaw equations contains 1100 data points with a time interval of 0 5 s monte carlo analysis tests the performance of parameter estimation for different levels of noise interference the noise variance is selected as a random number with a mean of zero and a variance of 10 of the maximum output values in this way the random sampling simulates different data collection conditions the parameters are identified by the original least squares fig 5 illustrates the smoothed distributions of the partial parameters in the case of 500 times monte carlo simulations the parameter distributions are compared with the results excited by 20 20 zigzag test the variances of parameter estimation decrease significantly after excited by the optimal training data the improvement in the surge equation is remarkable for the hydrodynamic coefficients x u x u u x u u u the parameter drift is effectively reduced by contrast the distribution is very divergent when excited by the 20 20 zigzag test as regards to the sway and yaw equations the optimized training data enhances the robustness of the parameter estimation although parameter estimation still has unstable conditions under noise disturbance which implies that multicollinearity still exists its impact can be further alleviated by model structure selection or robust identification algorithm the parameter drifts can be tolerated under the premise of ensuring the prediction requirements in addition the input signal designed for a specific equation of motion has better performance for parameter estimation of this equation of motion this result implies that the d optimality criterion is effective for quantifying dynamic information in order to maximize the information it is recommended to separately design the optimal excitation signals for the surge equation and the sway and yaw equations respectively to sum up a smaller variance of the parameter identification means that the identified model is more stable and robust these comparisons indicate that the optimized m level prs signal is superior to the widely used zigzag manoeuvre signal to investigate the effect on the generalization performance the prediction of manoeuvring motions is performed including 10 10 20 20 30 30 zigzag and 35 turning manoeuvres the identified model is trained by the dataset polluted by white noise to simulate the effects of measurement noise the variance of the noise is set to 2 of the maximum absolute value of the original response which corresponds to the pre processed data or the data from precision sensors parameters are identified by the original least squares method if the training data includes enough information even if the parameter drift occurs the prediction ability can also be guaranteed for comparison purpose the performance of 20 20 zigzag dataset is also investigated figs 6 9 illustrate the forecast of the heading angle and velocities for 35 turning 10 10 20 20 30 30 zigzag test respectively root mean square error rmse and symmetric mean absolute percentage error smape are used to evaluate the accuracy of prediction see table 4 the index smape measures accuracy based on a percentage error between 0 and 200 which is smaller when the prediction is more accurate it is computed by 19 s m a p e 100 n t 1 n f t a t a t f t 2 where a t is the actual value and f t is the predictive value according to the results high quality predictions are achieved under the excitation of the optimized training data all smape values are below 10 remarkably the predictive accuracy in surge motion has been improved significantly the analysis result from rmse is consistent by contrast when excited by the zigzag test dataset although good accuracy can be obtained when predicting the 20 20 zigzag the accuracy of prediction for other manoeuvres that do not involve in training data cannot be guaranteed there is a large deviation in the prediction of surge speed the prediction cannot even fit the trend especially for the 10 10 zigzag manoeuvre this result implies that insufficient information is provided thus the model cannot predict the motion with different collinearity structure from the training dataset the comparison demonstrates that the optimized m level prs input contains sufficient dynamic information for the predictive model the model identified by optimized excitation is more robust with better generalization ability 5 conclusions an optimal design scheme of the excitation signal has been presented for system identification of ship manoeuvring motion the m level prs is selected as the optimized object to include more nonlinear dynamic features taking the mariner ship as the study object the d optimal input signals are calculated by the aco algorithm for maximizing the information it is recommended to design the excitation signals for the surge equation and the sway and yaw equations separately comparisons with the widely used zigzag input reveals that the optimized m level prs input contains richer dynamic information in the presence of noise interference the reductions in parameter estimation variances and the improvements in generalization ability demonstrate the superiority of the optimized training data especially for the surge equation the optimized training data has significant effects on improving the performance of the identified model it is suggested that engineers give training data a greater role in ship identification modelling future work will aim at taking the propeller thrust into account as another input signal and improving the efficiency of the design algorithm by speeding up the convergence rate based on effective training data the reliability of the model can be further improved by combining effective identification algorithms such as the shrinkage methods and artificial intelligence

22218,an optimal design scheme of excitation signals is presented to determine the training data that provides the maximum dynamic information to improve the stability and accuracy of the identification of ship manoeuvring models a multi level pseudo random sequence is selected as the optimized object for covering the maximum nonlinear dynamic characteristics the amount of information is quantified by the d optimality criterion and the optimal solution is calculated by the ant colony optimization algorithm monte carlo analysis and generalization validation are conducted to evaluate the optimized signals the superiority of the optimized excitation signal is demonstrated by comparing with the widely used zigzag manoeuvre signal in the presence of noise interference the application of the optimized training data reduces the variance of parameter estimation and improves the generalization ability of the identified model especially for the surge equation keywords input design ship manoeuvring modelling system identification design of experiments 1 introduction mathematical modelling of manoeuvring motion is a key technology in ship manoeuvring and control research an accurate model is crucial for the conventional model based solution such as predicting the ship trajectories with manoeuvring models and the design of model based controllers sutulo and guedes soares 2011 since ship s dynamic characteristics are affected by operating conditions such as payload water depth and environmental factors it is of great value to build and to update the model in an easy to operate way among the modelling methods system identification si based on the free running test provides a practical and efficient way that requires low experiment time and cost this method only requires state information and inertia terms of the ship and does not require measuring forces besides it can also be applied to a full scale vessel to avoid the scale effects system identification is a data driven method that uses the measurements of input and output variables to model dynamic systems in the identification of ship manoeuvring motion a parametric model is typically selected and its parameters are estimated based on the training data these training data are measured from the free running tests that perform a specific input signal in this process the input signal i e the excitation signal defines how the system is excited thereby determining the amount of information contained in the training data only a dataset that can provide enough dynamic information allows the identification of a reliable model therefore to ensure the stability and generalization ability of the identified model the design of the input signal is critical much research on ship manoeuvring identification has focused on developing identification algorithms to estimate parameters the excitation signals are typically from the standard manoeuvres such as those of the zigzag test and the turning circle test zhang and zou 2011 revestido herrero and velasco gonzález 2012 luo et al 2014 sutulo and guedes soares 2014 xu et al 2018 bai et al 2019 these tests are required by the standards for ship manoeuvrability imo 2002 to predict ship manoeuvrability at the design stage thus the datasets are relatively convenient to obtain because researchers can use available databases however some studies have pointed out that these manoeuvres may have insufficient excitation to estimate the parameters of nonlinear models besides the reliability of the identified models cannot often be ensured under noise disturbance perera et al 2016 mentioned that even smooth zigzag and turning manoeuvres might not be able to excite the ship steering models effectively thus they used the persistent excitation manoeuvre to identify a reduced order model revestido herrero and velasco gonzález 2012 pointed out that the zigzag test is not designed for identification modelling to deal with the problem of insufficient excitation they reconstructed a model to adapt the zigzag test yoon and rhee 2003 argued that it is difficult to identify the hydrodynamic coefficients with the standard manoeuvre data because predictor variables are closely related in this situation moreover insufficient information can also affect the generalization ability of the model wang and zou 2018 analysed from the perspective of quantifying multicollinearity that single standard manoeuvre should be used with caution as the dataset under different rudder angle ranges may contain different dynamic characteristics wang et al 2019 suggested using multiple standard manoeuvres datasets simultaneously to improve the generalization performance under noise disturbance since the information contained in the dataset determines the essential performance of the model it is difficult to further improve the model performance without increasing the training data to further improve the reliability of identification modelling the design of the input signal also known as design of experiments doe is critical for identification modelling only a few studies have considered the doe for ship identification modelling yoon and rhee 2003 designed input signals based on the pseudo random binary sequence prbs to provide more information the result is a bang bang type rudder angle sequence then the optimized signal is carried out in a free running test to validate the effectiveness rhee et al 2004 yeon et al 2006 designed the input signal of side thrusters by comparing a and d optimal criteria through an exhaustive search also achieving a bang bang type signal after applying the designed signal the collinearity among the parameters in the low speed manoeuvring mathematical model is suppressed the doe is also studied in the adjacent research area sutulo and guedes soares 2002 proposed a doe approach based on adjusted mitchell s algorithm for optimizing manoeuvring experiments then the approach was applied to the optimal design of captive model pmm tests sutulo and guedes soares 2004 2006 it is worth mentioning that nouri et al 2018 optimized the input signal based on the amplitude modulated prbs aprbs for estimating the hydrodynamic derivatives of autonomous underwater vehicles auv and applying the a optimal criteria to minimize the variance of the coefficient estimation nouri and valadi 2017 employed a bayesian design strategy to design input signals on the auv system however in consideration of the dynamic characteristics of auv the range of rudder angle research is limited between 10 and 10 in the ship identification problem the studies applying doe only used steering sequence with a single or two amplitudes that is the bang bang type signal however this bang bang type signal is not well suited for nonlinear identification since it may not contain sufficient information to reveal the nonlinear behaviour of the system godfrey 1993 for identifying the nonlinear system the excitation signal should try to cover the area of the input space and relevant frequencies the excitation signals that can meet the requirements include multi level pseudo random sequences m level prs sine signals and chirp signals among them m level prs is more practical because other signals require an actuation at every time step to the best of our knowledge the optimal input design based on m level prs has not been investigated for identification modelling of ship manoeuvring motions for improving the generalization and stability of the model it is meaningful to design and apply this optimal input signal to excite the system with maximum information the present study proposes an optimal design scheme to design the excitation signals for system identification of ship manoeuvring the aim is to improve the performance of identification models by applying informative training data for covering more nonlinear dynamic characteristics multi level pseudo random sequences m level prs is selected as the type of excitation signal the amount of information in data is quantified by the d optimality criterion the optimal solution is ultimately calculated by the ant colony optimization aco algorithm for research purposes a mariner class vessel is taken as the study object the rest of the paper is organized as follows section 2 briefly introduces the manoeuvring model and derives the training data format which is the basis for the optimal design approach section 3 describes the methodology of optimal input design section 4 analyses the case study of the method to evaluate the results monte carlo analysis and generalization validation are carried out meanwhile a comparison study is given between the optimized signal and the signal of the zigzag test finally section 5 summarises with conclusions 2 mathematical model this section deduces the format of the training dataset from the three degrees of freedom model of ship manoeuvring motion the identification of the parametric model can be considered as a special case of multiple linear regression in this problem the training dataset is composed of variables collected by the sensor and the format is defined by the regression model structure the model structure is chosen with a trade off between model capacity and model complexity for improving the stability of the identified model the model structure should be appropriately simplified while ensuring that the modelling requirements are met in this study the model is expected to be able to predict the normal manoeuvres under design speed with rudder angles ranging from zero to full rudder and then can be applied to simulators model based controllers and planning algorithms in the future in order to better investigate the input design problem it is assumed that a good model structure has been chosen as prior knowledge this paper takes the mariner class vessel as the study object and employs the three degrees of freedom abkowitz model proposed in strom tejsen 1965 the reliability of this model has been verified by comparison with experiments the ship manoeuvring model in the surge sway and yaw can be expressed as 1 a m x u u x 1 b m y v v m x g y r r y 1 c m x g n v v i z n r r n where m is the ship s mass i z is the moment of inertia about the z axis x g is the longitudinal coordinate of the centre of gravity of the ship x u et al are the acceleration derivatives u v r are the surge velocity sway velocity and yaw rate respectively x y n are the components of external force and moment acting on the ship which represent as hydrodynamic force moment in calm water the nondimensional forms are expressed as 2 x 1 2 ρ l 2 u 2 x y 1 2 ρ l 2 u 2 y n 1 2 ρ l 3 u 2 n where ρ is the water density l is ship length and u is the total ship velocity expressed as u u 0 u 2 v 2 u is the change from the surge speed of the initial steady state u 0 thereby the surge speed can be expressed as u u 0 u the hydrodynamic forces moments are expressed as 3rd order polynomial expressions with 8 coefficients in surge equation and 9 coefficients in sway and yaw equations respectively the nondimensional forms of the x y n are represented as 3 a x x u u x u u u 2 x u u u u 3 x v v v 2 x r r r 2 x δ δ δ 2 x v r v r x v δ v δ 3 b y y v v y r r y v v v v 3 y v v r v 2 r y δ δ y δ δ δ δ 3 y v v δ v 2 δ y v δ δ v δ 2 y 0 3 c n n v v n r r n v v v v 3 n v v r v 2 r n δ δ n δ δ δ δ 3 n v v δ v 2 δ n v δ δ v δ 2 n 0 by deriving the expressions of the acceleration terms the equations of motions can be rewritten as 4 a u x m x u 4 b v i z n r y m x g y r n s 4 c r m y v n m x g n v y s where s i z n r m y v m x g y r m x g n v the inertia terms and the added mass coefficients are assumed to be known since they can all be measured or calculated by some effective methods such as the inertial measurement unit and the slender body theory luo 2016 as constants they can be combined with the unknown hydrodynamic coefficients as new parameters by this way the mathematical model eq 1 is converted to a regression form as 5 a u θ 1 x 1 u v r δ 5 b v θ 2 x 2 v r δ 5 c r θ 3 x 3 v r δ where x 1 x 2 x 3 are the vectors of regressors and θ 1 θ 2 θ 3 are the parameter vectors based on the known model structure identification modelling is to estimate these parameters for the convenience of computer simulation the velocity terms u v r are restored to the dimensional form by multiplying u 2 l in eq 5 a and eq 5 b and multiplying u 2 l 2 in eq 5 c in this way other terms are still in non dimensional forms further discretizing by euler s stepping method with time step h multiple linear regression models are obtained as a vector form 6 a u t 1 u t θ 1 x 1 t 6 b v t 1 v t θ 2 x 2 t 6 c r t 1 r t θ 3 x 3 t where the regressor vectors can be written as 7 a x 1 t u t u t l u 2 t l u 3 t u t l v 2 t l r 2 t l δ 2 t u 2 t l r t v t v t δ t u t l t h m x u 7 b x 2 t v t u t l r t u t v 3 t u t l v 2 t r t u t δ t u 2 t l δ 3 t u 2 t l v 2 t δ t l v t δ 2 t u t l t h s 7 c x 3 t v t u t l r t u t v 3 t u t l v 2 t r t u t δ t u 2 t l δ 3 t u 2 t l v 2 t δ t l v t δ 2 t u t l t h l s eq 7 is the format of the training data for each time step integrating all time steps of eq 6 the regression model can be obtained in matrix form expressed as y x θ training data is the collection of response vectors y and the regressor matrix x the regressor matrix x is also called the design matrix which will be used to evaluate the amount of information provided by training data it should be mentioned that one limitation of the abkowitz model is that it only considers small changes around the longitudinal velocity u 0 the propeller thrust is set to be constant therefore the model is more suitable for predicting manoeuvring motion around the design speed consequently the input signal will only consider steering command as mentioned earlier the choice of the model structure is a trade off between forecasting ability and model complexity although this model is not suitable for the manoeuvres with significant changes in speed it can meet the forecasting requirements of most shipping manoeuvres and it can also be applied to design model based controllers as can be seen the data collected by the sensors include input and state variables i e rudder angle surge and sway velocity and yaw rate once the rudder angle sequence is determined other state variables in training data can be indirectly determined 3 optimal design method for maximizing the information in the training data the essential is to design the steering sequence δ s e q δ 1 δ n namely the excitation signal this section introduces the development of the optimal design scheme 3 1 fisher information and optimal criteria fisher information can be used to measure the amount of information that the observations x carry about the parameter θ according to the cramér rao lower bound kay 1993 the variance of unbiased parameters estimation is limited by the inverse of the fisher information i θ 8 var θ ˆ 1 i θ in other words fisher information determines the upper bound of the accuracy that can be achieved by parameter estimation under the premise of achieving the cramér rao lower bound by effective unbiased estimation the variance of the parameter estimation can be minimized by maximizing the fisher information the fisher information is defined as 9 i θ e ℓ 2 x θ θ 2 where θ is an unknown parameter that will be estimated from observations x ℓ x θ log x θ is the log likelihood function for identifying ship manoeuvring motion multiple parameters need to be estimated thus the fisher information takes the form of a matrix m the elements can be calculated by 10 m m n e ℓ x θ θ m ℓ x θ θ n t the cramér rao lower bound is then extended as cov θ ˆ m 1 consider the case where the model structure f θ u is approximated enough and the measurement noise is known to be gaussian white noise with zero mean and variance σ the fisher information matrix can be calculated by 11 m i 1 n 1 σ 2 f θ u i t θ f θ u i θ to maximize the information of the training data hence minimizing the variance of the estimation the fisher information matrix must be maximized since maximizing a matrix is complicated the approximation approach is often used in practice that is applying optimality criteria to transform the optimized objective from a matrix to a simpler scalar various optimality criteria can be considered atkinson et al 2007 a optimality criterion minimizes the trace of the inverse of the fisher information matrix i e t r m 1 it is equivalent to minimize the average variance of the parameter estimation e optimality maximizes λ min m which represents the minimum eigenvalue of the information matrix m d optimality criterion aims at minimizing the generalized variance of the estimates of the parameters namely minimizing the determinant of m 1 these criteria are mainly from the perspective of improving parameter estimation besides some criteria are proposed to improve prediction capabilities named output space criterion for instance g optimality and v optimality minimize the maximum and averaged variance of the predicted response respectively among the above criteria d optimality has an advantage over a optimality and e optimality because it is not affected by the parameter scaling and linear transformations of the output mehra 1974 for the application of ship manoeuvring modelling the output space criteria are a good choice since the generalization ability is significant for the predictive model nevertheless the d optimality criterion is also applicable which is very close to g optimality for the quality of the response estimate welch 1984 besides by using d optimal the influence of excitation signal on parameter estimation and parameter drift can be investigated simultaneously therefore this paper selects d optimality as the criterion to quantify the amount of information which expresses as j det m 1 for the multiple linear regression y x θ the d optimality can be expressed as 12 j det x t x 1 the objective of optimal design is to minimize the value of eq 12 which is independent of the unknown hydrodynamic coefficients 3 2 multi level pseudo random sequences the choice of the type of excitation signal is fundamental for the optimal design high quality excitation signal should cover all required ranges of the input space and all relevant frequencies for the ship nonlinear dynamic system multiple amplitudes of steering angle and the different steering frequencies should be considered this requirement can be satisfied by the multi level pseudo random sequences m level prs the m level prs covers the input space by setting multiple amplitudes thereby highlighting the nonlinear behaviour its generation can be seen as a series of step functions that are determined by n amplitude values d n and durations t n see fig 1 corresponding to the input signal of ship manoeuvring motion each amplitude change in the m level prs is a steering operation the gradient of each ramp is set as a constant of the steady steering speed in the following text one steering operation is called one factor which is a terminology of doe the number of factors n is predetermined for designing the excitation signal with maximum information the amplitudes of steering angles δ n and the duration t n will be determined in the optimization problem 3 3 optimization problem the optimal input design can be formulated as an optimization problem determining the shape of m level prs with the maximum information the optimal m level prs is ultimately used as the input signal this target is achieved by minimizing the determinant of the inverse of the information matrix i e det m 1 the optimization problem is formulated as follows 13 min j logdet m 1 δ i t i δ i ℕ n int t i ℕ m int n int m int ℕ i 0 n subject to δ l δ i δ u δ l δ u ℕ n int l t i t u t l t u ℕ m int the objective function is minimized over the decision variables δ i and t i to make the excitation signal easy to implement the decision variables are discretized in the input space the values δ l δ u and t l t u are the box constraints for the amplitudes and duration of the steering angle since det m 1 is a nonconvex function of the decision variables this minimization problem belongs to the nonconvex nonlinear integer programming theoretically this optimization problem can be solved in two ways deterministic and stochastic methods common deterministic methods include branch and bound techniques outer approximation and others grossmann 2002 however only a few commercial software can achieve a global optimization solution with non convex conditions bussieck and vigerske 2010 kronqvist et al 2018 besides these methods often require explicit mathematical expressions of the optimization problem for the ship input design it is hard to derive an explicit formula of the objective function since the information matrix is deduced from the training data collected in a dynamic process in stochastic methods there is a class of approach called metaheuristics glover and kochenberger 2006 this type of method belongs to the black box solver which does not need to express the optimization problem as a mathematical formula explicitly this property makes them flexible and widely used by practitioners in addition the input design problem is non deterministic polynomial time hardness that is as the design factors increases the optimal design is solved in exponential time to solve the problem practically this paper employs a metaheuristic algorithm ant colony algorithm aco to find high quality solutions in a reasonable time aco was originally developed as a nature inspired method for solving combinatorial optimization problems dorigo et al 1996 its availability and practicability have been demonstrated by successful applications to many academic and industrial problems dorigo and birattari 2010 the idea of aco comes from the optimal path selection of ants in foraging behaviour in the beginning ants randomly explore the path and leave a chemical signal called pheromone as the accumulation of pheromones gradually changes the probability of the selected path the optimal path is selected through positive feedback this characteristic is exploited by aco to solve computational problems through artificial ant colonies it is worth noting that the design of excitation signals can be regarded as a special case of the combinatorial optimization problem that is the solution is defined by a combination of several steering angles and their duration the framework of aco is expressed as follows the first step is to determine the search space including the number of factors the discrete scheme of the steering angles δ and the duration t at the start of the algorithm all pheromone values are initialized as constant values in each iteration m ants probabilistically seek solutions from the search space based on the pheromone values these solutions are used for performing a pheromone update for the next iteration a pseudo code of the aco algorithm is presented in table 1 in this work the aco algorithm is programmed with matlab the following are some details of the algorithm the probability of each steering command to be selected is decided by pheromone values τ δ t n where superscript n refer to the factor number i e the n th times of steering operation it is defined as 14 p δ t n t τ δ t n t δ t τ δ t n t before the next iteration the pheromone update is implemented as the following formula 15 τ δ t n t 1 ρ τ δ t n t τ δ t n where ρ is the evaporation rate that represents the reduction of pheromone values after each iteration the τ δ t n is the added value of the pheromone after being selected by ants 16 τ δ t n i 1 m τ δ t i n where τ δ t i n is the i th solution in the search space 17 τ δ t i n q logdet m 1 i c d o f selected by i th ant 0 otherwise where q and c d o f are constants related to the effect of the objective function the probability of the input sequences is gradually changing under positive feedback until the optimal input sequence is constructed by solving the optimization problem the amplitudes and durations of steering angles are determined to define the shape of the excitation signal 4 application to the mariner class ship this section implements the optimal input design for the mariner ship as a case study table 2 shows the main dimensions of the mariner class ship the excitation signals are designed to provide informative training data in order to evaluate the performance a comparison study is conducted between optimized training data and the widely used 20 20 zigzag manoeuvre the model mentioned in section 2 is applied to simulate the data its reliability has been verified with experimental results more details about the model such as the values of hydrodynamic coefficients and inertia terms can be found in the literature strom tejsen 1965 for easy implementation in practice the steering angles and the dwell time are discretized with an interval of 5 and 25 s respectively the range of rudder angle is between 30 and 30 and the dwell time is up to 100 s 18 δ 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 dwell time 25 50 75 100 the m level prs signal is designed with six factors to cover the input space thus providing as much dynamic information as possible in this way an input sequence with six steering angles and six corresponding dwell times needs to be optimized it should be mentioned that the greater the number of factors the more dynamic features may be included but at the same time the more variables that need to be optimized since the aco algorithm requires random samplings to obtain high quality results more iterations may be needed to complete the optimization process therefore there is a trade off between the amount of information and computation complexity this paper sets the factor number as a larger number the intention is to explore the effective form of the excitation signal and the general nature of the results as these conclusions may also apply to other series of ships the optimal designs are applied to three degrees of freedom respectively since the objective function values calculated from datasets are different for each degree of freedom the parameters in the aco algorithm are set as follows the number of ants per iteration is 10 and the max iteration number is 450 the initial pheromone value τ 0 is 0 5 and the evaporation rate ρ is 0 05 to validate the convergence of the algorithm the optimizations are repeated ten times fig 2 shows the convergence of optimal values in sway motion similar results are obtained in other degrees of freedom high quality results are obtained within a reasonable operating time all these optimized input signals cover as many rudder angles as possible and the differences are reflected in the sequence and the duration of steering operations although local optimal solutions are sometimes obtained due to the non convexity of the problem the final values of the objective function are close and convergent the low values indicate that these solutions are all informative fig 3 shows the optimal input signal for surge model and fig 4 shows the optimal input signal for sway and yaw models the results show that the maximum information can be obtained simultaneously for sway and yaw equations but it is hard to balance with the surge equation this indicates that some trade offs are needed to make the excitation signal highly informative for three degrees of freedom at the same time alternatively two sets of free running tests can be used to collect data one for the surge model and another for sway and yaw models for the excitation of surge motion two consecutive 30 degree steering angles are contained in the optimized result the optimized input signal for sway and yaw motion tends to include more rudder angles table 3 compares the values of the objective function between the optimized m level prs and the input signal of the 20 20 zigzag manoeuvre which has been widely used in this identification problem luo and zou 2009 sutulo and guedes soares 2014 zhu et al 2017 moreno salinas et al 2019 xu et al 2019 as can be seen cost function values of the m level prs are smaller than that of the 20 20 zigzag signal especially for the surge motion this result implies that the optimized m level prs contains more dynamic information than the 20 20 zigzag signal it is worth noting that even the cost function value of the signal during the iteration is still better than that of the zigzag test this also indicates that the m level prs is more effective than the zigzag signal to further test the properties of the optimized input sequence monte carlo analysis and generalization validation are performed to analyse the impact of the new training data on the variances of parameter estimation and the generalization ability the optimal input in fig 3 is used to excite the surge motion equation and the optimal input in fig 4 is used to train the sway and yaw motion equations the training dataset of the surge equation contains 1150 data points and the training dataset of the sway and yaw equations contains 1100 data points with a time interval of 0 5 s monte carlo analysis tests the performance of parameter estimation for different levels of noise interference the noise variance is selected as a random number with a mean of zero and a variance of 10 of the maximum output values in this way the random sampling simulates different data collection conditions the parameters are identified by the original least squares fig 5 illustrates the smoothed distributions of the partial parameters in the case of 500 times monte carlo simulations the parameter distributions are compared with the results excited by 20 20 zigzag test the variances of parameter estimation decrease significantly after excited by the optimal training data the improvement in the surge equation is remarkable for the hydrodynamic coefficients x u x u u x u u u the parameter drift is effectively reduced by contrast the distribution is very divergent when excited by the 20 20 zigzag test as regards to the sway and yaw equations the optimized training data enhances the robustness of the parameter estimation although parameter estimation still has unstable conditions under noise disturbance which implies that multicollinearity still exists its impact can be further alleviated by model structure selection or robust identification algorithm the parameter drifts can be tolerated under the premise of ensuring the prediction requirements in addition the input signal designed for a specific equation of motion has better performance for parameter estimation of this equation of motion this result implies that the d optimality criterion is effective for quantifying dynamic information in order to maximize the information it is recommended to separately design the optimal excitation signals for the surge equation and the sway and yaw equations respectively to sum up a smaller variance of the parameter identification means that the identified model is more stable and robust these comparisons indicate that the optimized m level prs signal is superior to the widely used zigzag manoeuvre signal to investigate the effect on the generalization performance the prediction of manoeuvring motions is performed including 10 10 20 20 30 30 zigzag and 35 turning manoeuvres the identified model is trained by the dataset polluted by white noise to simulate the effects of measurement noise the variance of the noise is set to 2 of the maximum absolute value of the original response which corresponds to the pre processed data or the data from precision sensors parameters are identified by the original least squares method if the training data includes enough information even if the parameter drift occurs the prediction ability can also be guaranteed for comparison purpose the performance of 20 20 zigzag dataset is also investigated figs 6 9 illustrate the forecast of the heading angle and velocities for 35 turning 10 10 20 20 30 30 zigzag test respectively root mean square error rmse and symmetric mean absolute percentage error smape are used to evaluate the accuracy of prediction see table 4 the index smape measures accuracy based on a percentage error between 0 and 200 which is smaller when the prediction is more accurate it is computed by 19 s m a p e 100 n t 1 n f t a t a t f t 2 where a t is the actual value and f t is the predictive value according to the results high quality predictions are achieved under the excitation of the optimized training data all smape values are below 10 remarkably the predictive accuracy in surge motion has been improved significantly the analysis result from rmse is consistent by contrast when excited by the zigzag test dataset although good accuracy can be obtained when predicting the 20 20 zigzag the accuracy of prediction for other manoeuvres that do not involve in training data cannot be guaranteed there is a large deviation in the prediction of surge speed the prediction cannot even fit the trend especially for the 10 10 zigzag manoeuvre this result implies that insufficient information is provided thus the model cannot predict the motion with different collinearity structure from the training dataset the comparison demonstrates that the optimized m level prs input contains sufficient dynamic information for the predictive model the model identified by optimized excitation is more robust with better generalization ability 5 conclusions an optimal design scheme of the excitation signal has been presented for system identification of ship manoeuvring motion the m level prs is selected as the optimized object to include more nonlinear dynamic features taking the mariner ship as the study object the d optimal input signals are calculated by the aco algorithm for maximizing the information it is recommended to design the excitation signals for the surge equation and the sway and yaw equations separately comparisons with the widely used zigzag input reveals that the optimized m level prs input contains richer dynamic information in the presence of noise interference the reductions in parameter estimation variances and the improvements in generalization ability demonstrate the superiority of the optimized training data especially for the surge equation the optimized training data has significant effects on improving the performance of the identified model it is suggested that engineers give training data a greater role in ship identification modelling future work will aim at taking the propeller thrust into account as another input signal and improving the efficiency of the design algorithm by speeding up the convergence rate based on effective training data the reliability of the model can be further improved by combining effective identification algorithms such as the shrinkage methods and artificial intelligence

22219,among different methods of drag reduction air layer drag reduction aldr has been shown to be promising at least in laboratories although a few examples of its practical application is available important questions regarding the physics of aldr and consequently its design rules and implementation remain to be answered in order to enhance its reliable efficient and widespread use montazeri and alishahi 2019 introduced a hybrid numerical procedure for such a problem capable of producing acceptable and feasible results in comparison with experiments in the present study this procedure is modified and reapplied to the problem and its results are studied in more depth and some aspects of aldr that had been overlooked or even misinterpreted in experimental tests are discussed the results show that the air layer develops and then disintegrates downstream in most cases the ruptured air layer results in mild drag reduction for small air fluxes but high drag reduction happens for large flux values also it is shown that the aldr conduct is insensitive to bumps usually procured during construction results show that employing a superhydrophobic coating on a small surface prior to the injection point provides improved efficiency that would seem promising in practice keywords drag reduction computational fluid dynamics stability hydrophobic 1 introduction ships are one of the main transport vessels and large share of commercial transportation belongs to them the main advantage of marine transportation especially via ships over other transportation means is their lower price tag per mile per ton of freight loading large cargo ships bring about efficiency and cost effectiveness in spite of their huge fuel consumption large number of containers in a cargo ship can make the overall cost per loading lower than other transportation means however any reduction of fuel consumption in ships is still interesting as it may result in even cheaper transportation or faster ships reduction of fuel consumption even as small as 1 percent would bring about large amount of oil savings which is not only interesting financially but also environmentally fuel savings can be categorized into different methods such as increasing the engine or thruster efficiency optimizing the geometry of the hull to reduce its form drag and reducing the hull skin friction drag although any of these choices can be more important than the others per case the share of skin friction drag is usually more than form drag pressure drag in most cases of conventional commercial ships butterworth et al 2015 park et al 2015 this is more pronounced for larger ships e g oil tankers and as a result many researches have been focused on reduction of the skin friction drag of these ship s hull researchers have investigated different methods of friction reduction considering especially their performance and applicability using super hydrophobic surfaces injection of polymers micro bubbles or air layer using partial cavity and traveling inside a supercavity bubble are the most important investigations however some of them e g supercavity cannot be applied to large ships at relatively low speeds although most of these drag reduction methods result in acceptable drag reduction their practical application on commercial ships encompass difficulties implementation of super hydrophobic coatings on wall surface decreases the frictional drag henoch et al 2006 daniello et al 2009 accompanied with an initial and maintenance cost as well however this method entails some disadvantages the most important one is that the drag reduction by this method depends completely on micro nano bubbles of air entrapped inside the micro nano surface roughness structures based on experimental data wang et al 2014 stated that these bubbles may escape from their place when water flows over them for enough time period the super hydrophobic surface without its micro nano air bubbles would result in no drag reduction they claim that this problem can be solved by continuous air injection from the wall in this method the hydrophobic surface should also have porosity and the injected air replaces the escaped air bubbles although the efficiency of this method seems to be high because of low air leakage rate from hydrophobic surface construction and maintenance of a porous hydrophobic hull s surface adjacent to sea water would be difficult another drag reduction method investigated in the literature is bubble injection method in this method micro mini bubbles are injected from the wall the presence of air bubbles inside the boundary layer with lower density and viscosity relative to water changes the velocity and turbulence kinetic energy distribution in wall boundary layer mccormick and bhattacharyya 1973 kanai and miyata 2001 this change finally results in an acceptable drag reduction sanders et al 2006 air is usually injected from a porous wall but injection from thin slot is also investigated by researchers maltzev 1995 elbing et al 2008 murai 2014 listed many experimental and numerical investigations on drag reduction using bubble injection in this method the ratio of the drag reduction to the required air flux which is called gain factor by murai 2014 can be very high because of low air flux requirement however there are some issues on the applicability of this method many researchers e g butterworth et al 2015 studied the size of injected bubbles and reported that an acceptable drag reduction can be achieved using proper bubble size madavan deutsch and merkle 1984 and elbing et al 2008 stated that the size of bubbles changes when they flow downstream from the injection point due to many breakups and coalescences this change in bubble size may decrease the drag reduction such that verschoof et al 2016 experimentally showed 40 drag reduction using 1 mm air bubbles while 0 1 mm bubbles at the same conditions cannot produce drag reduction more than 5 also many researchers including kodama et al 2000 have shown that the injected bubbles leave the wall adjacency when flowing downstream due to boundary layer velocity distribution and corresponding effects in this manner the effect of these bubbles in drag reduction would be almost vanished watanabe masuko and shirose 1998 showed that in their experimental test on a 40 m flat plate the effect of injected bubbles decreased from 40 drag reduction at the injection point to about 10 at 20 m downstream also elbing et al 2008 showed that in their experimental study on 13 m flat plate the drag reduction due to bubble injection decreases from about 80 at 0 5 m downstream of the injection point to less than 20 at 4 5 m downstream this rapid decrease in drag reduction shows the inefficiency of bubble injection method for large hulls although multiple injection points may be used to overcome this problem the required air flux would be higher and construction and maintenance of multiple porous injectors would be more involved one of the interesting methods of drag reduction that has been investigated more recently is making an air layer at the hulls surface required air flux of this method is higher than the micro mini bubble injection method but the drag reduction percentage is also remarkable dns result reported by kim and moin 2010 showed about 100 skin friction reduction and experimental tests results reported by elbing et al 2008 elbing et al 2013 and jang et al 2014 conveyed more than 80 reduction in friction drag this level of drag reduction is reported only for air layer and partial cavity methods in partial cavity method a cavity should be constructed in the hull with a backstep at upstream and a recess at the end part of the hull this cavity should be filled with air and a continuous air injection inside the cavity would compensate the leakage of air from the recess as the leakage flux is low the required air flux of this method is lower than air layer method makiharju et al 2013 reported the air flux requirement for the partial cavity method is about one third of the air layer method alongside the low required air flux and high level of drag reduction partial cavity method entails some weaknesses the most important weakness of this method is that the hull s cavity with a specific depth and length should be designed only for a specific speed of ship makiharju et al 2013 results showed that the required air flux for partial cavity grows very rapidly when flow speed is lower or higher than the designed point also as rotte et al 2016 mentioned if the air injection system is turned off total drag of hull with cavity would be more than a simple flat hull geometry these two problems of partial cavity method make it practically undesirable regarding different aspects of the above methods the conclusion would be that the air layer drag reduction aldr is capable of producing high drag reduction ratio in a vast range of freestream velocities the aldr is mostly studied in experimental tests by researchers e g through investigations by elbing et al 2008 and elbing et al 2013 in these studies different air fluxes are injected onto a 2d flat plate wall surface from small values about 0 01 m2 s to large values about 0 15 m2 s elbing et al 2008 used wall skin friction sensors at 6 different positions downstream of the injection point and their drag reduction were reported for different air fluxes and different water speeds ranging from 6 7 to 18 m s elbing et al 2013 added ldv pitot tube and time of flight tof sensors to find the velocity and void fraction distributions elbing et al 2008 and elbing et al 2013 showed that minor drag reduction less than 30 can be achieved with relatively low air flux increasing the air flux raise the drag reduction percentage almost linearly to values more than 80 which they choose as the air layer development threshold they interpreted the results of the skin friction sensors such that there is a bubble drag reduction regime for low air fluxes and then for higher air flux a transitional air layer would occur where the bubbles are large and air patches are formed in the wall adjacency but the water stream remains in contact with some parts of the wall surface at last for a specific air flux which depends on flow conditions such as water free stream velocity surface roughness and upstream perturbations the air layer would be completely developed and the drag reduction would be more than 80 at the whole wall surface they call this air flux as the critical air flux elbing et al 2013 repeated the experimental test of elbing et al 2008 for free stream velocity of 6 3 m s in this new test the air was injected just downstream of a backward step although the existence of the backstep is claimed to reduce the sensitivity of the air layer to upstream perturbations by elbing et al 2008 jang et al 2014 showed that implementation of side guards are necessary to prevent side air leakages when using injection behind a backstep elbing et al 2013 investigated the effect of upstream perturbations by inserting vortex generators at different angles of attack and showed that the drag reduction does not depend on vortex generators angle of attack significantly when air is injected behind a backstep there are also some numerical simulations of the aldr flow wang yang and stern 2010 used a urans turbulence model spallart almaras model and tried to simulate the elbing et al 2008 s experimental test numerically they found that for very low air fluxes about 0 007 m2 s there is only a minor drag reduction ratio lower than 10 but at 0 007 m2 s air flux a jump in drag reduction is predicted and for air fluxes higher than this value the drag reduction ratio is about 100 this jump in drag reduction is not the case in the experimental results of neither elbing et al 2008 nor other researchers also the critical air flux predicted by wang et al 2010 is about 0 007 m2 s in 6 7 m s water free stream velocity where the experimental results show a value of about 0 04 m2 s in another numerical simulation kim and moin 2010 chose a small numerical domain with the length of about 40 cm and two phase direct numerical simulation of air injection behind a backward facing step was carried out injection of air behind a back step was previously investigated by elbing et al 2008 and it was expressed that the insertion of a back step just upstream of injection point would reduce the air layer sensitivity to upstream perturbations this problem is also studied by elbing et al 2013 and jang et al 2014 afterwards the dns results of kim and moin 2010 were qualitatively compared to experimental results as there were no similar experimental case with the simulated geometry and dimensions kim and moin 2010 showed that a low air flux injection cannot result in a stable and continuous air layer but at high air flux a continuous air layer on the wall would totally prevail although this is qualitatively in agreement with elbing et al 2008 results an important difference can be seen in the dns results fig 6 of kim and moin 2010 paper in comparison with elbing et al 2008 claims the dns results show that when the air flux is not sufficiently high an air layer would be formed near the injection point but there are some growing perturbations that finally cause disintegration of the air layer both the free surface shape and wall skin friction plot show that the air layer exists at near injection region for low air flux this is not in agreement with elbing et al 2008 and elbing et al 2013 statements they stated that for air fluxes lower than the critical value the air layer could not be developed and only bubbles and air patches would be present in another numerical study of aldr montazeri and alishahi 2019 investigated different urans turbulence models and showed that the most physical results among the investigated models would be produced by the well known sst model they showed that this model predicts the overall attribute but the predicted flow is more stable and continuous air layer is present even at lower air fluxes than what was reported in experimental test of elbing et al 2008 this was previously reported by wang et al 2010 paper using spallart almaras model they showed that the simulation weakness is due to incorrect stability prediction in urans simulations with the addition of proper perturbation to the inlet boundary condition comparable results with experimental tests involving minor errors would be obtained they performed many cfd simulations with different perturbation frequencies and found that there is a frequency which leads to the most unstable flow this most unstable flow results in drag reduction similar to the experimental results reported by elbing et al 2008 they also introduced a solution procedure which uses linear stability analysis to find the proper perturbation frequency and showed that the most unstable frequency extracted from this linear stability analysis is in fair agreement with the most unstable case predicted by cfd simulations with different perturbation frequencies two cfd simulations with proper urans model plus one linear stability analysis comprising in their method require much less computer resources and time if compared with dns solutions and hence it is suitable for practical applications it would be a valuable tool for studying the physical aspects of the flow field and specifically determining the outcome of various parameters adjustment involved in this problem montazeri and alishahi 2019 validated this procedure mainly by comparing the numerically predicted drag reduction values with those of experimental results in this paper the same numerical procedure is used to investigate the physical phenomena of aldr flow in more depth also the sensitivity of the air layer to surface bumps is studied to find the robustness and stability of air layer encountering construction faults and appendices then the effects of some parameters is studied to find out if the efficiency of aldr can be enhanced in practical situations 2 hybrid numerical method montazeri and alishahi 2019 proposed a four step numerical procedure for simulation of aldr with an acceptable numerical cost and accuracy these four steps are 1 a simple 2 dimensional cfd simulation with appropriate two phase model urans turbulence model and other numerical methods should be carried out then some quantities such as air layer thickness and velocity distribution of flow in boundary layers should be extracted from cfd results 2 a curve fit must be applied on the velocity distribution of cfd results with proper and preferably physical template as introduced by montazeri and alishahi 2019 3 using the ensued velocity distribution from the 2nd step as the base velocity a two phase linear stability analysis with appropriate boundary conditions should be performed the most unstable frequency from different modes of the flow should be extracted usually the internal mode is dominant when both internal and interfacial modes are present 4 the cfd simulation in the 1st step should be repeated with the addition of a harmonic perturbation with frequency of the unstable mode obtained in the 3rd step as the first step a simple 2 dimensional cfd simulation is carried out by commercial software ansys fluent at two free stream velocities of 6 7 and 11 1 m s each with different air fluxes the geometry and flow conditions are the same as elbing et al 2008 s tests water flows on a 13 m long flat plate and air is injected at 1 38 m location downstream of the flat plate leading edge this step is implemented exactly in the same way as montazeri and alishahi 2019 s investigation and hence full descriptions of the grid independence study turbulence model selection and other numerical aspects are omitted for the sake of briefness in this paper as they mentioned simple simulations with common turbulence models does not produce appropriate results and among different investigated urans models sst model is the only one that correctly predicts the overall behavior of the flow and the relevant physical phenomena as revealed in experimental tests however simulations using sst model result in an air layer with more stability and longer continuous air layer than experimental results fig 1 shows the air layer thickness for these simulations there is no additional perturbations in these simulations other than the inevitable numerical discretization error in this figure nominal air layer thickness ta is used instead of air flux to make two figures with different free stream velocities comparable nominal air layer thickness ta is a simple parameter that represents the ratio of 2d air flux to free stream velocity qa u this parameter has been used by other researchers including elbing et al 2008 and jang et al 2014 as it can be seen minor perturbations happen in air layer but they are not strong enough to disintegrate the air layer except for the lowest nominal air layer thickness in both free stream velocities the disintegration occurs in the lowest nominal thickness for both free stream velocities at locations of about 5 5 7 m downstream the flat plate leading edge which is not in agreement with experimental data jumps of the air layer interface position downstream of the disintegration point are due to the generation of bubbles and patches of air adjacent to and detached from the wall pay attention to the scales of plot axes which make bubbles shapes similar to high frequency noises the nominal thickness of air layer is not the same for simulated cases in these two free stream velocities but two plots in this figure show qualitatively similar behavior although the magnitude of free stream velocities are quite different fig 2 shows the time averaged shape of air layer for these cases it can be seen that the averaged shape of the air layer for cases with close nominal air layer thickness coincide with each other within acceptable error margin it also shows that the shape of the air layer in similar flows depends on nominal air layer thickness and hence the air layer thickness is proportional to the air flux and the inverse of free stream water velocity a close approximation of the required base flow data for the third step in the hybrid numerical algorithm i e the stability analysis can be obtained using these stable air layer flow simulations of the first step thus the air layer thickness and velocity distribution should be extracted from simulations of this step the second step of the procedure is the curve fitting equation 1 is the curve fit template that montazeri and alishahi 2019 used they compared the results of linear stability using this velocity distribution with those of linear velocity distribution which is more common in literature and showed that the correct estimation of base velocity distribution is very important as the stability spectrum using these two conditions is very different in this equation u m is a mean velocity of air layer flow u 0 is the interface velocity x is the downstream position y is the distance from wall and d is the air layer thickness j subscript indicates the air layer properties and e subscript indicates the water stream ones c 1 to c 4 are constant coefficients that must be tuned for a good fit 1 u j e t u m erf d y a 1 erf d a 1 u 0 u m 1 erf y a 2 erf d a 2 u e

the air layer velocity distribution u jet is a combination of two boundary layer profiles similar to stokes first problem solution this type of velocity distribution was used by soderberg 2003 and later montazeri and alishahi 2019 showed that adding a constant coefficient to the formula can also represent an accurate boundary layer profile for flat plate in compliance with the well known blasius velocity profile the water stream velocity distribution u env consists of two parts but only one of them is the stokes like profile the other part in u env is an exponential decay term corresponding to the effect of air water interface imposed on the previously developed boundary layer on wall surface upstream of the injection region montazeri and alishahi 2019 used simple exponential decay because the air water interface has just a minor effect on velocity distribution and it was supposed that an exponential decay term can lead to accurate enough results although the exponential decay term succeeded in accurate curve fit in this paper the water stream velocity distribution is modified to have a more physical shape by changing this exponential term to error function term similar to the other parts of the velocity distribution the effect of this modification on the analysis result is shown in the following the new modified velocity distribution is given in equation 2 2 u j e t u m e r f d y a 1 e r f d a 1 u 0 u m 1 e r f y a 2 e r f d a 2 u e n v u e r f y y p a 3 u 0 u b 1 e r f y a 4 u b u erf y p a 3 a 1 π μ j c 1 x ρ j u m a 2 π μ j c 2 x ρ j u

with its appropriate downstream position x in this version of equation a set of new parameters u b y p has been introduced the pre injection boundary layer is assumed to shift up in y direction by a value of y p at locations downstream of injection point u b is the velocity of water flow inside the boundary layer due to flat plate wall in no injection condition at location of x y p x inj is the length of flat plate prior to the injection point in previous version of the equation used by montazeri and alishahi 2019 equation 1 the equality of shear stress at the interface sides determined u p but in this new version this equality fixes y p instead in this modified version of the template the first term in u env is the boundary layer of the flat plate in no injection condition in this term the x inj is added to x to represent the effect of pre injection boundary layer growth also the y coordinate is shifted by y p which means that the pre injection boundary layer shifts by y p in y direction in post injection locations the amount of this shift y p is determined by the condition of shear stress equality at the interface sides the second term of u env is the effect of air water interface which also assumed to grow similar to stokes profile as the first term results a velocity at interface the second term uses u 0 u b as its governing velocity to have the correct interface velocity at y 0 using the new modified template and tuning the constant coefficients the best curve fit on cfd results was obtained fig 3 shows this fitting of the results for three air fluxes in free stream velocity of 11 1 m s as can be seen the fitted curve matches well on cfd results points as the previous template was also shown to match the cfd data by montazeri and alishahi 2019 it seems that this modification does not provide any sensible improvement however the main difference of these two versions is in the shape of boundary layer of air water interface in water stream and the new modified version is expected to be more physical than the previous exponential decay form as it applies a form of stokes problem solution a physical solution but the previous version used a simple exponential form just a mathematical fit with no physical background as mentioned before both versions of velocity distribution templates compromise a proper curve fit and many other functions can also be fitted on velocity distribution data from cfd results with good accuracy also introducing a complex velocity distribution to have an accurate curve fit may be questionable the key point is that the first and second derivative of the velocity distribution are present in eigen system matrix equations and play important roles in the stability analysis the presence of these derivatives can be seen in orr sommerfeld equation equation 3 and its boundary conditions equation 4 at air water interface location in these equations u is the base velocity and j and e subscripts mean values corresponding to air jet and water stream environment sides of interface ψ and φ are perturbation stream functions of air and water stream respectively k and c are non dimensional wave number and wave speed m is the water to air viscosity ratio and re and fr are reynolds and froude numbers based on air properties and air layer thickness reference length 3 ψ k 2 ψ u c ψ u i ν k ν j r e k 4 ψ 2 k 2 ψ

these equations are solved numerically using the chebyshev polynomials values of velocity derivatives are derived by direct differentiation of the fitted velocity curve since in a normal curve fit process one only tries to lower the difference between values of the curve fit and the velocity data points not paying attention to the velocity derivatives the usual curve fit of the base velocity would not provide reliable stability analysis results one of the proper methods if do not call it the best to provide correct velocity and its derivatives information simultaneously is to use a function that represents the physical aspects of the flow in this manner the derivatives accuracy only depends on fitting accuracy of the velocity data as the derivative information is previously contained in the velocity template to clarify the difference of these two versions of velocity distributions first and second derivatives of the fitted curve using both versions of template is compared in fig 4 as can be seen although the curve of velocity distribution using two versions are not sensibly different shapes of the derivatives are completely different as the shear stress equality is solved for both versions the first derivative of velocity at origin is identical for two distributions but there is one additional maxima in the new version derivative the origin is put on the interface as was shown by montazeri and alishahi 2019 as these derivatives are present in the governing differential equation and its boundary conditions they are crucially important in finding correct stability spectrum it is noteworthy that why this point has not received enough attention from previous researchers that might be due to simple boundary conditions that they employed straightforward velocity distribution uniform or linear velocity profile for their specific stability analysis the 3rd step in the above solution procedure is the linear stability analysis two phase orr sommerfeld equation was solved numerically using sufficient number of chebyshev polynomials boundary conditions of perturbations was set at flat plate wall free stream virtual wall and instantaneous air water interface location this analysis was carried out just similar to montazeri and alishahi 2019 except the modification in the template formulation of base velocity distribution as explained above fig 5 shows results of linear stability analysis using both versions of the template formulation previous version at left and new modified version at middle this figure shows that the most unstable frequency for different air fluxes are changed in the new analysis version also the magnitude of growth rate is changed to a large extent it is noteworthy to mention that all of these differences are due to the minor change in formulation of velocity distribution with no significant change in curve fit accuracy fig 5 also shows cfd results of montazeri and alishahi 2019 as mentioned before they performed many cfd simulations with different perturbation frequencies different instabilities with different power and tendency of the air layer toward disintegration were found almost in all cases they used continuous air layer length as the variable that reveals these different flow conditions and tendencies stability analysis results and cfd ones in fig 5 can be compared by comparing the most unstable frequencies the agreement of the present linear stability analysis with montazeri and alishahi 2019 s cfd simulations are better than the previous linear analysis this can be seen specifically for 0 06 m2 s air flux where the cfd simulations show that the flow experiences its most unstable state when it is perturbed at 200 rad s frequency and the linear stability analysis using the new velocity distribution predicts 240 rad s as the most unstable frequency while the old velocity distribution forecast was 340 rad s this improvement again shows the fact that the base velocity should be set as accurate as possible by correct modelling of base flow field physics the last step in the numerical simulation procedure is to repeat the first step cfd simulations with the addition of harmonic perturbation in boundary condition with the frequency of the most unstable mode of flow extracted from linear stability analysis the perturbation is added to the inlet boundary condition of air as a fluctuation of velocity about its mean value the air layer shape predicted in these simulations are plotted in fig 6 the air layer is completely different from what was shown in fig 1 due to the mentioned perturbations added in the air injection boundary condition the effect of the fluctuation amplitude was also investigated by comparing 1 3 5 and 10 values the conclusion is that there is no significant difference between these perturbation results this implies that the fluctuations in air layer interface is mainly related to the flow instabilities and not to the magnitude of forced perturbations at the inlet boundary the added velocity fluctuation at the boundary only triggers the unstable growth thus the cfd simulations were carried out with 3 perturbation of air velocity about its mean value in practice a perturbation with 3 fluctuation amplitude seems to be physical due to the compressor and other mechanical and environmental vibrations and noises as is shown in fig 6 the predicted unstable flow shows very large fluctuations compared to this initial amplitude which confirms that the fluctuation is due to the instability of the flow rather than an initial forced perturbation 3 results and discussion 3 1 investigation of aldr flow field drag reduction results of the hybrid numerical simulations at a sensor point located at 6 m downstream of the injection point are plotted in fig 7 alongside the experimental results from elbing et al 2008 results of the mentioned procedure shows acceptable accuracy in comparison with experimental data pay attention to the difference between the first simple numerical simulations with no additional perturbation and forth step results where the first step simulations with no additional perturbation predict 100 drag reduction even for low air fluxes but the addition of the perturbations step 4 brings the results to an acceptable range from the experiment another test case is also studied here with the injection of air behind a backstep elbing et al 2013 s test case geometry and conditions elbing et al 2013 reported the average of three drag reduction ratio measured by three skin friction sensors located at three different downstream locations similar results were extracted from numerical simulations and are plotted in fig 8 the error of the drag reduction ratio predicted by the numerical simulations is in quite satisfactory range from experiment elbing et al 2013 also reported velocity and void fraction distributions these data were reported as the average of three sensors output at three different positions distributed along the total flat plate length for different vortex generator configurations including the case of no vortex generators similar results were extracted from numerical simulations without any vortex generators and are plotted in fig 9 as the computed flow field contains different time dependent fluctuations the numerical data are presented as time averaged values in a relatively large time period of about 3 s in this figure the experimental data of void fraction are plotted for two different air fluxes elbing et al 2013 stated that the drag reduction for these two air fluxes are above 80 and accordingly the air layer development should be complete in these cases fig 9 shows the velocity distribution of both experimental and numerical results elbing et al 2013 measured velocity of the water flow using ldv in regions of almost no void fraction velocity distribution in regions of higher void fraction where both air and water phases are present was measured by time of flight sensor the time of flight sensor measures the velocity of two phase flow using its phase interface velocity but it does not provide any data when only one phase is present thus as elbing et al 2013 also stated the measurements of velocity in regions with high void fraction is not as accurate as other regions therefore the anomaly in experimental void fraction close to the wall is somehow expectable as fig 9 shows the numerical water velocity distribution is in complete agreement with experiment but the two phase velocity distributions are different to some extent elbing et al 2013 proposed a three layer velocity distribution in aldr the first part adjacent to the wall filled mainly with air and a constant velocity about 20 of free stream velocity the third part in water only region with velocity distribution very similar to no injection boundary layer distribution and a buffer layer second part between these two parts with almost linear velocity variations however there is a shortcoming with this proposal as it doesn t account for the value of air flux it is noticeable that the elbing et al 2013 proposal is stated only for air fluxes that result in complete air layer development on the other hand the numerical velocity distribution can be described as it consists of only two parts one is the outer region where the velocity distribution is very similar to no injection boundary layer just like the experimental data acquired by ldv measurements and the other is the inner region where the air layer is qualitatively similar to an unsteady couette flow velocity profile in starting times of flow the velocity distribution in this inner part consists of two boundary layers on the wall surface and air water interface and may gradually change toward a fully developed profile if the air layer remains stable and persists without significant change in thickness later in this section in fig 10 variation of velocity distribution at different downstream positions is presented and discussed although the location of void fraction rise in numerical and experimental results are close as shown in fig 9 there are two main differences in these results one is a minor void fraction rise up to 20 in both experimental data while it is not present in the numerical output the other difference is a drop in experimental void fraction at wall adjacency especially for air flux of 0 053 m2 s the first difference may be due to some small free bubbles above the air layer in experimental test and seems not to be so important the drop in void fraction at wall adjacency in experimental data is not in agreement with the physics of a continuous full air layer the existence of an air layer by itself implies a continuous stratified air layer adjacent to the wall and consequently a void fraction of unity at the wall this strange behavior in fig 9 can be seen mainly in the lower air flux and the data for the higher air flux are more reasonable it is noteworthy that according to elbing et al 2013 the error in void fraction measurement is up to 15 in regions of high void fraction namely inside the air layer note that both air fluxes result in high drag reductions in the experiments and expressed as developed air layer by elbing et al 2013 to get a better insight of the flow field these velocity and void fraction distributions are shown in fig 10 at each position separately not the average of three positions for three different air fluxes these data are also the time averaged numerical results in this figure the horizontal axis is the normal distance to the wall scaled by nominal air layer thickness instead of no injection boundary layer thickness as can be seen in the top row of fig 10 the void fraction is unity close to the wall and at the first station closest to the injection point for all three air fluxes this shows the existence of an air layer even for low air fluxes in the vicinity of the injection point at this station a relatively sharp interface between air and water can be inferred from large slope of void fraction distribution at the second station i e the middle row it seems that the air layer thickness is decreased and the interface of air water is not as sharp as the first station in other words the air layer bears some time fluctuations and the air water interface moves up and down resulting in a void fraction value between 0 and 1 from the time averaging process and hence a decrease in void fraction slope would be seen also this figure shows that there is almost no air layer in second position for the lowest air flux ta 3 6 mm i e the air layer is ruptured as the void fraction is not unity at the wall further downstream at the third station the air layer is also ruptured for medium and high air fluxes ta 5 4 and 6 3 mm as can be seen in this figure when the air layer disintegrates and the void fraction drops from unity to a lower value at the wall there is a maximum in void fraction distribution near the wall but not at the wall in all cases in other words when the air layer disintegrates into bubbles and air patches they start to move away from the wall surface and flow mostly along a stream parallel to the wall but in a distance away from it this is in agreement with the finding of some previous researchers including kodama et al 2000 and merkle et al 1990 they stated that air bubbles tend to escape from the wall surface in a boundary layer flow this is also consistent with the earlier mentioned drop in void fraction at the wall in elbing et al 2013 measurements for the lower air flux in fig 9 they stated that at this air flux a continuous air layer would prevail throughout the flat plate and high drag reduction ratio is resulted in contrast to their reasoning if the present numerical results are accepted the void fraction drop in elbing et al 2013 s test data for 0 053 m2 s air flux should be due to a degenerated air layer and we are faced with a ruptured air layer instead of continuous one in fig 8 the measured drag reduction ratio for the cases of qa 0 06 and 0 08 m2 s ta 0 01 and 0 013 m is more than 80 and probably these high drag reduction ratios suggested the existence of continuous air layer in elbing et al 2008 and elbing et al 2013 however the present numerical simulations show that despite of the air layer rupture void fraction at the wall remains high and consequently the drag reduction ratio is also high it is important to note that for a wide range of air fluxes the existence of air layer with different continuous length does not have any conflict with raw experimental measurements in contrast to some researchers misinterpretation of their measurement high values of drag reduction without a continuous air layer is also reported in an experimental test on flat plate by park et al 2015 they used pulsatile injection instead of continuous steady injection of air and hence resulted in discontinuous air layer repetitive injection of air leads to transitional aldr which can be assumed to be similar to the ruptured air layer as both contain large bubbles and air patches with high void fraction near the wall in their experiment they showed that this type of flow brings about high drag reduction ratios similar to continuous air layer their finding confirms that high drag reduction values can be achieved even when there is no continuous air layer there is also another point in fig 10 void fraction plots it can be seen that the air layer has an initial thickness thickness of regions with more than 50 void fraction and this thickness decreases downstream the air layer disintegrates at a position which is different for different air fluxes to further investigate the disintegration point of the air layer the time averaged air layer thickness is plotted in fig 11 for different nominal air layer thicknesses the ordinate in this figure is the normalized air layer interface position which is the ratio of actual time averaged interface position to its nominal thickness the figure represents results for different air fluxes for both elbing et al 2008 and elbing et al 2013 test cases without and with backstep implementation upstream of the injection point air layer thickness in cases containing the backstep starts from the step height and gradually decreases downstream note that the step height is the same in different cases but the air flux changes and hence the normalized step height is different for different cases in cases without the backstep air layer starts from zero thickness and a growth in thickness near injection location can be seen which is due to the injection angle and air water stream momentum balance following this increase in air layer thickness the air layer continues downstream with a gradual reduction in thickness the air layer fluctuates before disintegration point but as the fluctuation is nearly symmetric the time averaged air layer thickness does not change significantly due to these fluctuations for all cases that are plotted in this figure including cases with and without backstep the air layer thickness jumps to a lower value at some specific point which is the disintegration point of air layer when the air layer disintegrates into bubbles and air patches they flow inside the boundary layer and often touch the wall surface these touches make the time averaged air layer thickness to have a non zero value even when there is no actual continuous air layer after the disintegration point there are many bubbles and air patches which many of them do not touch the wall and so they have no effect in time averaged air layer thickness hence at the disintegration point the averaged thickness should suddenly drop to a small value which can be seen for almost all cases however in fig 11 it can be seen that higher air fluxes result in smoother change of air layer thickness at disintegration point which may be due to higher void fraction in ruptured air layer region and many contacts of bubbles and wall surface in that region in fig 11 there is a remarkable topic the horizontal thick light grey line shows normalized interface position of 1 which means that the actual time averaged thickness of air layer is equal to its nominal value almost all of studied cases show a change in their interface position slope at this line hence the point of disintegration for these different cases have interestingly almost identical normalized air layer thickness equal to unity this means that the air layer thickness is equal to its nominal thickness at the disintegration point in other words the air layer thickness decreases gradually from an initial value and when the time averaged thickness reaches its nominal thickness qa u the air layer disintegrates suddenly this phenomenon can be seen in all cases including cases with backstep and cases without backstep fig 11 brings about the hint that the air layer seems to disintegrate at a point where the air layer thickness equals its nominal value this may suggest the simplification of numerical procedure using the air layer thickness result from simple non perturbed simulation to find the disintegration point without accomplishing the forth step cfd simulation fig 1 shows the air layer thickness for non perturbed simulation first step while fig 11 shows the time averaged of air layer thickness for perturbed simulation forth step as the added perturbations are harmonic and symmetric the time average of perturbed flow may be expected to be similar to the non perturbed flow at least before the disintegration paying more attention reveals that the gradual thinning of the air layer in fig 11 is different from what can be seen in fig 1 the addition of perturbation in inflow velocity boundary condition seems to change the averaged air layer shape although the perturbation is harmonic and symmetric maybe due to nonlinearities of the flow this shows that the numerical simulation of the flow without the additional perturbations does not predict even the averaged air layer thickness before disintegration and performing the perturbed simulation is essential fig 11 can also be used to investigate the effect of backstep implementation on the performance of aldr although the nominal air layer thicknesses are not exactly identical for two cases of with and without backstep it can be seen that for cases with almost the same nominal thickness the existence of the backstep causes a fixed initial air layer thickness and the air layer thickness decreases gradually toward the thickness of no backstep case the rupture of air layer in both cases are almost at the same position except for low nominal thickness case this means that the existence of the backstep cannot postpone the disintegration point of the air layer to have a higher performance this is in agreement with the experimental data of elbing et al 2008 and elbing et al 2013 as explained in the following from another point of view as can be seen in fig 12 the drag reduction ratios reported by elbing et al 2008 without implementation of backstep at free stream velocity of 6 7 m s is almost the same as the data reported by elbing et al 2013 using backstep at free stream velocity of 6 3 m s this shows that the backstep cannot increase the drag reduction performance of aldr although it may lower the sensitivity of air layer to upstream perturbations the disintegration point for low air fluxes is relatively near the injection point in no backstep cases and the step height is much larger than the air layer thickness in identical case using backstep present numerical simulations show that large initial thickness due to the backstep in these cases may send the disintegration point further downstream as can be seen for nominal thickness of 3 mm in fig 11 this is favorable if low air flux is used more than one point of injection may be chosen in this situation to accomplish the air layer on the whole hull surface although it is not so advantageous as it increases the no injection drag and the overall air flux may also be high 3 2 aldr sensitivity investigation as mentioned earlier aldr is capable of hydrodynamic frictional drag reduction to a great extent in the previous section it was shown that a continuous and stable air layer may cancel out the frictional drag by almost 100 although high drag reductions are also present in cases of ruptured air layers for relatively high air fluxes it is more favorable to maintain a continuous air layer instead of a ruptured layer which includes bubbles and air patches ruptured air layer may gradually loose the tendency of high drag reduction when bubbles move away from the wall surface and void fraction in boundary layer decreases thus any disintegration of air layer should be assumed as non favorable one of the noticeable impacts that an air layer may encounter is the existence of wall surface bumps during the construction of a ship s hull there would be many bumps on the surface due to manufacturing errors and tolerances if the air layer is so sensitive to these bumps disintegration of the layer may occur which might construct the most important weakness of the aldr when applied practically thus the air layer sensitivity to bumps on the flat plate surface is studied in this section referring to fig 11 it seems that the nominal air layer thickness would be the critical value for time averaged air layer thickness such that the disintegration of air layer would occur if its time averaged thickness reaches this critical value hence bump heights more than nominal air layer thickness would be unacceptable for lower bumps on the wall surface the velocity distribution of the air layer may change new velocity distribution might increase or decrease the air layer thickness depending on the shape of the new distribution this means that the change in velocity distribution and whether to increase or decrease the air layer thickness may have a stabilizing or destabilizing effect on the flow as the first case of this study circular curves with the length of 0 6 m were placed on the wall surface the numerical simulation was carried out at 11 1 m s free stream velocity and 0 04 m2 s air flux two bumps were inserted on the wall one at 1 5 m and the other at 3 m downstream of the injection point results for this flow without any bumps showed that the air layer degenerates at about 1 8 m downstream of the injection point destabilizing or stabilizing effect of bumps may cause the air layer to disintegrate before destabilizing effect or after the first bump or even the air layer may survive to the second bump location stabilizing effect as the nominal air layer thickness is about 3 6 mm for the studied case three sizes of bumps were investigated with heights of 1 2 and 3 mm instantaneous and time averaged results of the simulation are shown in fig 13 and indicate a different conduct than what is expected the air layer thickness change is insensible at bumps location and also the fluctuations in air layer do not increase or decrease due to bumps it shows that this type of smooth bumps does not have any favorable or unfavorable stabilizing or destabilizing effects on the air layer another configuration of bumps is also studied in this investigation a triangular section was considered with a small slope in upstream direction and a backward facing step downstream fig 14 similar to the smooth bumps three sizes of 1 2 and 3 mm height and 0 6 m length of the triangular bumps were studied and they were placed at the same positions of previous bumps to check if the position of the protrusions changes their effect the triangular bumps with 1 mm height were also placed at new position of 0 9 and 2 4 m downstream of injection point in another simulation it might be expected that the triangular bumps initiate a separated flow at their backstep base and thus the air layer thickness increases the instantaneous and averaged air water interface location is plotted in fig 14 for these four configurations as can be seen again the triangles do not have any noticeable effect on air layer similar to smooth bumps 3 3 enhancement of aldr performance performance of drag reduction methods based on air injection can be evaluated via gain factor ratio of overall drag reduction to the required air flux any increase in drag reduction or lowering the required air flux improves the efficiency of the process regarding this some parameters are changed to check whether the performance of aldr can be enhanced one of the parameters that might play a role in the instabilities of this flow the kelvin helmholtz instability is the surface tension of water in standard conditions the surface tension coefficient σ of water air interface is about 0 07 n m but it can be changed by addition of some soluble liquids into the water injection of surfactant into the water flow is shown to change the surface tension coefficient by researchers e g elbing et al 2008 elbing et al 2008 injected triton x 100 into water stream and their measurements showed that the surface tension coefficient was reduced from 0 07 to 0 05 n m they investigated the effect of this change on bubble drag reduction bdr they showed that the change in bubble drag reduction and bubble size due to the change in surface tension is not significant they also measured the critical air flux for both normal water and water with additional surfactant their result shows just a minor difference between these two conditions if this minor difference is assumed not to be the measurement error the lower surface tension is showed to result in higher critical air flux by elbing et al 2008 in the present study the effect of surface tension is studied for aldr numerical simulation of the aldr flow field for 0 04 m2 s air flux and 11 1 m s free stream velocity was reproduced with surface tension coefficients of 0 05 and 0 1 n m surface tension coefficient is present in linear stability analysis in the phase interface boundary condition i e the last boundary condition in equation 4 on the other hand surface tension is considered in numerical simulations as a force proportional to its coefficient and phase interface surface curvature in momentum equation for cells which contain the interface fig 15 shows the results of these two cases alongside the original simulation with surface tension coefficient of 0 07 n m as can be seen the change in surface tension does not produce any visible enhancement in air layer in order to make the air layer more stable or to increase its continuous length without any rupture the air layer thickness should be increased if the air layer thickness increases in any other means the disintegration point might be pushed back downstream the air layer thickness can be raised by increasing the air flux but it is not desired as the efficiency of the aldr decreases the other way to expand the air layer is to change the air velocity distribution bounded by mass conservation of air this change in velocity distribution may be brought up by a change in wall shear rate probably due to non smoothness velocity distribution of water in contact with the wall can produce an effect on the interface velocity distribution and even on the air layer velocity distribution all of the previous cfd simulations in this paper were carried out assuming smooth surface condition non favorable effect of increasing the surface roughness on aldr is reported by elbing et al 2008 as the required air flux to establish the air layer increases thus the hydrophobicity of the wall surface is investigated in this study as it might be expected that the hydrophobicity has an opposite effect comparing with the wall roughness a hydrophobic surface is a surface with a material that repels water molecules having such a material the hydrophobicity of a surface can be enhanced by the use of micro nano roughness numerical modelling of flow on hydrophobic surface is usually done in two steps first a very small numerical domain with the specific roughness on the wall is simulated using dns or at least les methods then an equivalent navier slip length is estimated from such a simulation vast range of slip lengths is reported in experimental and numerical researches from very small values some nanometers for simpler hydrophobic surfaces to large values up to 0 4 mm for ultrahydrophobic surfaces with hierarchial wall roughness structures lee and kim 2009 slip lengths of some tens of micrometers is more common in literature as large and yet practical values song daniello and rothstein 2014 reported 0 02 mm and li et al 2009 reported 0 04 mm slip length in their measurements larger slip lengths are also reported in academic researches i e 0 1 mm by lee and kim 2011 0 05 0 25 mm by maali and bhushan 2012 and 0 4 mm by lee and choi 2008 production of ultrahydrophobic surfaces with such a large slip length in practical applications has not been accomplished yet but perhaps it would be achieved in the future nowadays superhydrophobic surfaces with slip lengths of tens of micrometers are constructed and used in practice in this paper a navier slip length value is used and it is assumed that a surface with some specific material and roughness structure and size can be constructed to have such a navier slip length value the navier slip length in aldr solution was implemented by setting up a slip velocity at the wall surface this slip velocity was set to zero for cells with void fractions greater than 0 5 assumed to be air filled cells that is usual no slip condition on the other hand cells with void fractions less than 0 5 are assumed to be water filled and the hydrophobicity effect should be set in these cells the slip velocity was set equal to τ w l μ where τ w is the wall shear stress and l is the slip length as the wall shear stress depends on wall slip velocity enough iterations should be performed at each time step to ensure convergence of wall shear stress and slip velocity some slip lengths ranging from 0 02 mm to 2 mm were considered and aldr flow was simulated for 11 1 m s water free stream velocity and 0 04 m2 s air flux fig 16 shows the length of continuous air layer in these cases with different navier slip lengths also fig 17 shows the air layer shape for three cases among these the hydrophobicity of the wall makes the air layer more stable and the continuous air layer length is increased from 1 6 m to about 3 5 m in cases with larger slip lengths but it does not provide major enhancement in cases with small slip lengths as can be seen in fig 16 in the studied flow conditions 0 4 mm is the critical slip length and air layer enhancement is evident for larger slip lengths while minor improvements can be seen for smaller values as mentioned before achieving the slip lengths larger than this critical value is not straightforward yet but it seems not to be impossible this critical slip length could be different for other flow conditions water stream velocity and air flux the next test case was carried out only for 1 mm slip length this test case with 0 06 m2 s air flux was chosen to ensure if such an improvement exists for other conditions fig 18 shows the result of this case and similar improvement can be seen for 0 06 m2 s air flux case in this combined application of air layer method and hydrophobic wall surface if the air layer develops and continues to the end of flat plate or practically hull wall surface almost no water wall contact would be present in such cases the hydrophobicity of wall would have no positive effect as the wall does not have any contact with water thus the hydrophobicity should affect the flow at regions with no air layer i e regions prior to the injection point thus the difference of water boundary layer velocity distribution at injection point between the normal case and hydrophobic surface might be the origin of the stabilizing effect if there is such an effect to investigate this statement previous simulation is repeated with new boundary conditions two new cases are studied one with a hydrophobic surface at the leading edge of flat plate up to 0 5 m upstream of injection point farfield hydrophobic case and the other case is the nearfield hydrophobic case with a hydrophobic surface just upstream of injection point from 0 5 m upstream of injection point to the point of injection both cases have normal no slip wall condition downstream of injection fig 19 shows the result of these two cases in comparison with the case of totally hydrophobic flat plate as can be seen the farfield hydrophobic case does not show the total hydrophobic wall improvement but the nearfield hydrophobic case shows very similar result to the reference case this shows that the main effect of hydrophobicity comes from a region just upstream of injection point this is an important result as it means that in practice there is no need to construct the hydrophobic coating on the whole ship s hull but only a relatively small region upstream of the injection point is enough to stabilize the air layer for a longer distance 4 conclusions air layer drag reduction is said to be a successful and cost efficient method for hydrodynamic skin friction reduction it was studied experimentally in literature but just a few complete numerical dns or les investigations are available due to huge computational resource requirements montazeri and alishahi 2019 proposed a numerical procedure to provide acceptable numerical predictions of this flow with low computational cost this procedure with minor modification was reapplied to various aldr problems in this study numerical results showed that the air layer develops for almost all air fluxes in any free stream water velocity while the length of continuous air layer changes by conditions of each specific case for low air fluxes in high free stream velocities low nominal air layer thickness the air layer encounters instabilities that grow up and bring about disintegration of air layer numerical simulation of different cases showed that the air layer disintegrates when its time averaged thickness reaches its nominal thickness this phenomenon was seen in almost all simulated cases in this paper however it can be imagined that for large enough nominal air layer thickness the instabilities occur in such long distances downstream that no effect would be observed in practice a drop in void fraction at wall adjacency is reported in experimental results of elbing et al 2013 for aldr cases present numerical simulations show that this means ruptured air layer for large enough nominal air layer thickness this ruptured air layer can still result in high drag reduction ratio which may be misinterpreted as continuous air layer drag reduction for the enhancement of aldr performance different parameters effects were studied it was shown that implementation of backstep just upstream of injection point cannot increase the performance of aldr unless for small nominal thickness relative to the step height changing the surface tension was also non effective covering the wall surface with hydrophobic coating was shown to be a successful option which resulted in a longer continuous air layer minor improvement was shown for small and more common slip lengths while major improvement was seen for large slip lengths which may be realized in future the conclusion is that the main effect of hydrophobicity comes from an upstream region near the injection point this is an important result as it shows that with a small amount of effort and money for implementation of hydrophobic surface on this small area the performance of aldr can be noticeably improved as the construction and maintenance of a hydrophobic surface on small region would be cheap and cost effective this method should be desirable implementation of bumps both in smooth circular and triangular step shapes showed no noticeable effect on the air layer this means that the air layer sensitivity to minor construction errors and tolerances is negligible and no instabilities or rupture of the air layer would occur in practice as a general conclusion the numerical result of this study shows that the aldr seems to be a robust enough method to be used practically and its combination with hydrophobic surface in a relatively small upstream area enhances its performance remarkably author contributions section mohammad hossein montazeri

22219,among different methods of drag reduction air layer drag reduction aldr has been shown to be promising at least in laboratories although a few examples of its practical application is available important questions regarding the physics of aldr and consequently its design rules and implementation remain to be answered in order to enhance its reliable efficient and widespread use montazeri and alishahi 2019 introduced a hybrid numerical procedure for such a problem capable of producing acceptable and feasible results in comparison with experiments in the present study this procedure is modified and reapplied to the problem and its results are studied in more depth and some aspects of aldr that had been overlooked or even misinterpreted in experimental tests are discussed the results show that the air layer develops and then disintegrates downstream in most cases the ruptured air layer results in mild drag reduction for small air fluxes but high drag reduction happens for large flux values also it is shown that the aldr conduct is insensitive to bumps usually procured during construction results show that employing a superhydrophobic coating on a small surface prior to the injection point provides improved efficiency that would seem promising in practice keywords drag reduction computational fluid dynamics stability hydrophobic 1 introduction ships are one of the main transport vessels and large share of commercial transportation belongs to them the main advantage of marine transportation especially via ships over other transportation means is their lower price tag per mile per ton of freight loading large cargo ships bring about efficiency and cost effectiveness in spite of their huge fuel consumption large number of containers in a cargo ship can make the overall cost per loading lower than other transportation means however any reduction of fuel consumption in ships is still interesting as it may result in even cheaper transportation or faster ships reduction of fuel consumption even as small as 1 percent would bring about large amount of oil savings which is not only interesting financially but also environmentally fuel savings can be categorized into different methods such as increasing the engine or thruster efficiency optimizing the geometry of the hull to reduce its form drag and reducing the hull skin friction drag although any of these choices can be more important than the others per case the share of skin friction drag is usually more than form drag pressure drag in most cases of conventional commercial ships butterworth et al 2015 park et al 2015 this is more pronounced for larger ships e g oil tankers and as a result many researches have been focused on reduction of the skin friction drag of these ship s hull researchers have investigated different methods of friction reduction considering especially their performance and applicability using super hydrophobic surfaces injection of polymers micro bubbles or air layer using partial cavity and traveling inside a supercavity bubble are the most important investigations however some of them e g supercavity cannot be applied to large ships at relatively low speeds although most of these drag reduction methods result in acceptable drag reduction their practical application on commercial ships encompass difficulties implementation of super hydrophobic coatings on wall surface decreases the frictional drag henoch et al 2006 daniello et al 2009 accompanied with an initial and maintenance cost as well however this method entails some disadvantages the most important one is that the drag reduction by this method depends completely on micro nano bubbles of air entrapped inside the micro nano surface roughness structures based on experimental data wang et al 2014 stated that these bubbles may escape from their place when water flows over them for enough time period the super hydrophobic surface without its micro nano air bubbles would result in no drag reduction they claim that this problem can be solved by continuous air injection from the wall in this method the hydrophobic surface should also have porosity and the injected air replaces the escaped air bubbles although the efficiency of this method seems to be high because of low air leakage rate from hydrophobic surface construction and maintenance of a porous hydrophobic hull s surface adjacent to sea water would be difficult another drag reduction method investigated in the literature is bubble injection method in this method micro mini bubbles are injected from the wall the presence of air bubbles inside the boundary layer with lower density and viscosity relative to water changes the velocity and turbulence kinetic energy distribution in wall boundary layer mccormick and bhattacharyya 1973 kanai and miyata 2001 this change finally results in an acceptable drag reduction sanders et al 2006 air is usually injected from a porous wall but injection from thin slot is also investigated by researchers maltzev 1995 elbing et al 2008 murai 2014 listed many experimental and numerical investigations on drag reduction using bubble injection in this method the ratio of the drag reduction to the required air flux which is called gain factor by murai 2014 can be very high because of low air flux requirement however there are some issues on the applicability of this method many researchers e g butterworth et al 2015 studied the size of injected bubbles and reported that an acceptable drag reduction can be achieved using proper bubble size madavan deutsch and merkle 1984 and elbing et al 2008 stated that the size of bubbles changes when they flow downstream from the injection point due to many breakups and coalescences this change in bubble size may decrease the drag reduction such that verschoof et al 2016 experimentally showed 40 drag reduction using 1 mm air bubbles while 0 1 mm bubbles at the same conditions cannot produce drag reduction more than 5 also many researchers including kodama et al 2000 have shown that the injected bubbles leave the wall adjacency when flowing downstream due to boundary layer velocity distribution and corresponding effects in this manner the effect of these bubbles in drag reduction would be almost vanished watanabe masuko and shirose 1998 showed that in their experimental test on a 40 m flat plate the effect of injected bubbles decreased from 40 drag reduction at the injection point to about 10 at 20 m downstream also elbing et al 2008 showed that in their experimental study on 13 m flat plate the drag reduction due to bubble injection decreases from about 80 at 0 5 m downstream of the injection point to less than 20 at 4 5 m downstream this rapid decrease in drag reduction shows the inefficiency of bubble injection method for large hulls although multiple injection points may be used to overcome this problem the required air flux would be higher and construction and maintenance of multiple porous injectors would be more involved one of the interesting methods of drag reduction that has been investigated more recently is making an air layer at the hulls surface required air flux of this method is higher than the micro mini bubble injection method but the drag reduction percentage is also remarkable dns result reported by kim and moin 2010 showed about 100 skin friction reduction and experimental tests results reported by elbing et al 2008 elbing et al 2013 and jang et al 2014 conveyed more than 80 reduction in friction drag this level of drag reduction is reported only for air layer and partial cavity methods in partial cavity method a cavity should be constructed in the hull with a backstep at upstream and a recess at the end part of the hull this cavity should be filled with air and a continuous air injection inside the cavity would compensate the leakage of air from the recess as the leakage flux is low the required air flux of this method is lower than air layer method makiharju et al 2013 reported the air flux requirement for the partial cavity method is about one third of the air layer method alongside the low required air flux and high level of drag reduction partial cavity method entails some weaknesses the most important weakness of this method is that the hull s cavity with a specific depth and length should be designed only for a specific speed of ship makiharju et al 2013 results showed that the required air flux for partial cavity grows very rapidly when flow speed is lower or higher than the designed point also as rotte et al 2016 mentioned if the air injection system is turned off total drag of hull with cavity would be more than a simple flat hull geometry these two problems of partial cavity method make it practically undesirable regarding different aspects of the above methods the conclusion would be that the air layer drag reduction aldr is capable of producing high drag reduction ratio in a vast range of freestream velocities the aldr is mostly studied in experimental tests by researchers e g through investigations by elbing et al 2008 and elbing et al 2013 in these studies different air fluxes are injected onto a 2d flat plate wall surface from small values about 0 01 m2 s to large values about 0 15 m2 s elbing et al 2008 used wall skin friction sensors at 6 different positions downstream of the injection point and their drag reduction were reported for different air fluxes and different water speeds ranging from 6 7 to 18 m s elbing et al 2013 added ldv pitot tube and time of flight tof sensors to find the velocity and void fraction distributions elbing et al 2008 and elbing et al 2013 showed that minor drag reduction less than 30 can be achieved with relatively low air flux increasing the air flux raise the drag reduction percentage almost linearly to values more than 80 which they choose as the air layer development threshold they interpreted the results of the skin friction sensors such that there is a bubble drag reduction regime for low air fluxes and then for higher air flux a transitional air layer would occur where the bubbles are large and air patches are formed in the wall adjacency but the water stream remains in contact with some parts of the wall surface at last for a specific air flux which depends on flow conditions such as water free stream velocity surface roughness and upstream perturbations the air layer would be completely developed and the drag reduction would be more than 80 at the whole wall surface they call this air flux as the critical air flux elbing et al 2013 repeated the experimental test of elbing et al 2008 for free stream velocity of 6 3 m s in this new test the air was injected just downstream of a backward step although the existence of the backstep is claimed to reduce the sensitivity of the air layer to upstream perturbations by elbing et al 2008 jang et al 2014 showed that implementation of side guards are necessary to prevent side air leakages when using injection behind a backstep elbing et al 2013 investigated the effect of upstream perturbations by inserting vortex generators at different angles of attack and showed that the drag reduction does not depend on vortex generators angle of attack significantly when air is injected behind a backstep there are also some numerical simulations of the aldr flow wang yang and stern 2010 used a urans turbulence model spallart almaras model and tried to simulate the elbing et al 2008 s experimental test numerically they found that for very low air fluxes about 0 007 m2 s there is only a minor drag reduction ratio lower than 10 but at 0 007 m2 s air flux a jump in drag reduction is predicted and for air fluxes higher than this value the drag reduction ratio is about 100 this jump in drag reduction is not the case in the experimental results of neither elbing et al 2008 nor other researchers also the critical air flux predicted by wang et al 2010 is about 0 007 m2 s in 6 7 m s water free stream velocity where the experimental results show a value of about 0 04 m2 s in another numerical simulation kim and moin 2010 chose a small numerical domain with the length of about 40 cm and two phase direct numerical simulation of air injection behind a backward facing step was carried out injection of air behind a back step was previously investigated by elbing et al 2008 and it was expressed that the insertion of a back step just upstream of injection point would reduce the air layer sensitivity to upstream perturbations this problem is also studied by elbing et al 2013 and jang et al 2014 afterwards the dns results of kim and moin 2010 were qualitatively compared to experimental results as there were no similar experimental case with the simulated geometry and dimensions kim and moin 2010 showed that a low air flux injection cannot result in a stable and continuous air layer but at high air flux a continuous air layer on the wall would totally prevail although this is qualitatively in agreement with elbing et al 2008 results an important difference can be seen in the dns results fig 6 of kim and moin 2010 paper in comparison with elbing et al 2008 claims the dns results show that when the air flux is not sufficiently high an air layer would be formed near the injection point but there are some growing perturbations that finally cause disintegration of the air layer both the free surface shape and wall skin friction plot show that the air layer exists at near injection region for low air flux this is not in agreement with elbing et al 2008 and elbing et al 2013 statements they stated that for air fluxes lower than the critical value the air layer could not be developed and only bubbles and air patches would be present in another numerical study of aldr montazeri and alishahi 2019 investigated different urans turbulence models and showed that the most physical results among the investigated models would be produced by the well known sst model they showed that this model predicts the overall attribute but the predicted flow is more stable and continuous air layer is present even at lower air fluxes than what was reported in experimental test of elbing et al 2008 this was previously reported by wang et al 2010 paper using spallart almaras model they showed that the simulation weakness is due to incorrect stability prediction in urans simulations with the addition of proper perturbation to the inlet boundary condition comparable results with experimental tests involving minor errors would be obtained they performed many cfd simulations with different perturbation frequencies and found that there is a frequency which leads to the most unstable flow this most unstable flow results in drag reduction similar to the experimental results reported by elbing et al 2008 they also introduced a solution procedure which uses linear stability analysis to find the proper perturbation frequency and showed that the most unstable frequency extracted from this linear stability analysis is in fair agreement with the most unstable case predicted by cfd simulations with different perturbation frequencies two cfd simulations with proper urans model plus one linear stability analysis comprising in their method require much less computer resources and time if compared with dns solutions and hence it is suitable for practical applications it would be a valuable tool for studying the physical aspects of the flow field and specifically determining the outcome of various parameters adjustment involved in this problem montazeri and alishahi 2019 validated this procedure mainly by comparing the numerically predicted drag reduction values with those of experimental results in this paper the same numerical procedure is used to investigate the physical phenomena of aldr flow in more depth also the sensitivity of the air layer to surface bumps is studied to find the robustness and stability of air layer encountering construction faults and appendices then the effects of some parameters is studied to find out if the efficiency of aldr can be enhanced in practical situations 2 hybrid numerical method montazeri and alishahi 2019 proposed a four step numerical procedure for simulation of aldr with an acceptable numerical cost and accuracy these four steps are 1 a simple 2 dimensional cfd simulation with appropriate two phase model urans turbulence model and other numerical methods should be carried out then some quantities such as air layer thickness and velocity distribution of flow in boundary layers should be extracted from cfd results 2 a curve fit must be applied on the velocity distribution of cfd results with proper and preferably physical template as introduced by montazeri and alishahi 2019 3 using the ensued velocity distribution from the 2nd step as the base velocity a two phase linear stability analysis with appropriate boundary conditions should be performed the most unstable frequency from different modes of the flow should be extracted usually the internal mode is dominant when both internal and interfacial modes are present 4 the cfd simulation in the 1st step should be repeated with the addition of a harmonic perturbation with frequency of the unstable mode obtained in the 3rd step as the first step a simple 2 dimensional cfd simulation is carried out by commercial software ansys fluent at two free stream velocities of 6 7 and 11 1 m s each with different air fluxes the geometry and flow conditions are the same as elbing et al 2008 s tests water flows on a 13 m long flat plate and air is injected at 1 38 m location downstream of the flat plate leading edge this step is implemented exactly in the same way as montazeri and alishahi 2019 s investigation and hence full descriptions of the grid independence study turbulence model selection and other numerical aspects are omitted for the sake of briefness in this paper as they mentioned simple simulations with common turbulence models does not produce appropriate results and among different investigated urans models sst model is the only one that correctly predicts the overall behavior of the flow and the relevant physical phenomena as revealed in experimental tests however simulations using sst model result in an air layer with more stability and longer continuous air layer than experimental results fig 1 shows the air layer thickness for these simulations there is no additional perturbations in these simulations other than the inevitable numerical discretization error in this figure nominal air layer thickness ta is used instead of air flux to make two figures with different free stream velocities comparable nominal air layer thickness ta is a simple parameter that represents the ratio of 2d air flux to free stream velocity qa u this parameter has been used by other researchers including elbing et al 2008 and jang et al 2014 as it can be seen minor perturbations happen in air layer but they are not strong enough to disintegrate the air layer except for the lowest nominal air layer thickness in both free stream velocities the disintegration occurs in the lowest nominal thickness for both free stream velocities at locations of about 5 5 7 m downstream the flat plate leading edge which is not in agreement with experimental data jumps of the air layer interface position downstream of the disintegration point are due to the generation of bubbles and patches of air adjacent to and detached from the wall pay attention to the scales of plot axes which make bubbles shapes similar to high frequency noises the nominal thickness of air layer is not the same for simulated cases in these two free stream velocities but two plots in this figure show qualitatively similar behavior although the magnitude of free stream velocities are quite different fig 2 shows the time averaged shape of air layer for these cases it can be seen that the averaged shape of the air layer for cases with close nominal air layer thickness coincide with each other within acceptable error margin it also shows that the shape of the air layer in similar flows depends on nominal air layer thickness and hence the air layer thickness is proportional to the air flux and the inverse of free stream water velocity a close approximation of the required base flow data for the third step in the hybrid numerical algorithm i e the stability analysis can be obtained using these stable air layer flow simulations of the first step thus the air layer thickness and velocity distribution should be extracted from simulations of this step the second step of the procedure is the curve fitting equation 1 is the curve fit template that montazeri and alishahi 2019 used they compared the results of linear stability using this velocity distribution with those of linear velocity distribution which is more common in literature and showed that the correct estimation of base velocity distribution is very important as the stability spectrum using these two conditions is very different in this equation u m is a mean velocity of air layer flow u 0 is the interface velocity x is the downstream position y is the distance from wall and d is the air layer thickness j subscript indicates the air layer properties and e subscript indicates the water stream ones c 1 to c 4 are constant coefficients that must be tuned for a good fit 1 u j e t u m erf d y a 1 erf d a 1 u 0 u m 1 erf y a 2 erf d a 2 u e

the air layer velocity distribution u jet is a combination of two boundary layer profiles similar to stokes first problem solution this type of velocity distribution was used by soderberg 2003 and later montazeri and alishahi 2019 showed that adding a constant coefficient to the formula can also represent an accurate boundary layer profile for flat plate in compliance with the well known blasius velocity profile the water stream velocity distribution u env consists of two parts but only one of them is the stokes like profile the other part in u env is an exponential decay term corresponding to the effect of air water interface imposed on the previously developed boundary layer on wall surface upstream of the injection region montazeri and alishahi 2019 used simple exponential decay because the air water interface has just a minor effect on velocity distribution and it was supposed that an exponential decay term can lead to accurate enough results although the exponential decay term succeeded in accurate curve fit in this paper the water stream velocity distribution is modified to have a more physical shape by changing this exponential term to error function term similar to the other parts of the velocity distribution the effect of this modification on the analysis result is shown in the following the new modified velocity distribution is given

with its appropriate downstream position x in this version of equation a set of new parameters u b y p has been introduced the pre injection boundary layer is assumed to shift up in y direction by a value of y p at locations downstream of injection point u b is the velocity of water flow inside the boundary layer due to flat plate wall in no injection condition at location of x y p x inj is the length of flat plate prior to the injection point in previous version of the equation used by montazeri and alishahi 2019 equation 1 the equality of shear stress at the interface sides determined u p but in this new version this equality fixes y p instead in this modified version of the template the first term in u env is the boundary layer of the flat plate in no injection condition in this term the x inj is added to x to represent the effect of pre injection boundary layer growth also the y coordinate is shifted by y p which means that the pre injection boundary layer shifts by y p in y direction in post injection locations the amount of this shift y p is determined by the condition of shear stress equality at the interface sides the second term of u env is the effect of air water interface which also assumed to grow similar to stokes profile as the first term results a velocity at interface the second term uses u 0 u b as its governing velocity to have the correct interface velocity at y 0 using the new modified template and tuning the constant coefficients the best curve fit on cfd results was obtained fig 3 shows this fitting of the results for three air fluxes in free stream velocity of 11 1 m s as can be seen the fitted curve matches well on cfd results points as the previous template was also shown to match the cfd data by montazeri and alishahi 2019 it seems that this modification does not provide any sensible improvement however the main difference of these two versions is in the shape of boundary layer of air water interface in water stream and the new modified version is expected to be more physical than the previous exponential decay form as it applies a form of stokes problem solution a physical solution but the previous version used a simple exponential form just a mathematical fit with no physical background as mentioned before both versions of velocity distribution templates compromise a proper curve fit and many other functions can also be fitted on velocity distribution data from cfd results with good accuracy also introducing a complex velocity distribution to have an accurate curve fit may be questionable the key point is that the first and second derivative of the velocity distribution are present in eigen system matrix equations and play important roles in the stability analysis the presence of these derivatives can be seen in orr sommerfeld equation equation 3 and its boundary conditions equation 4 at air water interface location in these equations u is the base velocity and j and e subscripts mean values corresponding to air jet and water stream environment sides of interface ψ and φ are perturbation stream functions of air and water stream respectively k and c are non dimensional wave number and wave speed m is the water to air viscosity ratio and re and fr are reynolds and froude numbers based on air properties and air layer thickness reference length 3 ψ k 2 ψ u c ψ u i ν k ν j r e k 4 ψ 2 k 2 ψ

these equations are solved numerically using the chebyshev polynomials values of velocity derivatives are derived by direct differentiation of the fitted velocity curve since in a normal curve fit process one only tries to lower the difference between values of the curve fit and the velocity data points not paying attention to the velocity derivatives the usual curve fit of the base velocity would not provide reliable stability analysis results one of the proper methods if do not call it the best to provide correct velocity and its derivatives information simultaneously is to use a function that represents the physical aspects of the flow in this manner the derivatives accuracy only depends on fitting accuracy of the velocity data as the derivative information is previously contained in the velocity template to clarify the difference of these two versions of velocity distributions first and second derivatives of the fitted curve using both versions of template is compared in fig 4 as can be seen although the curve of velocity distribution using two versions are not sensibly different shapes of the derivatives are completely different as the shear stress equality is solved for both versions the first derivative of velocity at origin is identical for two distributions but there is one additional maxima in the new version derivative the origin is put on the interface as was shown by montazeri and alishahi 2019 as these derivatives are present in the governing differential equation and its boundary conditions they are crucially important in finding correct stability spectrum it is noteworthy that why this point has not received enough attention from previous researchers that might be due to simple boundary conditions that they employed straightforward velocity distribution uniform or linear velocity profile for their specific stability analysis the 3rd step in the above solution procedure is the linear stability analysis two phase orr sommerfeld equation was solved numerically using sufficient number of chebyshev polynomials boundary conditions of perturbations was set at flat plate wall free stream virtual wall and instantaneous air water interface location this analysis was carried out just similar to montazeri and alishahi 2019 except the modification in the template formulation of base velocity distribution as explained above fig 5 shows results of linear stability analysis using both versions of the template formulation previous version at left and new modified version at middle this figure shows that the most unstable frequency for different air fluxes are changed in the new analysis version also the magnitude of growth rate is changed to a large extent it is noteworthy to mention that all of these differences are due to the minor change in formulation of velocity distribution with no significant change in curve fit accuracy fig 5 also shows cfd results of montazeri and alishahi 2019 as mentioned before they performed many cfd simulations with different perturbation frequencies different instabilities with different power and tendency of the air layer toward disintegration were found almost in all cases they used continuous air layer length as the variable that reveals these different flow conditions and tendencies stability analysis results and cfd ones in fig 5 can be compared by comparing the most unstable frequencies the agreement of the present linear stability analysis with montazeri and alishahi 2019 s cfd simulations are better than the previous linear analysis this can be seen specifically for 0 06 m2 s air flux where the cfd simulations show that the flow experiences its most unstable state when it is perturbed at 200 rad s frequency and the linear stability analysis using the new velocity distribution predicts 240 rad s as the most unstable frequency while the old velocity distribution forecast was 340 rad s this improvement again shows the fact that the base velocity should be set as accurate as possible by correct modelling of base flow field physics the last step in the numerical simulation procedure is to repeat the first step cfd simulations with the addition of harmonic perturbation in boundary condition with the frequency of the most unstable mode of flow extracted from linear stability analysis the perturbation is added to the inlet boundary condition of air as a fluctuation of velocity about its mean value the air layer shape predicted in these simulations are plotted in fig 6 the air layer is completely different from what was shown in fig 1 due to the mentioned perturbations added in the air injection boundary condition the effect of the fluctuation amplitude was also investigated by comparing 1 3 5 and 10 values the conclusion is that there is no significant difference between these perturbation results this implies that the fluctuations in air layer interface is mainly related to the flow instabilities and not to the magnitude of forced perturbations at the inlet boundary the added velocity fluctuation at the boundary only triggers the unstable growth thus the cfd simulations were carried out with 3 perturbation of air velocity about its mean value in practice a perturbation with 3 fluctuation amplitude seems to be physical due to the compressor and other mechanical and environmental vibrations and noises as is shown in fig 6 the predicted unstable flow shows very large fluctuations compared to this initial amplitude which confirms that the fluctuation is due to the instability of the flow rather than an initial forced perturbation 3 results and discussion 3 1 investigation of aldr flow field drag reduction results of the hybrid numerical simulations at a sensor point located at 6 m downstream of the injection point are plotted in fig 7 alongside the experimental results from elbing et al 2008 results of the mentioned procedure shows acceptable accuracy in comparison with experimental data pay attention to the difference between the first simple numerical simulations with no additional perturbation and forth step results where the first step simulations with no additional perturbation predict 100 drag reduction even for low air fluxes but the addition of the perturbations step 4 brings the results to an acceptable range from the experiment another test case is also studied here with the injection of air behind a backstep elbing et al 2013 s test case geometry and conditions elbing et al 2013 reported the average of three drag reduction ratio measured by three skin friction sensors located at three different downstream locations similar results were extracted from numerical simulations and are plotted in fig 8 the error of the drag reduction ratio predicted by the numerical simulations is in quite satisfactory range from experiment elbing et al 2013 also reported velocity and void fraction distributions these data were reported as the average of three sensors output at three different positions distributed along the total flat plate length for different vortex generator configurations including the case of no vortex generators similar results were extracted from numerical simulations without any vortex generators and are plotted in fig 9 as the computed flow field contains different time dependent fluctuations the numerical data are presented as time averaged values in a relatively large time period of about 3 s in this figure the experimental data of void fraction are plotted for two different air fluxes elbing et al 2013 stated that the drag reduction for these two air fluxes are above 80 and accordingly the air layer development should be complete in these cases fig 9 shows the velocity distribution of both experimental and numerical results elbing et al 2013 measured velocity of the water flow using ldv in regions of almost no void fraction velocity distribution in regions of higher void fraction where both air and water phases are present was measured by time of flight sensor the time of flight sensor measures the velocity of two phase flow using its phase interface velocity but it does not provide any data when only one phase is present thus as elbing et al 2013 also stated the measurements of velocity in regions with high void fraction is not as accurate as other regions therefore the anomaly in experimental void fraction close to the wall is somehow expectable as fig 9 shows the numerical water velocity distribution is in complete agreement with experiment but the two phase velocity distributions are different to some extent elbing et al 2013 proposed a three layer velocity distribution in aldr the first part adjacent to the wall filled mainly with air and a constant velocity about 20 of free stream velocity the third part in water only region with velocity distribution very similar to no injection boundary layer distribution and a buffer layer second part between these two parts with almost linear velocity variations however there is a shortcoming with this proposal as it doesn t account for the value of air flux it is noticeable that the elbing et al 2013 proposal is stated only for air fluxes that result in complete air layer development on the other hand the numerical velocity distribution can be described as it consists of only two parts one is the outer region where the velocity distribution is very similar to no injection boundary layer just like the experimental data acquired by ldv measurements and the other is the inner region where the air layer is qualitatively similar to an unsteady couette flow velocity profile in starting times of flow the velocity distribution in this inner part consists of two boundary layers on the wall surface and air water interface and may gradually change toward a fully developed profile if the air layer remains stable and persists without significant change in thickness later in this section in fig 10 variation of velocity distribution at different downstream positions is presented and discussed although the location of void fraction rise in numerical and experimental results are close as shown in fig 9 there are two main differences in these results one is a minor void fraction rise up to 20 in both experimental data while it is not present in the numerical output the other difference is a drop in experimental void fraction at wall adjacency especially for air flux of 0 053 m2 s the first difference may be due to some small free bubbles above the air layer in experimental test and seems not to be so important the drop in void fraction at wall adjacency in experimental data is not in agreement with the physics of a continuous full air layer the existence of an air layer by itself implies a continuous stratified air layer adjacent to the wall and consequently a void fraction of unity at the wall this strange behavior in fig 9 can be seen mainly in the lower air flux and the data for the higher air flux are more reasonable it is noteworthy that according to elbing et al 2013 the error in void fraction measurement is up to 15 in regions of high void fraction namely inside the air layer note that both air fluxes result in high drag reductions in the experiments and expressed as developed air layer by elbing et al 2013 to get a better insight of the flow field these velocity and void fraction distributions are shown in fig 10 at each position separately not the average of three positions for three different air fluxes these data are also the time averaged numerical results in this figure the horizontal axis is the normal distance to the wall scaled by nominal air layer thickness instead of no injection boundary layer thickness as can be seen in the top row of fig 10 the void fraction is unity close to the wall and at the first station closest to the injection point for all three air fluxes this shows the existence of an air layer even for low air fluxes in the vicinity of the injection point at this station a relatively sharp interface between air and water can be inferred from large slope of void fraction distribution at the second station i e the middle row it seems that the air layer thickness is decreased and the interface of air water is not as sharp as the first station in other words the air layer bears some time fluctuations and the air water interface moves up and down resulting in a void fraction value between 0 and 1 from the time averaging process and hence a decrease in void fraction slope would be seen also this figure shows that there is almost no air layer in second position for the lowest air flux ta 3 6 mm i e the air layer is ruptured as the void fraction is not unity at the wall further downstream at the third station the air layer is also ruptured for medium and high air fluxes ta 5 4 and 6 3 mm as can be seen in this figure when the air layer disintegrates and the void fraction drops from unity to a lower value at the wall there is a maximum in void fraction distribution near the wall but not at the wall in all cases in other words when the air layer disintegrates into bubbles and air patches they start to move away from the wall surface and flow mostly along a stream parallel to the wall but in a distance away from it this is in agreement with the finding of some previous researchers including kodama et al 2000 and merkle et al 1990 they stated that air bubbles tend to escape from the wall surface in a boundary layer flow this is also consistent with the earlier mentioned drop in void fraction at the wall in elbing et al 2013 measurements for the lower air flux in fig 9 they stated that at this air flux a continuous air layer would prevail throughout the flat plate and high drag reduction ratio is resulted in contrast to their reasoning if the present numerical results are accepted the void fraction drop in elbing et al 2013 s test data for 0 053 m2 s air flux should be due to a degenerated air layer and we are faced with a ruptured air layer instead of continuous one in fig 8 the measured drag reduction ratio for the cases of qa 0 06 and 0 08 m2 s ta 0 01 and 0 013 m is more than 80 and probably these high drag reduction ratios suggested the existence of continuous air layer in elbing et al 2008 and elbing et al 2013 however the present numerical simulations show that despite of the air layer rupture void fraction at the wall remains high and consequently the drag reduction ratio is also high it is important to note that for a wide range of air fluxes the existence of air layer with different continuous length does not have any conflict with raw experimental measurements in contrast to some researchers misinterpretation of their measurement high values of drag reduction without a continuous air layer is also reported in an experimental test on flat plate by park et al 2015 they used pulsatile injection instead of continuous steady injection of air and hence resulted in discontinuous air layer repetitive injection of air leads to transitional aldr which can be assumed to be similar to the ruptured air layer as both contain large bubbles and air patches with high void fraction near the wall in their experiment they showed that this type of flow brings about high drag reduction ratios similar to continuous air layer their finding confirms that high drag reduction values can be achieved even when there is no continuous air layer there is also another point in fig 10 void fraction plots it can be seen that the air layer has an initial thickness thickness of regions with more than 50 void fraction and this thickness decreases downstream the air layer disintegrates at a position which is different for different air fluxes to further investigate the disintegration point of the air layer the time averaged air layer thickness is plotted in fig 11 for different nominal air layer thicknesses the ordinate in this figure is the normalized air layer interface position which is the ratio of actual time averaged interface position to its nominal thickness the figure represents results for different air fluxes for both elbing et al 2008 and elbing et al 2013 test cases without and with backstep implementation upstream of the injection point air layer thickness in cases containing the backstep starts from the step height and gradually decreases downstream note that the step height is the same in different cases but the air flux changes and hence the normalized step height is different for different cases in cases without the backstep air layer starts from zero thickness and a growth in thickness near injection location can be seen which is due to the injection angle and air water stream momentum balance following this increase in air layer thickness the air layer continues downstream with a gradual reduction in thickness the air layer fluctuates before disintegration point but as the fluctuation is nearly symmetric the time averaged air layer thickness does not change significantly due to these fluctuations for all cases that are plotted in this figure including cases with and without backstep the air layer thickness jumps to a lower value at some specific point which is the disintegration point of air layer when the air layer disintegrates into bubbles and air patches they flow inside the boundary layer and often touch the wall surface these touches make the time averaged air layer thickness to have a non zero value even when there is no actual continuous air layer after the disintegration point there are many bubbles and air patches which many of them do not touch the wall and so they have no effect in time averaged air layer thickness hence at the disintegration point the averaged thickness should suddenly drop to a small value which can be seen for almost all cases however in fig 11 it can be seen that higher air fluxes result in smoother change of air layer thickness at disintegration point which may be due to higher void fraction in ruptured air layer region and many contacts of bubbles and wall surface in that region in fig 11 there is a remarkable topic the horizontal thick light grey line shows normalized interface position of 1 which means that the actual time averaged thickness of air layer is equal to its nominal value almost all of studied cases show a change in their interface position slope at this line hence the point of disintegration for these different cases have interestingly almost identical normalized air layer thickness equal to unity this means that the air layer thickness is equal to its nominal thickness at the disintegration point in other words the air layer thickness decreases gradually from an initial value and when the time averaged thickness reaches its nominal thickness qa u the air layer disintegrates suddenly this phenomenon can be seen in all cases including cases with backstep and cases without backstep fig 11 brings about the hint that the air layer seems to disintegrate at a point where the air layer thickness equals its nominal value this may suggest the simplification of numerical procedure using the air layer thickness result from simple non perturbed simulation to find the disintegration point without accomplishing the forth step cfd simulation fig 1 shows the air layer thickness for non perturbed simulation first step while fig 11 shows the time averaged of air layer thickness for perturbed simulation forth step as the added perturbations are harmonic and symmetric the time average of perturbed flow may be expected to be similar to the non perturbed flow at least before the disintegration paying more attention reveals that the gradual thinning of the air layer in fig 11 is different from what can be seen in fig 1 the addition of perturbation in inflow velocity boundary condition seems to change the averaged air layer shape although the perturbation is harmonic and symmetric maybe due to nonlinearities of the flow this shows that the numerical simulation of the flow without the additional perturbations does not predict even the averaged air layer thickness before disintegration and performing the perturbed simulation is essential fig 11 can also be used to investigate the effect of backstep implementation on the performance of aldr although the nominal air layer thicknesses are not exactly identical for two cases of with and without backstep it can be seen that for cases with almost the same nominal thickness the existence of the backstep causes a fixed initial air layer thickness and the air layer thickness decreases gradually toward the thickness of no backstep case the rupture of air layer in both cases are almost at the same position except for low nominal thickness case this means that the existence of the backstep cannot postpone the disintegration point of the air layer to have a higher performance this is in agreement with the experimental data of elbing et al 2008 and elbing et al 2013 as explained in the following from another point of view as can be seen in fig 12 the drag reduction ratios reported by elbing et al 2008 without implementation of backstep at free stream velocity of 6 7 m s is almost the same as the data reported by elbing et al 2013 using backstep at free stream velocity of 6 3 m s this shows that the backstep cannot increase the drag reduction performance of aldr although it may lower the sensitivity of air layer to upstream perturbations the disintegration point for low air fluxes is relatively near the injection point in no backstep cases and the step height is much larger than the air layer thickness in identical case using backstep present numerical simulations show that large initial thickness due to the backstep in these cases may send the disintegration point further downstream as can be seen for nominal thickness of 3 mm in fig 11 this is favorable if low air flux is used more than one point of injection may be chosen in this situation to accomplish the air layer on the whole hull surface although it is not so advantageous as it increases the no injection drag and the overall air flux may also be high 3 2 aldr sensitivity investigation as mentioned earlier aldr is capable of hydrodynamic frictional drag reduction to a great extent in the previous section it was shown that a continuous and stable air layer may cancel out the frictional drag by almost 100 although high drag reductions are also present in cases of ruptured air layers for relatively high air fluxes it is more favorable to maintain a continuous air layer instead of a ruptured layer which includes bubbles and air patches ruptured air layer may gradually loose the tendency of high drag reduction when bubbles move away from the wall surface and void fraction in boundary layer decreases thus any disintegration of air layer should be assumed as non favorable one of the noticeable impacts that an air layer may encounter is the existence of wall surface bumps during the construction of a ship s hull there would be many bumps on the surface due to manufacturing errors and tolerances if the air layer is so sensitive to these bumps disintegration of the layer may occur which might construct the most important weakness of the aldr when applied practically thus the air layer sensitivity to bumps on the flat plate surface is studied in this section referring to fig 11 it seems that the nominal air layer thickness would be the critical value for time averaged air layer thickness such that the disintegration of air layer would occur if its time averaged thickness reaches this critical value hence bump heights more than nominal air layer thickness would be unacceptable for lower bumps on the wall surface the velocity distribution of the air layer may change new velocity distribution might increase or decrease the air layer thickness depending on the shape of the new distribution this means that the change in velocity distribution and whether to increase or decrease the air layer thickness may have a stabilizing or destabilizing effect on the flow as the first case of this study circular curves with the length of 0 6 m were placed on the wall surface the numerical simulation was carried out at 11 1 m s free stream velocity and 0 04 m2 s air flux two bumps were inserted on the wall one at 1 5 m and the other at 3 m downstream of the injection point results for this flow without any bumps showed that the air layer degenerates at about 1 8 m downstream of the injection point destabilizing or stabilizing effect of bumps may cause the air layer to disintegrate before destabilizing effect or after the first bump or even the air layer may survive to the second bump location stabilizing effect as the nominal air layer thickness is about 3 6 mm for the studied case three sizes of bumps were investigated with heights of 1 2 and 3 mm instantaneous and time averaged results of the simulation are shown in fig 13 and indicate a different conduct than what is expected the air layer thickness change is insensible at bumps location and also the fluctuations in air layer do not increase or decrease due to bumps it shows that this type of smooth bumps does not have any favorable or unfavorable stabilizing or destabilizing effects on the air layer another configuration of bumps is also studied in this investigation a triangular section was considered with a small slope in upstream direction and a backward facing step downstream fig 14 similar to the smooth bumps three sizes of 1 2 and 3 mm height and 0 6 m length of the triangular bumps were studied and they were placed at the same positions of previous bumps to check if the position of the protrusions changes their effect the triangular bumps with 1 mm height were also placed at new position of 0 9 and 2 4 m downstream of injection point in another simulation it might be expected that the triangular bumps initiate a separated flow at their backstep base and thus the air layer thickness increases the instantaneous and averaged air water interface location is plotted in fig 14 for these four configurations as can be seen again the triangles do not have any noticeable effect on air layer similar to smooth bumps 3 3 enhancement of aldr performance performance of drag reduction methods based on air injection can be evaluated via gain factor ratio of overall drag reduction to the required air flux any increase in drag reduction or lowering the required air flux improves the efficiency of the process regarding this some parameters are changed to check whether the performance of aldr can be enhanced one of the parameters that might play a role in the instabilities of this flow the kelvin helmholtz instability is the surface tension of water in standard conditions the surface tension coefficient σ of water air interface is about 0 07 n m but it can be changed by addition of some soluble liquids into the water injection of surfactant into the water flow is shown to change the surface tension coefficient by researchers e g elbing et al 2008 elbing et al 2008 injected triton x 100 into water stream and their measurements showed that the surface tension coefficient was reduced from 0 07 to 0 05 n m they investigated the effect of this change on bubble drag reduction bdr they showed that the change in bubble drag reduction and bubble size due to the change in surface tension is not significant they also measured the critical air flux for both normal water and water with additional surfactant their result shows just a minor difference between these two conditions if this minor difference is assumed not to be the measurement error the lower surface tension is showed to result in higher critical air flux by elbing et al 2008 in the present study the effect of surface tension is studied for aldr numerical simulation of the aldr flow field for 0 04 m2 s air flux and 11 1 m s free stream velocity was reproduced with surface tension coefficients of 0 05 and 0 1 n m surface tension coefficient is present in linear stability analysis in the phase interface boundary condition i e the last boundary condition in equation 4 on the other hand surface tension is considered in numerical simulations as a force proportional to its coefficient and phase interface surface curvature in momentum equation for cells which contain the interface fig 15 shows the results of these two cases alongside the original simulation with surface tension coefficient of 0 07 n m as can be seen the change in surface tension does not produce any visible enhancement in air layer in order to make the air layer more stable or to increase its continuous length without any rupture the air layer thickness should be increased if the air layer thickness increases in any other means the disintegration point might be pushed back downstream the air layer thickness can be raised by increasing the air flux but it is not desired as the efficiency of the aldr decreases the other way to expand the air layer is to change the air velocity distribution bounded by mass conservation of air this change in velocity distribution may be brought up by a change in wall shear rate probably due to non smoothness velocity distribution of water in contact with the wall can produce an effect on the interface velocity distribution and even on the air layer velocity distribution all of the previous cfd simulations in this paper were carried out assuming smooth surface condition non favorable effect of increasing the surface roughness on aldr is reported by elbing et al 2008 as the required air flux to establish the air layer increases thus the hydrophobicity of the wall surface is investigated in this study as it might be expected that the hydrophobicity has an opposite effect comparing with the wall roughness a hydrophobic surface is a surface with a material that repels water molecules having such a material the hydrophobicity of a surface can be enhanced by the use of micro nano roughness numerical modelling of flow on hydrophobic surface is usually done in two steps first a very small numerical domain with the specific roughness on the wall is simulated using dns or at least les methods then an equivalent navier slip length is estimated from such a simulation vast range of slip lengths is reported in experimental and numerical researches from very small values some nanometers for simpler hydrophobic surfaces to large values up to 0 4 mm for ultrahydrophobic surfaces with hierarchial wall roughness structures lee and kim 2009 slip lengths of some tens of micrometers is more common in literature as large and yet practical values song daniello and rothstein 2014 reported 0 02 mm and li et al 2009 reported 0 04 mm slip length in their measurements larger slip lengths are also reported in academic researches i e 0 1 mm by lee and kim 2011 0 05 0 25 mm by maali and bhushan 2012 and 0 4 mm by lee and choi 2008 production of ultrahydrophobic surfaces with such a large slip length in practical applications has not been accomplished yet but perhaps it would be achieved in the future nowadays superhydrophobic surfaces with slip lengths of tens of micrometers are constructed and used in practice in this paper a navier slip length value is used and it is assumed that a surface with some specific material and roughness structure and size can be constructed to have such a navier slip length value the navier slip length in aldr solution was implemented by setting up a slip velocity at the wall surface this slip velocity was set to zero for cells with void fractions greater than 0 5 assumed to be air filled cells that is usual no slip condition on the other hand cells with void fractions less than 0 5 are assumed to be water filled and the hydrophobicity effect should be set in these cells the slip velocity was set equal to τ w l μ where τ w is the wall shear stress and l is the slip length as the wall shear stress depends on wall slip velocity enough iterations should be performed at each time step to ensure convergence of wall shear stress and slip velocity some slip lengths ranging from 0 02 mm to 2 mm were considered and aldr flow was simulated for 11 1 m s water free stream velocity and 0 04 m2 s air flux fig 16 shows the length of continuous air layer in these cases with different navier slip lengths also fig 17 shows the air layer shape for three cases among these the hydrophobicity of the wall makes the air layer more stable and the continuous air layer length is increased from 1 6 m to about 3 5 m in cases with larger slip lengths but it does not provide major enhancement in cases with small slip lengths as can be seen in fig 16 in the studied flow conditions 0 4 mm is the critical slip length and air layer enhancement is evident for larger slip lengths while minor improvements can be seen for smaller values as mentioned before achieving the slip lengths larger than this critical value is not straightforward yet but it seems not to be impossible this critical slip length could be different for other flow conditions water stream velocity and air flux the next test case was carried out only for 1 mm slip length this test case with 0 06 m2 s air flux was chosen to ensure if such an improvement exists for other conditions fig 18 shows the result of this case and similar improvement can be seen for 0 06 m2 s air flux case in this combined application of air layer method and hydrophobic wall surface if the air layer develops and continues to the end of flat plate or practically hull wall surface almost no water wall contact would be present in such cases the hydrophobicity of wall would have no positive effect as the wall does not have any contact with water thus the hydrophobicity should affect the flow at regions with no air layer i e regions prior to the injection point thus the difference of water boundary layer velocity distribution at injection point between the normal case and hydrophobic surface might be the origin of the stabilizing effect if there is such an effect to investigate this statement previous simulation is repeated with new boundary conditions two new cases are studied one with a hydrophobic surface at the leading edge of flat plate up to 0 5 m upstream of injection point farfield hydrophobic case and the other case is the nearfield hydrophobic case with a hydrophobic surface just upstream of injection point from 0 5 m upstream of injection point to the point of injection both cases have normal no slip wall condition downstream of injection fig 19 shows the result of these two cases in comparison with the case of totally hydrophobic flat plate as can be seen the farfield hydrophobic case does not show the total hydrophobic wall improvement but the nearfield hydrophobic case shows very similar result to the reference case this shows that the main effect of hydrophobicity comes from a region just upstream of injection point this is an important result as it means that in practice there is no need to construct the hydrophobic coating on the whole ship s hull but only a relatively small region upstream of the injection point is enough to stabilize the air layer for a longer distance 4 conclusions air layer drag reduction is said to be a successful and cost efficient method for hydrodynamic skin friction reduction it was studied experimentally in literature but just a few complete numerical dns or les investigations are available due to huge computational resource requirements montazeri and alishahi 2019 proposed a numerical procedure to provide acceptable numerical predictions of this flow with low computational cost this procedure with minor modification was reapplied to various aldr problems in this study numerical results showed that the air layer develops for almost all air fluxes in any free stream water velocity while the length of continuous air layer changes by conditions of each specific case for low air fluxes in high free stream velocities low nominal air layer thickness the air layer encounters instabilities that grow up and bring about disintegration of air layer numerical simulation of different cases showed that the air layer disintegrates when its time averaged thickness reaches its nominal thickness this phenomenon was seen in almost all simulated cases in this paper however it can be imagined that for large enough nominal air layer thickness the instabilities occur in such long distances downstream that no effect would be observed in practice a drop in void fraction at wall adjacency is reported in experimental results of elbing et al 2013 for aldr cases present numerical simulations show that this means ruptured air layer for large enough nominal air layer thickness this ruptured air layer can still result in high drag reduction ratio which may be misinterpreted as continuous air layer drag reduction for the enhancement of aldr performance different parameters effects were studied it was shown that implementation of backstep just upstream of injection point cannot increase the performance of aldr unless for small nominal thickness relative to the step height changing the surface tension was also non effective covering the wall surface with hydrophobic coating was shown to be a successful option which resulted in a longer continuous air layer minor improvement was shown for small and more common slip lengths while major improvement was seen for large slip lengths which may be realized in future the conclusion is that the main effect of hydrophobicity comes from an upstream region near the injection point this is an important result as it shows that with a small amount of effort and money for implementation of hydrophobic surface on this small area the performance of aldr can be noticeably improved as the construction and maintenance of a hydrophobic surface on small region would be cheap and cost effective this method should be desirable implementation of bumps both in smooth circular and triangular step shapes showed no noticeable effect on the air layer this means that the air layer sensitivity to minor construction errors and tolerances is negligible and no instabilities or rupture of the air layer would occur in practice as a general conclusion the numerical result of this study shows that the aldr seems to be a robust enough method to be used practically and its combination with hydrophobic surface in a relatively small upstream area enhances its performance remarkably author contributions section mohammad hossein montazeri
