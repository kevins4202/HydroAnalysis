16325,metaldehyde is a polar mobile low molecular weight pesticide that is challenging to remove from drinking water with current adsorption based micropollutant treatment technologies alternative strategies to remove this and compounds with similar properties are necessary to ensure an adequate supply of safe and regulation compliant drinking water biological removal of metaldehyde below the 0 1 µg l 1 regulatory concentration was attained in pilot scale slow sand filters ssfs subject to bioaugmentation with metaldehyde degrading bacteria to achieve this a library of degraders was first screened in bench scale assays for removal at micropollutant concentrations in progressively more challenging conditions including a mixed microbial community with multiple carbon sources the best performing strains a calcoaceticus e1 and sphingobium cmet h showed removal rates of 0 0012 µg h 1 107 cells 1 and 0 019 µg h 1 107 cells 1 at this scale these candidates were then used as inocula for bioaugmentation of pilot scale ssfs here removal of metaldehyde by a calcoaceticus e1 was insufficient to achieve compliant water regardless testing increasing cell concentrations quantification of metaldehyde degrading genes indicated that aggregation and inadequate distribution of the inoculum in the filters were the likely causes of this outcome conversely bioaugmentation with sphingobium cmet h enabled sufficient metaldehyde removal to achieve compliance with undetectable levels in treated water for at least 14 d volumetric removal 0 57 µg l 1 h 1 bioaugmentation did not affect the background ssf microbial community and filter function was maintained throughout the trial here it has been shown for the first time that bioaugmentation is an efficient strategy to remove the adsorption resistant pesticide metaldehyde from a real water matrix in upscaled systems swift contaminant removal after inoculum addition and persistent activity are two remarkable attributes of this approach that would allow it to effectively manage peaks in metaldehyde concentrations due to precipitation or increased application in incoming raw water by matching them with high enough degrading populations this study provides an example of how stepwise screening of a diverse collection of degraders can lead to successful bioaugmentation and can be used as a template for other problematic

metaldehyde 1 introduction the european union drinking water directive council directive 98 83 ec dwd defines the maximum concentration for individual and total pesticides in drinking water at 0 1 μg l 1 and 0 5 μg l 1 respectively pesticides such as clopyralid metaldehyde propyzamide carbetamide metazachlor and quinmerac have been identified as pollutants of concern as they are widespread in their application pollute water resources and result in compliance failures in drinking water cooke et al 2020 cosgrove et al 2019 dillon et al 2013 these compounds share characteristics which present challenges to conventional drinking water treatment processes most are highly mobile in soil log koc 2 7 ml g 1 with the exception of propyzamide and they are polar molecules log kow 3 lewis et al 2016 these properties result in micropollutant concentrations entering water sources through leaching or runoff from agricultural sources for instance for metaldehyde studies in the uk have found peak concentrations to be 0 2 0 4 μg l 1 in source waters although greater concentrations of up to 2 7 μg l 1 have been detected kay and grayson 2014 in samples taken from river thames castle et al 2018 identified concentrations of 0 009 4 2 μg l 1 in addition these compounds have a small organic structure and therefore are less likely to be adsorbed using conventional micropollutant treatments such as granular activated carbon gac processes busquets et al 2014 cosgrove et al 2019 stuart et al 2011 for the model pesticide tested here metaldehyde the adsorption to activated carbon is not constant as its conformation and polarity can change due to its chemical structure anet 1974 in addition the efficacy of gac for treating metaldehyde is in the order of a few months thus this strategy remains costly and ineffective for treating this pesticide busquets et al 2014 hall et al 2011 marshall 2013 more sophisticated treatments such as advanced oxidation and uv technologies have been extensively tested however they are carbon intensive require extensive capital expenditure and present treatment associated by products with important implications for human health camm et al 2014 cooke et al 2020 catchment management initiatives in the uk get pelletwise osr herbicides think water and application bans have reduced the number of failures in recent years however these compounds still represent a continued challenge to the supply of pesticide free drinking water chief inspector of drinking water 2018 cooke et al 2020 mohamad ibrahim et al 2019 the voluntary initiative 2021 clearly more efficient and less carbon and energy intensive treatments are required to ensure compliance and protect public health for metaldehyde carbetamide propyzamide and clopyralid biodegradation is the main pathway for their removal from the environment being mineralised by microorganisms and accelerated biodegradation upon repeated exposure has been observed arbeli and fuentes 2007 hole et al 2001 rouchaud et al 2000 schütz et al 1996 simms et al 2006 walker and welch 1991 for metazachlor and quinmerac microbial metabolism occurs hart 1995 wang et al 2018 therefore treatments focusing on biological removal such as slow sand filtration have been proposed as a promising strategy dillon et al 2013 slow sand filters ssfs can be efficient in removing organic micro pollutants through biodegradation and sorption and have been proposed as viable options for high levels of treatment in small drinking water treatment plants at community or household level escolà casas and bester 2015 scheytt et al 2004 previous studies have shown that the uppermost layer of the ssf 0 2 cm known as the schmutzdecke is the most important in terms of active biomass microbial diversity and range of functions especially organic contaminant biodegradation chen et al 2021 haig et al 2016 oh et al 2018 co occurrence of specific taxa and clustering of microbial communities and metabolic functions from samples taken from geographically separated full scale ssfs indicates that their microbial conformation is driven by environmental factors and has been linked to adequate ssf performance chen et al 2021 haig et al 2016 oh et al 2018 only certain operational biofilters have been capable of removing specific recalcitrant polar low molecular weight organic micropollutants other biofilters with similar features and source water characteristics have been unable to degrade these compounds suggesting an important role of the resident microbial populations for undertaking this function rolph et al 2018 the microbial community in ssfs might adapt to degrade specific micropollutants however this usually happens after persistent elevated fluxes of the compound for extended periods of time rolph et al 2019 2020 however the applicability of such an approach requires optimisation to reduce the acclimation period to practical durations so that the enrichment can occur during a closed loop recycle period a strategy such as bioaugmentation decouples this from active operation and enables the potential for continuous operation and is viewed as a more practical solution bioaugmentation involves the addition of microorganisms capable of removing a specific compound to a natural or engineered system this is a valuable strategy for ssfs since the indigenous microbial communities in biologically active reactors seldom contain sufficient abundance of degrading populations capable of mineralising specific micropollutants when occurring in spikes in drinking water sources at the ng l 1 to µg l 1 range benner et al 2013 besides targeting a specific pollutant in the short term this strategy might lead to the establishment of a stable degrading population within the filter samuelsen et al 2017 most bioaugmentation candidate strains and consortia have only been shown to utilize their specific substrate at high concentrations much higher than micropollutant levels in most cases it remains unknown if they can degrade the compound when immersed in an environmental matrix with competing organisms and at very low initial concentrations benner et al 2013 even if microorganisms capable of degrading the compound at low concentrations are added many challenges remain environmental matrices often contain substances that inhibit microbial activity toxins enzyme inhibitors the environment may lack cofactors necessary for enzymatic activity and the added organisms may use different organic compounds rather than the pollutant also the inoculum may be hindered by competition with the indigenous microbial community or subject to predation by protozoa bouchez et al 2000 fuller 2021 goldstein et al 1985 moran et al 1976 finally in sand filters adhesion of the bioaugmentation agent to the sand particles can be important for preventing inoculum wash out allowing for its integration into the biofilm samuelsen et al 2017 all these possible outcomes make the adequate selection testing and monitoring of bioaugmentation candidates essential steps to ensure performance of the required function few studies have coupled bioaugmentation with sand filtration in the past bourne et al 2006 evaluated the removal of the cyanobacterial toxin microcystin at 50 µg l 1 for 15 d in pilot scale ssfs fed with river water in which the strain sphingomonas mj pv was added complete removal of microcystin lr was observed in all sand columns within 6 d including within the uninoculated controls and it was inferred that contamination of the water reservoir which fed these columns by the degrading strain had occurred mcdowall et al 2009 seeded laboratory scale ssf columns with a consortium of bacteria capable of removing the cyanobacterial metabolite geosmin and monitored them for up to 17 d inoculated columns 1 107 total active cells ml 1 reached a maximum of 38 additional removal of the compound in clarified water 0 1 µg l 1 initial concentration versus the controls lack of complete removal was attributed to a low contact time between consortium members and the micropollutant albers et al 2015 bioaugmented pilot scale rapid sand filters with aminobacter sp msh1 a 2 6 dichlorobenzamide degrader aiming to eliminate the pesticide from groundwater at a concentration of 0 2 µg l 1 in this study 75 removal was attained degradation within this filter occurred for less than one month probably due to loss of the inoculated cells during backwashing predation by protozoans or starvation metaldehyde degrading bacteria have recently been isolated for the first time and proven to use the compound as a sole source of carbon thomas et al 2017 since then the diversity of known metaldehyde degraders has been expanded and a shared aerobic degradation pathway has been identified castro gutiérrez et al 2020 however it remains unknown if they are capable of degrading the pesticide at micropollutant concentrations in natural environments the current paper posits that selection of the most efficient metaldehyde degrading strains followed by its use as a bioaugmentation agents in a drinking water biofilm reactor will be effective in delivering metaldehyde compliant water while maintaining filter functionality even when challenged with low pollutant concentrations in real water matrices to test this we aimed to i identify the most suitable bioaugmentation agents from a library of metaldehyde degrading strains through bench scale assays ii evaluate if bioaugmentation of upscaled systems with selected strains is an effective strategy for removing the contaminant from water collected from within an active drinking water treatment works iii monitor the presence of degrading populations to better understand bioaugmentation outcomes and iv determine if the background microbial community of the ssfs remains stable after being subject to bioaugmentation 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents and water characteristics metaldehyde 99 was

experiments first it was necessary to determine if isolated metaldehyde degrading strains could remove the compound at environmentally relevant initial concentrations 2 µg l 1 in pure culture in defined medium with metaldehyde as the only carbon source and at a fixed inoculum level 1 107 cells ml 1 as these strains have been previously shown to degrade the compound at much higher starting concentrations 150 mg l 1 in the exact same medium castro gutiérrez et al 2020 the purpose of this experiment was to indicate if bioavailability is a limiting factor for the removal compound at this low starting concentration side by side comparison of the different strains under identical conditions permitted characterisation of the removal efficiency fig 1 a the strains had varying ability to remove metaldehyde at this low initial concentration sphingobium cmet h showed the fastest removal with 56 removed after 2 min and undetectable amounts of the compound after 15 min two of the acinetobacter strains a calcoaceticus e1 and a bohemicus jmet c were next in terms of removal efficiency c jiangsuensis sno d showed a slower utilization of the compound while negligible removal was observed for a lwoffii smet c and p vancouverensis smet b there was no metaldehyde removal by the control non degrading strain removal at the final time point ranged from none to below the lod even though most except sphingobium cmet h share the same metaldehyde degrading gene cluster and have been shown to degrade it at similar rates at higher concentrations 150 mg l 1 castro gutiérrez et al 2020 downregulation of catabolic enzymes or limited bioavailability are the main factors that can hinder degradation at very low concentrations bosma et al 1996 kundu et al 2019 for recently evolved xenobiotic degradation pathways it is unlikely that an efficient gene expression regulation mechanism has had a chance to emerge so the expression of enzymes involved in these catabolic reactions would be predominantly constitutive sørensen et al 2009 for the model metaldehyde degrading bacteria a calcoaceticus e1 a constitutive nature of the degrading pathway is supported by the observation that the onset of metaldehyde degradation proceeds very rapidly after inoculum addition to a metaldehyde containing aqueous matrix even if the inoculum has been pre grown in nutrient rich media without the contaminant at elevated 150 mg l 1 fuller 2021 or low concentrations 2 0 µg l 1 this study only a slight increase in metaldehyde degrading activity after pre culturing with metaldehyde vs acetate as sole carbon sources was found thomas et al 2017 these observations suggest that in a calcoaceticus e1 the degrading pathway is constitutive though it can be slightly upregulated since horizontal gene transfer is responsible for the dissemination of the shared degrading pathway across these strains castro gutiérrez 2020 the limited degradation rates at these low concentrations for specific strains would likely be due to low bioavailability instead of decreased enzyme expression micropollutant bioavailability can be influenced by factors such as phase distribution and mass transfer as well as associated physiological factors including membrane permeability active uptake systems and excretion of surfactants and enzymes cirja et al 2008 studies researching other micropollutants such as atrazine have applied compound specific isotope fractionation and demonstrated that mass transfer across the cell membrane becomes the rate limiting step below 60 µg l 1 in a chemostat ehrl et al 2019 with complete growth rate control evidenced in a retentostat at circa 12 µg l 1 where substrate is sufficient to maintain viability but not cell growth kundu et al 2019 on the other hand transport of micropollutants can be influenced by membrane transporters for instance whole genome sequencing of glyphosate resistant mutants of bacillus subtilis showed that its incorporation into the cell is mediated by the high affinity glutamate aspartate symporter gltt wicke et al 2019 it is possible that bioavailability limitations of metaldehyde are related to these factors and similar approaches could be used in subsequent studies to determine this the best performing strains a calcoaceticus e1 a bohemicus jmet c and sphingobium cmet h were selected for further validation in batch tests that more closely mimic a ssf environment conditions included the use of non sterile minimally treated water and presence of sand with and without an active microbial biofilm from a schmutzdecke it was posited that these conditions would expose the inocula to different sources of organic compounds inhibitory antimicrobial agents and interactions with other microorganisms in the water and sand metaldehyde removal below regulatory limits 0 1 µg l 1 in a time frame of less than 3 6 h estimated contact time in the sand bed for ssf was desirable since degrading enzyme expression is likely constitutive it was proposed that a moderate increase of the initial inoculum from 1 107 to 4 107 cells ml 1 could effectively and rapidly increase the contact between the degrading enzymes and the pollutant therefore reducing the treatment time needed to ensure good removal performance and compliance metaldehyde removal shown in fig 1b sphingobium cmet h reduced metaldehyde concentrations to levels below the instrument lod in less than 15 min for the clean systems and in less than 30 min for the systems with a biofilm a calcoaceticus reduced concentrations to below the regulatory limit in under 4 h for the systems with a biofilm and under 6 h for the clean systems for a bohemicus this occurred in less than 4 h in the systems with a biofilm however the desired removal level had not been reached in the clean sand system at the end of the assay calculated removal rates for the best strains sphingobium cmet h and a calcoaceticus e1 in the systems with a biofilm were 0 019 µg h 1 107 cells 1 and 0 0012 µg h 1 107 cells 1 the additional carbon sources present here can have a positive or negative effect on contaminant degradation positive effects can result from increased microbial biomass however this is usually the case in longer experiments that allow for more extensive microbial growth negative effects may occur if specific compounds other than the pesticide are present at high enough concentrations that cause catabolite repression kalisky et al 2007 or toxicity should a strain provide evidence of metaldehyde removal under these conditions it would be more likely to be active under continuous flow in a ssf even in this challenging scenario with mixed indigenous microbial communities and multiple substrates in a complex matrix metaldehyde levels were brought below the regulatory limits and even below the lod within a reasonable time frame using a practical inoculum size a calcoaceticus e1 was used first for inoculation of the pilot scale ssf because at the time of the experiments only the genes involved in metaldehyde catabolism for this strain mahx mahy had been identified and characterised castro gutiérrez et al 2020 and primer sets had been validated for tracking them in complex microbial communities castro gutiérrez 2020 sphingobium cmet h was trialled second as at that point no verifiable information was available regarding the genes responsible for the metaldehyde degradation subsequent work identified a gene mahs as responsible for metaldehyde degradation in sphingobium cmet h fuller 2021 3 2 effect of bioaugmentation on metaldehyde removal in a continuous flow through ssf treating real water six pilot scale ssfs 22 8 l total volume each were set up with a continuous flow 1 8 l h 1 of minimally treated water either spiked filters 3 6 or not spiked filters 1 and 2 with metaldehyde at a concentration of 2 0 µg l 1 table 1 and a hrt of 3 5 h no detection of metaldehyde above the lod occurred in the inlet of non spiked filters metaldehyde removal was quantified through time and is shown in fig 2 a 95 metaldehyde removal was required to obtain water below the regulatory limit of 0 1 µg l 1 dotted line in phase 1 of the trial days 1 to 55 metaldehyde removal in the non bioaugmented control ssfs 5 and 6 was very low with negligible removal detected at most time points and with a maximum removal of 12 3 at time 42 8 d in filter 5 and 11 2 at time 51 d in filter 6 in filters 3 and 4 a calcoaceticus e1 was first inoculated at 16 d if the removal rates from the batch assays were directly extrapolated addition of 2 1 107 cells ml 1 water of a calcoaceticus e1 would be needed to remove all metaldehyde from the water column 12 66 µg as well as the additional metaldehyde input from the inlet flow 3 6 µg in a 1 h period however the ssf columns were operated at 18 5 20 0 c vs 30 c in batch assays without shaking and the effect of washout predation and die off would have to be accounted for during extended operation therefore additional cells were added to the reactor such that 9 more cells were used in these experiments a 3 increase was selected for each of the effects of temperature mixing and cell losses the aim was to attain the establishment of a degrading population without having a deleterious impact on the indigenous microbial community of the ssf and hence influence the function of this system e g for turbidity removal this calculation yielded a target cell concentration of 1 9 108 cells ml 1 water nevertheless plate counts after inoculation revealed that an inoculation density of 2 4 107 colony forming units c f u ml 1 was achieved in the filters the cause of this apparent cell loss is discussed later in the paper in the next 12 h after inoculation metaldehyde removal increased to a maximum of 37 3 and 56 1 in filters 3 and 4 however the effect appeared transient and the removal returned to pre inoculation levels at 18 and 20 d respectively at 42 d double the original amount 2 of a calcoaceticus e1 was added to filters 3 and 4 here plate counts for the inoculum revealed that the filters had 4 84 107 c f u ml 1 of strain e1 peaks in removal were observed after 43 d reaching values of 74 6 and 78 1 for filters 3 and 4 metaldehyde elimination returned to pre inoculum levels at 45 and 51 d respectively the removal process therefore lasted for longer than during the first inoculation thus doubling the inoculum increased the peaks of removal by a factor of 2 and 1 5 respectively and increased the effect duration this suggested that removal could be controlled by the amount of strain dosed however this was not sufficient to achieve compliance given these results in phase 2 two different strategies were applied to enhance metaldehyde elimination triple the original amount 3 of a calcoaceticus e1 was added to filter 3 only while inoculation with sphingobium cmet h was carried out in filters 4 and 5 filter 4 had been previously treated with a calcoaceticus e1 while filter 5 had not been subjected to any bioaugmentation after inoculation with strain e1 at 56 d filter 3 reached a peak of 49 1 removal at 60 d 8 11 107 c f u ml 1 water in the filter nonetheless the effect seemed to last for longer than before with some residual removal still present even at the end of the trial for sphingobium cmet h if directly extrapolating from batch assays 1 4 106 cells ml 1 water would be needed to remove all metaldehyde in the water column plus the incoming load in a 1 h period without any of the previously mentioned corrections however given the previous results with strain e1 where compliance was not achieved even after increasing its concentration sphingobium cmet h was inoculated in excess at 5 6 107 cells ml 1 water contrary to a calcoaceticus there was very little discrepancy between this calculated dose and the effectively detected concentration in the water 5 0 107 c f u ml 1 water bioaugmentation with this strain in filters 4 and 5 at 56 d led to a rapid and significant increase in the degradation of metaldehyde achieving removal of the compound to below the lod 0 01 µg l 1 after 58 and 56 8 d for filters 4 and 5 removal of the compound at these levels persisted until 72 d when the ssfs were decommissioned the maximum metaldehyde removal rate for this strain occurred shortly after inoculation in ssf 5 0 67 µg l 1 h 1 whereas for filter 4 this was 0 61 µg l 1 h 1 thereafter since no contaminant breakthrough was detected removal capacity was calculated to be 0 57 µg l 1 h 1 in both vessels following a hrt of 3 5 h comparatively smaller laboratory scale through flow columns with previously acclimated sand 50 µg l 1 metaldehyde 5 d pre exposure have been used and a maximum removal rate of 0 17 μg l 1 h 1 from an inlet concentration of 0 5 μg l 1 and 13 8 h contact time was obtained rolph et al 2019 a fluidised bed reactor 100 l with acclimated sand and non controlled temperature has also been tested and reached a removal rate of up to 0 2 μg l 1 h 1 from an inlet concentration of 0 1 0 9 μg l 1 with 67 min hrt and a recycle ratio of 28 6 rolph et al 2020 therefore sphingobium cmet h can remove the compound at high rates under these conditions for at least two weeks without any prior acclimatisation to the target pesticide in situ this suggests that targeted bioagumentation solutions might be suitable even for ephemeral and highly variable micropollutants by matching them with a high enough degrading population 3 3 microbial community in the ssf quality statistics for 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing are shown in table s4 78 samples were sequenced obtaining an average of 173 142 reads per sample after quality control the sample from filter 5 at 23 d was removed due to a low number of reads after quality control all remaining samples were rarefied to 61 312 reads rarefaction curves supplementary fig s3 indicated that for all samples the richness of bacterial taxa had already reached a plateau at this depth 3 3 1 fate of bioaugmentation agents an assessment of the relative amounts of the bioaugmentation agents in the schmutzdecke of the ssfs was performed the percentages of the community corresponding to the genera acinetobacter and sphingobium for the filters that underwent bioaugmentation 2 to 5 is shown in fig 3 a python script was written which identified and counted the 16s rrna sequences for strains a calcoaceticus e1 and sphingobium cmet h from the reads files for the ssf sequencing 87 8 of all acinetobacter raw reads had at least a 99 sequence similarity with a calcoaceticus e1 including 66 9 exact matches for sphingobium cmet h 52 6 of all sphingobium raw reads had a 99 sequence similarity with sphingobium cmet h including 37 4 of exact matches for phase 1 before inoculation with acinetobacter e1 in ssfs 2 3 and 4 the genus was absent at this sequencing depth in filter 2 while the percentage detected was 0 1 for both filters 3 and 4 fig 3 after the first bioaugmentation 1 at time 16 d the acinetobacter population peaked in the next sampling at 84 6 71 4 and 79 0 for filters 2 3 and 4 respectively nonetheless the population returned to pre inoculation levels at 30 37 d regardless of the presence of metaldehyde in the inlet suggesting acinetobacter was not actively growing at a rate sufficient for a sustainable population in the reactor the second bioaugmentation with this same strain 2 at time 42 d resulted in higher relative abundance 88 4 93 7 and the percentage of the augmented genus in the community decreased more slowly with time indicating greater persistence in the reactor however once again the permanence of the inoculum was not markedly different between filters that had metaldehyde input filters 3 and 4 and the one that did not filter 2 this suggests that this metaldehyde concentration in the inlet is insufficient to maintain the e1 strain degrading population in the ssfs and that the die off rate is independent of this factor approximately 3 the original amount of strain a calcoaceticus e1 was added to filter 3 for phase 2 of the experiment at time 56 d reaching a peak of 97 9 of the community however at the end of the assay at time 72 d the population had already dropped to 33 8 overall these data for acinetobacter indicate that a larger inoculum extended the persistence of the bioaugmentation agent and produced higher although transient peaks in abundance however removal of metaldehyde 25 was mainly observed when acinetobacter populations exceeded c 70 of the total number of 16s reads present in the schmutzdecke fig 3 and supplementary fig s4 and the required 95 elimination was not reached to investigate further the amount of mahy gene copies metaldehyde degrading gene from a calcoaceticus e1 was assessed via qpcr in the different levels of the bioaugmented ssfs at the end of the trial to ascertain the final distribution of a calcoaceticus e1 table 2 interestingly strain retention was dramatically higher in the top layer than in the lower layers with a top middle bottom t m b ratio of 9658 5 1 and 573 1 1 in filters 3 and 4 respectively given these results and the fact that the concentration of strain e1 detected in the filters was much lower than the pre calculated inoculum amounts for this strain it appeared that aggregation of a calcoaceticus e1 cells during the inoculum preparation procedure reduced the number of c f u detected by the culture method and hindered the adequate distribution of the bacteria throughout the filter by causing retention of aggregates in the top layer bacterial autoaggregation can be triggered as a form of protection from environmental stress and has been reported for acinetobacter baumanni calcoaceticus complex ishikawa et al 2012 trunk et al 2018 this phenomenon would have reduced the overall contact time between the pesticide and the bacteria and contributed to the failure to obtain an efficient and continued metaldehyde removal sphingobium cmet h was added to filters 4 and 5 in phase 2 to reach a cell concentration of 5 0 107 in the aqueous phase of both filters very close to the precalculated concentrations no aggregation detected before inoculation a relative average population of only 0 02 and 0 03 of the community belonged to the genus sphingobium in filters 4 and 5 peaks of 5 3 and 21 1 in the upper layer of filters 4 and 5 were promptly reached but the abundance decreased rapidly to much lower levels due to decay retention at lower levels or washout from the filters nonetheless in this case metaldehyde removal was persistent until the end of the trial given that despite the relatively low percentages of sphingobium cmet h detected in the schmutzdecke pesticide elimination was efficient we aimed to determine whether the mahs metaldehyde degrading gene had been transferred horizontally to the indigenous microbiota during the trial qpcr was used to quantify the number the mahs gene copies in the bioaugmented ssfs and compare them against the sphingobium population determined from 16s rrna amplicon sequencing and total bacterial rrna gene copies if dissimilar patterns arise through time this suggests horizontal gene transfer of mahs to the indigenous microbial population however fig 4 shows that mahs gene and sphingobium abundances in the schmutzdecke follow a similar pattern making this hypothesis unlikely it was also hypothesized that the bulk of the sphingobium cmet h inoculum was being retained further down the ssf instead of in the schmutzdecke to determine this the abundance of mahs genes was quantified at the different depths of the bioaugmented filters 4 and 5 at the end of the trial table 2 data showed that mahs carrying degraders were being retained at an approximate t m b ratio of 9 5 1 and 4 3 1 for filters 4 and 5 respectively even though this scattering was much more homogeneous than for a calcoaceticus e1 this last strain represented an extreme case of uneven distribution thus no preferential retention in the lower levels for sphingobium cmet h was observed the absolute numbers of sphingobium cmet h that remained in the filters were lower than for a calcoaceticus e1 yet metaldehyde was efficiently removed in filters inoculated with the former as shown in batch scale assays sphingobium cmet h removed metaldehyde at a faster rate than any of the other strains which were tested at an identical cell density it was posited that this characteristic along with the lack of inoculum aggregation upon addition were the main drivers behind its superior performance at pilot scale ruling out horizontal gene transfer and preferential inoculum retention at lower levels through careful experimental work strengthened this position 3 3 2 overall microbial community regarding the wider microbial community the rarefied dataset for all filters contained 37 different phyla and 528 genera of bacteria and archaea to identify factors influencing the microbial community composition of the ssfs analysis of the inherent microbial communities i e not including acinetobacter and sphingobium was carried out first at phylum level and subsequently at genus level phylum proteobacteria dominated the microbial community composition in the filters fig 5 a as has been observed in the other ssf systems chen et al 2021 d alessio et al 2015 haig et al 2014 followed by planctomycetes and bacteroidetes at genus level increasing diversity shannon diversity index h with time can be recognized in the microbial community supplementary fig s5 however no marked differences were present between individual ssfs this observation goes in hand with an enhancement of ssf performance with maturity pompei et al 2017 the pcoa plot for ssf microbial community distribution at genus level is shown in fig 5b for phase 1 sampling time was a significant determinant of community dissimilarity permanova pseudo f 12 01 p 0 0001 df 8 conversely neither metaldehyde addition permanova pseudo f 3 1849 p 0 1587 df 1 nor bioaugmentation with a calcoaceticus e1 permanova pseudo f 1 985 p 0 1568 df 1 were found to be factors that explained the differences between the communities similarly in phase 2 no significant impact of bioaugmentation with sphingobium cmet h permanova pseudo f 1 3127 p 0 37 df 1 or metaldehyde input permanova pseudo f 1 9021 p 0 1712 df 1 was found in the remaining microbial communities the low impact of metaldehyde on the microbial community whether inoculated or indigenous could be explained by the fact that the compound is present here at micropollutant levels µg l 1 vs mg l 1 for bulk natural organic matter in the water growth of pure cultures on single substrates requires a minimum level of the compound threshold concentration which has typically been reported to range between 1 and 100 µg l 1 for different compounds egli 2010 this threshold has not been determined for metaldehyde nevertheless no significant changes in the communities were detected with the concentrations used here in contrast significant effects have been found at elevated concentrations of 50 µg l 1 rolph et al 2019 our data indicate that bioaugmentation with metaldehyde degraders dosing of metaldehyde or both simultaneously did not significantly impact the remaining microbial community in the ssf and as reinforced by adequate water parameters of the filter effluents table s1 it is unlikely that this strategy will disturb the microbial function of a ssf further work in our laboratory will include testing the performance of sphingobium cmet h over extended reactor operation times i e months in more challenging scenarios such as lower inoculum lower temperatures and varying metaldehyde concentrations as well as different dosing approaches 4 conclusion here it has been demonstrated for the first time that a bioaugmentation strategy can provide removal of metaldehyde from water to below the regulatory limit in an upscaled continuous flow system in a real environmental matrix having a diverse collection of degraders at the start of the study was vital to finally achieve successful bioaugmentation aggregation of a calcoaceticus e1 in the upscaled filters caused its retention almost exclusively in the top layer which limited its removal efficiency due to poor contact between pesticide and degrader the distribution of sphingobium cmet h was more homogeneous which coupled with its high degrading capacity led to efficient compound removal for an extended period this study provides a template for similar stepwise screening and upscaling strategies which could be used for other problematic adsorption resistant compounds in drinking water purification future work is required to ascertain the persistence longevity and growth of sphingobium cmet h in upscaled systems with transient peaks in substrate concentrations also it should be investigated if once established in the microbial community it can still respond in reduced time periods when challenged with the compound data access data associated with this manuscript is

16325,metaldehyde is a polar mobile low molecular weight pesticide that is challenging to remove from drinking water with current adsorption based micropollutant treatment technologies alternative strategies to remove this and compounds with similar properties are necessary to ensure an adequate supply of safe and regulation compliant drinking water biological removal of metaldehyde below the 0 1 µg l 1 regulatory concentration was attained in pilot scale slow sand filters ssfs subject to bioaugmentation with metaldehyde degrading bacteria to achieve this a library of degraders was first screened in bench scale assays for removal at micropollutant concentrations in progressively more challenging conditions including a mixed microbial community with multiple carbon sources the best performing strains a calcoaceticus e1 and sphingobium cmet h showed removal rates of 0 0012 µg h 1 107 cells 1 and 0 019 µg h 1 107 cells 1 at this scale these candidates were then used as inocula for bioaugmentation of pilot scale ssfs here removal of metaldehyde by a calcoaceticus e1 was insufficient to achieve compliant water regardless testing increasing cell concentrations quantification of metaldehyde degrading genes indicated that aggregation and inadequate distribution of the inoculum in the filters were the likely causes of this outcome conversely bioaugmentation with sphingobium cmet h enabled sufficient metaldehyde removal to achieve compliance with undetectable levels in treated water for at least 14 d volumetric removal 0 57 µg l 1 h 1 bioaugmentation did not affect the background ssf microbial community and filter function was maintained throughout the trial here it has been shown for the first time that bioaugmentation is an efficient strategy to remove the adsorption resistant pesticide metaldehyde from a real water matrix in upscaled systems swift contaminant removal after inoculum addition and persistent activity are two remarkable attributes of this approach that would allow it to effectively manage peaks in metaldehyde concentrations due to precipitation or increased application in incoming raw water by matching them with high enough degrading populations this study provides an example of how stepwise screening of a diverse collection of degraders can lead to successful bioaugmentation and can be used as a template for other problematic adsorption resistant compounds in drinking water purification graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords bioaugmentation water purification pesticide micropollutant slow sand filter metaldehyde 1 introduction the european union drinking water directive council directive 98 83 ec dwd defines the maximum concentration for individual and total pesticides in drinking water at 0 1 μg l 1 and 0 5 μg l 1 respectively pesticides such as clopyralid metaldehyde propyzamide carbetamide metazachlor and quinmerac have been identified as pollutants of concern as they are widespread in their application pollute water resources and result in compliance failures in drinking water cooke et al 2020 cosgrove et al 2019 dillon et al 2013 these compounds share characteristics which present challenges to conventional drinking water treatment processes most are highly mobile in soil log koc 2 7 ml g 1 with the exception of propyzamide and they are polar molecules log kow 3 lewis et al 2016 these properties result in micropollutant concentrations entering water sources through leaching or runoff from agricultural sources for instance for metaldehyde studies in the uk have found peak concentrations to be 0 2 0 4 μg l 1 in source waters although greater concentrations of up to 2 7 μg l 1 have been detected kay and grayson 2014 in samples taken from river thames castle et al 2018 identified concentrations of 0 009 4 2 μg l 1 in addition these compounds have a small organic structure and therefore are less likely to be adsorbed using conventional micropollutant treatments such as granular activated carbon gac processes busquets et al 2014 cosgrove et al 2019 stuart et al 2011 for the model pesticide tested here metaldehyde the adsorption to activated carbon is not constant as its conformation and polarity can change due to its chemical structure anet 1974 in addition the efficacy of gac for treating metaldehyde is in the order of a few months thus this strategy remains costly and ineffective for treating this pesticide busquets et al 2014 hall et al 2011 marshall 2013 more sophisticated treatments such as advanced oxidation and uv technologies have been extensively tested however they are carbon intensive require extensive capital expenditure and present treatment associated by products with important implications for human health camm et al 2014 cooke et al 2020 catchment management initiatives in the uk get pelletwise osr herbicides think water and application bans have reduced the number of failures in recent years however these compounds still represent a continued challenge to the supply of pesticide free drinking water chief inspector of drinking water 2018 cooke et al 2020 mohamad ibrahim et al 2019 the voluntary initiative 2021 clearly more efficient and less carbon and energy intensive treatments are required to ensure compliance and protect public health for metaldehyde carbetamide propyzamide and clopyralid biodegradation is the main pathway for their removal from the environment being mineralised by microorganisms and accelerated biodegradation upon repeated exposure has been observed arbeli and fuentes 2007 hole et al 2001 rouchaud et al 2000 schütz et al 1996 simms et al 2006 walker and welch 1991 for metazachlor and quinmerac microbial metabolism occurs hart 1995 wang et al 2018 therefore treatments focusing on biological removal such as slow sand filtration have been proposed as a promising strategy dillon et al 2013 slow sand filters ssfs can be efficient in removing organic micro pollutants through biodegradation and sorption and have been proposed as viable options for high levels of treatment in small drinking water treatment plants at community or household level escolà casas and bester 2015 scheytt et al 2004 previous studies have shown that the uppermost layer of the ssf 0 2 cm known as the schmutzdecke is the most important in terms of active biomass microbial diversity and range of functions especially organic contaminant biodegradation chen et al 2021 haig et al 2016 oh et al 2018 co occurrence of specific taxa and clustering of microbial communities and metabolic functions from samples taken from geographically separated full scale ssfs indicates that their microbial conformation is driven by environmental factors and has been linked to adequate ssf performance chen et al 2021 haig et al 2016 oh et al 2018 only certain operational biofilters have been capable of removing specific recalcitrant polar low molecular weight organic micropollutants other biofilters with similar features and source water characteristics have been unable to degrade these compounds suggesting an important role of the resident microbial populations for undertaking this function rolph et al 2018 the microbial community in ssfs might adapt to degrade specific micropollutants however this usually happens after persistent elevated fluxes of the compound for extended periods of time rolph et al 2019 2020 however the applicability of such an approach requires optimisation to reduce the acclimation period to practical durations so that the enrichment can occur during a closed loop recycle period a strategy such as bioaugmentation decouples this from active operation and enables the potential for continuous operation and is viewed as a more practical solution bioaugmentation involves the addition of microorganisms capable of removing a specific compound to a natural or engineered system this is a valuable strategy for ssfs since the indigenous microbial communities in biologically active reactors seldom contain sufficient abundance of degrading populations capable of mineralising specific micropollutants when occurring in spikes in drinking water sources at the ng l 1 to µg l 1 range benner et al 2013 besides targeting a specific pollutant in the short term this strategy might lead to the establishment of a stable degrading population within the filter samuelsen et al 2017 most bioaugmentation candidate strains and consortia have only been shown to utilize their specific substrate at high concentrations much higher than micropollutant levels in most cases it remains unknown if they can degrade the compound when immersed in an environmental matrix with competing organisms and at very low initial concentrations benner et al 2013 even if microorganisms capable of degrading the compound at low concentrations are added many challenges remain environmental matrices often contain substances that inhibit microbial activity toxins enzyme inhibitors the environment may lack cofactors necessary for enzymatic activity and the added organisms may use different organic compounds rather than the pollutant also the inoculum may be hindered by competition with the indigenous microbial community or subject to predation by protozoa bouchez et al 2000 fuller 2021 goldstein et al 1985 moran et al 1976 finally in sand filters adhesion of the bioaugmentation agent to the sand particles can be important for preventing inoculum wash out allowing for its integration into the biofilm samuelsen et al 2017 all these possible outcomes make the adequate selection testing and monitoring of bioaugmentation candidates essential steps to ensure performance of the required function few studies have coupled bioaugmentation with sand filtration in the past bourne et al 2006 evaluated the removal of the cyanobacterial toxin microcystin at 50 µg l 1 for 15 d in pilot scale ssfs fed with river water in which the strain sphingomonas mj pv was added complete removal of microcystin lr was observed in all sand columns within 6 d including within the uninoculated controls and it was inferred that contamination of the water reservoir which fed these columns by the degrading strain had occurred mcdowall et al 2009 seeded laboratory scale ssf columns with a consortium of bacteria capable of removing the cyanobacterial metabolite geosmin and monitored them for up to 17 d inoculated columns 1 107 total active cells ml 1 reached a maximum of 38 additional removal of the compound in clarified water 0 1 µg l 1 initial concentration versus the controls lack of complete removal was attributed to a low contact time between consortium members and the micropollutant albers et al 2015 bioaugmented pilot scale rapid sand filters with aminobacter sp msh1 a 2 6 dichlorobenzamide degrader aiming to eliminate the pesticide from groundwater at a concentration of 0 2 µg l 1 in this study 75 removal was attained degradation within this filter occurred for less than one month probably due to loss of the inoculated cells during backwashing predation by protozoans or starvation metaldehyde degrading bacteria have recently been isolated for the first time and proven to use the compound as a sole source of carbon thomas et al 2017 since then the diversity of known metaldehyde degraders has been expanded and a shared aerobic degradation pathway has been identified castro gutiérrez et al 2020 however it remains unknown if they are capable of degrading the pesticide at micropollutant concentrations in natural environments the current paper posits that selection of the most efficient metaldehyde degrading strains followed by its use as a bioaugmentation agents in a drinking water biofilm reactor will be effective in delivering metaldehyde compliant water while maintaining filter functionality even when challenged with low pollutant concentrations in real water matrices to test this we aimed to i identify the most suitable bioaugmentation agents from a library of metaldehyde degrading strains through bench scale assays ii evaluate if bioaugmentation of upscaled systems with selected strains is an effective strategy for removing the contaminant from water collected from within an active drinking water treatment works iii monitor the presence of degrading populations to better understand bioaugmentation outcomes and iv determine if the background microbial community of the ssfs remains stable after being subject to bioaugmentation 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents and water characteristics metaldehyde 99 was

diversity shannon s h index calculated from the abundance for each distinct genus in the samples 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of metaldehyde degrading strains in laboratory scale batch experiments first it was necessary to determine if isolated metaldehyde degrading strains could remove the compound at environmentally relevant initial concentrations 2 µg l 1 in pure culture in defined medium with metaldehyde as the only carbon source and at a fixed inoculum level 1 107 cells ml 1 as these strains have been previously shown to degrade the compound at much higher starting concentrations 150 mg l 1 in the exact same medium castro gutiérrez et al 2020 the purpose of this experiment was to indicate if bioavailability is a limiting factor for the removal compound at this low starting concentration side by side comparison of the different strains under identical conditions permitted characterisation of the removal efficiency fig 1 a the strains had varying ability to remove metaldehyde at this low initial concentration sphingobium cmet h showed the fastest removal with 56 removed after 2 min and undetectable amounts of the compound after 15 min two of the acinetobacter strains a calcoaceticus e1 and a bohemicus jmet c were next in terms of removal efficiency c jiangsuensis sno d showed a slower utilization of the compound while negligible removal was observed for a lwoffii smet c and p vancouverensis smet b there was no metaldehyde removal by the control non degrading strain removal at the final time point ranged from none to below the lod even though most except sphingobium cmet h share the same metaldehyde degrading gene cluster and have been shown to degrade it at similar rates at higher concentrations 150 mg l 1 castro gutiérrez et al 2020 downregulation of catabolic enzymes or limited bioavailability are the main factors that can hinder degradation at very low concentrations bosma et al 1996 kundu et al 2019 for recently evolved xenobiotic degradation pathways it is unlikely that an efficient gene expression regulation mechanism has had a chance to emerge so the expression of enzymes involved in these catabolic reactions would be predominantly constitutive sørensen et al 2009 for the model metaldehyde degrading bacteria a calcoaceticus e1 a constitutive nature of the degrading pathway is supported by the observation that the onset of metaldehyde degradation proceeds very rapidly after inoculum addition to a metaldehyde containing aqueous matrix even if the inoculum has been pre grown in nutrient rich media without the contaminant at elevated 150 mg l 1 fuller 2021 or low concentrations 2 0 µg l 1 this study only a slight increase in metaldehyde degrading activity after pre culturing with metaldehyde vs acetate as sole carbon sources was found thomas et al 2017 these observations suggest that in a calcoaceticus e1 the degrading pathway is constitutive though it can be slightly upregulated since horizontal gene transfer is responsible for the dissemination of the shared degrading pathway across these strains castro gutiérrez 2020 the limited degradation rates at these low concentrations for specific strains would likely be due to low bioavailability instead of decreased enzyme expression micropollutant bioavailability can be influenced by factors such as phase distribution and mass transfer as well as associated physiological factors including membrane permeability active uptake systems and excretion of surfactants and enzymes cirja et al 2008 studies researching other micropollutants such as atrazine have applied compound specific isotope fractionation and demonstrated that mass transfer across the cell membrane becomes the rate limiting step below 60 µg l 1 in a chemostat ehrl et al 2019 with complete growth rate control evidenced in a retentostat at circa 12 µg l 1 where substrate is sufficient to maintain viability but not cell growth kundu et al 2019 on the other hand transport of micropollutants can be influenced by membrane transporters for instance whole genome sequencing of glyphosate resistant mutants of bacillus subtilis showed that its incorporation into the cell is mediated by the high affinity glutamate aspartate symporter gltt wicke et al 2019 it is possible that bioavailability limitations of metaldehyde are related to these factors and similar approaches could be used in subsequent studies to determine this the best performing strains a calcoaceticus e1 a bohemicus jmet c and sphingobium cmet h were selected for further validation in batch tests that more closely mimic a ssf environment conditions included the use of non sterile minimally treated water and presence of sand with and without an active microbial biofilm from a schmutzdecke it was posited that these conditions would expose the inocula to different sources of organic compounds inhibitory antimicrobial agents and interactions with other microorganisms in the water and sand metaldehyde removal below regulatory limits 0 1 µg l 1 in a time frame of less than 3 6 h estimated contact time in the sand bed for ssf was desirable since degrading enzyme expression is likely constitutive it was proposed that a moderate increase of the initial inoculum from 1 107 to 4 107 cells ml 1 could effectively and rapidly increase the contact between the degrading enzymes and the pollutant therefore reducing the treatment time needed to ensure good removal performance and compliance metaldehyde removal shown in fig 1b sphingobium cmet h reduced metaldehyde concentrations to levels below the instrument lod in less than 15 min for the clean systems and in less than 30 min for the systems with a biofilm a calcoaceticus reduced concentrations to below the regulatory limit in under 4 h for the systems with a biofilm and under 6 h for the clean systems for a bohemicus this occurred in less than 4 h in the systems with a biofilm however the desired removal level had not been reached in the clean sand system at the end of the assay calculated removal rates for the best strains sphingobium cmet h and a calcoaceticus e1 in the systems with a biofilm were 0 019 µg h 1 107 cells 1 and 0 0012 µg h 1 107 cells 1 the additional carbon sources present here can have a positive or negative effect on contaminant degradation positive effects can result from increased microbial biomass however this is usually the case in longer experiments that allow for more extensive microbial growth negative effects may occur if specific compounds other than the pesticide are present at high enough concentrations that cause catabolite repression kalisky et al 2007 or toxicity should a strain provide evidence of metaldehyde removal under these conditions it would be more likely to be active under continuous flow in a ssf even in this challenging scenario with mixed indigenous microbial communities and multiple substrates in a complex matrix metaldehyde levels were brought below the regulatory limits and even below the lod within a reasonable time frame using a practical inoculum size a calcoaceticus e1 was used first for inoculation of the pilot scale ssf because at the time of the experiments only the genes involved in metaldehyde catabolism for this strain mahx mahy had been identified and characterised castro gutiérrez et al 2020 and primer sets had been validated for tracking them in complex microbial communities castro gutiérrez 2020 sphingobium cmet h was trialled second as at that point no verifiable information was available regarding the genes responsible for the metaldehyde degradation subsequent work identified a gene mahs as responsible for metaldehyde degradation in sphingobium cmet h fuller 2021 3 2 effect of bioaugmentation on metaldehyde removal in a continuous flow through ssf treating real water six pilot scale ssfs 22 8 l total volume each were set up with a continuous flow 1 8 l h 1 of minimally treated water either spiked filters 3 6 or not spiked filters 1 and 2 with metaldehyde at a concentration of 2 0 µg l 1 table 1 and a hrt of 3 5 h no detection of metaldehyde above the lod occurred in the inlet of non spiked filters metaldehyde removal was quantified through time and is shown in fig 2 a 95 metaldehyde removal was required to obtain water below the regulatory limit of 0 1 µg l 1 dotted line in phase 1 of the trial days 1 to 55 metaldehyde removal in the non bioaugmented control ssfs 5 and 6 was very low with negligible removal detected at most time points and with a maximum removal of 12 3 at time 42 8 d in filter 5 and 11 2 at time 51 d in filter 6 in filters 3 and 4 a calcoaceticus e1 was first inoculated at 16 d if the removal rates from the batch assays were directly extrapolated addition of 2 1 107 cells ml 1 water of a calcoaceticus e1 would be needed to remove all metaldehyde from the water column 12 66 µg as well as the additional metaldehyde input from the inlet flow 3 6 µg in a 1 h period however the ssf columns were operated at 18 5 20 0 c vs 30 c in batch assays without shaking and the effect of washout predation and die off would have to be accounted for during extended operation therefore additional cells were added to the reactor such that 9 more cells were used in these experiments a 3 increase was selected for each of the effects of temperature mixing and cell losses the aim was to attain the establishment of a degrading population without having a deleterious impact on the indigenous microbial community of the ssf and hence influence the function of this system e g for turbidity removal this calculation yielded a target cell concentration of 1 9 108 cells ml 1 water nevertheless plate counts after inoculation revealed that an inoculation density of 2 4 107 colony forming units c f u ml 1 was achieved in the filters the cause of this apparent cell loss is discussed later in the paper in the next 12 h after inoculation metaldehyde removal increased to a maximum of 37 3 and 56 1 in filters 3 and 4 however the effect appeared transient and the removal returned to pre inoculation levels at 18 and 20 d respectively at 42 d double the original amount 2 of a calcoaceticus e1 was added to filters 3 and 4 here plate counts for the inoculum revealed that the filters had 4 84 107 c f u ml 1 of strain e1 peaks in removal were observed after 43 d reaching values of 74 6 and 78 1 for filters 3 and 4 metaldehyde elimination returned to pre inoculum levels at 45 and 51 d respectively the removal process therefore lasted for longer than during the first inoculation thus doubling the inoculum increased the peaks of removal by a factor of 2 and 1 5 respectively and increased the effect duration this suggested that removal could be controlled by the amount of strain dosed however this was not sufficient to achieve compliance given these results in phase 2 two different strategies were applied to enhance metaldehyde elimination triple the original amount 3 of a calcoaceticus e1 was added to filter 3 only while inoculation with sphingobium cmet h was carried out in filters 4 and 5 filter 4 had been previously treated with a calcoaceticus e1 while filter 5 had not been subjected to any bioaugmentation after inoculation with strain e1 at 56 d filter 3 reached a peak of 49 1 removal at 60 d 8 11 107 c f u ml 1 water in the filter nonetheless the effect seemed to last for longer than before with some residual removal still present even at the end of the trial for sphingobium cmet h if directly extrapolating from batch assays 1 4 106 cells ml 1 water would be needed to remove all metaldehyde in the water column plus the incoming load in a 1 h period without any of the previously mentioned corrections however given the previous results with strain e1 where compliance was not achieved even after increasing its concentration sphingobium cmet h was inoculated in excess at 5 6 107 cells ml 1 water contrary to a calcoaceticus there was very little discrepancy between this calculated dose and the effectively detected concentration in the water 5 0 107 c f u ml 1 water bioaugmentation with this strain in filters 4 and 5 at 56 d led to a rapid and significant increase in the degradation of metaldehyde achieving removal of the compound to below the lod 0 01 µg l 1 after 58 and 56 8 d for filters 4 and 5 removal of the compound at these levels persisted until 72 d when the ssfs were decommissioned the maximum metaldehyde removal rate for this strain occurred shortly after inoculation in ssf 5 0 67 µg l 1 h 1 whereas for filter 4 this was 0 61 µg l 1 h 1 thereafter since no contaminant breakthrough was detected removal capacity was calculated to be 0 57 µg l 1 h 1 in both vessels following a hrt of 3 5 h comparatively smaller laboratory scale through flow columns with previously acclimated sand 50 µg l 1 metaldehyde 5 d pre exposure have been used and a maximum removal rate of 0 17 μg l 1 h 1 from an inlet concentration of 0 5 μg l 1 and 13 8 h contact time was obtained rolph et al 2019 a fluidised bed reactor 100 l with acclimated sand and non controlled temperature has also been tested and reached a removal rate of up to 0 2 μg l 1 h 1 from an inlet concentration of 0 1 0 9 μg l 1 with 67 min hrt and a recycle ratio of 28 6 rolph et al 2020 therefore sphingobium cmet h can remove the compound at high rates under these conditions for at least two weeks without any prior acclimatisation to the target pesticide in situ this suggests that targeted bioagumentation solutions might be suitable even for ephemeral and highly variable micropollutants by matching them with a high enough degrading population 3 3 microbial community in the ssf quality statistics for 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing are shown in table s4 78 samples were sequenced obtaining an average of 173 142 reads per sample after quality control the sample from filter 5 at 23 d was removed due to a low number of reads after quality control all remaining samples were rarefied to 61 312 reads rarefaction curves supplementary fig s3 indicated that for all samples the richness of bacterial taxa had already reached a plateau at this depth 3 3 1 fate of bioaugmentation agents an assessment of the relative amounts of the bioaugmentation agents in the schmutzdecke of the ssfs was performed the percentages of the community corresponding to the genera acinetobacter and sphingobium for the filters that underwent bioaugmentation 2 to 5 is shown in fig 3 a python script was written which identified and counted the 16s rrna sequences for strains a calcoaceticus e1 and sphingobium cmet h from the reads files for the ssf sequencing 87 8 of all acinetobacter raw reads had at least a 99 sequence similarity with a calcoaceticus e1 including 66 9 exact matches for sphingobium cmet h 52 6 of all sphingobium raw reads had a 99 sequence similarity with sphingobium cmet h including 37 4 of exact matches for phase 1 before inoculation with acinetobacter e1 in ssfs 2 3 and 4 the genus was absent at this sequencing depth in filter 2 while the percentage detected was 0 1 for both filters 3 and 4 fig 3 after the first bioaugmentation 1 at time 16 d the acinetobacter population peaked in the next sampling at 84 6 71 4 and 79 0 for filters 2 3 and 4 respectively nonetheless the population returned to pre inoculation levels at 30 37 d regardless of the presence of metaldehyde in the inlet suggesting acinetobacter was not actively growing at a rate sufficient for a sustainable population in the reactor the second bioaugmentation with this same strain 2 at time 42 d resulted in higher relative abundance 88 4 93 7 and the percentage of the augmented genus in the community decreased more slowly with time indicating greater persistence in the reactor however once again the permanence of the inoculum was not markedly different between filters that had metaldehyde input filters 3 and 4 and the one that did not filter 2 this suggests that this metaldehyde concentration in the inlet is insufficient to maintain the e1 strain degrading population in the ssfs and that the die off rate is independent of this factor approximately 3 the original amount of strain a calcoaceticus e1 was added to filter 3 for phase 2 of the experiment at time 56 d reaching a peak of 97 9 of the community however at the end of the assay at time 72 d the population had already dropped to 33 8 overall these data for acinetobacter indicate that a larger inoculum extended the persistence of the bioaugmentation agent and produced higher although transient peaks in abundance however removal of metaldehyde 25 was mainly observed when acinetobacter populations exceeded c 70 of the total number of 16s reads present in the schmutzdecke fig 3 and supplementary fig s4 and the required 95 elimination was not reached to investigate further the amount of mahy gene copies metaldehyde degrading gene from a calcoaceticus e1 was assessed via qpcr in the different levels of the bioaugmented ssfs at the end of the trial to ascertain the final distribution of a calcoaceticus e1 table 2 interestingly strain retention was dramatically higher in the top layer than in the lower layers with a top middle bottom t m b ratio of 9658 5 1 and 573 1 1 in filters 3 and 4 respectively given these results and the fact that the concentration of strain e1 detected in the filters was much lower than the pre calculated inoculum amounts for this strain it appeared that aggregation of a calcoaceticus e1 cells during the inoculum preparation procedure reduced the number of c f u detected by the culture method and hindered the adequate distribution of the bacteria throughout the filter by causing retention of aggregates in the top layer bacterial autoaggregation can be triggered as a form of protection from environmental stress and has been reported for acinetobacter baumanni calcoaceticus complex ishikawa et al 2012 trunk et al 2018 this phenomenon would have reduced the overall contact time between the pesticide and the bacteria and contributed to the failure to obtain an efficient and continued metaldehyde removal sphingobium cmet h was added to filters 4 and 5 in phase 2 to reach a cell concentration of 5 0 107 in the aqueous phase of both filters very close to the precalculated concentrations no aggregation detected before inoculation a relative average population of only 0 02 and 0 03 of the community belonged to the genus sphingobium in filters 4 and 5 peaks of 5 3 and 21 1 in the upper layer of filters 4 and 5 were promptly reached but the abundance decreased rapidly to much lower levels due to decay retention at lower levels or washout from the filters nonetheless in this case metaldehyde removal was persistent until the end of the trial given that despite the relatively low percentages of sphingobium cmet h detected in the schmutzdecke pesticide elimination was efficient we aimed to determine whether the mahs metaldehyde degrading gene had been transferred horizontally to the indigenous microbiota during the trial qpcr was used to quantify the number the mahs gene copies in the bioaugmented ssfs and compare them against the sphingobium population determined from 16s rrna amplicon sequencing and total bacterial rrna gene copies if dissimilar patterns arise through time this suggests horizontal gene transfer of mahs to the indigenous microbial population however fig 4 shows that mahs gene and sphingobium abundances in the schmutzdecke follow a similar pattern making this hypothesis unlikely it was also hypothesized that the bulk of the sphingobium cmet h inoculum was being retained further down the ssf instead of in the schmutzdecke to determine this the abundance of mahs genes was quantified at the different depths of the bioaugmented filters 4 and 5 at the end of the trial table 2 data showed that mahs carrying degraders were being retained at an approximate t m b ratio of 9 5 1 and 4 3 1 for filters 4 and 5 respectively even though this scattering was much more homogeneous than for a calcoaceticus e1 this last strain represented an extreme case of uneven distribution thus no preferential retention in the lower levels for sphingobium cmet h was observed the absolute numbers of sphingobium cmet h that remained in the filters were lower than for a calcoaceticus e1 yet metaldehyde was efficiently removed in filters inoculated with the former as shown in batch scale assays sphingobium cmet h removed metaldehyde at a faster rate than any of the other strains which were tested at an identical cell density it was posited that this characteristic along with the lack of inoculum aggregation upon addition were the main drivers behind its superior performance at pilot scale ruling out horizontal gene transfer and preferential inoculum retention at lower levels through careful experimental work strengthened this position 3 3 2 overall microbial community regarding the wider microbial community the rarefied dataset for all filters contained 37 different phyla and 528 genera of bacteria and archaea to identify factors influencing the microbial community composition of the ssfs analysis of the inherent microbial communities i e not including acinetobacter and sphingobium was carried out first at phylum level and subsequently at genus level phylum proteobacteria dominated the microbial community composition in the filters fig 5 a as has been observed in the other ssf systems chen et al 2021 d alessio et al 2015 haig et al 2014 followed by planctomycetes and bacteroidetes at genus level increasing diversity shannon diversity index h with time can be recognized in the microbial community supplementary fig s5 however no marked differences were present between individual ssfs this observation goes in hand with an enhancement of ssf performance with maturity pompei et al 2017 the pcoa plot for ssf microbial community distribution at genus level is shown in fig 5b for phase 1 sampling time was a significant determinant of community dissimilarity permanova pseudo f 12 01 p 0 0001 df 8 conversely neither metaldehyde addition permanova pseudo f 3 1849 p 0 1587 df 1 nor bioaugmentation with a calcoaceticus e1 permanova pseudo f 1 985 p 0 1568 df 1 were found to be factors that explained the differences between the communities similarly in phase 2 no significant impact of bioaugmentation with sphingobium cmet h permanova pseudo f 1 3127 p 0 37 df 1 or metaldehyde input permanova pseudo f 1 9021 p 0 1712 df 1 was found in the remaining microbial communities the low impact of metaldehyde on the microbial community whether inoculated or indigenous could be explained by the fact that the compound is present here at micropollutant levels µg l 1 vs mg l 1 for bulk natural organic matter in the water growth of pure cultures on single substrates requires a minimum level of the compound threshold concentration which has typically been reported to range between 1 and 100 µg l 1 for different compounds egli 2010 this threshold has not been determined for metaldehyde nevertheless no significant changes in the communities were detected with the concentrations used here in contrast significant effects have been found at elevated concentrations of 50 µg l 1 rolph et al 2019 our data indicate that bioaugmentation with metaldehyde degraders dosing of metaldehyde or both simultaneously did not significantly impact the remaining microbial community in the ssf and as reinforced by adequate water parameters of the filter effluents table s1 it is unlikely that this strategy will disturb the microbial function of a ssf further work in our laboratory will include testing the performance of sphingobium cmet h over extended reactor operation times i e months in more challenging scenarios such as lower inoculum lower temperatures and varying metaldehyde concentrations as well as different dosing approaches 4 conclusion here it has been demonstrated for the first time that a bioaugmentation strategy can provide removal of metaldehyde from water to below the regulatory limit in an upscaled continuous flow system in a real environmental matrix having a diverse collection of degraders at the start of the study was vital to finally achieve successful bioaugmentation aggregation of a calcoaceticus e1 in the upscaled filters caused its retention almost exclusively in the top layer which limited its removal efficiency due to poor contact between pesticide and degrader the distribution of sphingobium cmet h was more homogeneous which coupled with its high degrading capacity led to efficient compound removal for an extended period this study provides a template for similar stepwise screening and upscaling strategies which could be used for other problematic adsorption resistant compounds in drinking water purification future work is required to ascertain the persistence longevity and growth of sphingobium cmet h in upscaled systems with transient peaks in substrate concentrations also it should be investigated if once established in the microbial community it can still respond in reduced time periods when challenged with the compound data access data associated with this manuscript is

16326,in this article we show that enzymatic hydrolysis of a biodegradable polyester poly ε caprolactone by amano lipase ps in an aqueous buffer environment yielded rapidly an excessive number of microplastic particles merely 0 1 g of poly ε caprolactone film was demonstrated to yield millions of particles there were also indications of non enzymatic hydrolysis at the same conditions but this did not yield any particles within the time frame of the experiment up to 6 days microplastic particles formed had irregular shapes with an average size of around 10 µm with only a few reaching 60 µm the formation of microplastic particles resulted from the uneven hydrolysis erosion rate across the polymer film surface which led to a rough and undulating surface with ridge branch and rod shaped micro protruding structures the consequent detachment and fragmentation of these micro sized protruding structures resulted in the release of microplastics to the surroundings together with microplastics hydrolysis products such as acidic monomers and oligomers were also released during the enzymatic hydrolysis process causing a ph decrease in the surrounding liquid the results suggest that the risk of microplastic pollution from biodegradable plastics is notable despite their biodegradation special attention needs to be paid when using and disposing of biodegradable plastics

the key measures to alleviate plastic pollution is to replace conventional non biodegradable plastics with biodegradable plastics especially for single use products such as plastic garbage bags mulch films and packaging films which are basically made by non biodegradable pe qin et al 2021 satti and shah 2020 sun et al 2021 most of the commercial synthetic biodegradable plastics are polyesters such

esterases that degrade them are ubiquitous in living organisms such as bacteria and fungi for example phb is naturally synthesized as a storage material by many bacteria mcadam et al 2020 and can be even digested by animals in their guts without problems because of their biodegradability the persistence of biodegradable plastics in nature is much shorter than non biodegradable ones which helps to reduce the accumulation of plastic waste laycock et al 2017 the biodegradation of polyesters proceeds in several stages i colonization of microorganisms on the surface formation of biofilms and their

life of a phb film degraded on different marine beach sediments ranges from 112 to 215 days consequently depending on the conditions biodegradable microplastics can also accumulate in ecosystems

capable of adsorbing and concentrating polluting substances present in the environment cole et al 2011 sun et al 2021 zuo et al 2019 schöpfer et al 2020 conclude that the toxicity risk for conventional pe and biodegradable pla pbat blend microplastic particles is likely the same since microplastic toxicity is mainly attributable to physical and indirect nutritional effects rather than chemical effects as a result there is an urgent need to evaluate and understand the formation process of microplastics from biodegradable polymers in this article the formation process of microplastics from a biodegradable polyester during enzymatic hydrolysis in an aquatic environment and the underlying mechanisms are revealed the enzymatic hydrolysis of pcl by one of its microbial hydrolytic enzymes i e amano lipase ps was selected here as the model system pcl one of the common biodegradable polyesters is extensively used in food packaging and tissue engineering hajiali et al

were studied with a mettler toledo dsc 1 calorimeter switzerland the samples were heated from 20 to 80 c at a rate of 10 c min 1 with a nitrogen gas flow rate of 50 ml min 1 the degree of crystallinity was calculated by dividing the melting enthalpy of the samples by the melting enthalpy of 100 crystalline pcl 139 5 j g 1 crescenzi et al 1972 the molecular weight of the film samples

test the solution was filtered first with a 0 45 μm pvdf membrane to remove the plastic particles and then with a vivaspin 20 3 kda mwco polyethersulfone membrane merck sweden to remove the enzymes in the solution by membrane ultrafiltration in a centrifuge 3 results and discussion 3 1 microplastics formation the film samples fragmented after 4 days of ageing fig 1 a and the mass and thickness of the film decreased rapidly and similarly with increasing ageing time fig 1b in particular the thickness significantly reduced to 15 of the initial thickness after 2 days of ageing and further to 6 5 ca 33 μm after 4 days the film was very thin after 6 days of ageing and it shrank after being removed from the buffer solution fig 1a the results indicate fast enzymatic hydrolysis of pcl films under the actual 40 c temperature and ph conditions enzymes being large molecules cannot diffuse into polymers and can only catalyse hydrolysis at the plastic surface which is well known as a surface erosion process laycock et al 2017 this surface erosion process caused the gradual thickness reduction of the pcl films during ageing also it is observed in fig 1a that the sample surface became rougher with increasing ageing time due to surface erosion a large number of particles suspended in the buffer solution was observed in all aged samples fig 1c indicating the formation of microplastics during the entire enzymatic hydrolysis process of pcl video 1 clearly shows the movement of the suspended particles in the solution when shaking the glass vial the ph of the buffer solution decreased from 7 2 to 4 3 after one day of ageing and reached 3 9 after two days of ageing fig 1d the buffer ph also decreased during the two days that followed each buffer change but to a lesser extent than in the first two days of the ageing test this was because the ratio of the film mass to buffer volume decreased significantly after each buffer change fig 1e shows the extracted hplc chromatogram for the solution after two days of ageing with two prominent peaks observed at 2 8 and 3 8 elution time the relative areas of the peaks corresponded to ca 80 and 20 for 2 8 and 3 8 min respectively the ms profile of the elution times described not shown corresponded primarily to m z 151 for 2 8 min associated with the pcl monomer 6 hydroxycaproic acid see fig 1e the ms profile for 3 8 min elution on the other hand showed fractions corresponding to m z profiles of 475 4 m and 588 5 m ascribed to linear pcl oligomeric fractions these results indicated the formation of soluble hydrolysis products i e the acidic monomer and oligomers in the buffer solution which accounts for the ph decrease apart from the enzymatic hydrolysis the pcl samples aged in buffer solution with lipase could also undergo non enzymatic hydrolysis however the thickness mass and surface morphology of the control reference sample aged in the buffer without lipase for 6 days were unchanged in addition the buffer ph was unchanged and no particles appeared in the buffer fig 1 hence the degradation of pcl films and the formation of microplastics were mainly if not entirely caused by enzymatic hydrolysis both large and small microplastics were observed in the optical microscope figs 2 a and b the large particles showed a clear branch like shape as also observed in the sem images figs 2c d h and k much smaller irregular particles with sizes of a few micrometers were also observed for all the samples in the enlarged images the particles showed a heavily eroded rough surface figs 2e i j l and m the size of the formed microplastics ranged from a few micrometers to dozens of micrometers fig 3 the branch like microplastics with a size greater than 50 μm only accounted for a small part of the formed microplastics the average size was 15 μm for the microplastics formed during the first two days of ageing and it decreased to 12 and 9 5 μm for those formed in the consecutive second and third two days of ageing respectively the estimated number of the formed microplastics in each glass vial was 391 000 441 000 and 342 000 after the first second and third two days of ageing respectively note that the initial mass for each pcl film was only ca 0 1 g strikingly an estimated more than one million microplastics were in total generated from the whole biodegradation process of only 0 1 g of the pcl film depending on the fate of the detached microplastics the generation of microplastics may be a concern for generally considered good for the environment biodegradable polymers these microplastic particles are most likely highly persistent when they end up in the cold waters of the oceans initiating potential detrimental effects to sensitive ecosystems 3 2 surface morphology to further reveal the release process of microplastics from pcl films during the hydrolysis process the surface morphology of the films was carefully examined figs 4 a d show the evolution of the surface morphology of the pcl films after different ageing times in particular a large number of spherical holes were observed on the surface of the film after one day of ageing figs 4a e and f the wall shared by adjacent holes formed a continuous network of ridges as marked by the dashed line in fig 4f the ridges also had heavily eroded surfaces fig 4g the formation of holes pores on polymer surfaces during enzymatic hydrolysis has been extensively reported gan et al 1997 ma et al 2020 nishida and tokiwa 1993 shi et al 2020 and it is attributed to the heterogeneous hydrolysis rate across the polymer surface the heterogeneous hydrolysis rate stems from many possible reasons e g uneven coverage of microorganisms on the polymer surface the amorphous crystalline structure of semicrystalline polymers broad molecular weight distribution and the presence of defects gas bubbles fillers additives in samples laycock et al 2017 here the amorphous crystalline structure of pcl which has an initial crystallinity of 40 see below probably accounted for at least to a certain extent the uneven hydrolysis rate across the surface likely due to hydrolysis occurring preferentially in the amorphous phase laycock et al 2017 under further erosion a network of branch structures was formed on the top of the bulk film after two days of ageing figs 4b and h the formed branch network layer was ca 150 μm thick fig 4j the bottom part of the spherical holes whose borders were marked with dashed lines was recognized fig 4j and the branch structure was precisely located in the walls of adjacent holes the ridges this indicates that the branch structure was formed due to the erosion of ridges upon further ageing once the holes ridges morphology was formed on the surface the enzymatic hydrolysis eroded the ridges not only from top to bottom but also from side to side as illustrated in fig 4l as the ridge s width was much smaller than its height the erosion from the side penetrated the ridge more easily than that from the top as illustrated in fig 4l in addition owing to the uneven superficial erosion rate of enzymatic hydrolysis many cavities were formed within the ridges across their side surface figs 4j and k which eventually led to the formation of the observed branch structures the connecting part between the branch structures and bulk film was very thin and fragile figs 4j and k upon further ageing the thin connecting part was completely eroded which resulted in the detachment of the branches from the film as illustrated in fig 4l and the release of the fragments with a branch like shape into the buffer refer to the large ones observed in fig 2 moreover the branches had an uneven cross sectional area figs 4h and i and their thinner parts were likely to be fully eroded earlier than their thicker parts upon further ageing leading to the fragmentation within the branches and the release of the small microplastics observed in fig 2 most branches were detached from the film after 4 days of ageing leaving only the bottom part of the hole ridge structure on the film surface figs 4c and s1 besides many small through holes were observed in the thinned film suggesting that the erosion had penetrated the film from top to down which eventually caused the fragmentation of the bulk film and further release of microplastics fig 1a under further ageing the film became very thin and the through holes became larger and more leading to the formation of another type of branch structure fig 4d the branches observed in the upper part of fig 4d were about to fragment leading to further release of microplastics 3 3 physicochemical properties of aged pcl films the intensity of the main characteristic ir bands of pcl fig 5 a e g the asymmetric coc stretching band at 1240 cm 1 and c o and c c stretching modes in the amorphous phase at 1162 cm 1 khatiwala et al 2008 decreased with increasing ageing time due to the cleavage of ester groups during the enzymatic hydrolysis besides the aged samples displayed a new wider shoulder at 3500 3100 cm 1 attributed to the hydroxyl group of carboxylic acid and alcohol the ir spectra of the aged pcl films also showed an extra shoulder at 1650 cm 1 near their main carbonyl band at 1720 cm 1 the appearance of both the hydroxyl groups and new types of carbonyl groups revealed the formation of carboxylic acids during the enzymatic hydrolysis of pcl the migration of the hydrolysis products i e carboxylic acids into the buffer accounted for the decrease in the buffer ph fig 1d the reference sample showed similar changes in the ir spectrum with the ones aged in enzymes indicating the occurrence of also non enzymatic hydrolysis of pcl during the ageing the weight averaged molecular weight m w was 307 kda for pristine pcl and decreased to ca 240 kda after 1 day of ageing remaining unchanged at 260 kda upon further ageing fig 5b since enzymatic hydrolysis only occurred in the surface layer and the inner part of the sample remained unaffected the molecular weight of the enzymatically hydrolysed sample depends on the hydrolysis time and the ratio of the surface layer to the bulk part of samples noting that the reference sample had a reduced m w 270 kda the non enzymatic hydrolysis also partially accounted for the reduced molecular weight of the aged samples in addition small peaks in the lower molecular weight range ca 600 da were observed for the pristine pcl film fig 5b which was assigned to residual ester oligomers from the polymerization the increase in intensity during ageing of the low molecular weight species with a peak at 1380 da indicated that oligomers were formed from to hydrolysis of the film the unaged pcl sample had a single melting peak at 60 c fig 5c after one day of ageing a new small melting shoulder appeared at 51 c which shifted towards higher temperature with increasing ageing time it is known that when crystallizable polymers are annealed aged a new melting peak often appears ca 10 c above the annealing temperature due to the formation of new thin crystals wei et al 2017 the primary melting peak was also higher in the aged samples highest in the 6 day reference sample than in the unaged sample indicating an annealing induced thickening of the main larger crystals despite the annealing effects the crystallinity of the pcl samples was unchanged during the first 3 days of ageing and increased to 44 from 40 after 4 days of ageing the slight change in the crystallinity was probably due to the surface erosion process where the bulk part of the materials remains intact by enzymatic hydrolysis laycock et al 2017 notable is that the reference sample did not experience the same increase in crystallinity despite the crystal thickening 4 conclusion this study demonstrated that a considerably large number of microplastic particles were generated during the enzymatic hydrolysis of biodegradable polyesters under biodegradation the number of formed microplastics is very high up to one million from the complete biodegradation of 0 1 g pcl the polymer underwent a surface erosion process during the enzymatic hydrolysis and the erosion speed was heterogeneous across the film surface leading to a rough and undulating surface with ridge branch and rod shaped micro protruding structures the consequent detachment and fragmentation of these micro sized protruding structures during further hydrolysis caused the release of microplastics to the surroundings when the eroded sample became very thin the fragmentation of the bulk sample occurred leading to further microplastic release the molecular weight of the polymer and the ph of the liquid decreased during the experiment the latter was caused by the formation of hydrolysis

16326,in this article we show that enzymatic hydrolysis of a biodegradable polyester poly ε caprolactone by amano lipase ps in an aqueous buffer environment yielded rapidly an excessive number of microplastic particles merely 0 1 g of poly ε caprolactone film was demonstrated to yield millions of particles there were also indications of non enzymatic hydrolysis at the same conditions but this did not yield any particles within the time frame of the experiment up to 6 days microplastic particles formed had irregular shapes with an average size of around 10 µm with only a few reaching 60 µm the formation of microplastic particles resulted from the uneven hydrolysis erosion rate across the polymer film surface which led to a rough and undulating surface with ridge branch and rod shaped micro protruding structures the consequent detachment and fragmentation of these micro sized protruding structures resulted in the release of microplastics to the surroundings together with microplastics hydrolysis products such as acidic monomers and oligomers were also released during the enzymatic hydrolysis process causing a ph decrease in the surrounding liquid the results suggest that the risk of microplastic pollution from biodegradable plastics is notable despite their biodegradation special attention needs to be paid when using and disposing of biodegradable plastics

depending on the type of plastic and its surroundings producing a significant and long term threat to a multiplicity of ecosystems globally kannan and vimalkumar 2021 klingelhofer et al 2020 one of the key measures to alleviate plastic pollution is to replace conventional non biodegradable plastics with biodegradable plastics especially for single use products such as plastic garbage bags mulch films and packaging films which are basically made by non biodegradable pe qin et al 2021 satti and shah 2020 sun et al 2021 most of the commercial synthetic biodegradable plastics are polyesters such as polylactic acid pla poly ε caprolactone pcl polybutylene adipate terephthalate pbat and polyhydroxybutyrate phb tokiwa and calabia 2007 wei et al 2014 their ester bonds occur in nature and enzymes esterases that degrade them are ubiquitous in living organisms such as bacteria and fungi for example phb is naturally synthesized as a storage material by many bacteria mcadam et al 2020 and can be even digested by animals in their guts without problems because of their biodegradability the persistence of biodegradable plastics in nature is much shorter than non biodegradable ones which helps to reduce the accumulation of plastic waste laycock et al 2017 the biodegradation of polyesters proceeds in several stages i colonization of microorganisms on the surface formation of biofilms and their

life of a phb film degraded on different marine beach sediments ranges from 112 to 215 days consequently depending on the conditions biodegradable microplastics can also accumulate in ecosystems

capable of adsorbing and concentrating polluting substances present in the environment cole et al 2011 sun et al 2021 zuo et al 2019 schöpfer et al 2020 conclude that the toxicity risk for conventional pe and biodegradable pla pbat blend microplastic particles is likely the same since microplastic toxicity is mainly attributable to physical and indirect nutritional effects rather than chemical effects as a result there is an urgent need to evaluate and understand the formation process of microplastics from biodegradable polymers in this article the formation process of microplastics from a biodegradable polyester during enzymatic hydrolysis in an aquatic environment and the underlying mechanisms are revealed the enzymatic hydrolysis of pcl by one of its microbial hydrolytic enzymes i e amano lipase ps was selected here as the model system pcl one of the common biodegradable polyesters is extensively used in food packaging and tissue engineering hajiali et al 2018 jiang and zhang 2013 and amano lipase ps is reported as a very effective hydrolase for pcl delre et al 2021 greene et al 2021 phosphate buffered saline solution instead of pure water was employed as the hydrolysis media to optimize and maintain the ph for high enzyme activity zheng et al 2002 the pcl films were aged in the buffer solution containing lipase at a temperature of 40 c for up to 6 days the mass loss of film samples and the changes in solution ph during the hydrolysis were evaluated the releases of microplastics from the film were determined qualitatively and quantitatively including the morphological changes in the film during the degradation 2 experimental 2 1 materials and sample preparation pcl pellets having a trademark of capa fb100 and a density of 1130 kg m3 was

hydrolysis products i e the acidic monomer and oligomers in the buffer solution which accounts for the ph decrease apart from the enzymatic hydrolysis the pcl samples aged in buffer solution with lipase could also undergo non enzymatic hydrolysis however the thickness mass and surface morphology of the control reference sample aged in the buffer without lipase for 6 days were unchanged in addition the buffer ph was unchanged and no particles appeared in the buffer fig 1 hence the degradation of pcl films and the formation of microplastics were mainly if not entirely caused by enzymatic hydrolysis both large and small microplastics were observed in the optical microscope figs 2 a and b the large particles showed a clear branch like shape as also observed in the sem images figs 2c d h and k much smaller irregular particles with sizes of a few micrometers were also observed for all the samples in the enlarged images the particles showed a heavily eroded rough surface figs 2e i j l and m the size of the formed microplastics ranged from a few micrometers to dozens of micrometers fig 3 the branch like microplastics with a size greater than 50 μm only accounted for a small part of the formed microplastics the average size was 15 μm for the microplastics formed during the first two days of ageing and it decreased to 12 and 9 5 μm for those formed in the consecutive second and third two days of ageing respectively the estimated number of the formed microplastics in each glass vial was 391 000 441 000 and 342 000 after the first second and third two days of ageing respectively note that the initial mass for each pcl film was only ca 0 1 g strikingly an estimated more than one million microplastics were in total generated from the whole biodegradation process of only 0 1 g of the pcl film depending on the fate of the detached microplastics the generation of microplastics may be a concern for generally considered good for the environment biodegradable polymers these microplastic particles are most likely highly persistent when they end up in the cold waters of the oceans initiating potential detrimental effects to sensitive ecosystems 3 2 surface morphology to further reveal the release process of microplastics from pcl films during the hydrolysis process the surface morphology of the films was carefully examined figs 4 a d show the evolution of the surface morphology of the pcl films after different ageing times in particular a large number of spherical holes were observed on the surface of the film after one day of ageing figs 4a e and f the wall shared by adjacent holes formed a continuous network of ridges as marked by the dashed line in fig 4f the ridges also had heavily eroded surfaces fig 4g the formation of holes pores on polymer surfaces during enzymatic hydrolysis has been extensively reported gan et al 1997 ma et al 2020 nishida and tokiwa 1993 shi et al 2020 and it is attributed to the heterogeneous hydrolysis rate across the polymer surface the heterogeneous hydrolysis rate stems from many possible reasons e g uneven coverage of microorganisms on the polymer surface the amorphous crystalline structure of semicrystalline polymers broad molecular weight distribution and the presence of defects gas bubbles fillers additives in samples laycock et al 2017 here the amorphous crystalline structure of pcl which has an initial crystallinity of 40 see below probably accounted for at least to a certain extent the uneven hydrolysis rate across the surface likely due to hydrolysis occurring preferentially in the amorphous phase laycock et al 2017 under further erosion a network of branch structures was formed on the top of the bulk film after two days of ageing figs 4b and h the formed branch network layer was ca 150 μm thick fig 4j the bottom part of the spherical holes whose borders were marked with dashed lines was recognized fig 4j and the branch structure was precisely located in the walls of adjacent holes the ridges this indicates that the branch structure was formed due to the erosion of ridges upon further ageing once the holes ridges morphology was formed on the surface the enzymatic hydrolysis eroded the ridges not only from top to bottom but also from side to side as illustrated in fig 4l as the ridge s width was much smaller than its height the erosion from the side penetrated the ridge more easily than that from the top as illustrated in fig 4l in addition owing to the uneven superficial erosion rate of enzymatic hydrolysis many cavities were formed within the ridges across their side surface figs 4j and k which eventually led to the formation of the observed branch structures the connecting part between the branch structures and bulk film was very thin and fragile figs 4j and k upon further ageing the thin connecting part was completely eroded which resulted in the detachment of the branches from the film as illustrated in fig 4l and the release of the fragments with a branch like shape into the buffer refer to the large ones observed in fig 2 moreover the branches had an uneven cross sectional area figs 4h and i and their thinner parts were likely to be fully eroded earlier than their thicker parts upon further ageing leading to the fragmentation within the branches and the release of the small microplastics observed in fig 2 most branches were detached from the film after 4 days of ageing leaving only the bottom part of the hole ridge structure on the film surface figs 4c and s1 besides many small through holes were observed in the thinned film suggesting that the erosion had penetrated the film from top to down which eventually caused the fragmentation of the bulk film and further release of microplastics fig 1a under further ageing the film became very thin and the through holes became larger and more leading to the formation of another type of branch structure fig 4d the branches observed in the upper part of fig 4d were about to fragment leading to further release of microplastics 3 3 physicochemical properties of aged pcl films the intensity of the main characteristic ir bands of pcl fig 5 a e g the asymmetric coc stretching band at 1240 cm 1 and c o and c c stretching modes in the amorphous phase at 1162 cm 1 khatiwala et al 2008 decreased with increasing ageing time due to the cleavage of ester groups during the enzymatic hydrolysis besides the aged samples displayed a new wider shoulder at 3500 3100 cm 1 attributed to the hydroxyl group of carboxylic acid and alcohol the ir spectra of the aged pcl films also showed an extra shoulder at 1650 cm 1 near their main carbonyl band at 1720 cm 1 the appearance of both the hydroxyl groups and new types of carbonyl groups revealed the formation of carboxylic acids during the enzymatic hydrolysis of pcl the migration of the hydrolysis products i e carboxylic acids into the buffer accounted for the decrease in the buffer ph fig 1d the reference sample showed similar changes in the ir spectrum with the ones aged in enzymes indicating the occurrence of also non enzymatic hydrolysis of pcl during the ageing the weight averaged molecular weight m w was 307 kda for pristine pcl and decreased to ca 240 kda after 1 day of ageing remaining unchanged at 260 kda upon further ageing fig 5b since enzymatic hydrolysis only occurred in the surface layer and the inner part of the sample remained unaffected the molecular weight of the enzymatically hydrolysed sample depends on the hydrolysis time and the ratio of the surface layer to the bulk part of samples noting that the reference sample had a reduced m w 270 kda the non enzymatic hydrolysis also partially accounted for the reduced molecular weight of the aged samples in addition small peaks in the lower molecular weight range ca 600 da were observed for the pristine pcl film fig 5b which was assigned to residual ester oligomers from the polymerization the increase in intensity during ageing of the low molecular weight species with a peak at 1380 da indicated that oligomers were formed from to hydrolysis of the film the unaged pcl sample had a single melting peak at 60 c fig 5c after one day of ageing a new small melting shoulder appeared at 51 c which shifted towards higher temperature with increasing ageing time it is known that when crystallizable polymers are annealed aged a new melting peak often appears ca 10 c above the annealing temperature due to the formation of new thin crystals wei et al 2017 the primary melting peak was also higher in the aged samples highest in the 6 day reference sample than in the unaged sample indicating an annealing induced thickening of the main larger crystals despite the annealing effects the crystallinity of the pcl samples was unchanged during the first 3 days of ageing and increased to 44 from 40 after 4 days of ageing the slight change in the crystallinity was probably due to the surface erosion process where the bulk part of the materials remains intact by enzymatic hydrolysis laycock et al 2017 notable is that the reference sample did not experience the same increase in crystallinity despite the crystal thickening 4 conclusion this study demonstrated that a considerably large number of microplastic particles were generated during the enzymatic hydrolysis of biodegradable polyesters under biodegradation the number of formed microplastics is very high up to one million from the complete biodegradation of 0 1 g pcl the polymer underwent a surface erosion process during the enzymatic hydrolysis and the erosion speed was heterogeneous across the film surface leading to a rough and undulating surface with ridge branch and rod shaped micro protruding structures the consequent detachment and fragmentation of these micro sized protruding structures during further hydrolysis caused the release of microplastics to the surroundings when the eroded sample became very thin the fragmentation of the bulk sample occurred leading to further microplastic release the molecular weight of the polymer and the ph of the liquid decreased during the experiment the latter was caused by the formation of hydrolysis products such as acidic monomers and oligomers the results reveal the notable risk of microplastic pollution from biodegradable plastics declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

environmental economic and social challenges banks et al 2018 foley et al 2011 nearly one third of produced food is lost or discarded worldwide about 1 3 billion tonnes annually occupying about 44 of total solid waste worldwide fao 2015 kaza et al 2018 moreover population growth and diet shifts are projected to stimulate a substantial increase in global food demand by 60 to 110 between 2005 and 2050 hiç et al 2016 tilman et al 2011 without adequate effective precaution this would further aggravate fw problems weaken food security and impact the total environment to this end achieving sustainability in fw management is of high importance in the efforts to bolster public health resource availability and ecological benefit shafiee jood and cai 2016 zan et al 2020c currently there are various technologies available for fw treatment in the solid waste stream including landfill incineration composting and anaerobic digestion kiran et al 2014 ma and liu 2019 the long standing concept of managing fw with other solid waste results in the landfilling and incineration as the dominant treatment means kaza et al 2018 however besides the conventional treatment such as landfilling mixed with other solid waste an integrated process is deemed necessary for sustainable fw management involving the concurrent recovery of resources and energy ma and liu 2019 on the other hand advances in wastewater treatment have been anticipated to meet the needs for a more sustainable society by improving the potential of energy use and resource recovery in sewage management van loosdrecht and brdjanovic 2014 biological wastewater treatment allows for closing cycles and reuse of water chemicals and energy grant et al 2012 olsson 2015 taking advantage of the existing wastewater treatment system diverting fw from the solid waste stream to wastewater stream is promising in improving treatment efficiency deriving economic benefits and abating environmental impact kim et al 2019 maalouf and el fadel 2017 zan et al 2020c however integration of fw with wastewater management could potentially impact both local solid waste and wastewater systems to some extent regarding the collection transportation treatment and disposal in this context this paper aims to offer a critical review and comprehensive analysis of the impacts of diverting fw on solid waste and wastewater streams this paper initially outlines the basic principle of fw diversion and the current status of application globally subsequently this paper reviews the potential impacts of fw diversion discusses the challenges and opportunities and provides multiple perspectives for implementing fw diversion and its contribution to sustainable fw management 2 status quo of concepts for diverting food waste from households to wastewater treatment the diversion of fw into the sewer system and wwtps is achieved by the kitchen food waste disposers fwds as illustrated in fig 1 a fwd is a device installed under the kitchen sink that grinds the fw into fine particles at source and releases the resultant slurry into the sewer system to be collected and co treated with municipal wastewater at the wwtps kim et al 2019 thomas 2011 fwds are widely used in many countries such as the us canada the uk australia new zealand and japan iacovidou et al 2012a the united states has the highest penetration rate of fwds with at least one installed in up to 50 of households the use of fwds mainly targets fw from households a major sector accounting for 48 67 of total fw generation in many megacities table 1 reduction of household fw at source is favored by assessing the biophysical environmental and economic indicators philippidis et al 2019 this is because household fw is notoriously difficult to separate collect and transport these difficulties are directly related to the demographic factors e g gender age type of dwelling and socioeconomic background economic incentives e g weight based taxes on residual waste personal habits and social norms and environmental awareness aschemann witzel et al 2019 berglund 2006 bernstad 2014 fami et al 2019 schmidt 2016 vicente and reis 2008 given the intractable process employing fwds technology is effective to divert household fw at source the use of fwds enables diverting a considerable fraction of organic waste away from the solid waste stream to the wwtps however due to its uncertain impacts its practical application has been a controversial issue for decades battistoni et al 2007 kim et al 2019 maalouf and el fadel 2017 nyepd 1997 zan et al 2020a this paper targeted all related studies that considered diverting food waste to the wastewater treatment system it includes both experimental and model based investigations from lab pilot and full scale studies a literature search was carried out to spot relevant studies peer review original papers using both the scopus and web of science databases with the keywords including food waste disposer food waste and sewer subsequently the searching results from the databases were compared and checked to combine as a reviewed list in total there are 76 papers published between 2010 and 2020 in the recent ten years i e 2011 2020 there is an increasing trend of related papers published suggesting a growing focus on the co management of food waste and wastewater in addition the top five countries in terms of published papers are china 19 the us 16 the uk 13 sweden 8 and south korea 5 as above mentioned the us and the uk have adopted the use of fwds policy while china is now seeking alternatives to effectively manage its food waste and wastewater the reviewed studies cover a wide range of food waste diversion impacts on solid waste and wastewater systems from the aspects of energy economy environment and society 3 comprehensive impacts of food waste diversion 3 1 solid waste management the diversion of fw can result in many benefits in municipal solid waste management maalouf and el fadel 2017 zan et al 2018 the most direct benefit is the diversion of fw away from the municipal solid waste treatment such as landfills and incineration basic information of fw generation and treatment methods in different megacities is summarized in table 1 fw in many cities is mainly disposed of in landfills and incineration iqbal et al 2020b besides the percentage of fw in total solid waste varies from location to location with the range of 18 to 60 which attributes to different strategies for solid waste management table 1 fw from households accounting for a large proportion of total fw is normally considered for diversion to wastewater stream using fwds for landfills a decrease of 7 to 43 in the amount of fw destined for landfills is expected when the fwd installation rate ranged from 25 to 75 marashlian and el fadel 2005 zan et al 2018 in the anglian region of the uk the diversion of fw from the landfill to the sewer could cause a significant reduction of 12 81 and 94 in landfilled fw for different scenarios with the use of fwds iacovidou et al 2012b in sweden a case study involving 100 apartments housing 211 residents suggested that the amount of fw sent to landfills dropped by 8 with a part of households using fwds iacovidou et al 2012a besides up to 0 26 million and 0 88 million tonnes of household fw in hong kong could be diverted away from landfills annually through the application of fwds in the short and long terms i e 30 and 100 of fwds penetration rates since hong kong solely relies on the landfills for household fw treatment zan et al 2018 if the solid waste is incinerated for electricity generation the diversion of fw may also affect the performance the heating values of solid waste in hong kong can be improved by 19 due to the reduced moisture content which facilitates the conversion efficiency for electricity generation iqbal et al 2019 zan et al 2020c although the use of fwds reduces the quantity of solid waste for incineration and decreases electricity generation the savings in collection and transportation can increase the overall net profit by 5 zan et al 2020c moreover the diversion of fw would reduce the possibility of dioxin production from the incineration kiran et al 2014 in aarhus city of denmark energy recovery from the wwtps after the use of fwds was estimated to be slightly higher 0 3 in electricity generation and lower 2 in heat production than the incineration thomsen et al 2018 therefore the diversion of fw could relieve the burden of the municipal solid waste treatment which could further help eliminate the negative environmental impacts from the disposal of waste in landfills or incineration reduce energy use and greenhouse gas ghg emission from the transportation of waste and minimize disease causing vectors maalouf and el fadel 2017 yang et al 2010 it was estimated that on per tonne basis the fw diversion and co treatment with wastewater produced almost 87 less ghg emissions compared to the landfilling scenario in hong kong iqbal et al 2020a 3 2 sewer system the impacts of the diversion of fw on the sewer system have been a controversial issue for decades with respect to the deposition of solids the formation of fats oils and grease fog and sulfide production the high loadings of suspended solids from the ground fw can cause possible deposition in the sewer pipeline bolzonella et al 2003 by using different fwd models with different composition the particle sizes of ground fw could range from 0 76 to 0 85 mm on average zan et al 2018 over 50 lower than 0 84 mm bolzonella et al 2003 over 80 lower than 1 mm bernstad et al 2013 over 90 lower than 0 45 mm moñino et al 2016 or as high as 2 to 4 mm for 50 69 of total solids channon et al 2013 a theoretical calculation indicates that ground fw cannot settle in a sewer that has a design flow velocity of 0 6 m s wu et al 2016 this was also confirmed by a pilot scale test that the suspended solids in the slurry of fw may not settle in the pipe in a gravity sewer with a water velocity of 0 1 0 3 m s zan et al 2019 the fw added can be decomposed in the sewer system through the mediation of sewer biofilms a 4 hour laboratory test suggested that the transformation of fw in the sewer reactor could cause an increase in the substrate level through the hydrolysis and conversion of the macromolecular organics into small organics zan et al 2020a the extra loading of fog from fw is capable of solidifying and attaching to pipes causing sewer blockages brooksbank et al 2007 the content of fog from the effluent of the fwd could contribute to up to 40 by weight of dry solid bernstad et al 2013 the engineering feasibility reports suggested that large scale implementation of fwds could increase the possibility of pipe blockage by fog causing an increase in sewer maintenance expenditure nyepd 1997 perriam 2007 however a clear relationship between the installation rate of fwds fog formation from fw and the possibility of sewer blockage has not been established and needs further investigation the build up of sulfide and methane is a major concern in sewer management hvitved jacobsen et al 2013 the impacts of the diversion of fw on sewer process have not received adequate attention for a long time recent studies reveal that the diversion of fw may enhance the production and emission of sulfide and methane from the sewer system zan et al 2020b 2019 moreover the changes in concentrations of fw and or sulfate can affect the production and emission of hydrogen sulfide and methane from the pressure sewers fig 2 in a pilot scale gravity sewer the fw addition resulted in a greater thickness and increased dry density and more extracellular polymeric substance eps in sewer biofilm zan et al 2019 the denser and thicker biofilm formed with fw addition limited oxygen diffusion and enlarged the biofilm anaerobic zone which facilitated an increased population of sulfate reducing bacteria srb and enhanced the sulfide production potential in the gravity sewer in a lab scale sewer system simulating the pressure sewers the diversion of fw could boost the methane production by up to 60 whereas the impacts on sulfide production relied on the sulfate concentration present in sewage zan et al 2021 2020b in depth investigations indicated that the addition of fw substantially promoted the accumulation of methanogens in sewer biofilms and altered the spatial distributions of srb and methanogens zan et al 2020b furthermore the increases in either quantity of diverted fw or hydraulic retention time would enhance sulfide and methane production in sewers rendering severe environmental hygiene and physical risks from sewers zan et al 2020b to this end more research is still required to advance the knowledge about the impacts of the diversion of fw in real sewers 3 3 wastewater treatment plants 3 3 1 flow rate the consequences of using fwds on the operation of wwtps vary from location to location which could be attributed to the treatment capacity and adopted processes the first concern is the increased flow to the wwtps due to the consumption of water at source to flush fw slurry down the drain it remains difficult to accurately determine the actual water consumption from the use of fwds due to differing habits across households it was suggested that 1 kg of fw can be flushed with around 10 l of tap water by using the fwd kim et al 2015 zan et al 2018 in hong kong the additional water consumption for diverting fw is about 3 2 l capita day on the basis of a 100 penetration rate occupying only 2 of the current water consumption 160 l capita day hkdsd 2018 other estimations range from 1 to 7 l capita day representing 0 3 to 4 of the total water consumption of an average individual each day with different penetration rates bolzonella et al 2003 marashlian and el fadel 2005 a full scale investigation showed an insignificant changes in flow rate of wwtps after the fwds operation in both dry and wet weather periods battistoni et al 2007 this implies the impact of the diversion of fw on water demand is not too serious however the use of fwds may be crucial for water scarce regions where annual water supplies drop below 500 m3 capita unfao 2012 and it is not recommended for fw diversion due to the limited water resource rosenwinkel and wendler 2001 3 3 2 organic and nutrient removal performance the most critical concern received worldwide is the impact of the diversion of fw on the treatment performance of wwtps which have attracted tremendous attention in both research and practice this can directly affect the performance energy consumption and operational cost of the wwtps many studies from lab scale to full scale investigations or plant wide modelling have been devoted to evaluating the impacts of the diversion of fw on wastewater treatment with different processes as summarized in table 2 the wwtps receiving ground fw with different processes are shown in fig 3 the diversion of fw to wastewater treatment can be achieved either by source separation i e septic tanks for subsequent treatment or by sewer collection for downstream wastewater treatment bernstad et al 2013 durán et al 2018 hu et al 2020 lin et al 2019 moñino et al 2017 zamorano lópez et al 2018 fw concentration in wastewater or fw to sewage ratio could range from 0 2 to 200 g l by using different estimating methods table 2 the source separation of fw slurry relies on a decentralized settling tank or a septic tank fig 3a in which the settled sludge is transported for the ad system and or the tank effluent flows to sewers davidsson et al 2017 saraiva et al 2016 in general the diversion of fw for centralized treatment could increase solid content and cod concentration in wastewater while insignificant impacts on nitrogen and phosphorus were identified fig 3b this could be attributed to the high ratios of carbon nitrogen and carbon phosphorus in fw fisgativa et al 2016 kim et al 2015 zan et al 2018 extra loading of organics in fw would contribute to the enhancement of biological nutrient removal and reduce chemical consumption kim et al 2015 zan et al 2018 moreover full scale investigations mainly rely on the modelling of different processes e g conventional activated sludge cas modified ludzack ettinger mle bardenpho process and anaerobic anoxic aerobic a2o process becker et al 2017 iqbal et al 2020a kim et al 2019 lijó et al 2017 normally biological nutrient removal processes e g mle a2o and bardenpho could benefit from the diversion of fw in which nitrogen and phosphorus removal can be enhanced to secure a better effluent quality kim et al 2019 lijó et al 2017 sankai et al 1997 however it was reported that the high loading of the pollutants from the use of fwds may deteriorate the performance of wastewater treatment which required upgraded capacity and processes of the wwtps nyepd 1997 wainberg and nielssen 2000 it still remains unclear about the critical factors that determine the correlation between the diversion of fw and process performance in wwtps a plant wide steady state modelling case study from hong kong revealed that fw addition improved the cod to nitrogen ratio in influent wastewater subsequently improving the denitrification performance of the mle system and reducing the sludge age the change in effluent concentrations was insignificant for tn and tp but was doubled for cod yet it was below the local discharge standard in addition the final sludge production was increased by about 33 and the wwtp s energy recovery was improved by 80 to 400 with the diversion of fw iqbal et al 2020a emerging treatment processes such as anaerobic membrane bioreactor anmbr and high rate activated sludge with anaerobic digestion hras ad process increasingly attracted scholarly attention due to their high energy recovery potential bernstad et al 2013 durán et al 2018 hu et al 2020 moñino et al 2017 2016 pretel et al 2016 zamorano lópez et al 2018 compared with the conventional processes the removal of nitrogen and phosphorus was not affected or even deteriorated when adopting anmbr and hras durán et al 2018 guven et al 2019b kim et al 2019 lijó et al 2017 moñino et al 2017 the application of hras and anmbr process aims at improving energy recovery from the ground fw with wastewater as shown in fig 3b hras process is capable of maximizing sludge production with a short retention time to minimize biological oxidation jimenez et al 2015 it is thus promising to combine with the ad process to improve energy recovery from the sludge especially with ground fw becker et al 2017 guven et al 2019b however both hras and anmbr processes are still in their infancy which requires more studies and applications on a large scale to verify their application in main stream wastewater treatment and their impacts of the diversion of fw 3 3 3 sludge production in the biological wwtps sewage sludge can be generated from primary treatment as primary sludge and biological treatment as waste activated sludge in the primary treatment 75 90 of solids and 55 80 of cod in ground fw can be removed and settled out as primary sludge iacovidou et al 2012a karrman et al 2001 shpiner 1997 zan et al 2020c in the secondary treatment i e biological treatment cod remained could be converted through the bioprocess to biomass which contributes to waste activated sludge production ekama 2009 given the majority of ground fw deposited in the primary sedimentation tank the diversion of fw induces a much higher primary sludge production than waste activated sludge production zan et al 2020c with the penetration rate of 10 it was estimated that the production of primary and secondary sludge could increase by up to 11 and 2 respectively the produced primary and secondary sludge is then mixed for sludge digestion in ad system after the ad process the digested sludge is dewatered for final disposal fig 1 the increases in digested sludge production could range from 3 to 70 with the use of fwds battistoni et al 2007 galil and shpiner 2001 iacovidou et al 2012a kim et al 2019 zan et al 2020c this can be attributed to the changes in the penetration rates and the treatment process adopted in the wwtps kim et al 2019 zan et al 2020c regarding the impact on sludge production the capacity of sludge handling in wwtps should be given special attention for diverting fw to wastewater treatment 3 3 4 energy recovery conventionally the ad process adopted in the biological wwtps can convert organic matters in sludge into bioenergy in the form of methane and reduce sludge volume for sludge stabilization as illustrated in fig 3 henze et al 2008 the generated methane can be further utilized for electricity generation through the combined heat and power chp system figs 1 and 2 in this context the diversion of fw could offset the consumption of fossil fuels as well as the additional operational cost of wwtps from the extra loading kim et al 2019 maalouf and el fadel 2017 the potential for energy recovery from the diversion of fw may not only rely on the total amounts i e fwds penetration rates but also be affected by local fw composition i e meat fruits vegetables and starchy food and characteristics i e organic solids protein carbohydrates and lipid given the increased sludge production from primary and secondary treatment improved methane production from the ad process could be anticipated as reported ranging from 13 to 193 galil and shpiner 2001 guven et al 2019b zamorano lópez et al 2018 zan et al 2018 this would potentially boost electricity generation and heat recovery from the chp system recent focuses of handling fw in wwtps have been shifted to anmbr and hras ad process fig 3b which are capable of maximizing methane production from the co treatment of ground fw and wastewater becker et al 2017 durán et al 2018 guven et al 2019b moñino et al 2017 2016 zamorano lópez et al 2018 significant increases in methane production could be identified by 190 388 from the co treatment of fw and wastewater in anmbr durán et al 2018 moñino et al 2017 zamorano lópez et al 2018 the diversion of fw improves the biodegradability of the substrate i e fw with wastewater together with a long srt durán et al 2018 in the hras process short retention time could increase the concentrations of organic matter and sludge production which is preferable for enhancing methane production from the ad process meerburg et al 2015 the excess sludge from the hras system receiving fw and wastewater could enhance methane production by 51 from the ad process guven et al 2019a however the increase in sludge production could impact the energy demand for thickening dewatering and digester energy requirement therefore the decision should be made after analysing the net energy balance of the wwtp 3 4 environmental benefits knowledge of environmental impacts from fw diversion is important to evaluate the contribution to global warming potential gwp and also to facilitate the policy making regarding the implementation of fwds this is mainly achieved by carrying out the life cycle assessment lca of different treatment scenarios the related studies are listed in table 3 the focuses of such lca studies have been shifted gradually from the solid waste stream to the wastewater stream conventionally fw in the municipal solid waste is disposed into landfills or treated by incineration composting and or anaerobic digestion edwards et al 2018 kim et al 2011 thomsen et al 2018 with the use of fwds the estimated greenhouse gas ghg generation can be reduced by 24 to 88 compared with conventional scenarios edwards et al 2018 guven et al 2019c iqbal et al 2020a kim et al 2011 maalouf and el fadel 2018 thomsen et al 2018 the better environmental performance of fw diversion is also attributed to the mitigation of marine eutrophication and ecotoxicity compared with landfill guven et al 2019c and the lower potential for ozone layer depletion eutrophication and photochemical oxidation than composting edwards et al 2018 and lower human toxicity than incineration thomsen et al 2018 however the ad system for treating fw could excel the use of fwds with respect to the economic environmental and resource efficiency since the use of fwds results in the loss of organics in sewer and wastewater treatment edwards et al 2018 thomsen et al 2018 yet as aforementioned source separation of fw is the underlying factor limiting the productivity of a centralized ad system and therefore is mainly dependant on fw from commercial sources on the other hand the environmental impacts of fw diversion on wastewater management have attracted increasing attention regarding the current treatment configurations and process upgrading in the wastewater stream the diversion of fw could either preliminarily be separated by the settling tank or directly flow to the wwtps fig 3 although decentralized preliminary treatment may increase energy recovery potential the overall economic and environmental benefits are lower than the centralized wastewater treatment saraiva et al 2016 yi and yoo 2014 in the wwtps anmbr and hras coupled with different subsequent processes have been widely considered to maximize energy recovery from fw diversion becker et al 2017 guven et al 2018 compared with the cas process anmbr may cause the highest gwp due to the effluent methane emission whereas the hras with the ad system has the lowest gwp becker et al 2017 more importantly the increase in fw diversion can linearly decrease the gwp of anmbr and hras suggesting a high sensitivity of treatment processes to the quantity of fw diverted to the wwtps besides the benefits of anmbr could be promising regarding acidification eutrophication smog and respiratory effects becker et al 2017 adding fw to the hras process could facilitate the environmental benefits in terms of climate change acidification ecotoxicity fossil depletion guven et al 2018 however it should be noted that sludge transport distance could be a key factor affecting the environmental performance of the hras process regarding ecotoxicity smog and non carcinogens becker et al 2017 4 challenges and opportunities 4 1 unified definitions for evaluating the impacts of food waste diversion although many efforts have been put in exploring the possibility of fw diversion it still lacks a unified definition to facilitate better understandings about the findings and developments in the field fig 4 first of all the quantity of fw diverted is crucial for determining the impacts on solid waste and wastewater treatment which directly correlates with the use of fwds this is normally defined as penetration penetration rate or penetration factor battistoni et al 2007 iacovidou et al 2012b kim et al 2019 zan et al 2018 besides given that fwds are installed in the kitchen sink of the households saraiva et al 2016 thomas 2011 the diversion of fw refers to fw generated from the households unless a specific statement in this study we propose to use the penetration rate as a standard term for the use of fwds in which a certain penetration rate indicates the corresponding proportion of total household fw diverted from the solid waste stream to the wastewater stream secondly fw concentration in sewage or fw to sewage ratio g l is highly dependant on the quantities of fw diverted and wastewater flow rate which can significantly affect the operation of wwtps zan et al 2020c one critical issue is to clarify the variation in fw concentration within 24 h since the daily flow rate varies with the usage of water the variation in fw concentration may relate to the time when ground fw is discharged into the sewers which may incur a peak concentration in sewage however such information remains unclear and therefore we suggest that such variation in the fw to sewage ratio by fw concentration or wastewater flow rate should get special attention for impact assessment and be tested by performing sensitivity analysis besides implementing fw diversion is of significant importance to frame holistic urban management the overall impacts of fw diversion require a comprehensive assessment on a city scale to plan effective implementation to date the penetration rates are around 50 in the us 30 in new zealand 12 in australia 10 in canada and 5 in the u k iacovidou et al 2012a it is clear that the general penetration rates range at 5 30 in most areas whereas it can reach up to 50 in the us with a long history in the context of fwds application experience we suggest categorizing the impacts of fw diversion with fwds installation as two stages i e in short term 0 30 and long term 30 100 the proposed categorization is meaningful for city scale policy making to formulate specific short and long term plans however the proposed categorization is not changing over time but with the fwds penetration rates this may be attributed to many factors such as the culture dietary habits fwds acceptance and policies which results in an unclear relationship between the penetration rates with time 4 2 sewer network assessment for receiving ground food waste assessing the type of local sewer network is a prerequisite for determining the applicability of fw diversion fig 4 normally sewers can be classified as separate sewers and combined sewers by the type of sewage collected or gravity sewers and pressure sewers by mode of sewage conveyance hvitved jacobsen et al 2013 different combinations of sewers are established by the budget topography and scale which creates great uncertainty of the complex sewer network the slope of gravity sewers can maintain a self cleaning velocity which varies with various design criteria in this context it is necessary to scrutinize the local sewer conditions to analyse the possibility of using fwds the diameter of the drainpipe is of significance since flushing ground fw may increase the blockage potential of the drainpipe with a small diameter mattsson et al 2015 rosenwinkel and wendler 2001 suggested three criteria for the sewer network assessment that must be fulfilled to receive ground fw i separate sewer system ii a good condition with no fractures no leakage and sedimentations and iii the minimal slope of gravity sewer higher than 0 02 before the introduction of fwds in a territory the local sewer system requires a thorough inspection to satisfy these essential preconditions and to facilitate the decision making of the suitability of sewers receiving ground fw 4 3 emerging technologies for efficiently handling ground food waste different wastewater treatment technologies have been extensively researched to enhance the recovery of energy and resources from fw and sewage pham et al 2015 given the diversion of fw to wastewater treatment emerging technologies in wwtps require adequate investigations to verify their capability for not only efficiently handling the additional loadings but also sustaining the energy resource recovery potential the concepts behind for co treating wastewater with fw addition can be either in situ energy generation or organics enrichment for ex situ treatment fig 4 several studies as shown in table 2 have already taken efforts to achieve such purposes by using anmbr and hras processes for the co treatment guven et al 2019b moñino et al 2017 another option involving microbial electrochemical cells mecs may benefit from fw diversion mecs are capable of generating electrical power directly in the mode of microbial fuel cells or producing energy rich chemicals such as hydrogen gas in microbial electrolysis cells li et al 2014 the products of mecs e g electricity or hydrogen gas are more valuable and readily used than methane li et al 2015 however mecs may process a slow reaction for the initial break up of particulates which especially requires an optimized operation for wastewater containing ground fw besides the development of granular sludge technology offers a compact and cost effective wastewater treatment adav et al 2008 the granular sludge process employs unique structure biofilms with different functional microbial groups which extends the ability for treating high strength organic wastewaters zhao et al 2019 moreover recent research reveals the potential of recovering valuable chemicals from the eps of granular sludge felz et al 2020 kim et al 2020 the diversion of fw could increase the eps content in biofilms zan et al 2019 thus improving the potential of resource recovery from granular sludge in wwtps therefore there is a need for further investigation of employing granular sludge technology for not only treating fw but also recovering valuable resources 4 4 scale up studies on food waste diversion the diversion of fw affects both solid and wastewater streams a comprehensive evaluation thus includes both streams from stem to stern which provides fundamental information for policy makings fig 4 previous studies are mostly carried out at lab and pilot scale with the focus on a specific section either in solid waste management or wastewater treatment the overall impacts of fw diversion have been evaluated in case studies of the greater beirut area and hong kong marashlian and el fadel 2005 zan et al 2020c which relied on model based evaluations and lacked field verifications besides full scale studies on wastewater treatment in gagliole of italy and surahammar of sweden have been reported by battistoni et al 2007 and evans et al 2010 they installed fwds in households and evaluated the impacts on sewers and the operation of wwtps given the impacts on the wwtps the diversion of fw may call for an upgrading of the existing processes to tackle the issues result from the extra loadings and optimize the operation of the wwtps the investigation has been trailed from the lca perspective in a turkish context with site specific data guven et al 2018 however it should be noted that the results obtained in these studies varied from location to location due to the site specific co0nditions more importantly the studies of the use of fwds at a large scale are still limited and adequate information is needed to advance knowledge about the overall impacts on local solid waste and wastewater systems 4 5 policy drivers for implementing food waste diversion policies such as legislative requirements and the regulations of local municipalities are essential to whether to implement the use of fwds for fw diversion or not channon et al 2013 iacovidou et al 2012b maalouf and el fadel 2017 the use of fwds as a waste management option varies widely with the uncertainty regarding their potential benefits iacovidou et al 2012b maalouf and el fadel 2017 mtp 2008 concerns about the extra loading on the sewer network and the operation of local wwtps usually play a crucial role in decisions on whether to restrict or permit implementation the use of fwds in the us is highly encouraged even mandated in certain areas legislation and policies about the diversion of fw vary amongst the countries in the european union with factors such as environmental awareness the capacity of wwtps sludge treatment utilization of biogas and cultural attitudes toward technological developments all playing a role thomsen et al 2018 furthermore the ambiguity for the implementation is attributed to many area specific factors such as household practices adopted techniques for solid waste treatment usage and types of water resources the condition of sewerage system and treatment processes and the economic feasibility these factors must be taken into account before deciding a fwds policy for the diversion of fw as a wide scale waste management option to this end it is necessary to assess both the negative and positive impacts of fw diversion on local solid waste and wastewater management systems policy intervention could eventually determine to regulate the use of fwds either promoting them as an alternative option or banning them as a threat to the sewerage system and wastewater treatment hence a comprehensive assessment would significantly facilitate a multi faceted policy system for sustainable fw management 5 perspectives tackling fw issue is of high priority for achieving sustainable waste management to this end establishing fw management hierarchies is substantial by ranking a set of priorities to reduce pressure on natural systems as illustrated in fig 5 this would achieve efficient resource utilization and alleviate environmental impacts redlingshöfer et al 2020 one feasible and critical solution for fulfilling the hierarchy is technologies and systemic innovation which could significantly accelerate progress towards achieving fw management sustainability herrero et al 2020 this study reviewed a potentially viable approach of diverting fw from the solid waste stream to wastewater stream introducing fwds technology enables the diversion of fw especially from households this could facilitate the actions of energy resource recovery and waste to energy treatment and initiate the nexus of fw wastewater and energy resource through integrated fw and wastewater management fig 5 harvesting energy and recovering resources from either wastewater or fw have stimulated tremendous vitality in technology and research for sustainable wastewater and solid waste management kiran et al 2014 li et al 2015 ma and liu 2019 van loosdrecht and brdjanovic 2014 the diversion of fw to wastewater treatment can bridge the co management of fw and wastewater towards a lower environmental impact and an efficient energy resource recovery depending on the level of socio economic development of a country or region and other institutional and political constraints the application of fwds and the mix of approaches could vary widely herrero et al 2020 the successful experiences from other regions demonstrate the feasibility of using fwds but the application requires adequate assessment for optimizing wastewater and fw management sustainability to be specific a mix of different technologies fits a particular city and this requires special attention paid to the local fw characteristics the treatment framework and the sewer system with subsequent wastewater treatment for instance local solid waste should be characterized for designing a suitable treatment system that consists of several approaches e g landfilling incineration composting anaerobic digestion and fwds subsequently the existing fw system can be upgraded to a flexible and advanced system in the context of sustainability economic efficiency and environmental friendliness moreover it is also of significance to evaluate the local sewer system wastewater characteristics capacity of wwtps and treatment processes to verify the possibility of long term and large scale use of fwds meanwhile a life cycle assessment should be carried out based on local experimental and actual data to assess the impacts of fwds on the environment the economy and energy consumption to this end the use of fwds should be tested at different scales to determine the way forward the use of fwds can lead to various social outcomes due to the high relevance of fw to culture socio demographic differences and policy making thyberg and tonjes 2016 cities with the needs for reducing the burden on solid waste treatment could benefit from the use of fwds the use of fwds can play a role in such policy for household fw separation and treatment also it reduces the cost nuisance by road traffic as well as odour and hygiene issues involved in fw separation collection and transportation this study discussed that the diversion of fw may incur unexpected outcomes due to area specific characteristics hence it is still unable to reach a certain conclusion about whether the benefits from fw diversion can offset its cost in solid waste and wastewater streams or whether the pros of using fwds truly outweigh the cons 6 conclusions this paper has comprehensively reviewed the principal application and impacts of fw diversion from the solid waste stream to the wastewater stream although there are worldwide experiences of the use of fwds it still lacks a certain conclusion about the impacts on both solid waste and wastewater systems regarding the collection treatment and disposal challenges and opportunities of fw diversion were identified from five aspects 1 unified definitions in the field for a better understanding of evaluating the impacts of fw diversion 2 sewer network assessment to verify its qualification for receiving ground fw 3 emerging technologies in wwtps for efficiently handling ground fw with wastewater 4 scale up studies for the feasibility of diverting fw to wastewater treatment system and 5 policy drivers for implementing fw diversion this review suggests that the diversion of fw can pose a vital influence on fw management s sustainability and play a key role in the nexus of fw wastewater and energy resource derived from the fw management hierarchy however the area specific characteristics are of high importance to determine the implementation of fw diversion a set of comprehensive local assessments are thus deemed necessary to verify the pros and cons of diverting fw from the solid waste stream to the wastewater stream declaration of competing

16327,sustainable food waste management is a global issue with high priority for improving food security and conserving natural resources and ecosystems diverting food waste from the solid waste stream to the wastewater stream is a promising way for food waste source separation collection treatment and disposal given the advances in wastewater treatment this integrated system has great potential for the concurrent recovery of water resource and energy to this end many efforts from lab scale to full scale studies have been devoted to evaluating the feasibility and associated impacts on both solid waste and wastewater systems this paper summarizes the current status of food waste diversion from the aspects of principle and application the impacts of food waste diversion on solid waste treatment sewer system wastewater treatment and environmental benefits have been comprehensively reviewed and analysed in the context of the critical review this paper further identified the challenges of food waste diversion in unified definitions of the field sewer network assessment emerging wastewater treatment technologies scale up studies and policy drivers perspectives on the contribution of food waste diversion to a food waste management hierarchy were discussed for initiating the nexus of food waste wastewater energy resource we conclude that food waste diversion could facilitate sustainable urban development but the area specific factors e g household practices water resource sewerage system condition and treatment techniques require adequate evaluations to

environmental economic and social challenges banks et al 2018 foley et al 2011 nearly one third of produced food is lost or discarded worldwide about 1 3 billion tonnes annually occupying about 44 of total solid waste worldwide fao 2015 kaza et al 2018 moreover population growth and diet shifts are projected to stimulate a substantial increase in global food demand by 60 to 110 between 2005 and 2050 hiç et al 2016 tilman et al 2011 without adequate effective precaution this would further aggravate fw problems weaken food security and impact the total environment to this end achieving sustainability in fw management is of high importance in the efforts to bolster public health resource availability and ecological benefit shafiee jood and cai 2016 zan et al 2020c currently there are various technologies available for fw treatment in the solid waste stream including landfill incineration composting and anaerobic digestion kiran et al 2014 ma and liu 2019 the long standing concept of managing fw with other solid waste results in the landfilling and incineration as the dominant treatment means kaza et al 2018 however besides the conventional treatment such as landfilling mixed with other solid waste an integrated process is deemed necessary for sustainable fw management involving the concurrent recovery of resources and energy ma and liu 2019 on the other hand advances in wastewater treatment have been anticipated to meet the needs for a more sustainable society by improving the potential of energy use and resource recovery in sewage management van loosdrecht and brdjanovic 2014 biological wastewater treatment allows for closing cycles and reuse of water chemicals and energy grant et al 2012 olsson 2015 taking advantage of the existing wastewater treatment system diverting fw from the solid waste stream to wastewater stream is promising in improving treatment efficiency deriving economic benefits and abating environmental impact kim et al 2019 maalouf and el fadel 2017 zan et al 2020c however integration of fw with wastewater management could potentially impact both local solid waste and wastewater systems to some extent regarding the collection transportation treatment and disposal in this context this paper aims to offer a critical review and comprehensive analysis of the impacts of diverting fw on solid waste and wastewater streams this paper initially outlines the basic principle of fw diversion and the current status of application globally subsequently this paper reviews the potential impacts of fw diversion discusses the challenges and opportunities and provides multiple perspectives for implementing fw diversion and its contribution to sustainable fw management 2 status quo of concepts for diverting food waste from households to wastewater treatment the diversion of fw into the sewer system and wwtps is achieved by the kitchen food waste disposers fwds as illustrated in fig 1 a fwd is a device installed under the kitchen sink that grinds the fw into fine particles at source and releases the resultant slurry into the sewer system to be collected and co treated with municipal wastewater at the wwtps kim et al 2019 thomas 2011 fwds are widely used in many countries such as the us canada the uk australia new zealand and japan iacovidou et al 2012a the united states has the highest penetration rate of fwds with at least one installed in up to 50 of households the use of fwds mainly targets fw from households a major sector accounting for 48 67 of total fw generation in many megacities table 1 reduction of household fw at source is favored by assessing the biophysical environmental and economic indicators philippidis et al 2019 this is because household fw is notoriously difficult to separate collect and transport these difficulties are directly related to the demographic factors e g gender age type of dwelling and socioeconomic background economic incentives e g weight based taxes on residual waste personal habits and social norms and environmental awareness aschemann witzel et al 2019 berglund 2006 bernstad 2014 fami et al 2019 schmidt 2016 vicente and reis 2008 given the intractable process employing fwds technology is effective to divert household fw at source the use of fwds enables diverting a considerable fraction of organic waste away from the solid waste stream to the wwtps however due to its uncertain impacts its practical application has been a controversial issue for decades battistoni et al 2007 kim et al 2019 maalouf and el fadel 2017 nyepd 1997 zan et al 2020a this paper targeted all related studies that considered diverting food waste to the wastewater treatment system it includes both experimental and model based investigations from lab pilot and full scale studies a literature search was carried out to spot relevant studies peer review original papers using both the scopus and web of science databases with the keywords including food waste disposer food waste and sewer subsequently the searching results from the databases were compared and checked to combine as a reviewed list in total there are 76 papers published between 2010 and 2020 in the recent ten years i e 2011 2020 there is an increasing trend of related papers published suggesting a growing focus on the co management of food waste and wastewater in addition the top five countries in terms of published papers are china 19 the us 16 the uk 13 sweden 8 and south korea 5 as above mentioned the us and the uk have adopted the use of fwds policy while china is now seeking alternatives to effectively manage its food waste and wastewater the reviewed studies cover a wide range of food waste diversion impacts on solid waste and wastewater systems from the aspects of energy economy environment and society 3 comprehensive impacts of food waste diversion 3 1 solid waste management the diversion of fw can result in many benefits in municipal solid waste management maalouf and el fadel 2017 zan et al 2018 the most direct benefit is the diversion of fw away from the municipal solid waste treatment such as landfills and incineration basic information of fw generation and treatment methods in different megacities is summarized in table 1 fw in many cities is mainly disposed of in landfills and incineration iqbal et al 2020b besides the percentage of fw in total solid waste varies from location to location with the range of 18 to 60 which attributes to different strategies for solid waste management table 1 fw from households accounting for a large proportion of total fw is normally considered for diversion to wastewater stream using fwds for landfills a decrease of 7 to 43 in the amount of fw destined for landfills is expected when the fwd installation rate ranged from 25 to 75 marashlian and el fadel 2005 zan et al 2018 in the anglian region of the uk the diversion of fw from the landfill to the sewer could cause a significant reduction of 12 81 and 94 in landfilled fw for different scenarios with the use of fwds iacovidou et al 2012b in sweden a case study involving 100 apartments housing 211 residents suggested that the amount of fw sent to landfills dropped by 8 with a part of households using fwds iacovidou et al 2012a besides up to 0 26 million and 0 88 million tonnes of household fw in hong kong could be diverted away from landfills annually through the application of fwds in the short and long terms i e 30 and 100 of fwds penetration rates since hong kong solely relies on the landfills for household fw treatment zan et al 2018 if the solid waste is incinerated for electricity generation the diversion of fw may also affect the performance the heating values of solid waste in hong kong can be improved by 19 due to the reduced moisture content which facilitates the conversion efficiency for electricity generation iqbal et al 2019 zan et al 2020c although the use of fwds reduces the quantity of solid waste for incineration and decreases electricity generation the savings in collection and transportation can increase the overall net profit by 5 zan et al 2020c moreover the diversion of fw would reduce the possibility of dioxin production from the incineration kiran et al 2014 in aarhus city of denmark energy recovery from the wwtps after the use of fwds was estimated to be slightly higher 0 3 in electricity generation and lower 2 in heat production than the incineration thomsen et al 2018 therefore the diversion of fw could relieve the burden of the municipal solid waste treatment which could further help eliminate the negative environmental impacts from the disposal of waste in landfills or incineration reduce energy use and greenhouse gas ghg emission from the transportation of waste and minimize disease causing vectors maalouf and el fadel 2017 yang et al 2010 it was estimated that on per tonne basis the fw diversion and co treatment with wastewater produced almost 87 less ghg emissions compared to the landfilling scenario in hong kong iqbal et al 2020a 3 2 sewer system the impacts of the diversion of fw on the sewer system have been a controversial issue for decades with respect to the deposition of solids the formation of fats oils and grease fog and sulfide production the high loadings of suspended solids from the ground fw can cause possible deposition in the sewer pipeline bolzonella et al 2003 by using different fwd models with different composition the particle sizes of ground fw could range from 0 76 to 0 85 mm on average zan et al 2018 over 50 lower than 0 84 mm bolzonella et al 2003 over 80 lower than 1 mm bernstad et al 2013 over 90 lower than 0 45 mm moñino et al 2016 or as high as 2 to 4 mm for 50 69 of total solids channon et al 2013 a theoretical calculation indicates that ground fw cannot settle in a sewer that has a design flow velocity of 0 6 m s wu et al 2016 this was also confirmed by a pilot scale test that the suspended solids in the slurry of fw may not settle in the pipe in a gravity sewer with a water velocity of 0 1 0 3 m s zan et al 2019 the fw added can be decomposed in the sewer system through the mediation of sewer biofilms a 4 hour laboratory test suggested that the transformation of fw in the sewer reactor could cause an increase in the substrate level through the hydrolysis and conversion of the macromolecular organics into small organics zan et al 2020a the extra loading of fog from fw is capable of solidifying and attaching to pipes causing sewer blockages brooksbank et al 2007 the content of fog from the effluent of the fwd could contribute to up to 40 by weight of dry solid bernstad et al 2013 the engineering feasibility reports suggested that large scale implementation of fwds could increase the possibility of pipe blockage by fog causing an increase in sewer maintenance expenditure nyepd 1997 perriam 2007 however a clear relationship between the installation rate of fwds fog formation from fw and the possibility of sewer blockage has not been established and needs further investigation the build up of sulfide and methane is a major concern in sewer management hvitved jacobsen et al 2013 the impacts of the diversion of fw on sewer process have not received adequate attention for a long time recent studies reveal that the diversion of fw may enhance the production and emission of sulfide and methane from the sewer system zan et al 2020b 2019 moreover the changes in concentrations of fw and or sulfate can affect the production and emission of hydrogen sulfide and methane from the pressure sewers fig 2 in a pilot scale gravity sewer the fw addition resulted in a greater thickness and increased dry density and more extracellular polymeric substance eps in sewer biofilm zan et al 2019 the denser and thicker biofilm formed with fw addition limited oxygen diffusion and enlarged the biofilm anaerobic zone which facilitated an increased population of sulfate reducing bacteria srb and enhanced the sulfide production potential in the gravity sewer in a lab scale sewer system simulating the pressure sewers the diversion of fw could boost the methane production by up to 60 whereas the impacts on sulfide production relied on the sulfate concentration present in sewage zan et al 2021 2020b in depth investigations indicated that the addition of fw substantially promoted the accumulation of methanogens in sewer biofilms and altered the spatial distributions of srb and methanogens zan et al 2020b furthermore the increases in either quantity of diverted fw or hydraulic retention time would enhance sulfide and methane production in sewers rendering severe environmental hygiene and physical risks from sewers zan et al 2020b to this end more research is still required to advance the knowledge about the impacts of the diversion of fw in real sewers 3 3 wastewater treatment plants 3 3 1 flow rate the consequences of using fwds on the operation of wwtps vary from location to location which could be attributed to the treatment capacity and adopted processes the first concern is the increased flow to the wwtps due to the consumption of water at source to flush fw slurry down the drain it remains difficult to accurately determine the actual water consumption from the use of fwds due to differing habits across households it was suggested that 1 kg of fw can be flushed with around 10 l of tap water by using the fwd kim et al 2015 zan et al 2018 in hong kong the additional water consumption for diverting fw is about 3 2 l capita day on the basis of a 100 penetration rate occupying only 2 of the current water consumption 160 l capita day hkdsd 2018 other estimations range from 1 to 7 l capita day representing 0 3 to 4 of the total water consumption of an average individual each day with different penetration rates bolzonella et al 2003 marashlian and el fadel 2005 a full scale investigation showed an insignificant changes in flow rate of wwtps after the fwds operation in both dry and wet weather periods battistoni et al 2007 this implies the impact of the diversion of fw on water demand is not too serious however the use of fwds may be crucial for water scarce regions where annual water supplies drop below 500 m3 capita unfao 2012 and it is not recommended for fw diversion due to the limited water resource rosenwinkel and wendler 2001 3 3 2 organic and nutrient removal performance the most critical concern received worldwide is the impact of the diversion of fw on the treatment performance of wwtps which have attracted tremendous attention in both research and practice this can directly affect the performance energy consumption and operational cost of the wwtps many studies from lab scale to full scale investigations or plant wide modelling have been devoted to evaluating the impacts of the diversion of fw on wastewater treatment with different processes as summarized in table 2 the wwtps receiving ground fw with different processes are shown in fig 3 the diversion of fw to wastewater treatment can be achieved either by source separation i e septic tanks for subsequent treatment or by sewer collection for downstream wastewater treatment bernstad et al 2013 durán et al 2018 hu et al 2020 lin et al 2019 moñino et al 2017 zamorano lópez et al 2018 fw concentration in wastewater or fw to sewage ratio could range from 0 2 to 200 g l by using different estimating methods table 2 the source separation of fw slurry relies on a decentralized settling tank or a septic tank fig 3a in which the settled sludge is transported for the ad system and or the tank effluent flows to sewers davidsson et al 2017 saraiva et al 2016 in general the diversion of fw for centralized treatment could increase solid content and cod concentration in wastewater while insignificant impacts on nitrogen and phosphorus were identified fig 3b this could be attributed to the high ratios of carbon nitrogen and carbon phosphorus in fw fisgativa et al 2016 kim et al 2015 zan et al 2018 extra loading of organics in fw would contribute to the enhancement of biological nutrient removal and reduce chemical consumption kim et al 2015 zan et al 2018 moreover full scale investigations mainly rely on the modelling of different processes e g conventional activated sludge cas modified ludzack ettinger mle bardenpho process and anaerobic anoxic aerobic a2o process becker et al 2017 iqbal et al 2020a kim et al 2019 lijó et al 2017 normally biological nutrient removal processes e g mle a2o and bardenpho could benefit from the diversion of fw in which nitrogen and phosphorus removal can be enhanced to secure a better effluent quality kim et al 2019 lijó et al 2017 sankai et al 1997 however it was reported that the high loading of the pollutants from the use of fwds may deteriorate the performance of wastewater treatment which required upgraded capacity and processes of the wwtps nyepd 1997 wainberg and nielssen 2000 it still remains unclear about the critical factors that determine the correlation between the diversion of fw and process performance in wwtps a plant wide steady state modelling case study from hong kong revealed that fw addition improved the cod to nitrogen ratio in influent wastewater subsequently improving the denitrification performance of the mle system and reducing the sludge age the change in effluent concentrations was insignificant for tn and tp but was doubled for cod yet it was below the local discharge standard in addition the final sludge production was increased by about 33 and the wwtp s energy recovery was improved by 80 to 400 with the diversion of fw iqbal et al 2020a emerging treatment processes such as anaerobic membrane bioreactor anmbr and high rate activated sludge with anaerobic digestion hras ad process increasingly attracted scholarly attention due to their high energy recovery potential bernstad et al 2013 durán et al 2018 hu et al 2020 moñino et al 2017 2016 pretel et al 2016 zamorano lópez et al 2018 compared with the conventional processes the removal of nitrogen and phosphorus was not affected or even deteriorated when adopting anmbr and hras durán et al 2018 guven et al 2019b kim et al 2019 lijó et al 2017 moñino et al 2017 the application of hras and anmbr process aims at improving energy recovery from the ground fw with wastewater as shown in fig 3b hras process is capable of maximizing sludge production with a short retention time to minimize biological oxidation jimenez et al 2015 it is thus promising to combine with the ad process to improve energy recovery from the sludge especially with ground fw becker et al 2017 guven et al 2019b however both hras and anmbr processes are still in their infancy which requires more studies and applications on a large scale to verify their application in main stream wastewater treatment and their impacts of the diversion of fw 3 3 3 sludge production in the biological wwtps sewage sludge can be generated from primary treatment as primary sludge and biological treatment as waste activated sludge in the primary treatment 75 90 of solids and 55 80 of cod in ground fw can be removed and settled out as primary sludge iacovidou et al 2012a karrman et al 2001 shpiner 1997 zan et al 2020c in the secondary treatment i e biological treatment cod remained could be converted through the bioprocess to biomass which contributes to waste activated sludge production ekama 2009 given the majority of ground fw deposited in the primary sedimentation tank the diversion of fw induces a much higher primary sludge production than waste activated sludge production zan et al 2020c with the penetration rate of 10 it was estimated that the production of primary and secondary sludge could increase by up to 11 and 2 respectively the produced primary and secondary sludge is then mixed for sludge digestion in ad system after the ad process the digested sludge is dewatered for final disposal fig 1 the increases in digested sludge production could range from 3 to 70 with the use of fwds battistoni et al 2007 galil and shpiner 2001 iacovidou et al 2012a kim et al 2019 zan et al 2020c this can be attributed to the changes in the penetration rates and the treatment process adopted in the wwtps kim et al 2019 zan et al 2020c regarding the impact on sludge production the capacity of sludge handling in wwtps should be given special attention for diverting fw to wastewater treatment 3 3 4 energy recovery conventionally the ad process adopted in the biological wwtps can convert organic matters in sludge into bioenergy in the form of methane and reduce sludge volume for sludge stabilization as illustrated in fig 3 henze et al 2008 the generated methane can be further utilized for electricity generation through the combined heat and power chp system figs 1 and 2 in this context the diversion of fw could offset the consumption of fossil fuels as well as the additional operational cost of wwtps from the extra loading kim et al 2019 maalouf and el fadel 2017 the potential for energy recovery from the diversion of fw may not only rely on the total amounts i e fwds penetration rates but also be affected by local fw composition i e meat fruits vegetables and starchy food and characteristics i e organic solids protein carbohydrates and lipid given the increased sludge production from primary and secondary treatment improved methane production from the ad process could be anticipated as reported ranging from 13 to 193 galil and shpiner 2001 guven et al 2019b zamorano lópez et al 2018 zan et al 2018 this would potentially boost electricity generation and heat recovery from the chp system recent focuses of handling fw in wwtps have been shifted to anmbr and hras ad process fig 3b which are capable of maximizing methane production from the co treatment of ground fw and wastewater becker et al 2017 durán et al 2018 guven et al 2019b moñino et al 2017 2016 zamorano lópez et al 2018 significant increases in methane production could be identified by 190 388 from the co treatment of fw and wastewater in anmbr durán et al 2018 moñino et al 2017 zamorano lópez et al 2018 the diversion of fw improves the biodegradability of the substrate i e fw with wastewater together with a long srt durán et al 2018 in the hras process short retention time could increase the concentrations of organic matter and sludge production which is preferable for enhancing methane production from the ad process meerburg et al 2015 the excess sludge from the hras system receiving fw and wastewater could enhance methane production by 51 from the ad process guven et al 2019a however the increase in sludge production could impact the energy demand for thickening dewatering and digester energy requirement therefore the decision should be made after analysing the net energy balance of the wwtp 3 4 environmental benefits knowledge of environmental impacts from fw diversion is important to evaluate the contribution to global warming potential gwp and also to facilitate the policy making regarding the implementation of fwds this is mainly achieved by carrying out the life cycle assessment lca of different treatment scenarios the related studies are listed in table 3 the focuses of such lca studies have been shifted gradually from the solid waste stream to the wastewater stream conventionally fw in the municipal solid waste is disposed into landfills or treated by incineration composting and or anaerobic digestion edwards et al 2018 kim et al 2011 thomsen et al 2018 with the use of fwds the estimated greenhouse gas ghg generation can be reduced by 24 to 88 compared with conventional scenarios edwards et al 2018 guven et al 2019c iqbal et al 2020a kim et al 2011 maalouf and el fadel 2018 thomsen et al 2018 the better environmental performance of fw diversion is also attributed to the mitigation of marine eutrophication and ecotoxicity compared with landfill guven et al 2019c and the lower potential for ozone layer depletion eutrophication and photochemical oxidation than composting edwards et al 2018 and lower human toxicity than incineration thomsen et al 2018 however the ad system for treating fw could excel the use of fwds with respect to the economic environmental and resource efficiency since the use of fwds results in the loss of organics in sewer and wastewater treatment edwards et al 2018 thomsen et al 2018 yet as aforementioned source separation of fw is the underlying factor limiting the productivity of a centralized ad system and therefore is mainly dependant on fw from commercial sources on the other hand the environmental impacts of fw diversion on wastewater management have attracted increasing attention regarding the current treatment configurations and process upgrading in the wastewater stream the diversion of fw could either preliminarily be separated by the settling tank or directly flow to the wwtps fig 3 although decentralized preliminary treatment may increase energy recovery potential the overall economic and environmental benefits are lower than the centralized wastewater treatment saraiva et al 2016 yi and yoo 2014 in the wwtps anmbr and hras coupled with different subsequent processes have been widely considered to maximize energy recovery from fw diversion becker et al 2017 guven et al 2018 compared with the cas process anmbr may cause the highest gwp due to the effluent methane emission whereas the hras with the ad system has the lowest gwp becker et al 2017 more importantly the increase in fw diversion can linearly decrease the gwp of anmbr and hras suggesting a high sensitivity of treatment processes to the quantity of fw diverted to the wwtps besides the benefits of anmbr could be promising regarding acidification eutrophication smog and respiratory effects becker et al 2017 adding fw to the hras process could facilitate the environmental benefits in terms of climate change acidification ecotoxicity fossil depletion guven et al 2018 however it should be noted that sludge transport distance could be a key factor affecting the environmental performance of the hras process regarding ecotoxicity smog and non carcinogens becker et al 2017 4 challenges and opportunities 4 1 unified definitions for evaluating the impacts of food waste diversion although many efforts have been put in exploring the possibility of fw diversion it still lacks a unified definition to facilitate better understandings about the findings and developments in the field fig 4 first of all the quantity of fw diverted is crucial for determining the impacts on solid waste and wastewater treatment which directly correlates with the use of fwds this is normally defined as penetration penetration rate or penetration factor battistoni et al 2007 iacovidou et al 2012b kim et al 2019 zan et al 2018 besides given that fwds are installed in the kitchen sink of the households saraiva et al 2016 thomas 2011 the diversion of fw refers to fw generated from the households unless a specific statement in this study we propose to use the penetration rate as a standard term for the use of fwds in which a certain penetration rate indicates the corresponding proportion of total household fw diverted from the solid waste stream to the wastewater stream secondly fw concentration in sewage or fw to sewage ratio g l is highly dependant on the quantities of fw diverted and wastewater flow rate which can significantly affect the operation of wwtps zan et al 2020c one critical issue is to clarify the variation in fw concentration within 24 h since the daily flow rate varies with the usage of water the variation in fw concentration may relate to the time when ground fw is discharged into the sewers which may incur a peak concentration in sewage however such information remains unclear and therefore we suggest that such variation in the fw to sewage ratio by fw concentration or wastewater flow rate should get special attention for impact assessment and be tested by performing sensitivity analysis besides implementing fw diversion is of significant importance to frame holistic urban management the overall impacts of fw diversion require a comprehensive assessment on a city scale to plan effective implementation to date the penetration rates are around 50 in the us 30 in new zealand 12 in australia 10 in canada and 5 in the u k iacovidou et al 2012a it is clear that the general penetration rates range at 5 30 in most areas whereas it can reach up to 50 in the us with a long history in the context of fwds application experience we suggest categorizing the impacts of fw diversion with fwds installation as two stages i e in short term 0 30 and long term 30 100 the proposed categorization is meaningful for city scale policy making to formulate specific short and long term plans however the proposed categorization is not changing over time but with the fwds penetration rates this may be attributed to many factors such as the culture dietary habits fwds acceptance and policies which results in an unclear relationship between the penetration rates with time 4 2 sewer network assessment for receiving ground food waste assessing the type of local sewer network is a prerequisite for determining the applicability of fw diversion fig 4 normally sewers can be classified as separate sewers and combined sewers by the type of sewage collected or gravity sewers and pressure sewers by mode of sewage conveyance hvitved jacobsen et al 2013 different combinations of sewers are established by the budget topography and scale which creates great uncertainty of the complex sewer network the slope of gravity sewers can maintain a self cleaning velocity which varies with various design criteria in this context it is necessary to scrutinize the local sewer conditions to analyse the possibility of using fwds the diameter of the drainpipe is of significance since flushing ground fw may increase the blockage potential of the drainpipe with a small diameter mattsson et al 2015 rosenwinkel and wendler 2001 suggested three criteria for the sewer network assessment that must be fulfilled to receive ground fw i separate sewer system ii a good condition with no fractures no leakage and sedimentations and iii the minimal slope of gravity sewer higher than 0 02 before the introduction of fwds in a territory the local sewer system requires a thorough inspection to satisfy these essential preconditions and to facilitate the decision making of the suitability of sewers receiving ground fw 4 3 emerging technologies for efficiently handling ground food waste different wastewater treatment technologies have been extensively researched to enhance the recovery of energy and resources from fw and sewage pham et al 2015 given the diversion of fw to wastewater treatment emerging technologies in wwtps require adequate investigations to verify their capability for not only efficiently handling the additional loadings but also sustaining the energy resource recovery potential the concepts behind for co treating wastewater with fw addition can be either in situ energy generation or organics enrichment for ex situ treatment fig 4 several studies as shown in table 2 have already taken efforts to achieve such purposes by using anmbr and hras processes for the co treatment guven et al 2019b moñino et al 2017 another option involving microbial electrochemical cells mecs may benefit from fw diversion mecs are capable of generating electrical power directly in the mode of microbial fuel cells or producing energy rich chemicals such as hydrogen gas in microbial electrolysis cells li et al 2014 the products of mecs e g electricity or hydrogen gas are more valuable and readily used than methane li et al 2015 however mecs may process a slow reaction for the initial break up of particulates which especially requires an optimized operation for wastewater containing ground fw besides the development of granular sludge technology offers a compact and cost effective wastewater treatment adav et al 2008 the granular sludge process employs unique structure biofilms with different functional microbial groups which extends the ability for treating high strength organic wastewaters zhao et al 2019 moreover recent research reveals the potential of recovering valuable chemicals from the eps of granular sludge felz et al 2020 kim et al 2020 the diversion of fw could increase the eps content in biofilms zan et al 2019 thus improving the potential of resource recovery from granular sludge in wwtps therefore there is a need for further investigation of employing granular sludge technology for not only treating fw but also recovering valuable resources 4 4 scale up studies on food waste diversion the diversion of fw affects both solid and wastewater streams a comprehensive evaluation thus includes both streams from stem to stern which provides fundamental information for policy makings fig 4 previous studies are mostly carried out at lab and pilot scale with the focus on a specific section either in solid waste management or wastewater treatment the overall impacts of fw diversion have been evaluated in case studies of the greater beirut area and hong kong marashlian and el fadel 2005 zan et al 2020c which relied on model based evaluations and lacked field verifications besides full scale studies on wastewater treatment in gagliole of italy and surahammar of sweden have been reported by battistoni et al 2007 and evans et al 2010 they installed fwds in households and evaluated the impacts on sewers and the operation of wwtps given the impacts on the wwtps the diversion of fw may call for an upgrading of the existing processes to tackle the issues result from the extra loadings and optimize the operation of the wwtps the investigation has been trailed from the lca perspective in a turkish context with site specific data guven et al 2018 however it should be noted that the results obtained in these studies varied from location to location due to the site specific co0nditions more importantly the studies of the use of fwds at a large scale are still limited and adequate information is needed to advance knowledge about the overall impacts on local solid waste and wastewater systems 4 5 policy drivers for implementing food waste diversion policies such as legislative requirements and the regulations of local municipalities are essential to whether to implement the use of fwds for fw diversion or not channon et al 2013 iacovidou et al 2012b maalouf and el fadel 2017 the use of fwds as a waste management option varies widely with the uncertainty regarding their potential benefits iacovidou et al 2012b maalouf and el fadel 2017 mtp 2008 concerns about the extra loading on the sewer network and the operation of local wwtps usually play a crucial role in decisions on whether to restrict or permit implementation the use of fwds in the us is highly encouraged even mandated in certain areas legislation and policies about the diversion of fw vary amongst the countries in the european union with factors such as environmental awareness the capacity of wwtps sludge treatment utilization of biogas and cultural attitudes toward technological developments all playing a role thomsen et al 2018 furthermore the ambiguity for the implementation is attributed to many area specific factors such as household practices adopted techniques for solid waste treatment usage and types of water resources the condition of sewerage system and treatment processes and the economic feasibility these factors must be taken into account before deciding a fwds policy for the diversion of fw as a wide scale waste management option to this end it is necessary to assess both the negative and positive impacts of fw diversion on local solid waste and wastewater management systems policy intervention could eventually determine to regulate the use of fwds either promoting them as an alternative option or banning them as a threat to the sewerage system and wastewater treatment hence a comprehensive assessment would significantly facilitate a multi faceted policy system for sustainable fw management 5 perspectives tackling fw issue is of high priority for achieving sustainable waste management to this end establishing fw management hierarchies is substantial by ranking a set of priorities to reduce pressure on natural systems as illustrated in fig 5 this would achieve efficient resource utilization and alleviate environmental impacts redlingshöfer et al 2020 one feasible and critical solution for fulfilling the hierarchy is technologies and systemic innovation which could significantly accelerate progress towards achieving fw management sustainability herrero et al 2020 this study reviewed a potentially viable approach of diverting fw from the solid waste stream to wastewater stream introducing fwds technology enables the diversion of fw especially from households this could facilitate the actions of energy resource recovery and waste to energy treatment and initiate the nexus of fw wastewater and energy resource through integrated fw and wastewater management fig 5 harvesting energy and recovering resources from either wastewater or fw have stimulated tremendous vitality in technology and research for sustainable wastewater and solid waste management kiran et al 2014 li et al 2015 ma and liu 2019 van loosdrecht and brdjanovic 2014 the diversion of fw to wastewater treatment can bridge the co management of fw and wastewater towards a lower environmental impact and an efficient energy resource recovery depending on the level of socio economic development of a country or region and other institutional and political constraints the application of fwds and the mix of approaches could vary widely herrero et al 2020 the successful experiences from other regions demonstrate the feasibility of using fwds but the application requires adequate assessment for optimizing wastewater and fw management sustainability to be specific a mix of different technologies fits a particular city and this requires special attention paid to the local fw characteristics the treatment framework and the sewer system with subsequent wastewater treatment for instance local solid waste should be characterized for designing a suitable treatment system that consists of several approaches e g landfilling incineration composting anaerobic digestion and fwds subsequently the existing fw system can be upgraded to a flexible and advanced system in the context of sustainability economic efficiency and environmental friendliness moreover it is also of significance to evaluate the local sewer system wastewater characteristics capacity of wwtps and treatment processes to verify the possibility of long term and large scale use of fwds meanwhile a life cycle assessment should be carried out based on local experimental and actual data to assess the impacts of fwds on the environment the economy and energy consumption to this end the use of fwds should be tested at different scales to determine the way forward the use of fwds can lead to various social outcomes due to the high relevance of fw to culture socio demographic differences and policy making thyberg and tonjes 2016 cities with the needs for reducing the burden on solid waste treatment could benefit from the use of fwds the use of fwds can play a role in such policy for household fw separation and treatment also it reduces the cost nuisance by road traffic as well as odour and hygiene issues involved in fw separation collection and transportation this study discussed that the diversion of fw may incur unexpected outcomes due to area specific characteristics hence it is still unable to reach a certain conclusion about whether the benefits from fw diversion can offset its cost in solid waste and wastewater streams or whether the pros of using fwds truly outweigh the cons 6 conclusions this paper has comprehensively reviewed the principal application and impacts of fw diversion from the solid waste stream to the wastewater stream although there are worldwide experiences of the use of fwds it still lacks a certain conclusion about the impacts on both solid waste and wastewater systems regarding the collection treatment and disposal challenges and opportunities of fw diversion were identified from five aspects 1 unified definitions in the field for a better understanding of evaluating the impacts of fw diversion 2 sewer network assessment to verify its qualification for receiving ground fw 3 emerging technologies in wwtps for efficiently handling ground fw with wastewater 4 scale up studies for the feasibility of diverting fw to wastewater treatment system and 5 policy drivers for implementing fw diversion this review suggests that the diversion of fw can pose a vital influence on fw management s sustainability and play a key role in the nexus of fw wastewater and energy resource derived from the fw management hierarchy however the area specific characteristics are of high importance to determine the implementation of fw diversion a set of comprehensive local assessments are thus deemed necessary to verify the pros and cons of diverting fw from the solid waste stream to the wastewater stream declaration of competing

16328,calcium peroxide cao2 a common solid peroxide has been increasingly used in contaminated site remediation due to its ability to release oxygen o2 and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and its environmental friendliness our present study is first to explore micromechnisms of cao2 to efficaciously inactivate pathogen indicators including gram negative bacterium of escherichia coli e coli gram positive bacterium of staphylococcus aureus s aureus and virus of escherichia coli specific m13 bacteriophage vcsm13 under low concentration 4 mmol l 1 mm the inactivation mechanisms of e coli s aureus 1 mmol l 1 cao2 and vcsm13 4 mmol l 1 were mainly attributed to oh 32 58 and oh 34 42 followed by h2o2 13 20 and o2 10 12 generated from cao2 with the observed morphological and physiological associated damages also average steady state concentrations of oh oh h2o2 and o2 and their reaction rate constants with e coli and vcsm13 were determined accordingly the micro mechanism model of inactivation was established and validated and the inactivation efficiency of the same order of magnitude of pathogen was predicted furthermore during the common environmental factors the copper ions was found to be promote cao2 inactivation of pathogens and dissolved organic matter dom fractions had a negative effect on cao2 inactivation the present study explored the mechanisms of cao2 inactivation of pathogens in real surface water laying the foundation for its potential use in the inactivation of water borne microbial pathogens graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords calcium peroxide pathogen inactivation micromechanisms surface water 1 introduction the transmission of pathogenic microorganisms from domestic drinking water remains the leading cause of waterborne diseases and associated deaths in many developing countries song et al 2016 wang et al 2020 between the propagation of waterborne microorganisms and limited resources available for microbial control an alarming 2 2 million people are killed from diarrheal symptoms annually especially for children under five years old li et al 2008 as such disinfecting water to reduce microbial pathogens is essential to maintaining safe water for domestic use world health organization 2004 2017 moreover within the last 10 years disease outbreaks of enveloped viruses such as coronaviruses seong et al 2016 ebola virus chippaux 2014 hantavirus nunez et al 2014 and lassa virus prescott et al 2017 placed increasing demands for the implementation of water safety management practices to extinguish the infectious viruses in waters prescott et al 2017 presently this is of pertinent concern due to a big outbreak of novel coronavirus pneumonia covid 19 pandemic coronavirus resource center accessed on january 18 2022 which is capable of entering the aquatic environment through human excretion potentially leading to a greater number of infections mao et al 2020 the development of cost effective and widely available disinfection technologies for control of pathogenic microorganisms including bacteria and viruses is increasingly urgent though solutions to these concerns remains challenging current disinfection methods for water treatment including ultraviolet uv disinfection and chlorine chloramines or ozone chemical disinfection kheyrandish et al 2017 li et al 2008 2019 can control microbial pathogens however there may exist dilemmas between effective disinfection and high energy consumption the formation of harmful disinfection byproducts dbps or pathogenic recolonization dalrymple et al 2010 krasner et al 2006 wang et al 2020 despite good disinfection uv based processes required additional power consumption wang et al 2020 furthermore the resistance of some pathogenic microorganisms to decontaminants makes them difficult to disinfect except at high doses and intensity posing greater challenges to traditional antivirus techniques yates et al 2006 meanwhile a majority of dbps with biotoxicity have been reported with some byproducts shown to be more toxic than their parent compounds krasner et al 2006 richardson et al 2008 additionally very few traditional disinfection techniques have been evaluated for their effectiveness against viruses during water treatment therefore the effectiveness of novel disinfection techniques is urgently needed in the wake of the covid 19 outbreak and for mitigating effects from additional viral outbreaks calcium peroxide cao2 one of the most frequently used solid inorganic peroxy compounds has been widely used in agriculture aquaculture and medicine lu et al 2017 and is considered as a stable and safe solid form of h2o2 zhang et al 2015 cao2 may produce hydrolysates and reactive species hrs such as calcium hydroxide ca oh 2 oxygen o2 hydrogen peroxide h2o2 hydroxyl radical oh and superoxide anion radical o2 in moist media exhibiting its great potential for inactivating pathogenic microorganisms firstly ca oh 2 may exert antibacterial effects probably due to the release of hydroxyl ions oh via damage to the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane proteins or the dna siqueira jr and lopes 1999 however the bactericidal effect of ca oh 2 from cao2 remains controversial in natural surface water sw e g enterococcus faecalis due to the influence of natural water matrix or buffering cao2 dosage and pathogens with different ph tolerance siqueira jr and lopes 1999 secondly o2 h2o2 and o2 may exacerbate oxidative stress to some bacterial cells nelson et al 2018 but the efficacy of these hrs produced from cao2 on target pathogens was unknown due to uncertainties in hrs yields and hrs susceptibility to pathogens and matrix effect still cao2 can be used as eco friendly amendment to supply external o2 in agriculture horticulture silviculture lu et al 2017 thani et al 2016 and remediate black odor water wang et al 2019 furthermore exogenous oxidative inactivation is one of the most important ways capability of oxidation makes cao2 be used for degrading contaminants including mtbe contaminated groundwater liu et al 2006 and toxic materials in waste streams madan and wasewar 2018 and also shows the possibility of inactivating pathogens nelson et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 h2o2 o2 and oh can induce damage to macromolecules such as dna and lipids resulting in pathogen inactivation but e g bacteria have several active enzymes such as superoxide dismutase and catalase that may protect the cells from oxidative damage of h2o2 and o2 nelson et al 2018 raffellini et al 2008 rincon and pulgarin 2004 additionally compared with direct addition of h2o2 cao2 takes one more step to react with water to release hrs allowing more extended periods to oxidize pollutants or inactivate pathogens lu et al 2017 with respect to the continuous strong reactivity of multi hrs produced from cao2 and its safe application in many industrial processes lu et al 2017 we hypothesize that cao2 could be readily implemented as a successful water disinfectant for pathogenic microorganisms however cao2 induced hrs yields and their comprehensive synergistic effect efficacy of pathogen inactivation and corresponding mechanism are vacant which greatly hindered its practical application in natural water treatment and urgently need to be explored therefore the escherichia coli staphylococcus aureus and e coli specific m13 bacteriophage representative microorganisms of gram negative bacteria gram positive bacteria and viruses respectively were selected to evaluated disinfection of cao2 in natural water media the micromechanisms and model related reaction rate constants for cao2 inactivation of pathogens were investigated influences of several abiotic factors such as ions natural dissolved organic matter dom and sunlight present in natural treatment systems were explored this study will evaluate whether cao2 can be a promising water disinfection oxidant

at 4 c for 12 h rinsed three times with 0 1 m pbs ph 7 0 dehydrated with increasing concentrations of ethanol and subsequently treated with pure acetone for 20 min after infiltration and embedding the specimen was sectioned 80 nm and then stained by uranyl acetate and alkaline lead citrate for 5 to 10 min respectively and observed under a transmission electron microscope tem the detailed method used for tem is presented in si text s4 target pathogens were photographed at five different points and each point was photographed in triplicate at a magnification of 25 000 80 000 x respectively experiments were conducted in triplicate n 3 moreover total protein and proteins of na k atpase sod and cat in intracellular and extracellular spaces of e coli and total protein in intracellular and extracellular spaces of vcsm13 after cao2 treatment were measured following the protocols of commercially available kits nanjing jiancheng bioengineering institute china the dosage of cao2 was set at 1 0 mm for e coli and s aureus and 4 0 mm for vcsm13 2 10 influence of sunlight in microbicidal assay sunlight irradiance was measured on a summer day in shenzhen 22 6076 n 113 9987 e by a

discussion 3 1 effect of cao2 dosage cao2 effectively inactivated e coli and vcsm13 fig 1 a b the most suitable cao2 dosage for inactivating e coli and vcsm13 were 1 0 and 4 0 mm respectively which inactivated 76 of e coli and 41 of vcsm13 at the shortest exposure time i e 2 min and subsequently reached to 100 at 120 min respectively in both pw and sw groups a sharp decrease in the normalized concentrations of e coli and vcsm13 c c0 upon cao2 addition was most likely due to the production of hrs from cao2 including ca oh 2 o2 and h2o2 as well as oh and o2 reactions 12 15 zheng et al 2019 resulting in the inactivation of indicator bacteria and viruses nelson et al 2018 12 c a o 2 2 h 2 o c a o h 2 h 2 o 2 13 2 c a o 2 2 h 2 o 2 c a o h 2 o 2 14 h 2 o 2 a c t i v a t o r 2 o h 15 o h h 2 o 2 h 2 o h o 2 o 2 h h 2 o the inactivation kinetics of e coli and vcsm13 followed first order decay kinetics with r2 0 90 the apparent k values of e coli under pw were greater than those under sw while those of vcsm13 were not except that under 4 mm cao2 fig 1c the decreased k in sw may mainly be due to the consumption of hrs by the existing anions and dom zheng et al 2019 with detrimental consequences for inactivation potential especially for e coli however the increased or unchanged k of vcsm13 may be due to the production of excess reactive species such as triplet states of dissolved organic matter 3dom and carbonate radicals co3 arising from the reactions of oh and dom and hco3 co3 2 jasper and sedlak 2013 respectively and oh from fe3 cu and cao2 lu et al 2017 with the potential to compensate the loss of k or improve k especially for vcsm13 nelson et al 2018 additionally the k of e coli was over an order of magnitude greater than that for vcsm13 fig 1c probably because bacterial cells are vastly more complex and have more potential targets of exogenous damage leading to an increased susceptibility of inactivation moreover e coli was very susceptible to high ph davies colley et al 1999 and h2o2 asad et al 1998 kadir and nelson 2014 3 2 effect of environment level ions and dom anions such as co3 2 hco3 cl and so4 2 could quench oh zhao et al 2020 generated from cao2 hydrolysis which could decrease the disinfection efficacy however the degree of pathogen inactivation may be enhanced by the formation of secondary oxidants such as co3 cloh cl cl2 and so4 buxton et al 1988 rincon and pulgarin 2004 furthermore these anions may affect cell permeability and metabolism of e coli or cause osmotic shock to both e coli and vcsm13 jonczyk et al 2011 rincon and pulgarin 2004 leading to changes in k herein no noticeable change in k values for e coli and vcsm13 were observed fig 2 suggesting that effects of the environment level anions on disinfection efficacy are minimal a plausible reason may be the multifunction of anions in sw as mentioned above that could promote and inhibit the cao2 inactivation of pathogens simultaneously although the impacts of tested anions on k were insignificant cu2 substantially increased the k values by 821 and 3330 for e coli and vcsm13 respectively due largely to its catalytic reaction with cao2 to produce reactive species oh lu et al 2017 and cu2 itself inactivation of e coli armstrong et al 2016 however this effect was not seen with the addition of environmentally relevant concentrations of fe3 probably because the concentration of fe3 i e 150 μg l 1 was not sufficient to produce oh when compared to that of cu2 at 50 mg l 1 table s2 the environmentally relevant na concentration also had little influence on the inactivation of e coli and vcsm13 the effect of dom on disinfection depends on types of pathogens the addition of ha and fa decreased the k of e coli by 48 and 34 fig 2a respectively while inducing minimal effects on vcsm13 fig 2b the decrease in apparent k of e coli was most likely because dom acts as a quencher or buffer that consumed hrs despite the production of 3dom jasper and sedlak 2013 moreover dom may interact with pathogen indicators to shield the susceptible targets of damage from cao2 treatment nelson et al 2018 wenk et al 2019 however dom addition hardly changed vcsm13 inactivation efficacy probably due to the combined influence of dom on cao2 related reactions and the shielding effect on vcsm13 meanwhile e coli governs more vulnerable targets than that of vcsm13 nelson et al 2018 whereby e coli was more prone to inactivation by cao2 and influenced by dom 3 3 inactivation mechanism of pathogen indicators under cao2 3 3 1 effect of cao2 hydrolysates as compared to control groups ca oh 2 and h2o2 had a significant increase in the inactivation efficacy and k of e coli and vcsm13 while cacl2 and nacl had little influence figs s3 and 3 a b suggesting that oh and h2o2 played important roles during cao2 treatment while the effect of ca2 was negligible the high do 19 0 mg l 1 after o2 sparged in sw table s3 hardly influenced the inactivation of e coli and vcsm13 as compared to the control groups indicating that o2 played a negligible role in the cao2 inactivation of e coli and vcsm13 although o2 itself may exacerbate oxidative stress to bacterial cells nelson et al 2018 furthermore k values for e coli and vcsm13 under cao2 treatment were 250 and 273 greater than those under h2o2 treatment respectively in addition cao2 exhibited 23 and 57 greater k values than ca oh 2 respectively therefore oh played more important roles in the inactivation of e coli and vcsm13 than h2o2 meanwhile e coli itself was more susceptible to oh and h2o2 than vcsm13 nelson et al 2018 3 3 2 contributions of reactive species and oh among hrs oh was the most effective in inactivating the pathogen indicators about 58 and 51 of the decrease in k were observed for e coli and vcsm13 respectively in the presence of pbs an oh quencher fig 3 c d also oh was a major contributor to the pathogen inactivation ipa was known to effectively scavenge oh without additional reactions with other reactive species such as o2 zheng et al 2019 upon ipa addition there were 34 and 37 decreases in k of e coli and vcsm13 respectively indicating the crucial role of oh for disinfection fig 3 c d in order to assess the contribution of o2 to disinfection sod was used as a probe scavenger however due to its high reactivity with oh i e 5 3 1010 m 1 s 1 singh 1982 ipa was added in advance to remove oh comparison of k values between ipa and ipa sod fig s4 c d shows that o2 contributed to the k of e coli and vcsm13 marginally 11 and 10 respectively fig 3 c d in a similar vein ipa was spiked in advance to quench oh to evaluate sole contribution of h2o2 to the inactivation as depicted in fig 3 c d marginal contributions of h2o2 to the inactivation of e coli 20 and vcsm13 14 were exhibited however ca2 and o2 made little contribution to the cao2 inactivation of e coli and vcsm13 compared with other inactivation mechanisms fig 3 a b in sum the extent of contribution of the hrs to the e coli inactivation follows the descending order of oh 58 oh 34 h2o2 20 and o2 11 a similar trend of relative contribution to vcsm13 inactivation was observed 51 37 14 and 10 for oh oh h2o2 and o2 respectively furthermore total calculated contributions of hrs i e total k accounted for 123 of apparent k of e coli and 113 of apparent k of vcsm13 fig 3 c d the marginal difference between the total and apparent k values was likely attributed to experimental variations associated with manual counting of colonies and plaques it is also possible that the cao2 was not uniformly distributed which would have localized the hrs distribution spatially maraccini et al 2016 3 3 3 epr analysis epr was used to further ascertain major reactive radicals in sw during cao2 treatment there was no peak of epr signal in sw without cao2 treatment fig 3e while a dmpooh signal from the reaction of dmpo and oh with 1 2 2 1 split lines was observed under cao2 treatment in sw fig 3f indicating the existence of oh zheng et al 2019 as dmpoooh reaction of dmpo and o2 is easily auto converted into dmpooh methanol 50 v v an oh quencher was added to differentiate dmpooh from the reaction of dmpo and oh therefore to assess the presence of o2 the major dmpoooh 1 1 1 1 split lines signal in fig 3g implies the generation of o2 during uv cao2 thus oh and o2 were presented in the cao2 inactivation of sw 3 4 determination of hrs concentration and their reaction rate constants with pathogen indicators changes in oh h2o2 and o2 and corresponding 0 t frs d t in cao2 process in sw were shown in fig s6 hrs ss calculated using eqs 4 or 5 is shown in fig 4 for oh the 0 t o h d t in 3 h exhibited a good linear fit with r2 0 946 fig s6a2 and oh ss is shown in fig 4a which oh generated from 0 1 to 0 5 mm of cao2 addition was completely consumed due to oh 10 7 m i e ph 7 while oh ss ranged from 7 76 to 137 10 7 m among 1 4 mm of cao2 fig s6 b1 b2 shows changes in h2o2 and 0 t h 2 o 2 d t in 3 h and 0 t h 2 o 2 d t exhibited a linear fit with r2 0 934 meanwhile h2o2 ss increased linearly with cao2 r2 0 999 with values ranging from 6 39 to 315 10 5 m among 0 1 4 mm of cao2 fig 4b fig s6 c1 c2 shows changes in o2 and 0 t o 2 dt in 3 h and o2 ss ranged from 2 75 to 26 5 10 6 m for 0 1 4 mm of cao2 which followed an exponential fit with r2 0 989 fig 4c fig s6 d1 d2 shows disappearance of pcba and t t oh d t since pcba exerted insignificant degradation after 1 h of treatment oh ss obtained from a linear regression using eq 5 was only applicable to reaction time 1 h fig 4d since inactivation of target pathogens usually occurred within 1 h with inactivated efficiency 0 80 thus oh ss may be directly applied to evaluate subsequent pathogens inactivation efficacy according to calculated values of hrs ss and k of e coli and vcsm13 under 0 1 4 mm of cao2 process apparent k hrs p was calculated using eq 10 fig 4e the apparent k o h p of e coli and vcsm13 was close to or greater than the diffusion limit which was consistent to previous study that oh have been proven to react extremely fast with most of biological molecules usually at 109 m 1 s 1 bianco et al 2017 the k o h p of e coli and vcsm13 was about 3790 370 and 30 1 15 6 m 1 s 1 respectively followed by values of k o 2 p and k h 2 o 2 p at 3 10 38 8 25 4 m 1 s 1 and 0 0367 1 23 0 39 m 1 s 1 respectively although k oh p was significantly greater than those of other hrs the yields of oh ss was 8 11 orders of magnitudes smaller than those of other hrs thus contributions of oh to pathogens inactivation did not exert the most important role else developing cao2 based technologies to promote the yields and persistence of oh is of great significance to efficiently inactivate pathogens notably calculated k hrs p with big standard deviations may be due to the deviations propagation from big differences between calculated values of hrs ss and k and assumption of second order reaction between hrs and pathogens to verify the rationality of calculated k hrs p a linear correlation analysis of measured and estimated inactivated efficiencies using eq 8 was conducted fig 5 reveals the predicted values of p p 0 of e coli and vcsm13 under 1 4 mm cao2 process were in good agreement with the measured values with acceptable pearson s r of 0 907 hence hrs induced micromechanism model for pathogens inactivation involved in eq 8 may reasonably describe the main inactivation mechanism of target pathogen by cao2 process the gap between predicted and measured value was mainly due to the followings 1 assumption of continuous and stable hrs while hrs may exist longer or shorter for instance hrs ss were calculated in reaction time of 3 h except for oh ss in 1 h used in eq 8 while most of pathogen was inactivated within 1 2 h 2 there exist significant deviations of k h r s c e g deviations amounted for about 50 of both k oh p and k o 2 p or even about 100 of k o h p for vcsm13 fig 4e 3 although four frs were considered in cao2 inactivation of pathogen their interactions or the possible existence of persistent active radicals such as carbon based radicals were not considered notwithstanding this model deepens the understanding of the mechanism of in situ pathogen inactivation by cao2 and meanwhile accomplish the prediction of pathogen inactivated efficiency at the same order of magnitude 3 4 morphological and physiological associated damage compared to intact e coli fig 6 a1 e coli in cao2 treatment underwent plasmolysis accompanied by severe bacterial cytoplasmic shrinkage fig 6 a2 a3 the plasmolysis disrupted the periplasmic space that contains hydrolases synthetases binding proteins and receptor proteins resulting in e coli inactivation allen et al 2009 kellenberger and ryter 1958 nanninga 1998 the cytoplasmic shrinkage may destroy the bacterial solutes and enzymes for metabolic reactions leading to e coli death beney et al 2004 cobb et al 1996 furthermore the outer membrane cell wall and plasma membrane appeared dissolved or disrupted fig 6 a2 a3 the outer membrane contains many functional proteins related to receptors dna replication and cell division the cell wall mainly protects bacterial cells and holds structure and the plasma membrane controls the influx and outflux of substances of the cell kellenberger and ryter 1958 nanninga 1998 therefore the looseness or breakage of these structures may lead to e coli inactivation the neat intact spots fig 6b1 deformed or dissolved after cao2 treatment fig 6 b2 b3 which indicates the destruction of the vcsm13 structure mainly genome or capsid by oh and reactive species leading to a disruption of the stages of the virus life cycle cramer et al 1983 nelson et al 2018 the damage to the genome would hinder the replication of viral nucleic acid whereas damage to the capsid protein would disrupt attachment entry or nucleic acid replication nelson et al 2018 leading to virus inactivation and transmission interruption furthermore for e coli the intracellular proteins of cat sod and na k atp increased for an early exposure time 30 min and subsequently decreased while total intracellular protein continuously decreased fig 6c1 this is because bacteria may induce an adaptive regulatory response in the short term nelson et al 2018 to protect against or repair damage from cao2 treatment while further treatment with cao2 may severely disrupt the cell wall and membrane and cause the outflux of proteins the monotonic increase in extracellular proteins further implies the destruction of cell walls and membranes and the outflux of substances subsequently fig 6c2 for vcsm13 the decrease in total inner protein and the increase in total outer protein after 30 min of exposure suggests that the structure of the viral capsid may have been destroyed fig 6c3 the total protein in e coli and vcsm13 was decreased in the intracellular and increased in the extracellular fig 6c suggesting the protein leakage from the cell and then combined with the morphological damage of e coli and vcsm13 after 2 h cao2 treatment fig 6 a b further confirmed the hrs generated during cao2 hydrolysis destructed the cell wall and membrane of e coli and the capsid of vcsm13 however it is difficult to identify which particular hrs or combination of hrs was responsible for the irreversible damage to specific structures since many types of damage as well as stress responses may coincide 3 5 extensive cao2 inactivation of gram positive bacterium s aureus extensive cao2 inactivation of gram positive s aureus was also conducted s aureus was effectively inactivated by cao2 fig s7a as validated by first order decay kinetics r2 0 92 with a greater k value 0 432 0 084 min 1 than that of e coli 0 302 0 080 min 1 at 1 mm of cao2 fig 7 a because the additional outer membrane of gram negative e coli may protect exogenous damage whereas such pretention is not anticipated for gram positive s aureus meanwhile gram negative bacteria pose a differential cellular wall from gram positive bacteria which may provide more protection from exogenous damage maraccini et al 2016 furthermore s aureus inactivation micromechanisms was revealed oh 32 oh 42 h2o2 13 and o2 12 contributed to k fig 7 b c additionally tem of s aureus in fig 7e suggests that the bacterial cell underwent lysis compared to the intact bacteria fig 7d meanwhile the cell wall and plasma membrane looked loose after 2 h exposure of cao2 at 1 mm fig 7 e f in all cao2 was effective for all of the tested pathogen indicators covering a wide spectrum of pathogens including gram negative e coli gram positive s aureus and vcsm13 implying that cao2 may be an efficacious disinfectant for various species of microbial pathogens 3 6 environmental implications the alkalinity and oxidability of cao2 in solid allows consideration of its application as a disinfectant in waters meanwhile the external environmental factors may affect the cao2 inactivation of pathogens in the natural waters for instance sunlight may further enhance cao2 inactivation of pathogens considering 1 sunlight itself inactivation of water borne pathogens nelson et al 2018 2 activating cao2 to generate increased levels of oh zheng et al 2019 to inactivate pathogens and o2 generated from cao2 promoting the production of singlet oxygen 1o2 nelson et al 2018 wenk et al 2019 fig s8 reveals that the natural sunlight dramatically increased the k of e coli 0 1 mm cao2 and vcsm13 4 mm cao2 by 205 and 2261 respectively as compared to k with sole cao2 the time for 100 inactivation of e coli and vcsm13 was shortened to 30 min and 5 min respectively therefore combined with sunlight the dosage of cao2 could be greatly reduced improving its economic potential for engineering applications used in water reuse systems notably the inactivation of bacteria and viruses in different environments is multifactorial physiological differences of pathogens may influence their susceptibility to cao2 treatment due to varying responses to stress nelson et al 2018 which have proven difficult to assess nelson et al 2018 wenk et al 2019 additional studies are needed to assess the damage of cao2 to specific structures in bacteria and viruses to better characterize which mechanisms lead to inactivation 4 conclusions cao2 could effectively inactivate e coli s aureus and vcsm13 in sw with 100 efficiencies under 1 1 and 4 mm of cao2 in 120 min for e coli and vcsm13 environmental prevalent ions such as co3 2 hco3 cl so4 2 and fe3 had insignificant influence on their inactivation except that cu2 substantially promoted the inactivation besides ha and fa induced a negative effect on e coli inactivation but little effect on vcsm13 inactivation furthermore the inactivation of pathogen indicators was attributed to the oh 32 58 and oh 34 42 followed by h2o2 13 20 and o2 10 12 epr test ascertained the existence of oh and o2 in the cao2 inactivation of sw meanwhile hrs ss and second order k hrs p were calculated and the corresponding hrs induced micromechnism model was validated with exposure of cao2 results of tem reveal e coli and s aureu underwent the disruption of cell membrane and wall and vcsm13 underwent disruption of the capsid the inner proteins decreased while the outer protein increased during cao2 process which further indicates the damage of cao2 to bacterial cell wall and membrane and virus capsid given the excellent inactivation on the pathogen indictors cao2 can be applied as an emerging disinfectant in surface water systems moreover the environmental factors such as sunlight may significantly promote cao2 to increase inactivated efficiencies of pathogen indicators however further investigation is needed to characterize the inactivation mechanisms of cao2 to specific structures in bacteria and viruses declaration of competing interest the authors

16328,calcium peroxide cao2 a common solid peroxide has been increasingly used in contaminated site remediation due to its ability to release oxygen o2 and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and its environmental friendliness our present study is first to explore micromechnisms of cao2 to efficaciously inactivate pathogen indicators including gram negative bacterium of escherichia coli e coli gram positive bacterium of staphylococcus aureus s aureus and virus of escherichia coli specific m13 bacteriophage vcsm13 under low concentration 4 mmol l 1 mm the inactivation mechanisms of e coli s aureus 1 mmol l 1 cao2 and vcsm13 4 mmol l 1 were mainly attributed to oh 32 58 and oh 34 42 followed by h2o2 13 20 and o2 10 12 generated from cao2 with the observed morphological and physiological associated damages also average steady state concentrations of oh oh h2o2 and o2 and their reaction rate constants with e coli and vcsm13 were determined accordingly the micro mechanism model of inactivation was established and validated and the inactivation efficiency of the same order of magnitude of pathogen was predicted furthermore during the common environmental factors the copper ions was found to be promote cao2 inactivation of pathogens and dissolved organic matter dom fractions had a negative effect on cao2 inactivation the present study explored the mechanisms of cao2 inactivation of pathogens in real surface water laying the foundation for its potential use in the inactivation of water borne microbial pathogens graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords calcium peroxide pathogen inactivation micromechanisms surface water 1 introduction the transmission of pathogenic microorganisms from domestic drinking water remains the leading cause of waterborne diseases and associated

people are killed from diarrheal symptoms annually especially for children under five years old li et al 2008 as such disinfecting water to reduce microbial pathogens is essential to maintaining safe water for domestic use world health organization 2004 2017 moreover within the last 10 years disease outbreaks of enveloped viruses such as coronaviruses seong et al 2016 ebola virus chippaux 2014 hantavirus nunez et al 2014 and lassa virus prescott et al 2017 placed increasing demands for the implementation of water safety management practices to extinguish the infectious viruses in waters prescott et al 2017 presently this is of pertinent concern due to a big outbreak of novel coronavirus pneumonia covid 19 pandemic coronavirus resource center accessed on january 18 2022 which is capable of entering the aquatic environment through human excretion potentially leading to a greater number of infections mao et al 2020 the development of cost effective and widely available disinfection technologies for control of pathogenic microorganisms including bacteria and viruses is increasingly urgent though solutions to these concerns remains challenging current disinfection methods for water treatment including ultraviolet uv disinfection and chlorine chloramines or ozone chemical disinfection kheyrandish et al 2017 li et al 2008 2019 can control microbial pathogens however there may exist dilemmas between effective disinfection and high energy consumption the formation of harmful disinfection byproducts dbps or pathogenic recolonization dalrymple et al 2010 krasner et al 2006 wang et al 2020 despite good disinfection uv based processes required additional power consumption wang et al 2020 furthermore the resistance of some pathogenic microorganisms to decontaminants makes them difficult to disinfect except at high doses and intensity posing greater challenges to traditional antivirus techniques yates et al 2006 meanwhile a majority of dbps with biotoxicity have been reported with some byproducts shown to be more toxic than their parent compounds krasner et al 2006 richardson et al 2008 additionally very few traditional disinfection techniques have been evaluated for their effectiveness against viruses during water treatment therefore the effectiveness of novel disinfection techniques is urgently needed in the wake of the covid 19 outbreak and for mitigating effects from additional viral outbreaks calcium peroxide cao2 one of the most frequently used solid inorganic peroxy compounds has been widely used in agriculture aquaculture and medicine lu et al 2017 and is considered as a stable and safe solid form of h2o2 zhang et al 2015 cao2 may produce hydrolysates and reactive species hrs such as calcium hydroxide ca oh 2 oxygen o2 hydrogen peroxide h2o2 hydroxyl radical oh and superoxide anion radical o2 in moist media exhibiting its great potential for inactivating pathogenic microorganisms firstly ca oh 2 may exert antibacterial effects probably due to the release of hydroxyl ions oh via damage to the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane proteins or the dna siqueira jr and lopes 1999 however the bactericidal effect of ca oh 2 from cao2 remains controversial in natural surface water sw e g enterococcus faecalis due to the influence of natural water matrix or buffering cao2 dosage and pathogens with different ph tolerance siqueira jr and lopes 1999 secondly o2 h2o2 and o2 may exacerbate oxidative stress to some bacterial cells nelson et al 2018 but the efficacy of these hrs produced from cao2 on target pathogens was unknown due to uncertainties in hrs yields and hrs susceptibility to pathogens and matrix effect still cao2 can be used as eco friendly amendment to supply external o2 in agriculture horticulture silviculture lu et al 2017 thani et al 2016 and remediate black odor water wang et al 2019 furthermore exogenous oxidative inactivation is one of the most important ways capability of oxidation makes cao2 be used for degrading contaminants including mtbe contaminated groundwater liu et al 2006 and toxic materials in waste streams madan and wasewar 2018 and also shows the possibility of inactivating pathogens nelson et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 h2o2 o2 and oh can induce damage to macromolecules such as dna and lipids resulting in pathogen inactivation but e g bacteria have several active enzymes such as superoxide dismutase and catalase that may protect the cells from oxidative damage of h2o2 and o2 nelson et al 2018 raffellini et al 2008 rincon and pulgarin 2004 additionally compared with direct addition of h2o2 cao2 takes one more step to react with water to release hrs allowing more extended periods to oxidize pollutants or inactivate pathogens lu et al 2017 with respect to the continuous strong reactivity of multi hrs produced from cao2 and its safe application in many industrial processes lu et al 2017 we hypothesize that cao2 could be readily implemented as a successful water disinfectant for pathogenic microorganisms however cao2 induced hrs yields and their comprehensive synergistic effect efficacy of pathogen inactivation and corresponding mechanism are vacant which greatly hindered its practical application in natural water treatment and urgently need to be explored therefore the escherichia coli staphylococcus aureus and e coli specific m13 bacteriophage representative microorganisms of gram negative bacteria gram positive bacteria and viruses respectively were selected to evaluated disinfection of cao2 in natural water media the micromechanisms and model related reaction rate constants for cao2 inactivation of pathogens were investigated influences of several abiotic factors such as ions natural dissolved organic matter dom and sunlight present in natural treatment systems were explored this study will evaluate whether cao2 can be a promising water disinfection oxidant for both bacteria and viruses 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials details of all chemicals and target pathogen indicators used in this study are provided in supporting information si text s1 all bacteria and bacteriophages used in this study were inactivated by being autoclaved at 121 c for 15 min following all experiments natural surface water sw was collected from a local river dasha river shenzhen china 22 6076 n 113 9987 e at noon on a sunny day in the summer of 2020 filtered by 0 45 μm filters sterilized at 121 c for 15 min and stored at 4 c until used within one week the water chemistry parameters of collected sw are provided in table s1 2 2 microbicidal assay in pure water and surface water pathogen indicators were applied in the microbicidal assays by cao2 briefly gram negative e coli e coli and gram positive staphylococcus aureus s aureus were cultured in lb culture medium sangon biotech china and e coli specific m13 bacteriophage vcsm13 bacteriophage was cultured as previously conducted using the log growth of host bacteria oliveira et al 2018 yang et al 2015 details about the culture methods are provided in si text s2 cao2 0 8 mmol l 1 mm was added to 105 cfu

layer agar plate and vcsm13 bacteriophage for double layer agar plate after serial dilutions the plates were incubated at 37 c for 24 36 h to determine the viable cell count all the microbicidal assays were conducted in quadruplicate n 4 2 3 influence of environmental level ions and dom in microbicidal assay the influence of ions co3 2 hco3 cl so4 2 fe3 and cu2 and dom fulvic fa and humic acids ha on the degree of cao2 inactivation of e coli and vcsm13 were explored environmentally level concentrations of ions and dom used table s2 were determined based on those frequently measured in collected sw samples table s1 and previous investigations callahan et al 2004 wetzel 2001 yu et al 2017 as well as those associated with potential pathogen inactivation the dosage of cao2 used was set to the suitable dosage obtained from section 3 1 1 0 mm for e coli and 4 0 mm for vcsm13 2 4 effect of cao2 hydrolysates in microbicidal assay experiments to evaluate roles of cao2 hydrolysates ca2 oh h2o2 and dissolved o2 do on e coli and vcsm13 inactivation in sw were conducted the hydrolysates were set at theoretical equivalent optimal concentrations of cao2 75 w w cao2 1 0 mm ca oh 2 1 3 mm

provided in table s3 cacl2 in parallel with nacl was used to evaluate the function of ca2 on the microbicidal assay 2 5 contributions of hydrolysates and reactive species to characterize contributions of h2o2 do oh o2 and oh generated from cao2 in sw to the cao2 inactivation of pathogen indicators effect of corresponding scavengers were investigated ipa 10 100 mm was used to quench oh reactions cat 10 ku l was used to quench oh reactions sod 10 ku l was used to quench o2 phosphate buffered saline pbs 0 1 m ph 7 0 acted as a quencher for oh the dosage of cao2 was set at 1 0 mm for e coli and s aureus and 4 0 mm for vcsm13 moreover electron paramagnetic resonance epr esp300 bruker germany was used to further determine main free radicals the experimental settings were as follows sw cao2 sw cao2 sw 50 methanol to determine the presence of o2 methanol was used to quench oh in advance epr parameters used and test steps conducted were in accordance with previous reports zhang et al 2015 zheng et al 2019 experiments were conducted in triplicate n 3 2 6 reaction kinetic model of inactivation the inactivation data of pathogen indicators obtained from each experiment could be fit using a simple shoulder log linear model eq 1 van boekel 2002 1 ln p t p 0 k t ln 1 e k s 1 e k t where t is time min pt and p0 cfu ml 1 are the measured concentration at time t and 0 respectively s min is the shoulder or lag time with the minimal inactivation of pathogen indicators and k min 1 is the inactivation rate constant for the log linear portion of the inactivation curve after the lag time since the 95 confidence interval of the shoulder length s min crossed zero in this paper i e s 0 when t 0 k values of pathogen indicators can be determined through the slope of linear regression of ln

at 4 c for 12 h rinsed three times with 0 1 m pbs ph 7 0 dehydrated with increasing concentrations of ethanol and subsequently treated with pure acetone for 20 min after infiltration and embedding the specimen was sectioned 80 nm and then stained by uranyl acetate and alkaline lead citrate for 5 to 10 min respectively and observed under a transmission electron microscope tem the detailed method used for tem is presented in si text s4 target pathogens were photographed at five different points and each point was photographed in triplicate at a magnification of 25 000 80 000 x respectively experiments were conducted in triplicate n 3 moreover total protein and proteins of na k atpase sod and cat in intracellular and extracellular spaces of e coli and total protein in intracellular and extracellular spaces of vcsm13 after cao2 treatment were measured following the protocols of commercially available kits nanjing jiancheng bioengineering institute china the dosage of cao2 was set at 1 0 mm for e coli and s aureus and 4 0 mm for vcsm13 2 10 influence of sunlight in microbicidal assay sunlight irradiance was measured on a summer day in shenzhen 22 6076 n 113 9987 e by a spectroscope usb2000 uv vis ocean optics usa at 125 mw cm 2 200 2500 nm experiments were conducted in quadruplicate n 4 the dosage of cao2 was set at 0 1 mm for e coli and 4 0 mm for vcsm13 2 11 statistical analysis all data analysis was performed using origin origin 2018 all data are presented as mean standard error sem statistical analyses of the results on total protein and atpase sod and cat activities were performed using spss statistics 18 0 spss inc chicago il usa a kolmogorov smirnov one sample test was used to assess normality and levene s test was used to assess the homogeneity of variance the intergroup differences were assessed using a one way analysis of variance anova followed by dunnett s post hoc test statistical significance was determined at p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of cao2 dosage cao2 effectively inactivated e coli and vcsm13 fig 1 a b the most suitable cao2 dosage for inactivating e coli and vcsm13 were 1 0 and 4 0 mm respectively which inactivated 76 of e coli and 41 of vcsm13 at the shortest exposure time i e 2 min and subsequently reached to 100 at 120 min respectively in both pw and sw groups a sharp decrease in the normalized concentrations of e coli and vcsm13 c c0 upon cao2 addition was most likely due to the production of hrs from cao2 including ca oh 2 o2 and h2o2 as well as oh and o2 reactions 12 15 zheng et al 2019 resulting in the inactivation of indicator bacteria and viruses nelson et al 2018 12 c a o 2 2 h 2 o c a o h 2 h 2 o 2 13 2 c a o 2 2 h 2 o 2 c a o h 2 o 2 14 h 2 o 2 a c t i v a t o r 2 o h 15 o h h 2 o 2 h 2 o h o 2 o 2 h h 2 o the inactivation kinetics of e coli and vcsm13 followed first order decay kinetics with r2 0 90 the apparent k values of e coli under pw were greater than those under sw while those of vcsm13 were not except that under 4 mm cao2 fig 1c the decreased k in sw may mainly be due to the consumption of hrs by the existing anions and dom zheng et al 2019 with detrimental consequences for inactivation potential especially for e coli however the increased or unchanged k of vcsm13 may be due to the production of excess reactive species such as triplet states of dissolved organic matter 3dom and carbonate radicals co3 arising from the reactions of oh and dom and hco3 co3 2 jasper and sedlak 2013 respectively and oh from fe3 cu and cao2 lu et al 2017 with the potential to compensate the loss of k or improve k especially for vcsm13 nelson et al 2018 additionally the k of e coli was over an order of magnitude greater than that for vcsm13 fig 1c probably because bacterial cells are vastly more complex and have more potential targets of exogenous damage leading to an increased susceptibility of inactivation moreover e coli was very susceptible to high ph davies colley et al 1999 and h2o2 asad et al 1998 kadir and nelson 2014 3 2 effect of environment level ions and dom anions such as co3 2 hco3 cl and so4 2 could quench oh zhao et al 2020 generated from cao2 hydrolysis which could decrease the disinfection efficacy however the degree of pathogen inactivation may be enhanced by the formation of secondary oxidants such as co3 cloh cl cl2 and so4 buxton et al 1988 rincon and pulgarin 2004 furthermore these anions may affect cell permeability and metabolism of e coli or cause osmotic shock to both e coli and vcsm13 jonczyk et al 2011 rincon and pulgarin 2004 leading to changes in k herein no noticeable change in k values for e coli and vcsm13 were observed fig 2 suggesting that effects of the environment level anions on disinfection efficacy are minimal a plausible reason may be the multifunction of anions in sw as mentioned above that could promote and inhibit the cao2 inactivation of pathogens simultaneously although the impacts of tested anions on k were insignificant cu2 substantially increased the k values by 821 and 3330 for e coli and vcsm13 respectively due largely to its catalytic reaction with cao2 to produce reactive species oh lu et al 2017 and cu2 itself inactivation of e coli armstrong et al 2016 however this effect was not seen with the addition of environmentally relevant concentrations of fe3 probably because the concentration of fe3 i e 150 μg l 1 was not sufficient to produce oh when compared to that of cu2 at 50 mg l 1 table s2 the environmentally relevant na concentration also had little influence on the inactivation of e coli and vcsm13 the effect of dom on disinfection depends on types of pathogens the addition of ha and fa decreased the k of e coli by 48 and 34 fig 2a respectively while inducing minimal effects on vcsm13 fig 2b the decrease in apparent k of e coli was most likely because dom acts as a quencher or buffer that consumed hrs despite the production of 3dom jasper and sedlak 2013 moreover dom may interact with pathogen indicators to shield the susceptible targets of damage from cao2 treatment nelson et al 2018 wenk et al 2019 however dom addition hardly changed vcsm13 inactivation efficacy probably due to the combined influence of dom on cao2 related reactions and the shielding effect on vcsm13 meanwhile e coli governs more vulnerable targets than that of vcsm13 nelson et al 2018 whereby e coli was more prone to inactivation by cao2 and influenced by dom 3 3 inactivation mechanism of pathogen indicators under cao2 3 3 1 effect of cao2 hydrolysates as compared to control groups ca oh 2 and h2o2 had a significant increase in the inactivation efficacy and k of e coli and vcsm13 while cacl2 and nacl had little influence figs s3 and 3 a b suggesting that oh and h2o2 played important roles during cao2 treatment while the effect of ca2 was negligible the high do 19 0 mg l 1 after o2 sparged in sw table s3 hardly influenced the inactivation of e coli and vcsm13 as compared to the control groups indicating that o2 played a negligible role in the cao2 inactivation of e coli and vcsm13 although o2 itself may exacerbate oxidative stress to bacterial cells nelson et al 2018 furthermore k values for e coli and vcsm13 under cao2 treatment were 250 and 273 greater than those under h2o2 treatment respectively in addition cao2 exhibited 23 and 57 greater k values than ca oh 2 respectively therefore oh played more important roles in the inactivation of e coli and vcsm13 than h2o2 meanwhile e coli itself was more susceptible to oh and h2o2 than vcsm13 nelson et al 2018 3 3 2 contributions of reactive species and oh among hrs oh was the most effective in inactivating the pathogen indicators about 58 and 51 of the decrease in k were observed for e coli and vcsm13 respectively in the presence of pbs an oh quencher fig 3 c d also oh was a major contributor to the pathogen inactivation ipa was known to effectively scavenge oh without additional reactions with other reactive species such as o2 zheng et al 2019 upon ipa addition there were 34 and 37 decreases in k of e coli and vcsm13 respectively indicating the crucial role of oh for disinfection fig 3 c d in order to assess the contribution of o2 to disinfection sod was used as a probe scavenger however due to its high reactivity with oh i e 5 3 1010 m 1 s 1 singh 1982 ipa was added in advance to remove oh comparison of k values between ipa and ipa sod fig s4 c d shows that o2 contributed to the k of e coli and vcsm13 marginally 11 and 10 respectively fig 3 c d in a similar vein ipa was spiked in advance to quench oh to evaluate sole contribution of h2o2 to the inactivation as depicted in fig 3 c d marginal contributions of h2o2 to the inactivation of e coli 20 and vcsm13 14 were exhibited however ca2 and o2 made little contribution to the cao2 inactivation of e coli and vcsm13 compared with other inactivation mechanisms fig 3 a b in sum the extent of contribution of the hrs to the e coli inactivation follows the descending order of oh 58 oh 34 h2o2 20 and o2 11 a similar trend of relative contribution to vcsm13 inactivation was observed 51 37 14 and 10 for oh oh h2o2 and o2 respectively furthermore total calculated contributions of hrs i e total k accounted for 123 of apparent k of e coli and 113 of apparent k of vcsm13 fig 3 c d the marginal difference between the total and apparent k values was likely attributed to experimental variations associated with manual counting of colonies and plaques it is also possible that the cao2 was not uniformly distributed which would have localized the hrs distribution spatially maraccini et al 2016 3 3 3 epr analysis epr was used to further ascertain major reactive radicals in sw during cao2 treatment there was no peak of epr signal in sw without cao2 treatment fig 3e while a dmpooh signal from the reaction of dmpo and oh with 1 2 2 1 split lines was observed under cao2 treatment in sw fig 3f indicating the existence of oh zheng et al 2019 as dmpoooh reaction of dmpo and o2 is easily auto converted into dmpooh methanol 50 v v an oh quencher was added to differentiate dmpooh from the reaction of dmpo and oh therefore to assess the presence of o2 the major dmpoooh 1 1 1 1 split lines signal in fig 3g implies the generation of o2 during uv cao2 thus oh and o2 were presented in the cao2 inactivation of sw 3 4 determination of hrs concentration and their reaction rate constants with pathogen indicators changes in oh h2o2 and o2 and corresponding 0 t frs d t in cao2 process in sw were shown in fig s6 hrs ss calculated using eqs 4 or 5 is shown in fig 4 for oh the 0 t o h d t in 3 h exhibited a good linear fit with r2 0 946 fig s6a2 and oh ss is shown in fig 4a which oh generated from 0 1 to 0 5 mm of cao2 addition was completely consumed due to oh 10 7 m i e ph 7 while oh ss ranged from 7 76 to 137 10 7 m among 1 4 mm of cao2 fig s6 b1 b2 shows changes in h2o2 and 0 t h 2 o 2 d t in 3 h and 0 t h 2 o 2 d t exhibited a linear fit with r2 0 934 meanwhile h2o2 ss increased linearly with cao2 r2 0 999 with values ranging from 6 39 to 315 10 5 m among 0 1 4 mm of cao2 fig 4b fig s6 c1 c2 shows changes in o2 and 0 t o 2 dt in 3 h and o2 ss ranged from 2 75 to 26 5 10 6 m for 0 1 4 mm of cao2 which followed an exponential fit with r2 0 989 fig 4c fig s6 d1 d2 shows disappearance of pcba and t t oh d t since pcba exerted insignificant degradation after 1 h of treatment oh ss obtained from a linear regression using eq 5 was only applicable to reaction time 1 h fig 4d since inactivation of target pathogens usually occurred within 1 h with inactivated efficiency 0 80 thus oh ss may be directly applied to evaluate subsequent pathogens inactivation efficacy according to calculated values of hrs ss and k of e coli and vcsm13 under 0 1 4 mm of cao2 process apparent k hrs p was calculated using eq 10 fig 4e the apparent k o h p of e coli and vcsm13 was close to or greater than the diffusion limit which was consistent to previous study that oh have been proven to react extremely fast with most of biological molecules usually at 109 m 1 s 1 bianco et al 2017 the k o h p of e coli and vcsm13 was about 3790 370 and 30 1 15 6 m 1 s 1 respectively followed by values of k o 2 p and k h 2 o 2 p at 3 10 38 8 25 4 m 1 s 1 and 0 0367 1 23 0 39 m 1 s 1 respectively although k oh p was significantly greater than those of other hrs the yields of oh ss was 8 11 orders of magnitudes smaller than those of other hrs thus contributions of oh to pathogens inactivation did not exert the most important role else developing cao2 based technologies to promote the yields and persistence of oh is of great significance to efficiently inactivate pathogens notably calculated k hrs p with big standard deviations may be due to the deviations propagation from big differences between calculated values of hrs ss and k and assumption of second order reaction between hrs and pathogens to verify the rationality of calculated k hrs p a linear correlation analysis of measured and estimated inactivated efficiencies using eq 8 was conducted fig 5 reveals the predicted values of p p 0 of e coli and vcsm13 under 1 4 mm cao2 process were in good agreement with the measured values with acceptable pearson s r of 0 907 hence hrs induced micromechanism model for pathogens inactivation involved in eq 8 may reasonably describe the main inactivation mechanism of target pathogen by cao2 process the gap between predicted and measured value was mainly due to the followings 1 assumption of continuous and stable hrs while hrs may exist longer or shorter for instance hrs ss were calculated in reaction time of 3 h except for oh ss in 1 h used in eq 8 while most of pathogen was inactivated within 1 2 h 2 there exist significant deviations of k h r s c e g deviations amounted for about 50 of both k oh p and k o 2 p or even about 100 of k o h p for vcsm13 fig 4e 3 although four frs were considered in cao2 inactivation of pathogen their interactions or the possible existence of persistent active radicals such as carbon based radicals were not considered notwithstanding this model deepens the understanding of the mechanism of in situ pathogen inactivation by cao2 and meanwhile accomplish the prediction of pathogen inactivated efficiency at the same order of magnitude 3 4 morphological and physiological associated damage compared to intact e coli fig 6 a1 e coli in cao2 treatment underwent plasmolysis accompanied by severe bacterial cytoplasmic shrinkage fig 6 a2 a3 the plasmolysis disrupted the periplasmic space that contains hydrolases synthetases binding proteins and receptor proteins resulting in e coli inactivation allen et al 2009 kellenberger and ryter 1958 nanninga 1998 the cytoplasmic shrinkage may destroy the bacterial solutes and enzymes for metabolic reactions leading to e coli death beney et al 2004 cobb et al 1996 furthermore the outer membrane cell wall and plasma membrane appeared dissolved or disrupted fig 6 a2 a3 the outer membrane contains many functional proteins related to receptors dna replication and cell division the cell wall mainly protects bacterial cells and holds structure and the plasma membrane controls the influx and outflux of substances of the cell kellenberger and ryter 1958 nanninga 1998 therefore the looseness or breakage of these structures may lead to e coli inactivation the neat intact spots fig 6b1 deformed or dissolved after cao2 treatment fig 6 b2 b3 which indicates the destruction of the vcsm13 structure mainly genome or capsid by oh and reactive species leading to a disruption of the stages of the virus life cycle cramer et al 1983 nelson et al 2018 the damage to the genome would hinder the replication of viral nucleic acid whereas damage to the capsid protein would disrupt attachment entry or nucleic acid replication nelson et al 2018 leading to virus inactivation and transmission interruption furthermore for e coli the intracellular proteins of cat sod and na k atp increased for an early exposure time 30 min and subsequently decreased while total intracellular protein continuously decreased fig 6c1 this is because bacteria may induce an adaptive regulatory response in the short term nelson et al 2018 to protect against or repair damage from cao2 treatment while further treatment with cao2 may severely disrupt the cell wall and membrane and cause the outflux of proteins the monotonic increase in extracellular proteins further implies the destruction of cell walls and membranes and the outflux of substances subsequently fig 6c2 for vcsm13 the decrease in total inner protein and the increase in total outer protein after 30 min of exposure suggests that the structure of the viral capsid may have been destroyed fig 6c3 the total protein in e coli and vcsm13 was decreased in the intracellular and increased in the extracellular fig 6c suggesting the protein leakage from the cell and then combined with the morphological damage of e coli and vcsm13 after 2 h cao2 treatment fig 6 a b further confirmed the hrs generated during cao2 hydrolysis destructed the cell wall and membrane of e coli and the capsid of vcsm13 however it is difficult to identify which particular hrs or combination of hrs was responsible for the irreversible damage to specific structures since many types of damage as well as stress responses may coincide 3 5 extensive cao2 inactivation of gram positive bacterium s aureus extensive cao2 inactivation of gram positive s aureus was also conducted s aureus was effectively inactivated by cao2 fig s7a as validated by first order decay kinetics r2 0 92 with a greater k value 0 432 0 084 min 1 than that of e coli 0 302 0 080 min 1 at 1 mm of cao2 fig 7 a because the additional outer membrane of gram negative e coli may protect exogenous damage whereas such pretention is not anticipated for gram positive s aureus meanwhile gram negative bacteria pose a differential cellular wall from gram positive bacteria which may provide more protection from exogenous damage maraccini et al 2016 furthermore s aureus inactivation micromechanisms was revealed oh 32 oh 42 h2o2 13 and o2 12 contributed to k fig 7 b c additionally tem of s aureus in fig 7e suggests that the bacterial cell underwent lysis compared to the intact bacteria fig 7d meanwhile the cell wall and plasma membrane looked loose after 2 h exposure of cao2 at 1 mm fig 7 e f in all cao2 was effective for all of the tested pathogen indicators covering a wide spectrum of pathogens including gram negative e coli gram positive s aureus and vcsm13 implying that cao2 may be an efficacious disinfectant for various species of microbial pathogens 3 6 environmental implications the alkalinity and oxidability of cao2 in solid allows consideration of its application as a disinfectant in waters meanwhile the external environmental factors may affect the cao2 inactivation of pathogens in the natural waters for instance sunlight may further enhance cao2 inactivation of pathogens considering 1 sunlight itself inactivation of water borne pathogens nelson et al 2018 2 activating cao2 to generate increased levels of oh zheng et al 2019 to inactivate pathogens and o2 generated from cao2 promoting the production of singlet oxygen 1o2 nelson et al 2018 wenk et al 2019 fig s8 reveals that the natural sunlight dramatically increased the k of e coli 0 1 mm cao2 and vcsm13 4 mm cao2 by 205 and 2261 respectively as compared to k with sole cao2 the time for 100 inactivation of e coli and vcsm13 was shortened to 30 min and 5 min respectively therefore combined with sunlight the dosage of cao2 could be greatly reduced improving its economic potential for engineering applications used in water reuse systems notably the inactivation of bacteria and viruses in different environments is multifactorial physiological differences of pathogens may influence their susceptibility to cao2 treatment due to varying responses to stress nelson et al 2018 which have proven difficult to assess nelson et al 2018 wenk et al 2019 additional studies are needed to assess the damage of cao2 to specific structures in bacteria and viruses to better characterize which mechanisms lead to inactivation 4 conclusions cao2 could effectively inactivate e coli s aureus and vcsm13 in sw with 100 efficiencies under 1 1 and 4 mm of cao2 in 120 min for e coli and vcsm13 environmental prevalent ions such as co3 2 hco3 cl so4 2 and fe3 had insignificant influence on their inactivation except that cu2 substantially promoted the inactivation besides ha and fa induced a negative effect on e coli inactivation but little effect on vcsm13 inactivation furthermore the inactivation of pathogen indicators was attributed to the oh 32 58 and oh 34 42 followed by h2o2 13 20 and o2 10 12 epr test ascertained the existence of oh and o2 in the cao2 inactivation of sw meanwhile hrs ss and second order k hrs p were calculated and the corresponding hrs induced micromechnism model was validated with exposure of cao2 results of tem reveal e coli and s aureu underwent the disruption of cell membrane and wall and vcsm13 underwent disruption of the capsid the inner proteins decreased while the outer protein increased during cao2 process which further indicates the damage of cao2 to bacterial cell wall and membrane and virus capsid given the excellent inactivation on the pathogen indictors cao2 can be applied as an emerging disinfectant in surface water systems moreover the environmental factors such as sunlight may significantly promote cao2 to increase inactivated efficiencies of pathogen indicators however further investigation is needed to characterize the inactivation mechanisms of cao2 to specific structures in bacteria and viruses declaration of competing interest the authors

16329,bacterioplankton play an important role in the biogeochemical cycling in rivers the dynamics of hydrologic conditions in rivers were believed to affect geographic pattern and assembly process of these microorganisms which have not been widely investigated in this study the geographic pattern and assembly process of bacterioplankton community in river networks of the taihu basin were systematically explored using amplicon sequencing of the 16s rrna gene the results showed that the diversity structure and taxonomic composition of bacterioplankton community all exhibited significant temporal variation during wet normal and dry seasons p 0 01 the neutral community model and null model were applied to reveal the assembly process of bacterioplankton community the stochastic process and deterministic process both shaped the bacterioplankton community with greater influence of deterministic process in addition the abundant and rare bacterioplankton communities were comparatively analyzed the abundant and rare bacterioplankton communities exhibited similar temporal dynamics principal coordinates analysis and spatial variations distance decay relationship indicating similar geographic patterns meanwhile distinct assembly processes were observed for the abundant and rare bacterioplankton communities stochastic process dispersal limitation shaped the abundant bacterioplankton community while deterministic process heterogeneous selection dominated the assembly process of rare bacterioplankton community mantel test redundancy analysis and correlation analysis together indicated that ph and dissolved oxygen were the major environmental attributes that affected thestructure and assembly process of bacterioplankton community these results expanded

et al 2006 and play crucial roles in ecological services baron et al 2002 lotic ecosystems e g rivers and lentic ecosystem e g lakes are fundamental components of aquatic environments and they are essential for biogeochemical cycling human development activities agriculture industry urbanization pose more effects on environmental variables of lotic ecosystems leading to their environmental conditions more complex and dynamic compared to lentic ecosystem chen et al 2019b therefore revealing the dynamics of lotic ecosystems could enhance our understanding of the ecological process in aquatic environments rivers in the subtropical region of china experience remarkable wet normal dry cycles annually during wet season the rivers are mainly supplied by rainfall while during dry season the rivers are mainly supplied by groundwater normal season is the transition season between wet season and dry season the wet normal dry cycles leads to dynamic hydrologic and environmental conditions which were found to affect the riverine microeukatyotic communities in a pronounced manner chen et al 2019b besides microeukaryota bacterioplankton are also a major driver of biogeochemical cycles in rivers including nutrients cycling and pollutants degradation madsen 2011 therefore it is reasonable to expect that the bacterioplankton community could vary across different hydrologic periods the assembly process of bacterial community that shape the bacterial diversity is a central topic in aquatic environments with great ecological importance niche theory and neutral theory are two critical and complementary mechanisms for discerning the assembly process of bacterial community the niche theory believes that bacterial communities are largely controlled by deterministic factors including abiotic factors e g ph temperature oxygen and biotic factors e g competition mutualism predation lima mendez et al 2015 vanwonterghem et al 2014 in contrast the neutral theory assumes that stochastic processes birth death speciation limited dispersal and immigration dominantly shape bacterial diversity chave 2004 hubbell 2005 zhou and ning 2017 currently most of the prior studies focused on the assembly process of bacterial community in lentic ecosystems liu et al 2015 wan et al 2021 wu et al 2018 zhao et al 2017 and far less is known about the assembly process of bacterial community in lotic ecosystems a previous study showed that deterministic process shaped the bacterioplankton communities during dry season in a human impacted river isabwe et al 2018 however in the subtropical region of china rivers are interconnected with each other and it is difficult to make broad generalizations based on the observation of a single river river networks consist of several rivers with close geographic location and connectivity making them ideal targets for investigating the assembly process of bacterial community in lotic ecosystems in both natural and artificial ecosystems bacteria typically present a skewed abundance distribution a relatively limited number of high abundance bacteria abundant taxa co occurred with a large number of low abundance bacteria rare taxa jia et al 2018 the abundant taxa generally contributed major functions in ecosystems due to their high abundance kim et al 2013a in addition recent studies found some rare taxa were metabolically active in environments lynch and neufeld 2015 and they were taken as the major drivers for ecosystem multifunctionality chen et al 2020 therefore the rare taxa may also be of great importance to ecological functions in ecosystems a previous study revealed that theabundant and rare taxa exhibited similar geographic patterns in coastal antarctic lakes logares et al 2013 in contrast different patterns of the abundant and rare taxa were observed in an artificial bioreactor kim et al 2013a these results indicated the abundant and rare taxa may have distinct patterns in different ecosystems however in lotic ecosystems our knowledge of bacterial community was mainly focused on whole taxa lu et al 2021 staley et al 2013 with the respective roles of abundant and rare taxa remaining unclarified in this study the bacterioplankton community in river networks of the taihu basin during wet normal and dry seasons was analyzed using the amplicon sequencing approach the diversity geographic pattern and assembly process of the bacterioplankton community were investigated to separately address 1 does the bacterioplankton community exhibit spatiotemporal dynamics across different seasons 2 does the abundant and rare bacterioplankton exhibit similar geographic patterns under different hydrologic conditions 3 are the abundant and rare bacterioplankton communities assembled via similar processes 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection and environmental attributes analysis the taihu basin located in subtropical region of china covers an area of 36 900 km2 this region is one of the world s famous water towns and there are at least 15 rivers in this region with a total length of 120 000 km these rivers are interconnected with each other forming dense river networks of 3 2 km km2 water samples were collected from four crisscrossing rivers 18 sampling sites in the taihu basin during wet july 2020 normal october 2020 and dry january 2021 seasons figure s1 we failed to obtain water samples from two sampling sites in july due to unforeseen reasons and a total of 52 samples were obtained in this study table s1 at each sampling site 2 l surface water was immediately filtered through 0 22 μm polycarbonate membrane and an additional 1 l water was transported to the laboratory on ice for environmental attributes analyses within one day the ph and dissolved oxygen do were measured using a water quality analyzer hach usa total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp phosphate phosphorus po4 3 p ammonia nitrogen nh4 n nitrate nitrogen no3 n and nitrite nitrogen no2 n were determined colorimetrically by a spectrophotometer hach usa water samples were digested by k2s2o8 before the tn and tp analysis for the total suspended solid tss analysis water samples were firstly filtered through a 0 45 μm polycarbonate membrane and then weighed after drying at 105 c for 6 h the environmental attributes of each sample were listed in table s2 2 2 dna extraction pcr amplification and sequencing microbial dna was extracted by the fastdna spin kit for soil mp biomedicals usa the concentration and purity of the extracted dna were measured by the qubit fluorometer thermo scientific usa and nanodrop 2000 thermo scientific usa respectively the bacterioplankton communities were profiled by amplicon sequencing of the 16s rrna gene the v4 region of bacterial 16s rrna gene was amplified by the universal primer pair 515f 806r caporaso et al 2011 the pcr products were initially checked by agarose electrophoresis 1 and then purified by qiaquick pcr purification kit qiagen germany the purified pcr products were then pooled together in equal amount and sequenced on the illumina s novaseq 6000 platform at the novogene beijing china all of the raw sequencing data have been deposited in the genome sequence archive in national genomics data center https ngdc cncb ac cn gsa under accession number cra004387 2 3 sequencing data processing the raw sequencing data were firstly quality checked by fastqc tool http www bioinformatics babraham ac uk projects fastqc to ensure that the data were of good quality and suitable for the following analysis then sequencing data was processed using usearch software version 11 0 667 edgar 2010 the pair end reads were merged together by overlapping reads followed by removal of chimeras and trimming off low quality reads the merged reads were clustered into different operational taxonomy units otus at 97 similarity level using the uparse algorithm edgar 2013 a representative sequence from each otu was selected for taxonomic annotation against the ribosomal database project rdp 16s rrna gene training set version 18 using the bayesian classifier at 80 confidence level wang et al 2007 afterward all chloroplast archaeal eukaryotic and unknown sequences were discarded before further analysis to reduce the potential of pcr bias otus with less than 5 sequences were removed and the sequence number was finally rarefied to 42 196 per sample for downstream analyses in this study the abundant and rare bacterioplankton communities were clarifiedfollowing a previous method jiao and lu 2020a the abundant bacterioplankton community consisted of otus with relative abundances higher than 0 1 and the rare bacterioplankton community comprised of otus with relative abundances less than 0 01 the typical otus top 20 most abundant from the abundant and rare bacterioplankton communities were selected for phylogenetic analysis by mega7 software using neighbor joining method 1000 bootstrap replicates kumar et al 2016 and further modified by ggtree package version 2 0 4 in r software version 3 6 2 yu et al 2017 2 4 statistical analysis all of the following analyses were performed in r software version 3 6 2 unless otherwise indicated the α diversity index shannon diversity index for each sample and β diversity index bray curtis distance for each pairwise sample were calculated using vegan package version 2 5 6 one way anova followed by duncan s honestly significant difference test was used to compare the α diversity and β diversity among different seasons by agricolae package version 1 3 1 the linear discriminant analysis lda followed by kruskal wallis test was performed to identify the significant biomarker taxa using the online pipeline http huttenhower sph harvard edu galaxy segata et al 2011 the principal coordinates analysis pcoa based on bray curtis distance was performed to show the profile of bacterioplankton community using vegan package version 2 5 6 the geographic distance between each pairwise sampling site was calculated by geosphere package version 1 5 10 using the longitude and latitude data and the distance decay relationship was calculated as the slope of an ordinary least squares regression between geographic distance and bray curtis similariy 1 bray curtis distance the neutral community model was used to determine the potential roles of stochastic processes in the assembly process of bacterial community by predicting the relationship between detection frequency and relative abundance of each otu sloan et al 2006 the fit of the neutral community model r2 was calculated by miceco package version 1 2 1 and positive r2 indicated the fit of neutral community model then the null model analysis 999 randomizations was performed to quantify the relative contributions of stochastic and deterministic processes for the assembly process of bacterial community stegen et al 2013 the beta nearest taxon index βnti and the bray curtis based raup crick metric rcbray were calculated by picante package version 1 8 2 the βnti values less than 2 indicated homogeneous selection whereas values higher than 2 indicated heterogeneous selection zhou and ning 2017 for the βnti values between 2 and 2 the rcbray values less than 0 95 represented homogenous dispersal values higher than 0 95 represented dispersal limitation and the remaining parts represented undominated fraction zhou and ning 2017 to further reveal the influence of dispersal limitation on assembly process of bacterial community the habitat niche breadth levins index was calculated using spaa package version 0 2 2 to illustrate the impacts of environmental attributes on the community structure mantel correlation analysis and redundancy analysis rda was performed the environmental preferences of representative otus from the abundant and rare bacterioplankton communities were analyzed based on the spearman correlation coefficients by hmisc package version 4 3 0 network analysis based on spearman correlation coefficients was applied to visualize the co occurrence among otus to simplify the network for a better visualization only the otus that occurred in more than 60 of the samples were retained the spearman correlation coefficients were calculated by the hmisc package version 4 3 0 and the correlation was considered robust when the correlation coefficient r was higher than 0 85 and p was less than 0 01 the p values were adjusted by the false discovery rate method benjamini and hochberg 1995 to reduce the chances of obtaining false positive results the visualization and topological analysis of the network was performed on the gephi software version 0 9 2 bastian et al 2009 3 results 3 1 dynamics of bacterioplankton community composition and diversity in this study a sampling companion was carried out on river networks of the taihu basin during wet normal and dry seasons after amplicon sequencing of the bacterial 16s rrna gene followed by the quality checking and sequences filtering a total of 3416 477 high quality sequences were obtained which could be clustered into 16 443 otus most of the otus 15 423 otus belonged to bacteria domain and the low abundance otus total sequence 5 were then removed to reduce the potential pcr bias a total of 9 500 bacterial otus were finally obtained and the number of sequences per sample ranged from 42 196 to 76 114 to fairly compare all the samples at the same sequencing depth the sequence number was finally rarefied to 42 196 for downstream analysis for each sample 1 386 4 742 otus were obtained and the shannon diversity ranged from 2 74 to 6 62 comparison of the shannon diversity index revealed that the diversity of the bacterioplankton community exhibited temporal dynamics and it was more diverse in wet and normal seasons than dry season fig 1 a the representative sequence from each otu was blasted to different phylogenetic taxa against the rdp database proteobacteria exhibited the highest otu richness 29 3 of otus and it was the most abundant bacterial phylum for most of the samples 80 8 accounting for 27 8 to 77 0 of the total bacterial sequences in each sample with an overall abundance of 48 4 actinobacteria cyanobacteria and bacteroidetes were also predominant in the bacterioplankton community with an abundance 10 of the total bacterial sequences fig 1b temporal variation of the taxonomic composition was also observed the lda followed by kruskal wallis test revealed that planctomycetes omnitrophica and bacteroidetes were the most significant biomarker taxa during wet normal and dry seasons respectively p 0 05 fig 1c the abundant and rare bacterioplankton communities were comparatively analyzed a total of 149 abundant otus total abundance 70 1 and 8 697 rare otus total abundance 10 9 were selected for abundant community and rare community respectively similar to the whole bacterioplankton community proteobacteria also exhibited the highest otu richness 50 3 in abundant community and 28 2 in rare community and it was the most abundant phylum in both abundant community and rare community accounting for 52 2 and 33 5 of total sequences respectively figure s2 3 2 dynamics of bacterioplankton community structure the bray curtis index was calculated to show the similarity distance for each pairwise sample as shown in figure s3 the bray curtis index exhibited temporal dynamics the samples in wet season showed the highest similarity while those in normal season were the lowest in addition the community similarity was found to decrease with increasing geographic distance during wet and normal seasons these results revealed that the bacterioplankton community structure exhibited spatial variation with a distance decay pattern fig 2 similar distance decay patterns were also observed in the abundant and rare communities indicating the abundant and rare community structures also exhibited spatial variations moreover the distance decay pattern was found to be more significant during dry season fig 2b p 0 001 than wet season fig 2a p 0 05 which were consistent for the whole abundant and rare bacterioplankton communities notably no significant distance decay pattern was observed during the normal period figure s4 p 0 05 pcoa plot based on the bray curtis distance was shown in fig 3 a samples from the same season were grouped together and the samples from different seasons were clearly separated meanwhile similar profiles were observed for the abundant and rare bacterioplankton communities fig 3a showing that the structures of abundant and rare bacterioplankton communities exhibited similar temporal variations notably the venn diagram showed that almost all of the otus 96 6 were shared for the abundant bacterioplankton community and no otus were unique among three seasons fig 3b on the contrary 30 6 of the otus for the rare bacterioplankton community were found to be unique among three seasons fig 3b this observation indicated that the biodiversity pattern largely differed between abundant and rare bacterioplankton communities 3 3 co occurrence pattern of bacterioplankton community based on the spearman correlation coefficients the co occurrence network of the bacterioplankton community was generated fig 4 a most of the edges 90 7 in this network were positive indicating that positive relationships accounted for almost all of the bacterioplankton community this network consisted of 16 modules with top 4 major modules accounting for 74 7 of the nodes among these 4 major modules 77 6 of the nodes were assigned as actinobacteria cyanobacteria bacteroidetes and proteobacteria of which proteobacteria exhibited the highest percentage except in module ii fig 4b in addition the co occurrence networks for wet and dry seasons were also built fig 4c the topological properties indicated that the bacterioplankton community had a more complex network during dry season and it was less connected during wet season table s3 3 4 assembly process of bacterioplankton community the neutral community model was applied to explore the assembly process of bacterioplankton community overall the neutral community model fitted well for the whole bacterioplankton community showing that stochastic process played an unneglectable role in the assembly process of bacterioplankton community fig 5 a in addition the neutral community model also fitted well for the abundant bacterioplankton community while it could not fit the rare bacterioplankton community r2 0 table s4 showing that stochastic process was the major process in shaping the abundant bacterioplankton community rather than the rare bacterioplankton community to further explore the relative contributions of stochastic and deterministic processes the null model was applied based on the βnti and rcbray fig 5b the majority of βnti values 72 1 were less than 2 or higher than 2 showing that deterministic process played a more important role in the assembly process of bacterioplankton community than stochastic process among deterministic process heterogeneous selection 53 6 rather than homogeneous selection 16 8 was the most crucial process for the assembly process of bacterioplankton community in addition contrasting assembly processes were observed for the abundant and rare bacterioplankton communities fig 5b stochastic process mainly the dispersal limitation process dominated the assembly process of the abundant bacterioplankton communities fig 5b especially during wet season as nearly all of the βnti values 99 2 were between 2 and 2 showing strong effects of stochastic process on the community assembly figure s5 on the contrary deterministic process shaped the rare bacterioplankton community and it was mainly attributed to heterogeneous selection 47 6 and homogeneous selection 24 1 fig 5b furthermore higher values of habitat niche breadth were observed in the abundant bacterioplankton community compared with the rare bacterioplankton community figure s6 confirming that abundant bacterioplankton taxa were more likely to be limited for dispersal in this study all of the environmental attributes exhibited significant temporal variation figure s7 mantel test was further used to reveal which environmental variables were significantly correlated with the bacterioplankton community fig 5c the do and ph exhibited the strongest relationships with the bacterioplankton community r 0 4 p 0 001 for the whole and rare bacterioplankton communities the do ph tn nh4 n no3 n tp and tss showed significant correlations with the bacterioplankton composition r 0 2 p 0 001 for the abundant bacterioplankton community the do ph tn no3 n tp and tss had strong and significant correlations with bacterioplankton community composition r 0 2 p 0 001 while the nh4 n and po4 3 p showed relatively weaker relationships r 0 2 p 0 05 these results indicated that bacterioplankton responded sensitively to environmental variations to further understand the response of bacterioplankton to environmental variations the typical otus top 20 most abundant from the abundant and rare bacterioplankton communities were selected and their responses to environmental attributes were analyzed fig 6 overall the selected abundant taxa 62 8 had a similar level of environmental associations as compared with the rare taxa 55 6 in addition 42 5 and 40 of the selected abundant and rare taxa had close and positive relations with do and ph respectively implying the strong effects of do and ph on bacterial taxa the rda plot revealed that the do and ph had significant effects on the bacterioplankton community structures whole abundant and rare communities based on the 999 permutations of the monte carlo test figure s8 p 0 001 furthermore the variations of do and ph had positively linear relationships with the βnti values figure s9 p 0 001 these results together indicated that among the environmental attributes measured in this study the do and ph were the most important environmental attributes affecting the structure and assembly process of bacterioplankton community 4 discussion 4 1 spatiotemporal dynamics of bacterioplankton community the dynamics of bacterioplankton community in aquatic environments has recently received a great deal of attentions in microbial ecology nemergut et al 2013 this study contributed to our understanding of the spatiotemporal variations of bacterioplankton communities induced by different hydrologic conditions in river networks and provided some clues for the underlying mechanisms in agreement with our expectations the α diversity β diversity and taxonomic composition of the bacterioplankton community all exhibited temporal variation fig 1a figure s3 and fig 1c meanwhile the pcoa ordinations revealed that the bacterioplankton community structure also exhibited temporal variationby showing that the bacterioplankton communities from the same season could be clustered together fig 3a similar observations were reported for the bacterioplankton community in an estuarine ecosystem zhou et al 2021 and microeukaryotic community in a subtropical river chen et al 2019b several reasons may explain this observation firstly different hydrologic conditions during wet normal and dry seasons led to different environmental conditions which could further affect the structure and diversity of bacterioplankton community in this study all of the environmental attributes were found be statistically different during wet normal and dry seasons figure s7 and close relationships between the environmental attributes and bacterioplankton community were observed fig 5c secondly the four crisscrossing rivers in this study were interconnected and the bacterioplankton tended to be exchanged among them leading to seasonal clusters in pcoa ordinations thirdly precipitation primarily occurred during wet season in this region the precipitation could wash the microorganisms from surrounding environmental systems e g soil sediment watershed and air into the rivers mo et al 2021 nyirabuhoro et al 2021 leading to higher bacterial diversity during wet season however the seasonal cycling is an annually repeated process in this region and whether the dynamics of bacterioplankton community is an annually repeated process require long term investigation in the future meanwhile spatial variation was also found to affect the bacterioplankton communities to some extent a significant distance decay pattern was observed for the bacterioplankton community during wet and dry seasons and the distance decay relationship was weaker during wet season than dry season fig 3 in a subtropical river the distance decay relationship of microeukaryotic community was also found to be weaker during dry season chen et al 2019b in addition the co occurrence network showed that the bacterial interactions were weaker during wet season than dry season fig 4c and table s3 which was similar to the observation in an estuarine ecosystem zhou et al 2021 this result was not surprising due to the dispersal ability of bacteria was promoted by higher rate of river flow during wet season resulting in higher community similarity during wet season than dry seasons figure s3 this result also implied that precipitation might lead to random distribution of bacterial community rather than establish close interactions 4 2 geographic patterns of abundant and rare bacterioplankton communities several recent studies have illustrated that rare microbial community may be of great importance to ecological functions in ecosystems chen et al 2019b chen et al 2020 jiao and lu 2020a 2020b lynch and neufeld 2015 wan et al 2021 in this study the abundant and rare bacterioplankton communities were comparatively analyzed the abundant and rare bacterioplankton communities exhibited similar temporal and spatial variations fig 2 and fig 3a indicating that they had similar geographic patterns this observation was consistent with previous studies focusing on bacterioplankton communities in bays mo et al 2018 and lakes liao et al 2017 as well as microeukaryotic communities in a subtropical river chen et al 2019b the similar geographic patterns suggested that the abundant and rare bacterioplankton communities might respond to the environmental changes in a similar way this speculation was approved by the observation that the typical otus of abundant and rare bacterioplankton communities showed similar relationships with environmental attributes fig 6 a previous study also suggested that abundant and rare taxa have comparable environmental sensitivity in aquatic ecosystem logares et al 2013 however different patterns of abundant and rare bacterial communities were observed in an artificial bioreactor kim et al 2013a these differences might due to the different ecosystems natural and artificial and in aquatic environments rare microbial community might exhibit a similar geographic pattern to abundant microbial community 4 3 assembly process of bacterioplankton community the bacterioplankton community exhibited spatiotemporal dynamics indicating that the assembly process might vary periodically the neutral community model and null model were applied to further confirm this speculation the neutral community model fitted well for the bacterioplankton community with a moderate fitted value r2 0 67 fig 5a the fitted value indicated that stochastic process played only a moderate role in the community assembly process by comparing with other studies chen et al 2019b zhang et al 2021b further the null model confirmed this by showing that stochastic process was responsible for 27 9 of the community assembly process and the remaining was deterministic process fig 5b during wet season stochastic process was the major process while deterministic process dominated during normal and dry seasons figure s5 these results were in agreement with the hydrologic conditions in which the dispersal event stochastic process occurred more easily in wet season together with precipitation but it was relatively limited during the other two seasons in this study the abundant and rare bacterioplankton communities were found to be assembled via distinct processes dispersal limitation mainly shaped the abundant bacterioplankton community while environmental selection heterogeneous selection and homogeneous selection dominated the assembly process of rare bacterioplankton community this result was supported by previous studies in which the abundant taxa were mainly limited by dispersal in lakes and reservoirs liu et al 2015 pacific ocean wu et al 2017 mangrove zhang et al 2021b and agricultural soils jiao and lu 2020a 2020b there were two possible reasons that may explain this observation firstly the abundant bacterioplankton taxa were more likely to be involved in a dispersal event due to more individuals resulting in wide distribution of abundant taxa jiao and lu 2020b the venn diagram confirmed this by showing that most of the otus of abundant bacterioplankton communities were shared fig 3b secondly the abundant bacterioplankton had wider niche breadth than the rare bacterioplankton figure s6 the taxa with wider niche breadth may be limited by the chances to reach multiple locations zhang et al 2021b on the contrary the taxa with narrower habit niche breadth would face stronger environmental selection wu et al 2017 leading to deterministic process being the dominant assembly process for rare bacterioplankton community furthermore multiple statistical methods including mantel test rda and correlation analysis were performed to reveal the major environmental attributes affecting the bacterioplankton community structure and assembly process among the environmental attributes measured in this study do and ph were found to be the most important factors affecting the structure and assembly process of bacterioplankton community fig 5c figure s8 and figure s9 this result was reasonable for the following reasons in this study the do concentration varied significantly figure s7 ranging from 5 52 0 69 in wet season to 7 17 0 86 in dry season do was well recognized as a critical factor for bacterial taxa due to its impact on bacterial activity and the specific selection of distinct bacterial lineages by do concentration was well known wang et al 2012 similarly ph changed significantly under different hydrological conditions figure s7 ph was believed to be an independent driver of bacterial diversity lauber et al 2009 and any significant deviation in environmental ph can impose stress on these single cell microorganisms it was found to play an important role in shaping the bacterial community structure chodak et al 2013 fierer and jackson 2006 xu et al 2017 in this study ph was found to affect not only the diversity but also the assembly process of bacterial community a recent study confirmed this by showing that ph could regulate the assembly process of bacterial community through environmental filtering jiao and lu 2020a 5 conclusion in this study the dynamics of the bacterioplankton community during wet normal and dry seasons in river networks of the taihu basin were analyzed by amplicon sequencing and multiple statistical analyses the diversity structure and taxonomic composition of bacterioplankton community exhibited temporal dynamics the abundant and rare bacterioplankton communities were comparatively analyzed and they were found to exhibit similar geographic patterns with spatiotemporal variations stochastic process mainly shaped the abundant bacterioplankton community while deterministic process dominated the assembly process of rare bacterioplankton community these results indicated that the abundant and rare bacterioplankton communities responded similarly to the variation of hydrologic conditions via distinct assembly processes credit authorship contribution statement tao zhang sampling formal analysis

studies focused on the assembly process of bacterial community in lentic ecosystems liu et al 2015 wan et al 2021 wu et al 2018 zhao et al 2017 and far less is known about the assembly process of bacterial community in lotic ecosystems a previous study showed that deterministic process shaped the bacterioplankton communities during dry season in a human impacted river isabwe et al 2018 however in the subtropical region of china rivers are interconnected with each other and it is difficult to make broad generalizations based on the observation of a single river river networks consist of several rivers with close geographic location and connectivity making them ideal targets for investigating the assembly process of bacterial community in lotic ecosystems in both natural and artificial ecosystems bacteria typically present a skewed abundance distribution a relatively limited number of high abundance bacteria abundant taxa co occurred with a large number of low abundance bacteria rare taxa jia et al 2018 the abundant taxa generally contributed major functions in ecosystems due to their high abundance kim et al 2013a in addition recent studies found some rare taxa were metabolically active in environments lynch and neufeld 2015 and they were taken as the major drivers for ecosystem multifunctionality chen et al 2020 therefore the rare taxa may also be of great importance to ecological functions in ecosystems a previous study revealed that theabundant and rare taxa exhibited similar geographic patterns in coastal antarctic lakes logares et al 2013 in contrast different patterns of the abundant and rare taxa were observed in an artificial bioreactor kim et al 2013a these results indicated the abundant and rare taxa may have distinct patterns in different ecosystems however in lotic ecosystems our knowledge of bacterial community was mainly focused on whole taxa lu et al 2021 staley et al 2013 with the respective roles of abundant and rare taxa remaining unclarified in this study the bacterioplankton community in river networks of the taihu basin during wet normal and dry seasons was analyzed using the amplicon sequencing approach the diversity geographic pattern and assembly process of the bacterioplankton community were investigated to separately address 1 does the bacterioplankton community exhibit spatiotemporal dynamics across different seasons 2 does the abundant and rare bacterioplankton exhibit similar geographic patterns under different hydrologic conditions 3 are the abundant and rare bacterioplankton communities assembled via similar processes 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection and environmental attributes analysis the taihu basin located in subtropical region of china covers an area of 36 900 km2 this region is one of the world s famous water towns and there are at least 15 rivers in this region with a total length of 120 000 km these rivers are interconnected with each other forming dense river networks of 3 2 km km2 water samples were collected from four crisscrossing rivers 18 sampling sites in the taihu basin during wet july 2020 normal october 2020 and dry january 2021 seasons figure s1 we failed to obtain water samples from two sampling sites in july due to unforeseen reasons and a total of 52 samples were obtained in this study table s1 at each sampling site 2 l surface water was immediately filtered through 0 22 μm polycarbonate membrane and an additional 1 l water was transported to the laboratory on ice for environmental attributes analyses within one day the ph and dissolved oxygen do were measured using a water quality analyzer hach usa total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp phosphate phosphorus po4 3 p ammonia nitrogen nh4 n nitrate nitrogen no3 n and nitrite nitrogen no2 n were determined colorimetrically by a spectrophotometer hach usa water samples were digested by k2s2o8 before the tn and tp analysis for the total suspended solid tss analysis water samples were firstly filtered through a 0 45 μm polycarbonate membrane and then weighed after drying at 105 c for 6 h the environmental attributes of each sample were listed in table s2 2 2 dna extraction pcr amplification and sequencing microbial dna was extracted by the fastdna spin kit for soil mp biomedicals usa the concentration and purity of the extracted dna were measured by the qubit fluorometer thermo scientific usa and nanodrop 2000 thermo scientific usa respectively the bacterioplankton communities were profiled by amplicon sequencing of the 16s rrna gene the v4 region of bacterial 16s rrna gene was amplified by the universal primer pair 515f 806r caporaso et al 2011 the pcr products were initially checked by agarose electrophoresis 1 and then purified by qiaquick pcr purification kit qiagen germany the purified pcr products were then pooled together in equal amount and sequenced on the illumina s novaseq 6000 platform at the novogene beijing china all of the raw sequencing data have been deposited in the genome sequence archive in national genomics data center https ngdc cncb ac cn gsa under accession number cra004387 2 3 sequencing data processing the raw sequencing data were firstly quality checked by fastqc tool http www bioinformatics babraham ac uk projects fastqc to ensure that the data were of good quality and suitable for the following analysis then sequencing data was processed using usearch software version 11 0 667 edgar 2010 the pair end reads were merged together by overlapping reads followed by removal of chimeras and trimming off low quality reads the merged reads were clustered into different operational taxonomy units otus at 97 similarity level using the uparse algorithm edgar 2013 a representative sequence from each otu was selected for taxonomic annotation against the ribosomal database project rdp 16s rrna gene training set version 18 using the bayesian classifier at 80 confidence level wang et al 2007 afterward all chloroplast archaeal eukaryotic and unknown sequences were discarded before further analysis to reduce the potential of pcr bias otus with less than 5 sequences were removed and the sequence number was finally rarefied to 42 196 per sample for downstream analyses in this study the abundant and rare bacterioplankton communities were clarifiedfollowing a previous method jiao and lu 2020a the abundant bacterioplankton community consisted of otus with relative abundances higher than 0 1 and the rare bacterioplankton community comprised of otus with relative abundances less than 0 01 the typical otus top 20 most abundant from the abundant and rare bacterioplankton communities were selected for phylogenetic analysis by mega7 software using neighbor joining method 1000 bootstrap replicates kumar et al 2016 and further modified by ggtree package version 2 0 4 in r software version 3 6 2 yu et al 2017 2 4 statistical analysis all of the following analyses were performed in r software version 3 6 2 unless otherwise indicated the α diversity index shannon diversity index for each sample and β diversity index bray curtis distance for each pairwise sample were calculated using vegan package version 2 5 6 one way anova followed by duncan s honestly significant difference test was used to compare the α diversity and β diversity among different seasons by agricolae package version 1 3 1 the linear discriminant analysis lda followed by kruskal wallis test was performed to identify the significant biomarker taxa using the online pipeline http huttenhower sph harvard edu galaxy segata et al 2011 the principal coordinates analysis pcoa based on bray curtis distance was performed to show the profile of bacterioplankton community using vegan package version 2 5 6 the geographic distance between each pairwise sampling site was calculated by geosphere package version 1 5 10 using the longitude and latitude data and the distance decay relationship was calculated as the slope of an ordinary least squares regression between geographic distance and bray curtis similariy 1 bray curtis distance the neutral community model was used to determine the potential roles of stochastic processes in the assembly process of bacterial community by predicting the relationship between detection frequency and relative abundance of each otu sloan et al 2006 the fit of the neutral community model r2 was calculated by miceco package version 1 2 1 and positive r2 indicated the fit of neutral community model then the null model analysis 999 randomizations was performed to quantify the relative contributions of stochastic and deterministic processes for the assembly process of bacterial community stegen et al 2013 the beta nearest taxon index βnti and the bray curtis based raup crick metric rcbray were calculated by picante package version 1 8 2 the βnti values less than 2 indicated homogeneous selection whereas values higher than 2 indicated heterogeneous selection zhou and ning 2017 for the βnti values between 2 and 2 the rcbray values less than 0 95 represented homogenous dispersal values higher than 0 95 represented dispersal limitation and the remaining parts represented undominated fraction zhou and ning 2017 to further reveal the influence of dispersal limitation on assembly process of bacterial community the habitat niche breadth levins index was calculated using spaa package version 0 2 2 to illustrate the impacts of environmental attributes on the community structure mantel correlation analysis and redundancy analysis rda was performed the environmental preferences of representative otus from the abundant and rare bacterioplankton communities were analyzed based on the spearman correlation coefficients by hmisc package version 4 3 0 network analysis based on spearman correlation coefficients was applied to visualize the co occurrence among otus to simplify the network for a better visualization only the otus that occurred in more than 60 of the samples were retained the spearman correlation coefficients were calculated by the hmisc package version 4 3 0 and the correlation was considered robust when the correlation coefficient r was higher than 0 85 and p was less than 0 01 the p values were adjusted by the false discovery rate method benjamini and hochberg 1995 to reduce the chances of obtaining false positive results the visualization and topological analysis of the network was performed on the gephi software version 0 9 2 bastian et al 2009 3 results 3 1 dynamics of bacterioplankton community composition and diversity in this study a sampling companion was carried out on river networks of the taihu basin during wet normal and dry seasons after amplicon sequencing of the bacterial 16s rrna gene followed by the quality checking and sequences filtering a total of 3416 477 high quality sequences were obtained which could be clustered into 16 443 otus most of the otus 15 423 otus belonged to bacteria domain and the low abundance otus total sequence 5 were then removed to reduce the potential pcr bias a total of 9 500 bacterial otus were finally obtained and the number of sequences per sample ranged from 42 196 to 76 114 to fairly compare all the samples at the same sequencing depth the sequence number was finally rarefied to 42 196 for downstream analysis for each sample 1 386 4 742 otus were obtained and the shannon diversity ranged from 2 74 to 6 62 comparison of the shannon diversity index revealed that the diversity of the bacterioplankton community exhibited temporal dynamics and it was more diverse in wet and normal seasons than dry season fig 1 a the representative sequence from each otu was blasted to different phylogenetic taxa against the rdp database proteobacteria exhibited the highest otu richness 29 3 of otus and it was the most abundant bacterial phylum for most of the samples 80 8 accounting for 27 8 to 77 0 of the total bacterial sequences in each sample with an overall abundance of 48 4 actinobacteria cyanobacteria and bacteroidetes were also predominant in the bacterioplankton community with an abundance 10 of the total bacterial sequences fig 1b temporal variation of the taxonomic composition was also observed the lda followed by kruskal wallis test revealed that planctomycetes omnitrophica and bacteroidetes were the most significant biomarker taxa during wet normal and dry seasons respectively p 0 05 fig 1c the abundant and rare bacterioplankton communities were comparatively analyzed a total of 149 abundant otus total abundance 70 1 and 8 697 rare otus total abundance 10 9 were selected for abundant community and rare community respectively similar to the whole bacterioplankton community proteobacteria also exhibited the highest otu richness 50 3 in abundant community and 28 2 in rare community and it was the most abundant phylum in both abundant community and rare community accounting for 52 2 and 33 5 of total sequences respectively figure s2 3 2 dynamics of bacterioplankton community structure the bray curtis index was calculated to show the similarity distance for each pairwise sample as shown in figure s3 the bray curtis index exhibited temporal dynamics the samples in wet season showed the highest similarity while those in normal season were the lowest in addition the community similarity was found to decrease with increasing geographic distance during wet and normal seasons these results revealed that the bacterioplankton community structure exhibited spatial variation with a distance decay pattern fig 2 similar distance decay patterns were also observed in the abundant and rare communities indicating the abundant and rare community structures also exhibited spatial variations moreover the distance decay pattern was found to be more significant during dry season fig 2b p 0 001 than wet season fig 2a p 0 05 which were consistent for the whole abundant and rare bacterioplankton communities notably no significant distance decay pattern was observed during the normal period figure s4 p 0 05 pcoa plot based on the bray curtis distance was shown in fig 3 a samples from the same season were grouped together and the samples from different seasons were clearly separated meanwhile similar profiles were observed for the abundant and rare bacterioplankton communities fig 3a showing that the structures of abundant and rare bacterioplankton communities exhibited similar temporal variations notably the venn diagram showed that almost all of the otus 96 6 were shared for the abundant bacterioplankton community and no otus were unique among three seasons fig 3b on the contrary 30 6 of the otus for the rare bacterioplankton community were found to be unique among three seasons fig 3b this observation indicated that the biodiversity pattern largely differed between abundant and rare bacterioplankton communities 3 3 co occurrence pattern of bacterioplankton community based on the spearman correlation coefficients the co occurrence network of the bacterioplankton community was generated fig 4 a most of the edges 90 7 in this network were positive indicating that positive relationships accounted for almost all of the bacterioplankton community this network consisted of 16 modules with top 4 major modules accounting for 74 7 of the nodes among these 4 major modules 77 6 of the nodes were assigned as actinobacteria cyanobacteria bacteroidetes and proteobacteria of which proteobacteria exhibited the highest percentage except in module ii fig 4b in addition the co occurrence networks for wet and dry seasons were also built fig 4c the topological properties indicated that the bacterioplankton community had a more complex network during dry season and it was less connected during wet season table s3 3 4 assembly process of bacterioplankton community the neutral community model was applied to explore the assembly process of bacterioplankton community overall the neutral community model fitted well for the whole bacterioplankton community showing that stochastic process played an unneglectable role in the assembly process of bacterioplankton community fig 5 a in addition the neutral community model also fitted well for the abundant bacterioplankton community while it could not fit the rare bacterioplankton community r2 0 table s4 showing that stochastic process was the major process in shaping the abundant bacterioplankton community rather than the rare bacterioplankton community to further explore the relative contributions of stochastic and deterministic processes the null model was applied based on the βnti and rcbray fig 5b the majority of βnti values 72 1 were less than 2 or higher than 2 showing that deterministic process played a more important role in the assembly process of bacterioplankton community than stochastic process among deterministic process heterogeneous selection 53 6 rather than homogeneous selection 16 8 was the most crucial process for the assembly process of bacterioplankton community in addition contrasting assembly processes were observed for the abundant and rare bacterioplankton communities fig 5b stochastic process mainly the dispersal limitation process dominated the assembly process of the abundant bacterioplankton communities fig 5b especially during wet season as nearly all of the βnti values 99 2 were between 2 and 2 showing strong effects of stochastic process on the community assembly figure s5 on the contrary deterministic process shaped the rare bacterioplankton community and it was mainly attributed to heterogeneous selection 47 6 and homogeneous selection 24 1 fig 5b furthermore higher values of habitat niche breadth were observed in the abundant bacterioplankton community compared with the rare bacterioplankton community figure s6 confirming that abundant bacterioplankton taxa were more likely to be limited for dispersal in this study all of the environmental attributes exhibited significant temporal variation figure s7 mantel test was further used to reveal which environmental variables were significantly correlated with the bacterioplankton community fig 5c the do and ph exhibited the strongest relationships with the bacterioplankton community r 0 4 p 0 001 for the whole and rare bacterioplankton communities the do ph tn nh4 n no3 n tp and tss showed significant correlations with the bacterioplankton composition r 0 2 p 0 001 for the abundant bacterioplankton community the do ph tn no3 n tp and tss had strong and significant correlations with bacterioplankton community composition r 0 2 p 0 001 while the nh4 n and po4 3 p showed relatively weaker relationships r 0 2 p 0 05 these results indicated that bacterioplankton responded sensitively to environmental variations to further understand the response of bacterioplankton to environmental variations the typical otus top 20 most abundant from the abundant and rare bacterioplankton communities were selected and their responses to environmental attributes were analyzed fig 6 overall the selected abundant taxa 62 8 had a similar level of environmental associations as compared with the rare taxa 55 6 in addition 42 5 and 40 of the selected abundant and rare taxa had close and positive relations with do and ph respectively implying the strong effects of do and ph on bacterial taxa the rda plot revealed that the do and ph had significant effects on the bacterioplankton community structures whole abundant and rare communities based on the 999 permutations of the monte carlo test figure s8 p 0 001 furthermore the variations of do and ph had positively linear relationships with the βnti values figure s9 p 0 001 these results together indicated that among the environmental attributes measured in this study the do and ph were the most important environmental attributes affecting the structure and assembly process of bacterioplankton community 4 discussion 4 1 spatiotemporal dynamics of bacterioplankton community the dynamics of bacterioplankton community in aquatic environments has recently received a great deal of attentions in microbial ecology nemergut et al 2013 this study contributed to our understanding of the spatiotemporal variations of bacterioplankton communities induced by different hydrologic conditions in river networks and provided some clues for the underlying mechanisms in agreement with our expectations the α diversity β diversity and taxonomic composition of the bacterioplankton community all exhibited temporal variation fig 1a figure s3 and fig 1c meanwhile the pcoa ordinations revealed that the bacterioplankton community structure also exhibited temporal variationby showing that the bacterioplankton communities from the same season could be clustered together fig 3a similar observations were reported for the bacterioplankton community in an estuarine ecosystem zhou et al 2021 and microeukaryotic community in a subtropical river chen et al 2019b several reasons may explain this observation firstly different hydrologic conditions during wet normal and dry seasons led to different environmental conditions which could further affect the structure and diversity of bacterioplankton community in this study all of the environmental attributes were found be statistically different during wet normal and dry seasons figure s7 and close relationships between the environmental attributes and bacterioplankton community were observed fig 5c secondly the four crisscrossing rivers in this study were interconnected and the bacterioplankton tended to be exchanged among them leading to seasonal clusters in pcoa ordinations thirdly precipitation primarily occurred during wet season in this region the precipitation could wash the microorganisms from surrounding environmental systems e g soil sediment watershed and air into the rivers mo et al 2021 nyirabuhoro et al 2021 leading to higher bacterial diversity during wet season however the seasonal cycling is an annually repeated process in this region and whether the dynamics of bacterioplankton community is an annually repeated process require long term investigation in the future meanwhile spatial variation was also found to affect the bacterioplankton communities to some extent a significant distance decay pattern was observed for the bacterioplankton community during wet and dry seasons and the distance decay relationship was weaker during wet season than dry season fig 3 in a subtropical river the distance decay relationship of microeukaryotic community was also found to be weaker during dry season chen et al 2019b in addition the co occurrence network showed that the bacterial interactions were weaker during wet season than dry season fig 4c and table s3 which was similar to the observation in an estuarine ecosystem zhou et al 2021 this result was not surprising due to the dispersal ability of bacteria was promoted by higher rate of river flow during wet season resulting in higher community similarity during wet season than dry seasons figure s3 this result also implied that precipitation might lead to random distribution of bacterial community rather than establish close interactions 4 2 geographic patterns of abundant and rare bacterioplankton communities several recent studies have illustrated that rare microbial community may be of great importance to ecological functions in ecosystems chen et al 2019b chen et al 2020 jiao and lu 2020a 2020b lynch and neufeld 2015 wan et al 2021 in this study the abundant and rare bacterioplankton communities were comparatively analyzed the abundant and rare bacterioplankton communities exhibited similar temporal and spatial variations fig 2 and fig 3a indicating that they had similar geographic patterns this observation was consistent with previous studies focusing on bacterioplankton communities in bays mo et al 2018 and lakes liao et al 2017 as well as microeukaryotic communities in a subtropical river chen et al 2019b the similar geographic patterns suggested that the abundant and rare bacterioplankton communities might respond to the environmental changes in a similar way this speculation was approved by the observation that the typical otus of abundant and rare bacterioplankton communities showed similar relationships with environmental attributes fig 6 a previous study also suggested that abundant and rare taxa have comparable environmental sensitivity in aquatic ecosystem logares et al 2013 however different patterns of abundant and rare bacterial communities were observed in an artificial bioreactor kim et al 2013a these differences might due to the different ecosystems natural and artificial and in aquatic environments rare microbial community might exhibit a similar geographic pattern to abundant microbial community 4 3 assembly process of bacterioplankton community the bacterioplankton community exhibited spatiotemporal dynamics indicating that the assembly process might vary periodically the neutral community model and null model were applied to further confirm this speculation the neutral community model fitted well for the bacterioplankton community with a moderate fitted value r2 0 67 fig 5a the fitted value indicated that stochastic process played only a moderate role in the community assembly process by comparing with other studies chen et al 2019b zhang et al 2021b further the null model confirmed this by showing that stochastic process was responsible for 27 9 of the community assembly process and the remaining was deterministic process fig 5b during wet season stochastic process was the major process while deterministic process dominated during normal and dry seasons figure s5 these results were in agreement with the hydrologic conditions in which the dispersal event stochastic process occurred more easily in wet season together with precipitation but it was relatively limited during the other two seasons in this study the abundant and rare bacterioplankton communities were found to be assembled via distinct processes dispersal limitation mainly shaped the abundant bacterioplankton community while environmental selection heterogeneous selection and homogeneous selection dominated the assembly process of rare bacterioplankton community this result was supported by previous studies in which the abundant taxa were mainly limited by dispersal in lakes and reservoirs liu et al 2015 pacific ocean wu et al 2017 mangrove zhang et al 2021b and agricultural soils jiao and lu 2020a 2020b there were two possible reasons that may explain this observation firstly the abundant bacterioplankton taxa were more likely to be involved in a dispersal event due to more individuals resulting in wide distribution of abundant taxa jiao and lu 2020b the venn diagram confirmed this by showing that most of the otus of abundant bacterioplankton communities were shared fig 3b secondly the abundant bacterioplankton had wider niche breadth than the rare bacterioplankton figure s6 the taxa with wider niche breadth may be limited by the chances to reach multiple locations zhang et al 2021b on the contrary the taxa with narrower habit niche breadth would face stronger environmental selection wu et al 2017 leading to deterministic process being the dominant assembly process for rare bacterioplankton community furthermore multiple statistical methods including mantel test rda and correlation analysis were performed to reveal the major environmental attributes affecting the bacterioplankton community structure and assembly process among the environmental attributes measured in this study do and ph were found to be the most important factors affecting the structure and assembly process of bacterioplankton community fig 5c figure s8 and figure s9 this result was reasonable for the following reasons in this study the do concentration varied significantly figure s7 ranging from 5 52 0 69 in wet season to 7 17 0 86 in dry season do was well recognized as a critical factor for bacterial taxa due to its impact on bacterial activity and the specific selection of distinct bacterial lineages by do concentration was well known wang et al 2012 similarly ph changed significantly under different hydrological conditions figure s7 ph was believed to be an independent driver of bacterial diversity lauber et al 2009 and any significant deviation in environmental ph can impose stress on these single cell microorganisms it was found to play an important role in shaping the bacterial community structure chodak et al 2013 fierer and jackson 2006 xu et al 2017 in this study ph was found to affect not only the diversity but also the assembly process of bacterial community a recent study confirmed this by showing that ph could regulate the assembly process of bacterial community through environmental filtering jiao and lu 2020a 5 conclusion in this study the dynamics of the bacterioplankton community during wet normal and dry seasons in river networks of the taihu basin were analyzed by amplicon sequencing and multiple statistical analyses the diversity structure and taxonomic composition of bacterioplankton community exhibited temporal dynamics the abundant and rare bacterioplankton communities were comparatively analyzed and they were found to exhibit similar geographic patterns with spatiotemporal variations stochastic process mainly shaped the abundant bacterioplankton community while deterministic process dominated the assembly process of rare bacterioplankton community these results indicated that the abundant and rare bacterioplankton communities responded similarly to the variation of hydrologic conditions via distinct assembly processes credit authorship contribution statement tao zhang sampling formal analysis
