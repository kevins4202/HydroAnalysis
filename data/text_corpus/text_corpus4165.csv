20825,the paper presents simulation results of an inland container vessel designed to be operated in the inland waters of china initially calm water simulations are performed in open water with varying draft and speed to determine the possible propulsion power required by the vessel for regular operations next static drift simulations are performed with a heave and pitch free motion at varying drift angles and drafts encountered hull resistance and linear derivatives are determined from the drift results to assess the vessel s maneuvering capabilities finally simulations are performed in restricted water following possible operating channel geometry to assess the vessel s performance in restricted operating conditions the required propulsion power of the vessel has been calculated for each case and compared cases that showed maximum resistance was re stimulated in full scale to discard the scaling effect from predictions the results show that a significant increase in resistance is observed when the vessel operates in shallow and narrow channels which limits its possible operating speed the study concludes that model scale simulations are efficient for preliminary studies however for the required power prediction full scale simulations should be considered keywords cfd inland vessel restricted waters static drift scale effect power prediction openfoam 1 introduction the present day challenge in the water transportation industry is to minimize energy consumption while ensuring maximum protection for the marine environment the vessel and the crew the maximization of vessel efficiency and economy are also among key targets with the everlasting threat of climate change researchers are continuously looking for ways to make the way of life more sustainable the most significant contributor to co2 emission is the transportation industry which is essential for the transfer of humans and goods however in terms of emissions surely some modes of transportations are better than others despite transporting more than 90 of global goods shipping is responsible for only 3 of global co2 emissions shipping and world trade 2020 eu emission report 2020 as such countries with abundant inland waterways like the netherlands rhine river and china yangtze river are focusing on developing reliable and efficient inland water transportation systems at the same time there is a trend to increase automation in ships moving towards autonomous ships while initial efforts have focused on guidance and control of the vessels moreira et al 2007 hinostroza et al 2019 as well as appropriate autonomous systems for collision avoidance perera et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 other aspects such as the economy kretschmann et al 2017 santos and guedes soares 2018 and safety zhang et al 2016 wu et al 2020 are also of concern it is generally accepted that the transition to autonomous shipping has to be done gradually starting with coastal and inland transportation and with intelligent perera et al 2012 and remote controlled ships before moving to fully autonomous oceangoing ships as part of the above referred effort a project targeting a 64 teu inland container vessel in china is under development to transport goods and containers with trends of intelligent remote or autonomous control this paper focuses on the hydrodynamic study of the vessel to ensure appropriate propulsion power installation in the vessel to ensure smooth operations with minimum environmental impact different research groups have been developing rans models since the late 1980s and the field has matured significantly in the last the two decades with the introduction of standard hull forms and related experimental data in the gothenburg 2000 workshop larsson et al 2003 global benchmarks were set and validation of cfd models became easier after the gothenburg 2010 larsson et al 2011 and hino and kenkyūjo 2005 and tokyo 2015 hino et al 2021 workshops witnessed gradual improvement in the prediction accuracy of cfd models which came above 3 in 2010 in the last decade a very large number of publications have been made that focus on the verification and validation of different popular cfd models apart from the workshop proceedings which includes results from a large number of participants some of the relatively recent cfd studies in resistance prediction for standard ships were done by sadat hosseini et al 2013 kim et al 2013 and islam and guedes soares 2019 over the years overall expertise in calm water cfd simulations have developed significantly and cfd has proven to be a suitable substitute for towing tank simulations however studies in academia are mostly related to the validation of large seagoing vessels and works related to inland vessel propulsion power prediction are still quite limited along with the development of resistance prediction ship maneuvering studies using cfd have also been developing in parallel like resistance studies progress and standards in maneuvering studies are generally set at simman 2008 2014 workshops planar motion mechanism pmm simulations are particularly popular for maneuvering studies and a large number of publications are available in this regard among some of the recent works wang et al 2011 used the cfd tool fluent to simulated oblique motion for kvlcc2 in deep and shallow water kim et al 2015 presented pmm simulation results for the kcs model using in house code ship motion and predicted hydrodynamic derivatives from simulation results hajivand and mousavizadegan 2015a b also performed pmm simulations using star ccm and openfoam static drift only for the dtmb 5512 model and predicted hydrodynamic derivatives from the simulation results yao et al 2016 presented static drift turning and pure sway simulation data using openfoam for tanker model kvlcc2 islam and guedes soares 2018 also performed pmm simulations for the kcs model using openfoam however as can be observed most of the referred works discuss seagoing vessels and studies related to inland vessels are comparatively scarce liu et al 2015 provided a summary of the evaluation and prediction of maneuverability of inland vessels referring to the notable works in the area liu 2017 also performed extensive studies on the impact of rudder configuration on inland vessel maneuverability however general studies focusing on inland vessel hydrodynamic derivatives are still limited another very important aspect for inland vessels is the restriction of channel width and draft dedicated shallow and confined water workshops like mashcon mashcon 2009 19 discusses extensively the shallow water effects blockage effects lockage entrance ship ship interactions shallow water affects the maneuvering capability of ships which may be critical in inland navigation zhou et al 2016a xu et al 2020 ship ship interactions are also very important in inland navigation zhou et al 2016b wnek et al 2018 however in general most studies from the field focus on studying large vessels passing through coastlines or port channels like large crude carriers toxopeus et al 2013 lee and hong 2017 hoydonck et al 2018 and container ships terziev et al 2018 zeng et al 2019 thus studies related to the impact of channel restrictions on the resistance for inland vessels are still limited the present study aims to predict the propulsion power requirement for a 64 teu autonomous inland container vessel designed to be operated in the waterways of zhejiang province the paper presents cfd simulation results for three different types of operations of the inland vessel including cruising in open waters with design speed maneuvering and passing through restricted channels four different loading conditions have been considered for the study and a large number of simulations have been performed using a rans based cfd model with openfoam to predict the vessel s resistance and behavior in different conditions power prediction for the full scale ship has been made using the resistance data and a recommendation for installed power has been made instead of using cfd for an in depth analysis of a particular operation scenario the paper focuses more on the practical application of cfd in assessing vessel propulsion power performance after considering different operation scenarios 2 method 2 1 the numerical solver the open source cfd toolkit openfoam open field operation and manipulation is used for the present studies the solver has been under development for more than 15 years and is widely popular among researchers and in the offshore industry openfoam contains several packages to perform multi phase turbulent flow simulations for floating objects and also allows relatively easy customization and modification of solvers because of its modular design the solver has been detailed by jasak 2009 a brief description of the solver is provided below the governing equations for the solver are the navier stokes equation 1 and the continuity equation 2 for an incompressible laminar flow of a newtonian fluid in vector form the navier stokes and continuity equation are given by 1 ρ v t v v p μ 2 v ρ g 2 v 0 here v is the velocity p is the pressure μ is the dynamic viscosity g is the acceleration due to gravity and 2 is the laplace operator the volume of fluid vof method is used to model the fluid as one continuum of mixed properties this vof method determines the fraction of each fluid that exists in each cell thus tracking the free surface elevation the volume fraction was obtained by equation 3 3 α t α v 0 where v is the velocity field and α is the volume fraction of water in the cell varying from 0 to 1 with 0 representing a cell full of air and 1 representing a cell full of water the unstructured collocated finite volume method fvm is used to discretize the governing equations time integration was performed by a semi implicit second order two point backward differencing scheme pressure velocity coupling was obtained through the pimple algorithm a combination of simple and piso for the present study turbulence has been modeled with the reynolds averaged stress ras sst k ω two equation model to accommodate the motion of the vessel the mesh morphing technique has been used 2 2 the ship model the simulations were performed for a 2 065 m model that represents a 69 m long 64 twenty feet equivalent unit teu inland container ship model simulations are performed on a bare hull with no appendages the vessel follows a novel design aiming at an intelligent inland vessel with multiple advanced technologies intended to be operated between huzhou and shanghai china apart from a blunt bow the vessel features a rim driven thruster propulsion system and ship shore coordination assisted navigation a representative hull diagram and the ship s principal dimensions for both full scale and model scale are shown in fig 1 and table 1 2 3 mesh generation for all the simulations meshes are generated using the mesh generation utility of openfoam the blockmeshdict is used to generate the initial simulation domain which follows the ittc 2011 and ittc 2014 recommendations of one ship length at the front two ship lengths after the stern one ship length at the side and three ship lengths in the vertical direction however the lateral and vertical domain size was different for the shallow water cases the initial domain is then refined six times using toposetdict and refinemeshdict next snappyhexmeshdict is used to incorporate the hull form into the blockmesh four layers are added around the hull for proper capturing of the viscous force the initial simulations in open calm water are run for the half hull port side with a heave and pitch free motion the static drift and restricted water simulations are performed using the full hull both starboard and port side although depending on the water depth and drift angle some details in the mesh are adjusted while the overall mesh topology in all the simulations remains the same the general mesh used for calm water simulations has a resolution of 1 5 million cells for the half domain the mesh resolution was selected based on the grid dependency study reported for the vessel in islam et al 2021 for static drift the overall mesh resolution is higher as the full domain both starboard and port side of the hull is simulated the mesh resolution varies depending on the drift angle as the final refinement area is enlarged to cover the drifting hull thus the resolution is higher for larger drift angles this was done to ensure even mesh resolution around the hull for all the cases the average mesh resolution for the static drift cases is around 3 5 million finally the restricted water simulations are performed with a narrow channel with shallow drafts the mesh resolution varies slightly due to the changing depth and width the refinement level for the cases was maintained the same as the previous two cases thus mesh distribution near the hull remained the same as before even mesh resolution was maintained in the vertical direction from the hull bottom to the bottom boundary the average mesh resolution is around 2 7 million a rough description of the used meshes is provided in table 2 and the general mesh assembly for the cases are shown in figs 2 4 the y values shown in table 2 correspond to y values for the highest speed simulated for that type of simulation since multiple cases were simulated setting mesh quality based on the highest speed ensures that the y criterion will be met for all the other cases however for all the cases even for the slowest speed the y value remained above the value of 30 this is important since wall function has been used in the simulations and following the law of the wall y values should remain between 30 and 300 for reliable results 2 4 computational resources the simulations are performed on two computers an intel xenon workstation with 2 2gz processor with 64 threads and 16 gb of ram and an intel core i9 computer with 2 90gz processor 24 threads and 64 gb of ram however for each simulation only 12 cores were used to ensure efficient memory handling each simulation was run for 50 s simulation time with an average time step of 0 01s and took a physical time of 40 h on average 3 results the paper focuses on resistance prediction for an inland container vessel model at different operating conditions initially calm water simulations are performed at four different speeds at four different drafts the present work is a continuation of the work done by islam et al 2021 where a detailed verification and validation study for the calm water simulations has been presented the verification or uncertainty study was performed for three froude numbers and revealed that the resistance prediction has relatively higher uncertainty in high speed cases whereas sinkage prediction has higher uncertainty for low speed cases this is understandable since at lower speed the sinkage value remains small and relatively higher mesh resolution is required to capture that vertical motion properly as for trim results they showed relatively low uncertainty at all vessel speeds for validation of the results the results were compared with experimental and starccm results however it was mentioned that the experimental study had high uncertainty and the cfd results were found to be in better agreement with each other a summary of the results presented by islam et al 2021 is shown in tables 3 and 4 the highest mesh resolution from the study has been used for the presented simulations next drift simulations are performed with varying drift angles for the same speed with a heave and pitch free motion from the results maneuvering derivatives are also calculated then simulations are performed in a restricted channel to assess how to channel depth and width influences the vessel s encountered resistance simulations for open water and static drift were performed with just heave and pitch free motion while keeping the other four motions restricted as for restricted water cases static simulations were performed with all motions restricted since an inland vessel has been considered which should only operate in calm waters the impact of other motions in general should be minimum islam and akimoto 2018 furthermore the vessel has been designed for enhanced stability compromising some efficiency aspects thus in general the vessel has a low motion response although in restricted waters all motions become important adding more motions would also include more uncertainty regarding the results and without proper validation data concluding from the results would have become more difficult thus only static simulations have been performed for restricted waters finally specific cases are repeated with full scale simulation to obtain a more reliable prediction for the required installed power all model scale simulations are performed for four draft conditions whereas the full scale simulations are repeated just for drafts 3 and 4 a summary of the simulated cases is shown in table 5 further details regarding the simulations are provided in individual sub sections of the results 3 1 calm water simulation in open waters the calm water simulations are performed in an open channel with relatively large width and depth one ship length as width on each side and one ship length in depth with a heave and pitch free motion considering different loading conditions simulations are performed for four different draft conditions at varying speeds as mentioned before the 1 5 million mesh resolution half hull used for the simulations was systematically verified using a detailed uncertainty study presented by islam et al 2021 a total of eight simulations are performed for varying froude number drafts 0 0435 m 0 0580 m 0 0754 m and 0 0870 m and displacement volume 0 7884 m2 0 8839 m2 0 9702 m2 and 1 0239 m2 respectively for all the cases pressure viscous and total drag coefficients are measured including sinkage and trim except for the lowest draft case for the lowest draft 0 0435 m dynamic simulations show high oscillation due to very low displacement volume and relatively large mesh volume furthermore initial dynamic simulations for the case reveal very low movement thus the simulations are later performed in static conditions all resistance results are converted to full hull both port and starboard side resistance for coefficient calculation the following equation 4 is used for the drag coefficient 4 c f 0 5 ρ a w s v 2 here c is the coefficient ρ is the water density a w s is the wetted surface area of the vessel and v is the vessel speed the simulation results are shown in table 6 a relative comparison among the results is also shown in figs 5 7 the drag coefficient results show that the hull has the least amount of resistance in the draft 2 0 0580 m condition and overall all the drafts show relatively low resistance at froude 0 155 0 7 m s the hull shows a similar level of resistance at draft 1 and draft 4 however while draft 1 shows higher viscous resistance draft 4 shows higher pressure resistance the relative sinkage also increases with increasing load or draft as for trim at low draft condition the vessel shows bow ward trim at all speeds with increasing draft and speed the vessel shows stern wards trim as expected 3 1 1 power prediction conversion from model scale next from the predicted resistance approximate power calculation is done for the full scale ship to do so the residual or wave making pressure resistance c w is taken from the model scale simulation results and the viscous resistance c v is calculated using the ittc 1957 guidelines molland et al 2011 ittc 2002 the value of form factors for the vessel 1 k is calculated to be 1 454 1 377 1 45 and 1 498 for draft 1 2 3 and 4 respectively then total drag resistance for the full scale ship is calculated by combining the wave making and viscous drag coefficient c t c w c v the effective drag force for a full scale vessel is then calculated as f c t 0 5 ρ a w s v 2 here a w s is the full scale vessel wetted surface area and v is corresponding full scale velocity the required effective power can be calculated as p f v finally the required installed power is calculated by assuming a quasi propulsive coefficient of 0 55 2 0 shaft loss 5 0 gearbox loss and a 15 reduction to maintain the maximum continuous rating of the propeller marine insight 2019 since the vessel will be operating in inland waters no sea margin is considered the air drag is also ignored although there is a possibility that the proposed vessel would be propelled by electric motors specific detail regarding losses in electric power train is yet to be available thus the calculations have been done assuming a regular diesel engine driven propulsion the prediction results are shown in table 7 in fig 8 the velocities correspond to froude number 0 067 0 111 0 155 and 0 200 respectively as expected the results show the highest power requirement for the design speed at the maximum draft the power requirement for the maximum draft is roughly 150 kw more comparing to the design draft for the design speed overall the projected required power for the 64teu inland vessel is around 1150 kw 3 2 static drift simulation in open water static drift tests are principally performed for assessing vessel maneuverability as part of the planar motion mechanism pmm tests however it is not uncommon for vessels to be exposed to drifting motion while maneuvering especially during docking and undocking thus the required propulsion power was studied for drifting cases static drift simulations are performed for model scale ship at the design speed fr 0 2 0 9 m s for varying drift angles six simulations are performed for different drift angles for each ship draft with a heave and pitch free motion except for the smallest draft case draft 1 as mentioned in section 3 1 draft 1 shows instability for heave and pitch free motion and thus drift simulations for draft 1 are performed with all ship motions restricted from the simulation total drag resistance lateral force and yaw and roll moments are measured the results are shown in table 8 the lateral force and moment for the 0 drift cases are negligible thus they are simply replaced by 0 0 comparison among the forces and moment for changing drifts and drafts are also shown in figs 9 11 as expected figs 9 11 show that with increasing draft and drift angle the encountered force and moment also increases for the total drag coefficient draft 2 initially shows relatively low resistance comparing to draft 1 which gradually increases with an increasing drift angle as for lateral force and yaw moment they follow a clear trend with higher values for the larger draft and larger drift angle the slope for the trends varies slightly for different drafts indicating that the values of maneuvering derivatives are not the same for each draft the sinkage and trim results for the cases are shown in figs 12 and 13 respectively as can be seen from the sinkage results the sinkage increases with an increasing drift angle at the design speed and draft for a drift of 15 the sinkage increases by around 0 05 m in full scale which might be particularly important while navigating through very shallow waters a sudden high drift maneuvering in shallow water might ground the vessel if maneuvering is not done with care the trim angle also shows a change of value with an increasing drift angle however the effect is relatively less nevertheless the combined effect of added sinkage and trim might prove important for very shallow channels 3 2 1 estimation of static derivatives the linear hydrodynamic derivatives are estimated from the static drift simulation results hydrodynamic derivatives represent the rate of change of force or moment with changing drift angle for linear derivatives and changing velocity and acceleration for non linear derivatives from the static drift results linear derivatives y v and n v are calculated although some non linear derivatives may also be calculated from the static results their results are generally less reliable the derivatives are calculated from the slope of the changing lateral force and yaw moment vs the changing drift angle islam and guedes soares 2018 the results are shown in table 9 following theoretical hydrodynamics for high stability y v should have a negative value and n v should have a small negative or positive value from the results it can be interpreted that the vessel has relatively low lateral stability and the stability reduces with an increasing draft however the vessel shows reasonable stability in yaw moment nevertheless the vessel shows relatively high stability comparing to sea going tankers and container vessels which is expected for inland vessels 3 2 2 estimation of power requirement during maneuvering to analyze the power requirement for propulsion during maneuvering the required propulsion power is also calculated from the drag force coefficients for the static drift cases power is estimated following the same method as described in section 3 1 1 the results for the final required installed power is shown in fig 14 the results indicate a much higher power requirement at drifting conditions which increases with drifting angle and draft as such the vessel will face a reduction in speed as it maneuvers with larger drift angles the power prediction also suggests that high drift maneuvering would be particularly difficult if a negative current is present in the area or channel of maneuvering 3 3 calm water simulation in restricted waters finally considering that the vessel will be operating in inland waterways which are in many cases restricted in width and depth simulations are also performed in restricted channels the vessel is intended to operate in a class iii channel following the definition from the standards for inland river navigation 2014 the depth of waterways within this class is generally around 2 0 m 2 4 m and the width would be 30 m for a one way line and 60 m for a two way line however assuming that the vessel in general would avoid such shallow paths in a fully loaded condition simulations are performed considering the two way width and channel depth to vessel draft ratios of 2 0 1 5 1 2 and 1 1 in the model scale the channel width is set as 1 74 m 60 m full scale and channel depth is varied following the depth to draft ratios since power requirement increases significantly in the case of operating in restricted waters a reduced vessel model scale speed of 0 5 m s 5 6 knots full scale is considered for the study some simulations are also performed with higher and lower vessel speeds to generate a rough understanding regarding how power requirement changes with changing velocity in case of operating in restricted waters an important aspect for restricted water simulations is the study of effects related to hull wake propwash the influence of the number of propellers current and reflected waves in the shallow and narrow channel however the present study mostly focused on resistance prediction and studies related to these influences were ignored another aspect is that since the restricted water simulations were performed at low froude numbers the hull wake and the interaction of waves with the boundaries were limited furthermore the studied vessel is designed with a full directional thruster instead of propellers and rudders which makes the study of wash from single or twin propellers become somewhat redundant thus for the propulsion power assessment only bare hull was simulated without considering propeller and rudder effects all restricted water simulations are performed with a static hull sinkage and trim motion restricted although vessel squat in shallow channels is a topic of interest it is not studied in the present work since the principal target of the work is propulsion power prediction and dynamic simulation in shallow water is both challenging and resource consuming furthermore the studied cases here fall within low depth froude number thus the impact of sinkage and trim is limited the effect of changing channel width was also not studied in the model scale study the results for calm water simulations in restricted waters are shown in table 10 the results from table 8 show that with shallower water the viscous resistance decreases whereas the pressure resistance increases the results also show that at draft 3 design draft and 4 the total drag coefficient shows an optimal value at velocity 0 5 m s and the drag increases with increasing or decreasing velocity a trend line for the total drag coefficient at velocity 0 5 m s for changing depth is shown in fig 15 the figure shows that with reducing depth the total drag coefficient increases and maximum drag is observed for draft 1 in most cases while the rest of the drafts show relatively close values since draft 1 has the lowest draft the simulations for draft 1 were the shallowest cases 3 3 1 estimation of power requirement in restricted waters following the previous cases the total required installed power is also calculated for the restricted water cases however to account for the shallow water effect while estimating the viscous drag coefficient for a full scale the form factor was calculated by adding a term as followed millward 1989 5 c v c f 1 k s h a l l o w c f i t t c 1 k 0 644 t h 1 72 here t is the ship draft and h is the channel water depth the full scale results are shown in table 11 the results from table 11 shows that the required propulsion power varies significantly based on ship speed and bottom clearance for the same bottom clearance the power requirement increases significantly with an increase in vessel speed this indicates that if power is installed based on the design speed for open waters the vessel won t be able to attain beyond a certain speed in restricted channels furthermore if the restricted channel has a negative current greater than 5 knots the vessel might not be able to propel forward at all a comparative image for power requirement at changing draft and depth for the vessel at speed 5 70 knots is shown in fig 16 the results show that even at h d 2 the power requirement is almost twice that of open water case fig 8 and the power requirement increases substantially for very shallow cases h d 12 0 1 10 however the effect is not just because of the channel depth but also because of the channel width which has been considered to be 30 m for the presented cases 3 4 full scale simulation results as explained in section 3 1 1 for the conversion of model scale data to full scale considering a similarity law it is assumed that the wave making resistance coefficient for both model and full scale vessel remains the same whereas the viscous resistance coefficient is calculated following the empirical formulation from ittc 57 this process for scaling model scale results to full scale has been in use for several decades and has been adopted in numerical studies from the experimental field in the experimental study it is simply impossible to perform full scale tests even for model scale tests predicting viscous resistance generally requires double body simulation which is expensive thus the application of empirical formulation for predicting frictional thus viscous resistance for both model and full scale is quite common several researchers have already tried to address the issue related to the scale effect in deep and shallow waters min and kang 2010 zeng et al 2018 2020 terziev et al 2019 niklas and pruszko 2019 zhang et al 2020 and it is still an ongoing study when it comes to rans simulations one particular reason behind running such a sophisticated resource consuming solution is to predict the viscous resistance of the vessel with good accuracy the solvers also include multi equation turbulence models to better realize the turbulence effect in both pressure and viscous resistance however while converting the data to full scale following the common practice the viscous resistance predicted by the rans model is simply discarded and an empirical formula is used to estimate the viscous resistance the practice begs the question that what is the point of running the rans simulation in the model scale to begin with however running full scale simulation ensuring the required level of mesh resolution y value is highly resource consuming thus for ship behavioral investigation running all the simulations in full scale might not be feasible as such for comparative study model scale simulations are quite efficient however for power prediction the extreme cases identified in the model scale should be run again in full scale to properly predict the required power in general following the results from this particular study ittc 57 over predicts the viscous resistance coefficient in model scale for all cases comparing to cfd results thus it may be assumed that ittc 57 over predicts the values for full scale as well as such to avoid over prediction of required power for the 64teu inland container vessel model simulations that predicted maximum resistance are repeated in full scale however all simulations performed on the full scale are static simulations thus heave and pitch motion are restricted initially a grid dependency analysis is performed to investigate how resistance prediction changes with changing mesh resolution the simulations are performed for the vessel design speed 10 knots and the design draft draft 3 the results are shown in table 12 the grid dependency analysis shows that with increasing resolution the solver predicts lower power a further uncertainty study on the drag components following the factor of safety celic et al 2008 based method in ittc 2017 guidelines showed that the corrected uncertainty for the total drag coefficient is around 0 4 whereas for viscous and pressure drag it is 0 67 and 4 3 respectively thus although the mesh resolutions used are relatively low considering full scale simulation overall uncertainty in resistance prediction remains low furthermore since a decrease in mesh resolution increases the resistance prediction the application of a relatively low mesh resolution for further studies should not be an issue just to be certain another simulation was run using a 30 million cell resolution with a y value of around 200 which produced a power prediction of 770 kw as such the moderate mesh resolution of 3 39 million was chosen for subsequent simulations as mentioned before simulations are repeated in full scale only for the maximum resistance cases observed in model scale simulations in total eight cases are repeated calm water simulations in open water for draft 3 and 4 at design speed 10 1 knots static drift simulation at a 15 drift angle at design speed for draft 3 and 4 and restricted water simulations for draft 3 and 4 at 5 6 knots speed h d 1 1 and channel width of 60 m and 45 m initially restricted water simulations for draft 3 and 4 at 5 6 knots speed and h d 1 1 for a single way width of 30 m show very high power requirements implying that the vessel would have to substantially reduce its speed while traveling through such narrow and shallow channel this is mainly because the bow waves generated by the hull in shallow and narrow channel reflects the hull and creates added resistance further investigation for such cases using dynamic conditions heave and pitch free motion would provide better information in this regard for the present study the single way 30 m simulation results are not included in the comparison the simulation results are shown in table 13 and comparison among power prediction for the cases in full scale vs power predicted by the model scale is shown in fig 17 the results show that for restricted channel cases the model scale simulations 60 m equivalent width and h d 1 1 predict that pressure drag will decrease with an increasing draft whereas the viscous drag formulation by millward 1989 suggests that viscous drag would increase with ship draft however the full scale restricted channel simulation predicts that for draft 4 viscous drag also decreases the full scale results also contradict model scale results which is interesting further investigation is required to understand the issue in detail however overall the difference between the two cases remains small and as can be seen from fig 15 the deciding factor here for power would be not just the depth but also the width of the channel if the vessel faces two way traffic and is forced to travel close to one of the banks instead of taking the middle path the total drag significantly increases thus with lower installed power the vessel would propel at a substantially reduced speed in narrow channels the overall results from model scale and full scale simulations suggest that in general the model scale simulations slightly over predict the pressure drag and the ittc formulation for viscous drag significantly over predict the viscous drag in full scale as such the model scale converted results over predict the overall power requirement by around 20 for calm water simulations by around 10 for drift cases and by around 20 for restricted channel cases this over the installation of power would increase the initial cost of the vessel would passively promote operations in overcapacity and produce higher emissions flow field visualization for full scale simulations are shown in figs 18 21 all figures are plotted using the same pressure range values fig 18 shows pressure distribution on the free surface and the hull form during calm water simulation at draft 3 and 4 at speed 10 1 knots fig 19 shows the same for a drift angle of 15 fig 20 shows restricted water simulation cases for 60 m channel width with 5 6 knots velocity whereas fig 21 shows so for 45 m channel width with the vessel being placed at aside comparing to figs 18 figs 20 and 21 show a substantial increase in drag force due to channel restriction effects while fig 19 shows a significant increase in drag at the side of the bow and stern due to drifting motion 3 4 1 final recommendation overall the simulation results suggest that an installed capacity of 1200 kw or 1600hp should prove sufficient for the proposed vessel to safely and comfortably maneuver through the restricted inland waters of the intended sites in china the vessel should be able to operate smoothly at its design speed in a relatively open channel and during small maneuvering motion however it would have to reduce the speed while passing through restricted channels and during sharp maneuvers the power requirement would also depend on the average current velocity in the channel as can be realized from the simulation results if the proposed channel has a current higher than 4 knots in very shallow and narrow areas the required installed power would be higher 4 conclusion a substantial number of simulations are performed for a proposed inland container vessel to determine its required propulsion power initially model scale dynamic simulations are performed in calm open waters in straight and drift conditions next static simulations are performed for restricted channel conditions full scale power predictions are made for all the results finally following the assessment from model scale results full scale simulations are performed for the identified maximum resistance cases following the results the required installation power of 1200 kw is recommended for the vessel the calm water simulations showed that while the vessel s design speed is 10 knots the vessel should perform relatively better at 7 8 knots in terms of efficiency as expected the vessel shows the highest resistance in case of the highest speed and highest draft linear derivatives calculated from the static drift results indicate that the vessel has relatively less lateral stability however the yaw stability is high the lateral stability gets slightly compromised with an increasing draft the static drift simulation results also indicate that the consideration of combined sinkage and trim effect of the vessel during maneuvering might be important during navigating through shallow waters the power prediction shows that the drift angle has a limited influence on propulsion power requirement and only registers notable variation for relatively high draft cases finally the restricted water simulations show that both channel depth and width significantly influences the resistance encountered by the vessel and propulsion power requirement at shallow water conditions is significantly larger compared to open channel cases for the same installed power the vessel would face a sharp reduction in speed while maneuvering through shallow restricted channels comparing to open waters thus consideration of channel current is crucial while predicting the propulsion power requirement finally the study observes that the old methods developed to convert model scale tests to full scale results are outdated as stated in several other previous researchers considering resource requirements model scale simulations can serve the purpose of getting insights regarding different configurations and operating conditions however for power prediction full scale simulation for particular cases is essential as such with the availability of greater computational power both academia and industry should target full scale simulations instead of model scale ones at least for selected cases to get a better estimate for resistance prediction credit authorship contribution statement h

20825,the paper presents simulation results of an inland container vessel designed to be operated in the inland waters of china initially calm water simulations are performed in open water with varying draft and speed to determine the possible propulsion power required by the vessel for regular operations next static drift simulations are performed with a heave and pitch free motion at varying drift angles and drafts encountered hull resistance and linear derivatives are determined from the drift results to assess the vessel s maneuvering capabilities finally simulations are performed in restricted water following possible operating channel geometry to assess the vessel s performance in restricted operating conditions the required propulsion power of the vessel has been calculated for each case and compared cases that showed maximum resistance was re stimulated in full scale to discard the scaling effect from predictions the results show that a significant increase in resistance is observed when the vessel operates in shallow and narrow channels which limits its possible operating speed the study concludes that model scale simulations are efficient for preliminary studies however for the required power prediction full scale simulations should be considered keywords cfd inland vessel restricted waters static drift scale effect power prediction openfoam 1 introduction the present day challenge in the water transportation industry is to minimize energy consumption while ensuring maximum protection for the marine environment the vessel and the crew the maximization of vessel efficiency and economy are also among key targets with the everlasting threat of climate change researchers are continuously looking for ways to make the way of life more sustainable the most significant contributor to co2 emission is the transportation industry which is essential for the transfer of humans and goods however in terms of emissions surely some modes of transportations are better than others despite transporting more than 90 of global goods shipping is responsible for only 3 of global co2 emissions shipping and world trade 2020 eu emission report 2020 as such countries with abundant inland waterways like the netherlands rhine river and china yangtze river are focusing on developing reliable and efficient inland water transportation systems at the same time there is a trend to increase automation in ships moving towards autonomous ships while initial efforts have focused on guidance and control of the vessels moreira et al 2007 hinostroza et al 2019 as well as appropriate autonomous systems for collision avoidance perera et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 other aspects such as the economy kretschmann et al 2017 santos and guedes soares 2018 and safety zhang et al 2016 wu et al 2020 are also of concern it is generally accepted that the transition to autonomous shipping has to be done gradually starting with coastal and inland transportation and with intelligent perera et al 2012 and remote controlled ships before moving to fully autonomous oceangoing ships as part of the above referred effort a project targeting a 64 teu inland container vessel in china is under development to transport goods and containers with trends of intelligent remote or autonomous control this paper focuses on the hydrodynamic study of the vessel to ensure appropriate propulsion power installation in the vessel to ensure smooth operations with minimum environmental impact different research groups have been developing rans models since the late 1980s and the field has matured significantly in the last the two decades with the introduction of standard hull forms and related experimental data in the gothenburg 2000 workshop larsson et al 2003 global benchmarks were set and validation of cfd models became easier after the gothenburg 2010 larsson et al 2011 and hino and kenkyūjo 2005 and tokyo 2015 hino et al 2021 workshops witnessed gradual improvement in the prediction accuracy of cfd models which came above 3 in 2010 in the last decade a very large number of publications have been made that focus on the verification and validation of different popular cfd models apart from the workshop proceedings which includes results from a large number of participants some of the relatively recent cfd studies in resistance prediction for standard ships were done by sadat hosseini et al 2013 kim et al 2013 and islam and guedes soares 2019 over the years overall expertise in calm water cfd simulations have developed significantly and cfd has proven to be a suitable substitute for towing tank simulations however studies in academia are mostly related to the validation of large seagoing vessels and works related to inland vessel propulsion power prediction are still quite limited along with the development of resistance prediction ship maneuvering studies using cfd have also been developing in parallel like resistance studies progress and standards in maneuvering studies are generally set at simman 2008 2014 workshops planar motion mechanism pmm simulations are particularly popular for maneuvering studies and a large number of publications are available in this regard among some of the recent works wang et al 2011 used the cfd tool fluent to simulated oblique motion for kvlcc2 in deep and shallow water kim et al 2015 presented pmm simulation results for the kcs model using in house code ship motion and predicted hydrodynamic derivatives from simulation results hajivand and mousavizadegan 2015a b also performed pmm simulations using star ccm and openfoam static drift only for the dtmb 5512 model and predicted hydrodynamic derivatives from the simulation results yao et al 2016 presented static drift turning and pure sway simulation data using openfoam for tanker model kvlcc2 islam and guedes soares 2018 also performed pmm simulations for the kcs model using openfoam however as can be observed most of the referred works discuss seagoing vessels and studies related to inland vessels are comparatively scarce liu et al 2015 provided a summary of the evaluation and prediction of maneuverability of inland vessels referring to the notable works in the area liu 2017 also performed extensive studies on the impact of rudder configuration on inland vessel maneuverability however general studies focusing on inland vessel hydrodynamic derivatives are still limited another very important aspect for inland vessels is the restriction of channel width and draft dedicated shallow and confined water workshops like mashcon mashcon 2009 19 discusses extensively the shallow water effects blockage effects lockage entrance ship ship interactions shallow water affects the maneuvering capability of ships which may be critical in inland navigation zhou et al 2016a xu et al 2020 ship ship interactions are also very important in inland navigation zhou et al 2016b wnek et al 2018 however in general most studies from the field focus on studying large vessels passing through coastlines or port channels like large crude carriers toxopeus et al 2013 lee and hong 2017 hoydonck et al 2018 and container ships terziev et al 2018 zeng et al 2019 thus studies related to the impact of channel restrictions on the resistance for inland vessels are still limited the present study aims to predict the propulsion power requirement for a 64 teu autonomous inland container vessel designed to be operated in the waterways of zhejiang province the paper presents cfd simulation results for three different types of operations of the inland vessel including cruising in open waters with design speed maneuvering and passing through restricted channels four different loading conditions have been considered for the study and a large number of simulations have been performed using a rans based cfd model with openfoam to predict the vessel s resistance and behavior in different conditions power prediction for the full scale ship has been made using the resistance data and a recommendation for installed power has been made instead of using cfd for an in depth analysis of a particular operation scenario the paper focuses more on the practical application of cfd in assessing vessel propulsion power performance after considering different operation scenarios 2 method 2 1 the numerical solver the open source cfd toolkit openfoam open field operation and manipulation is used for the present studies the solver has been under development for more than 15 years and is widely popular among researchers and in the offshore industry openfoam contains several packages to perform multi phase turbulent flow simulations for floating objects and also allows relatively easy customization and modification of solvers because of its modular design the solver has been detailed by jasak 2009 a brief description of the solver is provided below the governing equations for the solver are the navier stokes equation 1 and the continuity equation 2 for an incompressible laminar flow of a newtonian fluid in vector form the navier stokes and continuity equation are given by 1 ρ v t v v p μ 2 v ρ g 2 v 0 here v is the velocity p is the pressure μ is the dynamic viscosity g is the acceleration due to gravity and 2 is the laplace operator the volume of fluid vof method is used to model the fluid as one continuum of mixed properties this vof method determines the fraction of each fluid that exists in each cell thus tracking the free surface elevation the volume fraction was obtained by equation 3 3 α t α v 0 where v is the velocity field and α is the volume fraction of water in the cell varying from 0 to 1 with 0 representing a cell full of air and 1 representing a cell full of water the unstructured collocated finite volume method fvm is used to discretize the governing equations time integration was performed by a semi implicit second order two point backward differencing scheme pressure velocity coupling was obtained through the pimple algorithm a combination of simple and piso for the present study turbulence has been modeled with the reynolds averaged stress ras sst k ω two equation model to accommodate the motion of the vessel the mesh morphing technique has been used 2 2 the ship model the simulations were performed for a 2 065 m model that represents a 69 m long 64 twenty feet equivalent unit teu inland container ship model simulations are performed on a bare hull with no appendages the vessel follows a novel design aiming at an intelligent inland vessel with multiple advanced technologies intended to be operated between huzhou and shanghai china apart from a blunt bow the vessel features a rim driven thruster propulsion system and ship shore coordination assisted navigation a representative hull diagram and the ship s principal dimensions for both full scale and model scale are shown in fig 1 and table 1 2 3 mesh generation for all the simulations meshes are generated using the mesh generation utility of openfoam the blockmeshdict is used to generate the initial simulation domain which follows the ittc 2011 and ittc 2014 recommendations of one ship length at the front two ship lengths after the stern one ship length at the side and three ship lengths in the vertical direction however the lateral and vertical domain size was different for the shallow water cases the initial domain is then refined six times using toposetdict and refinemeshdict next snappyhexmeshdict is used to incorporate the hull form into the blockmesh four layers are added around the hull for proper capturing of the viscous force the initial simulations in open calm water are run for the half hull port side with a heave and pitch free motion the static drift and restricted water simulations are performed using the full hull both starboard and port side although depending on the water depth and drift angle some details in the mesh are adjusted while the overall mesh topology in all the simulations remains the same the general mesh used for calm water simulations has a resolution of 1 5 million cells for the half domain the mesh resolution was selected based on the grid dependency study reported for the vessel in islam et al 2021 for static drift the overall mesh resolution is higher as the full domain both starboard and port side of the hull is simulated the mesh resolution varies depending on the drift angle as the final refinement area is enlarged to cover the drifting hull thus the resolution is higher for larger drift angles this was done to ensure even mesh resolution around the hull for all the cases the average mesh resolution for the static drift cases is around 3 5 million finally the restricted water simulations are performed with a narrow channel with shallow drafts the mesh resolution varies slightly due to the changing depth and width the refinement level for the cases was maintained the same as the previous two cases thus mesh distribution near the hull remained the same as before even mesh resolution was maintained in the vertical direction from the hull bottom to the bottom boundary the average mesh resolution is around 2 7 million a rough description of the used meshes is provided in table 2 and the general mesh assembly for the cases are shown in figs 2 4 the y values shown in table 2 correspond to y values for the highest speed simulated for that type of simulation since multiple cases were simulated setting mesh quality based on the highest speed ensures that the y criterion will be met for all the other cases however for all the cases even for the slowest speed the y value remained above the value of 30 this is important since wall function has been used in the simulations and following the law of the wall y values should remain between 30 and 300 for reliable results 2 4 computational resources the simulations are performed on two computers an intel xenon workstation with 2 2gz processor with 64 threads and 16 gb of ram and an intel core i9 computer with 2 90gz processor 24 threads and 64 gb of ram however for each simulation only 12 cores were used to ensure efficient memory handling each simulation was run for 50 s simulation time with an average time step of 0 01s and took a physical time of 40 h on average 3 results the paper focuses on resistance prediction for an inland container vessel model at different operating conditions initially calm water simulations are performed at four different speeds at four different drafts the present work is a continuation of the work done by islam et al 2021 where a detailed verification and validation study for the calm water simulations has been presented the verification or uncertainty study was performed for three froude numbers and revealed that the resistance prediction has relatively higher uncertainty in high speed cases whereas sinkage prediction has higher uncertainty for low speed cases this is understandable since at lower speed the sinkage value remains small and relatively higher mesh resolution is required to capture that vertical motion properly as for trim results they showed relatively low uncertainty at all vessel speeds for validation of the results the results were compared with experimental and starccm results however it was mentioned that the experimental study had high uncertainty and the cfd results were found to be in better agreement with each other a summary of the results presented by islam et al 2021 is shown in tables 3 and 4 the highest mesh resolution from the study has been used for the presented simulations next drift simulations are performed with varying drift angles for the same speed with a heave and pitch free motion from the results maneuvering derivatives are also calculated then simulations are performed in a restricted channel to assess how to channel depth and width influences the vessel s encountered resistance simulations for open water and static drift were performed with just heave and pitch free motion while keeping the other four motions restricted as for restricted water cases static simulations were performed with all motions restricted since an inland vessel has been considered which should only operate in calm waters the impact of other motions in general should be minimum islam and akimoto 2018 furthermore the vessel has been designed for enhanced stability compromising some efficiency aspects thus in general the vessel has a low motion response although in restricted waters all motions become important adding more motions would also include more uncertainty regarding the results and without proper validation data concluding from the results would have become more difficult thus only static simulations have been performed for restricted waters finally specific cases are repeated with full scale simulation to obtain a more reliable prediction for the required installed power all model scale simulations are performed for four draft conditions whereas the full scale simulations are repeated just for drafts 3 and 4 a summary of the simulated cases is shown in table 5 further details regarding the simulations are provided in individual sub sections of the results 3 1 calm water simulation in open waters the calm water simulations are performed in an open channel with relatively large width and depth one ship length as width on each side and one ship length in depth with a heave and pitch free motion considering different loading conditions simulations are performed for four different draft conditions at varying speeds as mentioned before the 1 5 million mesh resolution half hull used for the simulations was systematically verified using a detailed uncertainty study presented by islam et al 2021 a total of eight simulations are performed for varying froude number drafts 0 0435 m 0 0580 m 0 0754 m and 0 0870 m and displacement volume 0 7884 m2 0 8839 m2 0 9702 m2 and 1 0239 m2 respectively for all the cases pressure viscous and total drag coefficients are measured including sinkage and trim except for the lowest draft case for the lowest draft 0 0435 m dynamic simulations show high oscillation due to very low displacement volume and relatively large mesh volume furthermore initial dynamic simulations for the case reveal very low movement thus the simulations are later performed in static conditions all resistance results are converted to full hull both port and starboard side resistance for coefficient calculation the following equation 4 is used for the drag coefficient 4 c f 0 5 ρ a w s v 2 here c is the coefficient ρ is the water density a w s is the wetted surface area of the vessel and v is the vessel speed the simulation results are shown in table 6 a relative comparison among the results is also shown in figs 5 7 the drag coefficient results show that the hull has the least amount of resistance in the draft 2 0 0580 m condition and overall all the drafts show relatively low resistance at froude 0 155 0 7 m s the hull shows a similar level of resistance at draft 1 and draft 4 however while draft 1 shows higher viscous resistance draft 4 shows higher pressure resistance the relative sinkage also increases with increasing load or draft as for trim at low draft condition the vessel shows bow ward trim at all speeds with increasing draft and speed the vessel shows stern wards trim as expected 3 1 1 power prediction conversion from model scale next from the predicted resistance approximate power calculation is done for the full scale ship to do so the residual or wave making pressure resistance c w is taken from the model scale simulation results and the viscous resistance c v is calculated using the ittc 1957 guidelines molland et al 2011 ittc 2002 the value of form factors for the vessel 1 k is calculated to be 1 454 1 377 1 45 and 1 498 for draft 1 2 3 and 4 respectively then total drag resistance for the full scale ship is calculated by combining the wave making and viscous drag coefficient c t c w c v the effective drag force for a full scale vessel is then calculated as f c t 0 5 ρ a w s v 2 here a w s is the full scale vessel wetted surface area and v is corresponding full scale velocity the required effective power can be calculated as p f v finally the required installed power is calculated by assuming a quasi propulsive coefficient of 0 55 2 0 shaft loss 5 0 gearbox loss and a 15 reduction to maintain the maximum continuous rating of the propeller marine insight 2019 since the vessel will be operating in inland waters no sea margin is considered the air drag is also ignored although there is a possibility that the proposed vessel would be propelled by electric motors specific detail regarding losses in electric power train is yet to be available thus the calculations have been done assuming a regular diesel engine driven propulsion the prediction results are shown in table 7 in fig 8 the velocities correspond to froude number 0 067 0 111 0 155 and 0 200 respectively as expected the results show the highest power requirement for the design speed at the maximum draft the power requirement for the maximum draft is roughly 150 kw more comparing to the design draft for the design speed overall the projected required power for the 64teu inland vessel is around 1150 kw 3 2 static drift simulation in open water static drift tests are principally performed for assessing vessel maneuverability as part of the planar motion mechanism pmm tests however it is not uncommon for vessels to be exposed to drifting motion while maneuvering especially during docking and undocking thus the required propulsion power was studied for drifting cases static drift simulations are performed for model scale ship at the design speed fr 0 2 0 9 m s for varying drift angles six simulations are performed for different drift angles for each ship draft with a heave and pitch free motion except for the smallest draft case draft 1 as mentioned in section 3 1 draft 1 shows instability for heave and pitch free motion and thus drift simulations for draft 1 are performed with all ship motions restricted from the simulation total drag resistance lateral force and yaw and roll moments are measured the results are shown in table 8 the lateral force and moment for the 0 drift cases are negligible thus they are simply replaced by 0 0 comparison among the forces and moment for changing drifts and drafts are also shown in figs 9 11 as expected figs 9 11 show that with increasing draft and drift angle the encountered force and moment also increases for the total drag coefficient draft 2 initially shows relatively low resistance comparing to draft 1 which gradually increases with an increasing drift angle as for lateral force and yaw moment they follow a clear trend with higher values for the larger draft and larger drift angle the slope for the trends varies slightly for different drafts indicating that the values of maneuvering derivatives are not the same for each draft the sinkage and trim results for the cases are shown in figs 12 and 13 respectively as can be seen from the sinkage results the sinkage increases with an increasing drift angle at the design speed and draft for a drift of 15 the sinkage increases by around 0 05 m in full scale which might be particularly important while navigating through very shallow waters a sudden high drift maneuvering in shallow water might ground the vessel if maneuvering is not done with care the trim angle also shows a change of value with an increasing drift angle however the effect is relatively less nevertheless the combined effect of added sinkage and trim might prove important for very shallow channels 3 2 1 estimation of static derivatives the linear hydrodynamic derivatives are estimated from the static drift simulation results hydrodynamic derivatives represent the rate of change of force or moment with changing drift angle for linear derivatives and changing velocity and acceleration for non linear derivatives from the static drift results linear derivatives y v and n v are calculated although some non linear derivatives may also be calculated from the static results their results are generally less reliable the derivatives are calculated from the slope of the changing lateral force and yaw moment vs the changing drift angle islam and guedes soares 2018 the results are shown in table 9 following theoretical hydrodynamics for high stability y v should have a negative value and n v should have a small negative or positive value from the results it can be interpreted that the vessel has relatively low lateral stability and the stability reduces with an increasing draft however the vessel shows reasonable stability in yaw moment nevertheless the vessel shows relatively high stability comparing to sea going tankers and container vessels which is expected for inland vessels 3 2 2 estimation of power requirement during maneuvering to analyze the power requirement for propulsion during maneuvering the required propulsion power is also calculated from the drag force coefficients for the static drift cases power is estimated following the same method as described in section 3 1 1 the results for the final required installed power is shown in fig 14 the results indicate a much higher power requirement at drifting conditions which increases with drifting angle and draft as such the vessel will face a reduction in speed as it maneuvers with larger drift angles the power prediction also suggests that high drift maneuvering would be particularly difficult if a negative current is present in the area or channel of maneuvering 3 3 calm water simulation in restricted waters finally considering that the vessel will be operating in inland waterways which are in many cases restricted in width and depth simulations are also performed in restricted channels the vessel is intended to operate in a class iii channel following the definition from the standards for inland river navigation 2014 the depth of waterways within this class is generally around 2 0 m 2 4 m and the width would be 30 m for a one way line and 60 m for a two way line however assuming that the vessel in general would avoid such shallow paths in a fully loaded condition simulations are performed considering the two way width and channel depth to vessel draft ratios of 2 0 1 5 1 2 and 1 1 in the model scale the channel width is set as 1 74 m 60 m full scale and channel depth is varied following the depth to draft ratios since power requirement increases significantly in the case of operating in restricted waters a reduced vessel model scale speed of 0 5 m s 5 6 knots full scale is considered for the study some simulations are also performed with higher and lower vessel speeds to generate a rough understanding regarding how power requirement changes with changing velocity in case of operating in restricted waters an important aspect for restricted water simulations is the study of effects related to hull wake propwash the influence of the number of propellers current and reflected waves in the shallow and narrow channel however the present study mostly focused on resistance prediction and studies related to these influences were ignored another aspect is that since the restricted water simulations were performed at low froude numbers the hull wake and the interaction of waves with the boundaries were limited furthermore the studied vessel is designed with a full directional thruster instead of propellers and rudders which makes the study of wash from single or twin propellers become somewhat redundant thus for the propulsion power assessment only bare hull was simulated without considering propeller and rudder effects all restricted water simulations are performed with a static hull sinkage and trim motion restricted although vessel squat in shallow channels is a topic of interest it is not studied in the present work since the principal target of the work is propulsion power prediction and dynamic simulation in shallow water is both challenging and resource consuming furthermore the studied cases here fall within low depth froude number thus the impact of sinkage and trim is limited the effect of changing channel width was also not studied in the model scale study the results for calm water simulations in restricted waters are shown in table 10 the results from table 8 show that with shallower water the viscous resistance decreases whereas the pressure resistance increases the results also show that at draft 3 design draft and 4 the total drag coefficient shows an optimal value at velocity 0 5 m s and the drag increases with increasing or decreasing velocity a trend line for the total drag coefficient at velocity 0 5 m s for changing depth is shown in fig 15 the figure shows that with reducing depth the total drag coefficient increases and maximum drag is observed for draft 1 in most cases while the rest of the drafts show relatively close values since draft 1 has the lowest draft the simulations for draft 1 were the shallowest cases 3 3 1 estimation of power requirement in restricted waters following the previous cases the total required installed power is also calculated for the restricted water cases however to account for the shallow water effect while estimating the viscous drag coefficient for a full scale the form factor was calculated by adding a term as followed millward 1989 5 c v c f 1 k s h a l l o w c f i t t c 1 k 0 644 t h 1 72 here t is the ship draft and h is the channel water depth the full scale results are shown in table 11 the results from table 11 shows that the required propulsion power varies significantly based on ship speed and bottom clearance for the same bottom clearance the power requirement increases significantly with an increase in vessel speed this indicates that if power is installed based on the design speed for open waters the vessel won t be able to attain beyond a certain speed in restricted channels furthermore if the restricted channel has a negative current greater than 5 knots the vessel might not be able to propel forward at all a comparative image for power requirement at changing draft and depth for the vessel at speed 5 70 knots is shown in fig 16 the results show that even at h d 2 the power requirement is almost twice that of open water case fig 8 and the power requirement increases substantially for very shallow cases h d 12 0 1 10 however the effect is not just because of the channel depth but also because of the channel width which has been considered to be 30 m for the presented cases 3 4 full scale simulation results as explained in section 3 1 1 for the conversion of model scale data to full scale considering a similarity law it is assumed that the wave making resistance coefficient for both model and full scale vessel remains the same whereas the viscous resistance coefficient is calculated following the empirical formulation from ittc 57 this process for scaling model scale results to full scale has been in use for several decades and has been adopted in numerical studies from the experimental field in the experimental study it is simply impossible to perform full scale tests even for model scale tests predicting viscous resistance generally requires double body simulation which is expensive thus the application of empirical formulation for predicting frictional thus viscous resistance for both model and full scale is quite common several researchers have already tried to address the issue related to the scale effect in deep and shallow waters min and kang 2010 zeng et al 2018 2020 terziev et al 2019 niklas and pruszko 2019 zhang et al 2020 and it is still an ongoing study when it comes to rans simulations one particular reason behind running such a sophisticated resource consuming solution is to predict the viscous resistance of the vessel with good accuracy the solvers also include multi equation turbulence models to better realize the turbulence effect in both pressure and viscous resistance however while converting the data to full scale following the common practice the viscous resistance predicted by the rans model is simply discarded and an empirical formula is used to estimate the viscous resistance the practice begs the question that what is the point of running the rans simulation in the model scale to begin with however running full scale simulation ensuring the required level of mesh resolution y value is highly resource consuming thus for ship behavioral investigation running all the simulations in full scale might not be feasible as such for comparative study model scale simulations are quite efficient however for power prediction the extreme cases identified in the model scale should be run again in full scale to properly predict the required power in general following the results from this particular study ittc 57 over predicts the viscous resistance coefficient in model scale for all cases comparing to cfd results thus it may be assumed that ittc 57 over predicts the values for full scale as well as such to avoid over prediction of required power for the 64teu inland container vessel model simulations that predicted maximum resistance are repeated in full scale however all simulations performed on the full scale are static simulations thus heave and pitch motion are restricted initially a grid dependency analysis is performed to investigate how resistance prediction changes with changing mesh resolution the simulations are performed for the vessel design speed 10 knots and the design draft draft 3 the results are shown in table 12 the grid dependency analysis shows that with increasing resolution the solver predicts lower power a further uncertainty study on the drag components following the factor of safety celic et al 2008 based method in ittc 2017 guidelines showed that the corrected uncertainty for the total drag coefficient is around 0 4 whereas for viscous and pressure drag it is 0 67 and 4 3 respectively thus although the mesh resolutions used are relatively low considering full scale simulation overall uncertainty in resistance prediction remains low furthermore since a decrease in mesh resolution increases the resistance prediction the application of a relatively low mesh resolution for further studies should not be an issue just to be certain another simulation was run using a 30 million cell resolution with a y value of around 200 which produced a power prediction of 770 kw as such the moderate mesh resolution of 3 39 million was chosen for subsequent simulations as mentioned before simulations are repeated in full scale only for the maximum resistance cases observed in model scale simulations in total eight cases are repeated calm water simulations in open water for draft 3 and 4 at design speed 10 1 knots static drift simulation at a 15 drift angle at design speed for draft 3 and 4 and restricted water simulations for draft 3 and 4 at 5 6 knots speed h d 1 1 and channel width of 60 m and 45 m initially restricted water simulations for draft 3 and 4 at 5 6 knots speed and h d 1 1 for a single way width of 30 m show very high power requirements implying that the vessel would have to substantially reduce its speed while traveling through such narrow and shallow channel this is mainly because the bow waves generated by the hull in shallow and narrow channel reflects the hull and creates added resistance further investigation for such cases using dynamic conditions heave and pitch free motion would provide better information in this regard for the present study the single way 30 m simulation results are not included in the comparison the simulation results are shown in table 13 and comparison among power prediction for the cases in full scale vs power predicted by the model scale is shown in fig 17 the results show that for restricted channel cases the model scale simulations 60 m equivalent width and h d 1 1 predict that pressure drag will decrease with an increasing draft whereas the viscous drag formulation by millward 1989 suggests that viscous drag would increase with ship draft however the full scale restricted channel simulation predicts that for draft 4 viscous drag also decreases the full scale results also contradict model scale results which is interesting further investigation is required to understand the issue in detail however overall the difference between the two cases remains small and as can be seen from fig 15 the deciding factor here for power would be not just the depth but also the width of the channel if the vessel faces two way traffic and is forced to travel close to one of the banks instead of taking the middle path the total drag significantly increases thus with lower installed power the vessel would propel at a substantially reduced speed in narrow channels the overall results from model scale and full scale simulations suggest that in general the model scale simulations slightly over predict the pressure drag and the ittc formulation for viscous drag significantly over predict the viscous drag in full scale as such the model scale converted results over predict the overall power requirement by around 20 for calm water simulations by around 10 for drift cases and by around 20 for restricted channel cases this over the installation of power would increase the initial cost of the vessel would passively promote operations in overcapacity and produce higher emissions flow field visualization for full scale simulations are shown in figs 18 21 all figures are plotted using the same pressure range values fig 18 shows pressure distribution on the free surface and the hull form during calm water simulation at draft 3 and 4 at speed 10 1 knots fig 19 shows the same for a drift angle of 15 fig 20 shows restricted water simulation cases for 60 m channel width with 5 6 knots velocity whereas fig 21 shows so for 45 m channel width with the vessel being placed at aside comparing to figs 18 figs 20 and 21 show a substantial increase in drag force due to channel restriction effects while fig 19 shows a significant increase in drag at the side of the bow and stern due to drifting motion 3 4 1 final recommendation overall the simulation results suggest that an installed capacity of 1200 kw or 1600hp should prove sufficient for the proposed vessel to safely and comfortably maneuver through the restricted inland waters of the intended sites in china the vessel should be able to operate smoothly at its design speed in a relatively open channel and during small maneuvering motion however it would have to reduce the speed while passing through restricted channels and during sharp maneuvers the power requirement would also depend on the average current velocity in the channel as can be realized from the simulation results if the proposed channel has a current higher than 4 knots in very shallow and narrow areas the required installed power would be higher 4 conclusion a substantial number of simulations are performed for a proposed inland container vessel to determine its required propulsion power initially model scale dynamic simulations are performed in calm open waters in straight and drift conditions next static simulations are performed for restricted channel conditions full scale power predictions are made for all the results finally following the assessment from model scale results full scale simulations are performed for the identified maximum resistance cases following the results the required installation power of 1200 kw is recommended for the vessel the calm water simulations showed that while the vessel s design speed is 10 knots the vessel should perform relatively better at 7 8 knots in terms of efficiency as expected the vessel shows the highest resistance in case of the highest speed and highest draft linear derivatives calculated from the static drift results indicate that the vessel has relatively less lateral stability however the yaw stability is high the lateral stability gets slightly compromised with an increasing draft the static drift simulation results also indicate that the consideration of combined sinkage and trim effect of the vessel during maneuvering might be important during navigating through shallow waters the power prediction shows that the drift angle has a limited influence on propulsion power requirement and only registers notable variation for relatively high draft cases finally the restricted water simulations show that both channel depth and width significantly influences the resistance encountered by the vessel and propulsion power requirement at shallow water conditions is significantly larger compared to open channel cases for the same installed power the vessel would face a sharp reduction in speed while maneuvering through shallow restricted channels comparing to open waters thus consideration of channel current is crucial while predicting the propulsion power requirement finally the study observes that the old methods developed to convert model scale tests to full scale results are outdated as stated in several other previous researchers considering resource requirements model scale simulations can serve the purpose of getting insights regarding different configurations and operating conditions however for power prediction full scale simulation for particular cases is essential as such with the availability of greater computational power both academia and industry should target full scale simulations instead of model scale ones at least for selected cases to get a better estimate for resistance prediction credit authorship contribution statement h

extraction of ocean mineral resource has been paid increasingly attention sharma 2017 as one of the significant unexploited treasures and high tech fields deep sea has become an important strategic target for the major economies of the world kang et al 2019 in worldwide the distribution of current known deposits of mineral resources is shown in fig 1 according to statistics the total amount of polymetallic nodules in the all major oceans is about 500 billion tons and the potential resource of sulfide is 1 4 billion tons worth 385 3 billion us dollars such substantial and valuable untapped resources attracted the interest of the international mining industry and many countries including united states of america russia australia china japan korea france india and germany teague et al 2018 the united states geological surveys usgs expects that deep sea mining of critical metals to reach around 5 percent of global supply by 2030 and 15 percent by 2050 by the international sea authority fig 2 illustrates some global exploration locations for deep sea mineral in generally deep sea mineral resources are in extreme environments and have special occurrence conditions there are three main types of deposits on the sea floor fig 3 polymetallic nodules also termed as manganese nodules which lies up to 4000 6000 m water depth massive sulfides sms located near hot water vents on volcanic rocks and cobalt rich crusts that are found on the slopes and summits of undersea mountains as one typical miner resource manganese nodule mn occurs as potato shaped concretions on the deep sea abyssal plains manganese nodules form two dimensional deposits on top or within the first 10 cm of the deep sea sediments fig 4 due to its location in flat seafloor mn has the greatest mining potential with easy implementation the abundant manganese nickel copper cobalt molybdenum and rare earth metals of mn miners make them commercial potential in worldwide industrial applications hein et al 2013 however the harsh and complex operating environments induce the difficulty on exploration of deep sea mining currently there are still few commercial mining companies and national governments with the ability to actually capitalize deep sea mineral teague et al 2018 some researchers pointed that the mining sediment plumes noise and chemical pollution could disturb the habitat for marine life for decades and permanently damage the deep sea floor in deep sea environment some operational issues should be also considered e g soft deep seabed low temperature lack of ambient light positioning and sensors therefore mining technologies and equipment adapting to deep sea environments is significant which determines the commercial and engineering prospective of the ocean mining industry in this paper key technologies of deep sea mining systems especially operational mining vehicles are reviewed the reminders are organized as follows in section 2 the development of deep sea

status of deep sea mining vehicle techniques 2 existing structural design of deep sea mining system in last decades four main types of deep sea mining systems have been developed that is submarine drag bucket mining system continuous line bucket mining system masuda et al 1971 shuttle vessel mining system rajesh et al 2011 and pipeline lift mining system sharma 2017 in early 60s submarine drag bucket mining system was designed by omi operation in united states of america by the sea trail it was demonstrated that such mining system could not trace the scheduled mining paths and its manipulability was difficult which induced to low efficiency then the continuous line bucket clb mining system was proposed in japan although clb system was easy to manufacture and with low cost yet the buckets were often inter twined which blocked the mining operation for enhancing the mobility shuttle vessel mining system was developed but the high cost of battery and manufacturing fees hindered its applications the development of deep sea mining systems is illustrated in fig 5 recently pipeline lift mining system is universally acknowledged as the most potential in practical application wu et al 2020 such system consists of a deep sea mining vehicle also named as a pilot miner to collect manganese nodules from the deep seabed a mining support vessel also termed as mother station at surface and a transportation system between the mining vehicle and the support vessel the deep sea mining vehicle simultaneously collects submarine manganese nodules and travels on the soft sea ground the lifting system then transports the collected nodules deposits from dsmv to the support vessel through a lifting system e g a pump and a pipe the support vessel is to classify and process the nodules by various on board facilities and to emit signals to the deep sea mining vehicle in operation among the deep sea lifting mining systems dsmv is a core component due to its extracting and collecting functions on the deep seafloor cho et al 2019 in worldwide some typical dsmv prototypes were developed and tested in the sea trial in 2007 korea research institute of ships and ocean engineering kriso designed a concept minero i dsmv fig 6 a which was at the scale 1 20 of the commercial capacity hong et al 2010 in 2012 the collection efficiency of minero ii dsmv fig 6 b was validated by an inshore pre pilot mining test in the ease sea at 130 m water depth yeu et al 2015 yoon et al 2012 the weight and size of minero ii dsmv are 28 tons in air 9 8tons in water and 6 5m l 5m w 4m h respectively the series minero dsmv prototypes are shown in fig 6 in 2000 national institute of ocean technology niot institut für konstruktion iks and university of siegen germany jointly designed a deep sea mining machine fig 7 a which has an undercarriage unit with track belts having involute tooth profile initially the system was tested for sand and silt mining operations short term operations at 410m depth in 2001 and the modified system for long term operations was tested at 521m depth in 2006 fig 7 b deepak et al 2007 then the efforts have been made towards for practical 6000 m depth that is a remotely operable electrically operable sub sea for sea trail testing was conducted at 5462m water depth in ciob in 2011 muthukrishna babu et al 2014 by the cooperation between central south university china and cebynetic corporation france a second generation deep sea mining vehicle is developed fig 8 which is with special sharp triangular teeth track the weight of this dsmv prototype are 11 7 tons in air and its size is 9 2 m length 5 2 m width 3m height respectively the concept dsmv was validated in 135 m depth in water and it collected 9000 kg artificial manganese nodules dai et al 2019 for practical application numerous studies on the dynamic analysis of dsmv and the control technology were conducted in these issues the recent progress and main contributions of dsmv were reviewed as followings 3 dynamic analysis of deep sea mining vehicle dsmv as a dsmv moves on the deep seafloor for collecting manganese nodules the trafficability of the vehicle by the sufficient traction force is a significant issue for its safe operation i e without great sinking and slipping and turnover xu et al 2019 different from the land soil deep sea sediment has larger void ratio higher water content and more obvious rheological performances suneel et al 2008 ma et al 2014 2016 therefore it is significant to study the dynamic mobility performance of dsmv in deep sea environment 3 1 tractive analysis of dsmv based on the properties of deep sea sediment when dsmv walks on the sea floor sediment a typical elastic plastic deformation of soil occurs in the beginning the shear stress increases proportionally to the displacement in which the elastic deformation is dominated at a certain shear displacement by the action of dsmv the sea floor soil starts to fail and plastic deformation is merged when the maximum shear stress is reaches the soil is completely in failure in which the stress reduces to its residual value due to this elastic plastic deformation the sinkage of dsmv is the main source of power and traction force loss currently sinkage and traction force of dsmv on sea floor operation are mainly studied based on elastic plastic constitutive models of the deep sea sediment by the classical bekker theory bekker 1969 an empirical equation between normal pressure and sinkage of deep sea soil was initially investigated by schulte and wschwarz 2009 in which the static sinkage calculation and sinkage with respect to time were briefly obtained in addition to ground failure assessment for the practical seafloor sediment in the kr5 korea reserved 5 area in pacific zone choi et al 2011 applied distribution fitting methods to the elastic plastic constitutive model of sea floor sediment and its probability distribution of nonlinear shear strength with depth was obtained for further considering the energy loss effects wang et al 2016 proposed an elastic soft plastic model for shear stress displacement model of deep sea soil and its effectiveness was verified by series shearing tests of simulative sea floor soil see fig 9 through this model the drawbar pull function of dsmv was predicted and validated by experimental testing compared with above mentioned static time independent prediction methods some rheological models considering rate related and time dependent effect are developed when dsmv is moving forward on the deep seabed the sediment is compressed and sheared that is the sinkage of dsmv is influenced not only by compressive force but also by shear force therefore the traction force is affected by the shear and compressive interaction of seabed soil for describing this compression shear coupling effect xu et al 2018 proposed an endochronic rheological constitutive model and key parameters were determined by coupling creep tests based on the proposed constitutive model of sea floor soil moving simulation of dsmv was conducted in which sinkage deformation and traction force were derived later this research team xu et al 2019 applied a kelvin hooke k h model to simulate compressive and shear rheological properties of seabed soil and a theoretical analysis on traction force for actual track shoe structures of dsmv was deduced the prediction results e g maximum traction force of this model was much closer to actual situation this k h model was also validated for describing impact compressive creep characteristics of simulative sea floor soil ma et al 2016 recently qi et al 2019 established a fractional derivative burgers model to describe rheological property of sea floor soil and its key parameters were identified by creep test of simulative soil in pacific c c mining area the ground contact length of track and walking velocity of dsmv was then predicted which provided safety design for improving mining efficiency some representative reports on the physical and mechanical properties of deep sea sediment are listed in table 1 highlight and applicability of different constitutive models for sea floor sediment are compared during operation when a dsmv moves on the sea floor the track system laterally transmits the engine torque to the soil track interface which results in slip displacement and an associated soil trust acting as a traction force for accurately predicting the traction situation researchers baek et al 2019 carried out experimental study on the soil thrust of underwater tracked vehicle moving on the soft seafloor the development and characteristics of two main different failure modes block and wedge failure see fig 10 were discussed and thus the traction performance influenced by the different failure was studied 3 2 track structure characteristics on trafficability of dsmv besides the properties of deep sea soil trafficability of the tracked dsmv on a deep sea floor is also dependent on the contact area of the track geometrical characteristics of tracked grousers choi et al 2011 for the mining vehicle there are several track shoes types such as passive aggressive grouser and bladed type grouser and the last one is often utilized in dsmv xu et al 2019 in last decades there are some literatures on the studies of traction force by different grouser parameters and the optimization design an experimental study was initially conducted hong and choi 2001 on grouser shape effects on the tractive performance of mining vehicle on extremely soft deep seabed triangle and blade types of grouser shapes with 18 models were investigated and the sinkage and traction forces of each grouser model were evaluated by considering variable bearing pressure and shearing velocity of mining vehicles effect of tracked grouse height on tractive performance of dsmv was carried out by li et al 2017 a single track shoe with grouse driving model was initially established fig 11 which derives the optimal track structural parameters for improving tractive performance of dsmv on soft sediment the total driving force improved rapidly with the increment of the grouse height and the slip rate and the influential law of different grouser height ranges e g 0 15 cm and 15 30 cm or slip ratio 0 40 were discussed similarly xu et al 2019 numerically conducted track shoe structure optimization of dsmv based on sediment track interaction in multi objective optimal analysis see fig 12 they stated that it was better to choose the thick triangle track shoe or the sharp triangle track shoe when the sinkage or the traction force was respectively considered as a dominant factor recently inspired by the natural bionics theory the crawled mineral collector based on deep sea sediment was optimized by the design of bionic grousers cai et al 2020 the grouser was designed and optimized by buffalo hoof s profile as shown in fig 13 it is found that the maximum traction of grouser was related to the grouser parameters e g distance l from the top of the curvature change point and curvature radius r and the best bionic grouser walking speed for mineral collection was obtained 3 3 dynamics modeling and analysis of dsmv evaluation of dsmv trafficability and locomotion performance is essential for the safety design of working principle which directly affects the continuous operation of the entire deep sea mining system in the aspect of numerical simulation some studies on dynamic modeling and analysis were conducted li and zhong 2005 developed a multi rigid body model and a virtual pilot miner with a scale 1 1 to actual size in software automatic dynamic analysis of mechanical system adams and adamas tracked vehicle toolkit atv the moving responses of dsmv were simulated at different speeds weights and positions of central mass and varied terrains and resistances of pipe system were considered this model was validated by the measured data from a lake trial of 150 m water depth by integrating physical model of the deep sea sediment dai et al 2015 developed a multi body dynamic model of deep sea miner in recurdyn software fig 14 in which its trafficability and locomotion performance were evaluated the tendency of traction force with varied slip rate and speed was derived similarity work were conducted by xu et al 2018 2019 the difference was that the coupling shear compressive characteristics of deep sea sediment was considered compared with the above mentioned simulation in multi body dynamic method some subsystem analysis or single body dynamic method for dsmv were proposed with the high calculation cost and reasonable computational accuracy kim et al 2013 proposed a subsystem synthesis method to investigate dynamics analysis of deep sea tracked vehicle in which subsystems in complex dsmv was independently analyzed with virtual massless reference bodies and they were synthesized into an overall multi body tracked vehicle with effective matrix and vector based on discretized track terrain interaction model a simplified three dimensional 3d single body of seafloor pilot miner fig 15 was developed with three rotational and three translational degrees of freedom dai et al 2010 this method provided a rapid possibility for dynamic analysis of dsmv recently edwin et al 2018 developed and implemented an algorithmic method for calculation of deep sea soil deformation in track contact patch for single rigid body modeling of tracked dsmv in which plastically deformable nature of soil in sink direction and the change in track contact area in dsmv s operation on uneven surfaces were explored fig 16 in the aspect of theoretical analysis some dynamic models were proposed for achieving locomotion responses of dsmv maclaurin 2014 applied a mobility envelop approach to establish a trencher walking traction model which compared traction requirements and soil resistance for operational conditions a modified magic formula was used to describe the relationship between traction and slip of mining vehicle track in soft cohesive soils and the effects of altering tyre size and pressure were predicted based on nonlinear rheological properties of seafloor dai et al 2015 established a mathematical model to evaluate the deep sea miner s tractive performance in which the variation of slip ratio and primary design parameters were considered it is found that the traction force reaches a maximum value when the optimum slip ratio was 3 similarly based on seabed structural interaction the relationship of traction force velocity and time were obtained by adomian decomposition method qi et al 2019 besides theoretical and numerical analysis some researchers conducted scaled experimental testing for validation dai et al 2015 studied the interaction between a seafloor tracked dsmv and the sediment by laboratory simulated experiments dsmv s geometric locomotion performances were evaluated in different operation conditions i e turning trajectory climbing obstacle crossing as shown in fig 17 wang et al 2016 conducted a drawbar pull test to study tractive performance for seafloor tracked trencher of dsmv by measurement drawbar pull forces with different sediment conditions contact pressures and width of track structure were obtained for further estimation of the sinkage and breakout forces in maneuverability of tracked vehicle for soft soils amudha et al 2014 experimentally investigated the immediate breakout forces of plates with involute grousers and single track unit of undercarriage unit in dsmv fig 18 and the magnitude of traction forces were obtained 3 4 high efficiency design of dsmv by dynamic analysis collection efficiency is also a critical performance for dsmv in deep sea mining process based on dynamic analysis a few studies have been conducted on the structural design optimization of dsmv collector for improving the operational efficiency by considering the probability distribution of seafloor sediment a water jet lifting tracked dsmv was conceptually designed choi et al 2011 its design principle was that maximization of safety and durability and minimization of energy consumption and environmental impacts based on coandă effect cho et al 2019 developed an optimal design for mining collection device of dsmv with coupled constraints the sketch of the optimal collector with baffle plate and water jet nozzle was shown in fig 19 the design principle was to seperate the manganese nodules from the semi liquid layer of the deep seabed and the underwater performance of the designed dsmv were tested similarly kim et al 2019 proposed an reliability based design optimization method for the pick up device of dsmv using coandă effect by considering the uncertainties of the size and mass of the manganese nodules the designed pick up device showed a significant improvement in collecting efficiency additionally to guarantee the dsmv collector can walk on the soft sediment of seafloor suspension principle for deep sea mining was proposed zheng et al 2014 in which the supporting and driving mechanisms were separated to avoid collector sinkage fig 20 the traction forces of designed dsmv could reach to 800 kg and the sinkage was under the limitation less than 8 cm recently liu et al 2020 proposed a novel pipe leg walking mining robot fig 21 this design utilized a driving component to drive the lifting pile for walking which improved stability and efficiency to complete the mining task on the manganese nodule geological layer during operation the benthic organisms were sucked and transferred by the negative pressure suction mechanism which effectively protects the life and living environment of the

of a series of deep sea mining work and the planning precision directly affects the operational efficiency according to economic benefits and safety dsmv s path planning should meet the requirements of high coverage and low repetition rate mathai et al 2012 for three dimensional path planning shi et al 2008 proposed an ant colony optimization particle swarm optimization hybrid algorithm aco pso in which the mining vehicle was simplified as a particle motion in a two dimensional plane for sweeping mining path park et al 2011 designed algorithms for two conventional mining paths i e contour parallel and direction parallel and the collection efficiency was maximized considering the operational safety and collection efficiency of tracked miner dai and liu 2013 proposed two improved mining paths see fig 22 in which the miner turned with relative long radius and the distance between its straight line path was controlled as the width of the vehicle compared to the conventional mining path the designed principles could avoid large sinkage and high slip 4 2 dynamic control of dsmv 4 2 1 walking control of seafloor tracked mining vehicle to travel along an expected mining path a seafloor tracked miner should be precisely controlled which requires an accurate track keeping a stable forward speed and steering ratio currently the walking control of tracked dsmv is mainly focused on three aspects the speed maintenance heading correction and slip control in practical speed maintenance is significant for trajectory control of tracked dsmv yoon et al 2012 designed a pi controller to realize speed control according to the open loop response the parameters of the tracking system were identified and the pi gain was generated by the tuning formula the proposed control algorithm was also validated by an underwater robot in order to maintain a stable steering ratio and forward speed yeu et al 2015 proposed a four column track speed distribution mode see fig 23 in which a pi controller was upgraded and pi gain was adjusted to the approximately millisecond constrained integral gain optimization amigo rule this model was verified with higher efficiency and accuracy according to the above mentioned novel paths control dai et al 2019 further established the dynamic models for the dsmv as shown in fig 24 in which a fuzzy control algorithm and fuzzy adaptive pid control algorithm were adopted to control track speed and speed ratio separately co simulation showed that the trajectory deviation could be generally controlled within 0 5 m besides speed control heading control is also significant for maneuvering of tracked dsmv on the seafloor sediment focusing on dsmv perception and attitude control by considering drag characteristics varshney et al 2013 proposed a dsmv speed and heading angle control method and this method was verified by a virtual prototype simulation dynamic simulation showed that mining machines was able to traverse seabed terrain similarity liu and guo 2018 proposed a novel trajectory tracking pid control algorithm through continuous correction of the heading angle and track deviation feedback precise control of the dsmv path was achieved slip is a major factor affecting dsmv speed and heading control currently anti slip research of tracked vehicle mainly divided into two groups active control and passive control methods passive control focused on the transformation of mechanical structures such as optimizing the shape of track shoes from the perspective of active control some studies have been conducted as follows herzog et al 2007 utilized a speed sensor to monitor the speed of dsmv track wheels in real time and built a dsmv control system to prevent side slip its validation was verified by the experimental testing of niot iks deep sea mining machine wang et al 2008 used an integral separation pid control algorithm to control drive torque of the wheel to keep slip rate in the optimal state in this control algorithm a pd control was adopted when the system error is large and then the derivative action was increased to relieve the system instability however this controller only deals with the slip issue during the straight line driving and it still has limitation in the practical application by considering the influence of terrain slope and side angled route ouyang and wang 2016 further proposed an improved sliding mode control algorithm in which an optimal track slip rate was tracked by controlling the torque of the driving wheel and its good performance was proved through simulation compared with the linear control algorithm this improved sliding mode control was adaptable to the uncertainty of the seabed terrain 4 2 2 motion control of propelled rov and auv in advance of seabed mining operations it is necessary to conduct a series of tasks such as exploration sampling and positioning by propelled rovs and auvs different from the relatively fixed and simple path of the tracked dsmv the trajectory of rov and auv is usually a complex spatial curve which brings great disturbance and uncertainty to the design of the controller therefore linear controllers e g pid control for tracked dsmv is unable to satisfy the requirements of the movement of rov and auv jin et al 2016 introduced a model predictive control mpc method based on constrained discrete time for thruster driven underwater vehicles compared with traditional control methods i e fuzzy control and adaptive control it took the current state as the starting point and considered the motion information to assist in realizing precise motion control in order to satisfy the high precision motion of underwater vehicles driven by propellers shen et al 2018 proposed a lyapunov based model predictive control lmpc for auv lmpc controller exploited nonlinearities in the system dynamics which gained additional robustness compared to the inverse dynamics control feedback linearization simulation results showed that this controller significantly improved the performance of trajectory tracking control simetti et al 2018 developed a hierarchical control scheme and proposed an intelligent control strategy in which the motion variables e g speed response and position feedback and dynamic variables e g load and torque of the underwater robot were respectively controlled fig 25 this method was expected to achieve robust control under different operating parameters of dsmv later this research team sartore et al 2019 utilized multi beam echo sounder mbes and laser induced breakdown spectroscopy libs technology to derive the location of the mining area and complete the identification of manganese nodules fig 26 some representative reports on control strategies of dsmv are listed in table 2 and highlight and applicability of different control strategies are compared 4 3 navigation and positioning of dsmv apart from designing an efficient walking control integrating an accurate positioning system for mining system also plays a significant role it is known that global positioning system gps is a common navigation method on land however this method is not effective in deep sea environment due to the rapid decay of electromagnetic signals currently acoustic baseline positioning abp is widely utilized for navigation and positioning of dsmv abp method was composed of transceivers and transponder and the acoustic transponder was equipped on tracked mining vehicle which will communicate to the transceivers acoustically by calculating distance and phase difference between the transponder and each transceiver the position of mining vehicle in relative to transceivers were determined according to the different distance of baseline it can be divided into three main types long baseline lbl short baseline sbl and ultra short baseline usbl among them lbl system are usually fixed on the seafloor with the highest positioning accuracy but deployment and recovery have yet to be resolved sbl and usbl are widely used due to their convenience and flexibility by acoustic baseline positioning method some valuable studies have been conducted ramji et al 2007 proposed dsmv equipped with an ultrashort base line usbl and a real time positioning through dynamic positioning of the surface mother ship was realized later a new mining system framework named vamos was proposed by almeida et al 2018a b the system included a dsmv surface launch and recovery mother ship and auv hrov for mining area exploration see fig 27 an accurate real time positioning of dsmv was achieved through multi sensor system by trial testing the results demonstrated that long term real time position errors below 0 2 m for dsmv were accomplished ji et al 2019 proposed a new hybrid navigation system hns for underwater tracked vehicles which consisted of ring laser gyro sensors rlg integration kalman filter and ultra short baseline usbl as shown in fig 28 the effectiveness of hns was verified by the experiment of the underwater trencher uri r it should be noticed that one single navigation system may not satisfy the working requirements of deep sea mining system and thus multiple sensor signals e g measured signals in inertial measurement unit ring laser gyro sensor ultrashort baseline sensor should be developed and utilized for the navigation and positioning development in deep sea environment recently inspired from the fish lateral line a series of researches on attitude perception flow field identify and obstacles recognition of rov have been conducted by liu et al 2018 2019 2020 compared with traditional perception technologies this perception method is not affected by external electromagnetic and acoustic interference sources that is it may be more suitable for utilized in deep sea environment hence bionic perception method may provide high application potential in the navigation and perception of deep sea mining vehicles 5 summary in this paper the development of deep sea mining system and key technologies are reviewed some typical dsmv prototypes and underwater testing are presented current designed dsmvs are mainly based on remotely operated vehicle generally sea trials of dsmv are conducted in the water depth within 600 m and its collection efficiency is evaluated by collecting artificial manganese nodules recent achievement on dynamic analysis of dsmv is reviewed which is crucial for the trafficability in soft deep sea sediment considering the deformation modes of seafloor e g compression shear and combined mode different constitutive laws of sea soil are established and the interaction between deep sea sediment and tracked dsmv are discussed dynamic modeling methods of dsmv in sea soil are developed which is well to understand the operation mechanisms of dsmv additionally the influence of track characteristics on the trafficability of dsmv is presented and some optimal track grousers are proposed to accomplish minimal sink and slip for engineering applications in deep sea environment current key control strategies of dsmv are reviewed especially in path planning dynamic motion navigation and positioning for ensuring mining collection efficiency path planning control methods of dsmv e g deep learning tracking control intelligent aco pso hybrid algorithm adaptive fuzzy control are proposed which helps to overcome the nonlinear fluid and sediment disturbance achieve obstacle avoidance maximize coverage of minerals and minimize repetition rate in terms of motion control classical control methods e g pid sliding model fuzzy lyapunov based model are utilized by inputting sensor feedback data which achieves the expected dynamic state of dsmv with lack of light in deep sea operation precise navigation and real time positioning control methods of dsmv are reviewed it is concluded that a hybrid navigation system by integration of multiple sensor signals is crucial for deep sea operation of dsmv and some bionic perception method may provide high application potential in the navigation and perception of deep sea mining vehicles in the past decades numerous efforts have been made to develop deep sea mining technologies however there is still no commercial mining activity since there are some critical issues which have not been well solved firstly the loss of irreversible biodiversity from

keywords deep sea mining dynamic analysis track characteristics motion control positioning 1 introduction with the era of rapid industrialization land mineral resources are gradually to reduce the extraction of ocean mineral resource has been paid increasingly attention sharma 2017 as one of the significant unexploited treasures and high tech fields deep sea has become an important strategic target for the major economies of the world kang et al 2019 in worldwide the distribution of current known deposits of mineral resources is shown in fig 1 according to statistics the total amount of polymetallic nodules in the all major oceans is about 500 billion tons and the potential resource of sulfide is 1 4 billion tons worth 385 3 billion us dollars such substantial and valuable untapped resources attracted the interest of the international mining industry and many countries including united states of america russia australia china japan korea france india and germany teague et al 2018 the united states geological surveys usgs expects that deep sea mining of critical metals to reach around 5 percent of global supply by 2030 and 15 percent by 2050 by the international sea authority fig 2 illustrates some global exploration locations for deep sea mineral in generally deep sea mineral resources are in extreme environments and have special occurrence conditions there are three main types of deposits on the sea floor fig 3 polymetallic nodules also termed as manganese nodules which lies up to 4000 6000 m water depth massive sulfides sms located near hot water vents on volcanic rocks and cobalt rich crusts that are found on the slopes and summits of undersea mountains as one typical miner resource manganese nodule mn occurs as potato shaped concretions on the deep sea abyssal plains manganese nodules form two dimensional deposits on top or within the first 10 cm of the deep sea sediments fig 4 due to its location in flat seafloor mn has the greatest mining potential with easy implementation the abundant manganese nickel copper cobalt molybdenum and rare earth metals of mn miners make them commercial potential in worldwide industrial applications hein et al 2013 however the harsh and complex operating environments induce the difficulty on exploration of deep sea mining currently there are still few commercial mining companies and national governments with the ability to actually capitalize deep sea mineral teague et al 2018 some researchers pointed that the mining sediment plumes noise and chemical pollution could disturb the habitat for marine life for decades and permanently damage the deep sea floor in deep sea environment some operational issues should be also considered e g soft deep seabed low temperature lack of ambient light positioning and sensors therefore mining technologies and equipment adapting to deep sea environments is significant which determines the commercial and engineering prospective of the ocean mining industry in this paper key technologies of deep sea mining systems especially operational mining vehicles are reviewed the reminders are organized as follows in section 2 the development of deep sea

status of deep sea mining vehicle techniques 2 existing structural design of deep sea mining system in last decades four main types of deep sea mining systems have been developed that is submarine drag bucket mining system continuous line bucket mining system masuda et al 1971 shuttle vessel mining system rajesh et al 2011 and pipeline lift mining system sharma 2017 in early 60s submarine drag bucket mining system was designed by omi operation in united states of america by the sea trail it was demonstrated that such mining system could not trace the scheduled mining paths and its manipulability was difficult which induced to low efficiency then the continuous line bucket clb mining system was proposed in japan although clb system was easy to manufacture and with low cost yet the buckets were often inter twined which blocked the mining operation for enhancing the mobility shuttle vessel mining system was developed but the high cost of battery and manufacturing fees hindered its applications the development of deep sea mining systems is illustrated in fig 5 recently pipeline lift mining system is universally acknowledged as the most potential in practical application wu et al 2020 such system consists of a deep sea mining vehicle also named as a pilot miner to collect manganese nodules from the deep seabed a mining support vessel also termed as mother station at surface and a transportation system between the mining vehicle and the support vessel the deep sea mining vehicle simultaneously collects submarine manganese nodules and travels on the soft sea ground the lifting system then transports the collected nodules deposits from dsmv to the support vessel through a lifting system e g a pump and a pipe the support vessel is to classify and process the nodules by various on board facilities and to emit signals to the deep sea mining vehicle in operation among the deep sea lifting mining systems dsmv is a core component due to its extracting and collecting functions on the deep seafloor cho et al 2019 in worldwide some typical dsmv prototypes were developed and tested in the sea trial in 2007 korea research institute of ships and ocean engineering kriso designed a concept minero i dsmv fig 6 a which was at the scale 1 20 of the commercial capacity hong et al 2010 in 2012 the collection efficiency of minero ii dsmv fig 6 b was validated by an inshore pre pilot mining test in the ease sea at 130 m water depth yeu et al 2015 yoon et al 2012 the weight and size of minero ii dsmv are 28 tons in air 9 8tons in water and 6 5m l 5m w 4m h respectively the series minero dsmv prototypes are shown in fig 6 in 2000 national institute of ocean technology niot institut für konstruktion iks and university of siegen germany jointly designed a deep sea mining machine fig 7 a which has an undercarriage unit with track belts having involute tooth profile initially the system was tested for sand and silt mining operations short term operations at 410m depth in 2001 and the modified system for long term operations was tested at 521m depth in 2006 fig 7 b deepak et al 2007 then the efforts have been made towards for practical 6000 m depth that is a remotely operable electrically operable sub sea for sea trail testing was conducted at 5462m water depth in ciob in 2011 muthukrishna babu et al 2014 by the cooperation between central south university china and cebynetic corporation france a second generation deep sea mining vehicle is developed fig 8 which is with special sharp triangular teeth track the weight of this dsmv prototype are 11 7 tons in air and its size is 9 2 m length 5 2 m width 3m height respectively the concept dsmv was validated in 135 m depth in water and it collected 9000 kg artificial manganese nodules dai et al 2019 for practical application numerous studies on the dynamic analysis of dsmv and the control technology were conducted in these issues the recent progress and main contributions of dsmv were reviewed as followings 3 dynamic analysis of deep sea mining vehicle dsmv as a dsmv moves on the deep seafloor for collecting manganese nodules the trafficability of the vehicle by the sufficient traction force is a significant issue for its safe operation i e without great sinking and slipping and turnover xu et al 2019 different from the land soil deep sea sediment has larger void ratio higher water content and more obvious rheological performances suneel et al 2008 ma et al 2014 2016 therefore it is significant to study the dynamic mobility performance of dsmv in deep sea environment 3 1 tractive analysis of dsmv based on the properties of deep sea sediment when dsmv walks on the sea floor sediment a typical elastic plastic deformation of soil occurs in the beginning the shear stress increases proportionally to the displacement in which the elastic deformation is dominated at a certain shear displacement by the action of dsmv the sea floor soil starts to fail and plastic deformation is merged when the maximum shear stress is reaches the soil is completely in failure in which the stress reduces to its residual value due to this elastic plastic deformation the sinkage of dsmv is the main source of power and traction force loss currently sinkage and traction force of dsmv on sea floor operation are mainly studied based on elastic plastic constitutive models of the deep sea sediment by the classical bekker theory bekker 1969 an empirical equation between normal pressure and sinkage of deep sea soil was initially investigated by schulte and wschwarz 2009 in which the static sinkage calculation and sinkage with respect to time were briefly obtained in addition to ground failure assessment for the practical seafloor sediment in the kr5 korea reserved 5 area in pacific zone choi et al 2011 applied distribution fitting methods to the elastic plastic constitutive model of sea floor sediment and its probability distribution of nonlinear shear strength with depth was obtained for further considering the energy loss effects wang et al 2016 proposed an elastic soft plastic model for shear stress displacement model of deep sea soil and its effectiveness was verified by series shearing tests of simulative sea floor soil see fig 9 through this model the drawbar pull function of dsmv was predicted and validated by experimental testing compared with above mentioned static time independent prediction methods some rheological models considering rate related and time dependent effect are developed when dsmv is moving forward on the deep seabed the sediment is compressed and sheared that is the sinkage of dsmv is influenced not only by compressive force but also by shear force therefore the traction force is affected by the shear and compressive interaction of seabed soil for describing this compression shear coupling effect xu et al 2018 proposed an endochronic rheological constitutive model and key parameters were determined by coupling creep tests based on the proposed constitutive model of sea floor soil moving simulation of dsmv was conducted in which sinkage deformation and traction force were derived later this research team xu et al 2019 applied a kelvin hooke k h model to simulate compressive and shear rheological properties of seabed soil and a theoretical analysis on traction force for actual track shoe structures of dsmv was deduced the prediction results e g maximum traction force of this model was much closer to actual situation this k h model was also validated for describing impact compressive creep characteristics of simulative sea floor soil ma et al 2016 recently qi et al 2019 established a fractional derivative burgers model to describe rheological property of sea floor soil and its key parameters were identified by creep test of simulative soil in pacific c c mining area the ground contact length of track and walking velocity of dsmv was then predicted which provided safety design for improving mining efficiency some representative reports on the physical and mechanical properties of deep sea sediment are listed in table 1 highlight and applicability of different constitutive models for sea floor sediment are compared during operation when a dsmv moves on the sea floor the track system laterally transmits the engine torque to the soil track interface which results in slip displacement and an associated soil trust acting as a traction force for accurately predicting the traction situation researchers baek et al 2019 carried out experimental study on the soil thrust of underwater tracked vehicle moving on the soft seafloor the development and characteristics of two main different failure modes block and wedge failure see fig 10 were discussed and thus the traction performance influenced by the different failure was studied 3 2 track structure characteristics on trafficability of dsmv besides the properties of deep sea soil trafficability of the tracked dsmv on a deep sea floor is also dependent on the contact area of the track geometrical characteristics of tracked grousers choi et al 2011 for the mining vehicle there are several track shoes types such as passive aggressive grouser and bladed type grouser and the last one is often utilized in dsmv xu et al 2019 in last decades there are some literatures on the studies of traction force by different grouser parameters and the optimization design an experimental study was initially conducted hong and choi 2001 on grouser shape effects on the tractive performance of mining vehicle on extremely soft deep seabed triangle and blade types of grouser shapes with 18 models were investigated and the sinkage and traction forces of each grouser model were evaluated by considering variable bearing pressure and shearing velocity of mining vehicles effect of tracked grouse height on tractive performance of dsmv was carried out by li et al 2017 a single track shoe with grouse driving model was initially established fig 11 which derives the optimal track structural parameters for improving tractive performance of dsmv on soft sediment the total driving force improved rapidly with the increment of the grouse height and the slip rate and the influential law of different grouser height ranges e g 0 15 cm and 15 30 cm or slip ratio 0 40 were discussed similarly xu et al 2019 numerically conducted track shoe structure optimization of dsmv based on sediment track interaction in multi objective optimal analysis see fig 12 they stated that it was better to choose the thick triangle track shoe or the sharp triangle track shoe when the sinkage or the traction force was respectively considered as a dominant factor recently inspired by the natural bionics theory the crawled mineral collector based on deep sea sediment was optimized by the design of bionic grousers cai et al 2020 the grouser was designed and optimized by buffalo hoof s profile as shown in fig 13 it is found that the maximum traction of grouser was related to the grouser parameters e g distance l from the top of the curvature change point and curvature radius r and the best bionic grouser walking speed for mineral collection was obtained 3 3 dynamics modeling and analysis of dsmv evaluation of dsmv trafficability and locomotion performance is essential for the safety design of working principle which directly affects the continuous operation of the entire deep sea mining system in the aspect of numerical simulation some studies on dynamic modeling and analysis were conducted li and zhong 2005 developed a multi rigid body model and a virtual pilot miner with a scale 1 1 to actual size in software automatic dynamic analysis of mechanical system adams and adamas tracked vehicle toolkit atv the moving responses of dsmv were simulated at different speeds weights and positions of central mass and varied terrains and resistances of pipe system were considered this model was validated by the measured data from a lake trial of 150 m water depth by integrating physical model of the deep sea sediment dai et al 2015 developed a multi body dynamic model of deep sea miner in recurdyn software fig 14 in which its trafficability and locomotion performance were evaluated the tendency of traction force with varied slip rate and speed was derived similarity work were conducted by xu et al 2018 2019 the difference was that the coupling shear compressive characteristics of deep sea sediment was considered compared with the above mentioned simulation in multi body dynamic method some subsystem analysis or single body dynamic method for dsmv were proposed with the high calculation cost and reasonable computational accuracy kim et al 2013 proposed a subsystem synthesis method to investigate dynamics analysis of deep sea tracked vehicle in which subsystems in complex dsmv was independently analyzed with virtual massless reference bodies and they were synthesized into an overall multi body tracked vehicle with effective matrix and vector based on discretized track terrain interaction model a simplified three dimensional 3d single body of seafloor pilot miner fig 15 was developed with three rotational and three translational degrees of freedom dai et al 2010 this method provided a rapid possibility for dynamic analysis of dsmv recently edwin et al 2018 developed and implemented an algorithmic method for calculation of deep sea soil deformation in track contact patch for single rigid body modeling of tracked dsmv in which plastically deformable nature of soil in sink direction and the change in track contact area in dsmv s operation on uneven surfaces were explored fig 16 in the aspect of theoretical analysis some dynamic models were proposed for achieving locomotion responses of dsmv maclaurin 2014 applied a mobility envelop approach to establish a trencher walking traction model which compared traction requirements and soil resistance for operational conditions a modified magic formula was used to describe the relationship between traction and slip of mining vehicle track in soft cohesive soils and the effects of altering tyre size and pressure were predicted based on nonlinear rheological properties of seafloor dai et al 2015 established a mathematical model to evaluate the deep sea miner s tractive performance in which the variation of slip ratio and primary design parameters were considered it is found that the traction force reaches a maximum value when the optimum slip ratio was 3 similarly based on seabed structural interaction the relationship of traction force velocity and time were obtained by adomian decomposition method qi et al 2019 besides theoretical and numerical analysis some researchers conducted scaled experimental testing for validation dai et al 2015 studied the interaction between a seafloor tracked dsmv and the sediment by laboratory simulated experiments dsmv s geometric locomotion performances were evaluated in different operation conditions i e turning trajectory climbing obstacle crossing as shown in fig 17 wang et al 2016 conducted a drawbar pull test to study tractive performance for seafloor tracked trencher of dsmv by measurement drawbar pull forces with different sediment conditions contact pressures and width of track structure were obtained for further estimation of the sinkage and breakout forces in maneuverability of tracked vehicle for soft soils amudha et al 2014 experimentally investigated the immediate breakout forces of plates with involute grousers and single track unit of undercarriage unit in dsmv fig 18 and the magnitude of traction forces were obtained 3 4 high efficiency design of dsmv by dynamic analysis collection efficiency is also a critical performance for dsmv in deep sea mining process based on dynamic analysis a few studies have been conducted on the structural design optimization of dsmv collector for improving the operational efficiency by considering the probability distribution of seafloor sediment a water jet lifting tracked dsmv was conceptually designed choi et al 2011 its design principle was that maximization of safety and durability and minimization of energy consumption and environmental impacts based on coandă effect cho et al 2019 developed an optimal design for mining collection device of dsmv with coupled constraints the sketch of the optimal collector with baffle plate and water jet nozzle was shown in fig 19 the design principle was to seperate the manganese nodules from the semi liquid layer of the deep seabed and the underwater performance of the designed dsmv were tested similarly kim et al 2019 proposed an reliability based design optimization method for the pick up device of dsmv using coandă effect by considering the uncertainties of the size and mass of the manganese nodules the designed pick up device showed a significant improvement in collecting efficiency additionally to guarantee the dsmv collector can walk on the soft sediment of seafloor suspension principle for deep sea mining was proposed zheng et al 2014 in which the supporting and driving mechanisms were separated to avoid collector sinkage fig 20 the traction forces of designed dsmv could reach to 800 kg and the sinkage was under the limitation less than 8 cm recently liu et al 2020 proposed a novel pipe leg walking mining robot fig 21 this design utilized a driving component to drive the lifting pile for walking which improved stability and efficiency to complete the mining task on the manganese nodule geological layer during operation the benthic organisms were sucked and transferred by the negative pressure suction mechanism which effectively protects the life and living environment of the

of a series of deep sea mining work and the planning precision directly affects the operational efficiency according to economic benefits and safety dsmv s path planning should meet the requirements of high coverage and low repetition rate mathai et al 2012 for three dimensional path planning shi et al 2008 proposed an ant colony optimization particle swarm optimization hybrid algorithm aco pso in which the mining vehicle was simplified as a particle motion in a two dimensional plane for sweeping mining path park et al 2011 designed algorithms for two conventional mining paths i e contour parallel and direction parallel and the collection efficiency was maximized considering the operational safety and collection efficiency of tracked miner dai and liu 2013 proposed two improved mining paths see fig 22 in which the miner turned with relative long radius and the distance between its straight line path was controlled as the width of the vehicle compared to the conventional mining path the designed principles could avoid large sinkage and high slip 4 2 dynamic control of dsmv 4 2 1 walking control of seafloor tracked mining vehicle to travel along an expected mining path a seafloor tracked miner should be precisely controlled which requires an accurate track keeping a stable forward speed and steering ratio currently the walking control of tracked dsmv is mainly focused on three aspects the speed maintenance heading correction and slip control in practical speed maintenance is significant for trajectory control of tracked dsmv yoon et al 2012 designed a pi controller to realize speed control according to the open loop response the parameters of the tracking system were identified and the pi gain was generated by the tuning formula the proposed control algorithm was also validated by an underwater robot in order to maintain a stable steering ratio and forward speed yeu et al 2015 proposed a four column track speed distribution mode see fig 23 in which a pi controller was upgraded and pi gain was adjusted to the approximately millisecond constrained integral gain optimization amigo rule this model was verified with higher efficiency and accuracy according to the above mentioned novel paths control dai et al 2019 further established the dynamic models for the dsmv as shown in fig 24 in which a fuzzy control algorithm and fuzzy adaptive pid control algorithm were adopted to control track speed and speed ratio separately co simulation showed that the trajectory deviation could be generally controlled within 0 5 m besides speed control heading control is also significant for maneuvering of tracked dsmv on the seafloor sediment focusing on dsmv perception and attitude control by considering drag characteristics varshney et al 2013 proposed a dsmv speed and heading angle control method and this method was verified by a virtual prototype simulation dynamic simulation showed that mining machines was able to traverse seabed terrain similarity liu and guo 2018 proposed a novel trajectory tracking pid control algorithm through continuous correction of the heading angle and track deviation feedback precise control of the dsmv path was achieved slip is a major factor affecting dsmv speed and heading control currently anti slip research of tracked vehicle mainly divided into two groups active control and passive control methods passive control focused on the transformation of mechanical structures such as optimizing the shape of track shoes from the perspective of active control some studies have been conducted as follows herzog et al 2007 utilized a speed sensor to monitor the speed of dsmv track wheels in real time and built a dsmv control system to prevent side slip its validation was verified by the experimental testing of niot iks deep sea mining machine wang et al 2008 used an integral separation pid control algorithm to control drive torque of the wheel to keep slip rate in the optimal state in this control algorithm a pd control was adopted when the system error is large and then the derivative action was increased to relieve the system instability however this controller only deals with the slip issue during the straight line driving and it still has limitation in the practical application by considering the influence of terrain slope and side angled route ouyang and wang 2016 further proposed an improved sliding mode control algorithm in which an optimal track slip rate was tracked by controlling the torque of the driving wheel and its good performance was proved through simulation compared with the linear control algorithm this improved sliding mode control was adaptable to the uncertainty of the seabed terrain 4 2 2 motion control of propelled rov and auv in advance of seabed mining operations it is necessary to conduct a series of tasks such as exploration sampling and positioning by propelled rovs and auvs different from the relatively fixed and simple path of the tracked dsmv the trajectory of rov and auv is usually a complex spatial curve which brings great disturbance and uncertainty to the design of the controller therefore linear controllers e g pid control for tracked dsmv is unable to satisfy the requirements of the movement of rov and auv jin et al 2016 introduced a model predictive control mpc method based on constrained discrete time for thruster driven underwater vehicles compared with traditional control methods i e fuzzy control and adaptive control it took the current state as the starting point and considered the motion information to assist in realizing precise motion control in order to satisfy the high precision motion of underwater vehicles driven by propellers shen et al 2018 proposed a lyapunov based model predictive control lmpc for auv lmpc controller exploited nonlinearities in the system dynamics which gained additional robustness compared to the inverse dynamics control feedback linearization simulation results showed that this controller significantly improved the performance of trajectory tracking control simetti et al 2018 developed a hierarchical control scheme and proposed an intelligent control strategy in which the motion variables e g speed response and position feedback and dynamic variables e g load and torque of the underwater robot were respectively controlled fig 25 this method was expected to achieve robust control under different operating parameters of dsmv later this research team sartore et al 2019 utilized multi beam echo sounder mbes and laser induced breakdown spectroscopy libs technology to derive the location of the mining area and complete the identification of manganese nodules fig 26 some representative reports on control strategies of dsmv are listed in table 2 and highlight and applicability of different control strategies are compared 4 3 navigation and positioning of dsmv apart from designing an efficient walking control integrating an accurate positioning system for mining system also plays a significant role it is known that global positioning system gps is a common navigation method on land however this method is not effective in deep sea environment due to the rapid decay of electromagnetic signals currently acoustic baseline positioning abp is widely utilized for navigation and positioning of dsmv abp method was composed of transceivers and transponder and the acoustic transponder was equipped on tracked mining vehicle which will communicate to the transceivers acoustically by calculating distance and phase difference between the transponder and each transceiver the position of mining vehicle in relative to transceivers were determined according to the different distance of baseline it can be divided into three main types long baseline lbl short baseline sbl and ultra short baseline usbl among them lbl system are usually fixed on the seafloor with the highest positioning accuracy but deployment and recovery have yet to be resolved sbl and usbl are widely used due to their convenience and flexibility by acoustic baseline positioning method some valuable studies have been conducted ramji et al 2007 proposed dsmv equipped with an ultrashort base line usbl and a real time positioning through dynamic positioning of the surface mother ship was realized later a new mining system framework named vamos was proposed by almeida et al 2018a b the system included a dsmv surface launch and recovery mother ship and auv hrov for mining area exploration see fig 27 an accurate real time positioning of dsmv was achieved through multi sensor system by trial testing the results demonstrated that long term real time position errors below 0 2 m for dsmv were accomplished ji et al 2019 proposed a new hybrid navigation system hns for underwater tracked vehicles which consisted of ring laser gyro sensors rlg integration kalman filter and ultra short baseline usbl as shown in fig 28 the effectiveness of hns was verified by the experiment of the underwater trencher uri r it should be noticed that one single navigation system may not satisfy the working requirements of deep sea mining system and thus multiple sensor signals e g measured signals in inertial measurement unit ring laser gyro sensor ultrashort baseline sensor should be developed and utilized for the navigation and positioning development in deep sea environment recently inspired from the fish lateral line a series of researches on attitude perception flow field identify and obstacles recognition of rov have been conducted by liu et al 2018 2019 2020 compared with traditional perception technologies this perception method is not affected by external electromagnetic and acoustic interference sources that is it may be more suitable for utilized in deep sea environment hence bionic perception method may provide high application potential in the navigation and perception of deep sea mining vehicles 5 summary in this paper the development of deep sea mining system and key technologies are reviewed some typical dsmv prototypes and underwater testing are presented current designed dsmvs are mainly based on remotely operated vehicle generally sea trials of dsmv are conducted in the water depth within 600 m and its collection efficiency is evaluated by collecting artificial manganese nodules recent achievement on dynamic analysis of dsmv is reviewed which is crucial for the trafficability in soft deep sea sediment considering the deformation modes of seafloor e g compression shear and combined mode different constitutive laws of sea soil are established and the interaction between deep sea sediment and tracked dsmv are discussed dynamic modeling methods of dsmv in sea soil are developed which is well to understand the operation mechanisms of dsmv additionally the influence of track characteristics on the trafficability of dsmv is presented and some optimal track grousers are proposed to accomplish minimal sink and slip for engineering applications in deep sea environment current key control strategies of dsmv are reviewed especially in path planning dynamic motion navigation and positioning for ensuring mining collection efficiency path planning control methods of dsmv e g deep learning tracking control intelligent aco pso hybrid algorithm adaptive fuzzy control are proposed which helps to overcome the nonlinear fluid and sediment disturbance achieve obstacle avoidance maximize coverage of minerals and minimize repetition rate in terms of motion control classical control methods e g pid sliding model fuzzy lyapunov based model are utilized by inputting sensor feedback data which achieves the expected dynamic state of dsmv with lack of light in deep sea operation precise navigation and real time positioning control methods of dsmv are reviewed it is concluded that a hybrid navigation system by integration of multiple sensor signals is crucial for deep sea operation of dsmv and some bionic perception method may provide high application potential in the navigation and perception of deep sea mining vehicles in the past decades numerous efforts have been made to develop deep sea mining technologies however there is still no commercial mining activity since there are some critical issues which have not been well solved firstly the loss of irreversible biodiversity from deep sea mining activities is of particularly importance the balance between ecological state and commercial pattern should be carefully considered secondly the process of deep sea mining may deteriorate the distribution of unmined nodules zones during operation the track of dsmv compacts the soft sea soil into the relative solid foundation which may increase the mining difficulty thirdly some other technical challenges are emerged such as the energy supply extraction vertical transport and mineral processing consequently by technology progress and bionic inspiration future studies

20827,the spiderfloat sf is an offshore wind turbine substructure that promises to drastically reduce project capital expenditure via its modularized slender structure efficient load path and effective use of materials the structural design of the sf must both guarantee component reliability as well as floater stability this article discusses the theory and the analytically developed method to determine the internal loads and the required dimensions of the sf s main components during preliminary design the classical elastic beam theory is extended to a higher order to account for buckling risk and shortening due to bending and applied to the sf s typical leg member two key load cases are considered in this preliminary sizing analyzed against both service and ultimate limit states sls and uls the first loading scenario occurs on a dry dock during sf s assembly and is associated with the pretensioning of the cables which realizes both the overall structure stiffness as well as the concrete leg and stem prestress the second load case is an operational condition at sea and near turbine rated power after assessing the loads the leg dimensions and the reinforcement geometry are determined by satisfying both sls and uls requirements based on design standards the newly developed structural model is implemented in the software tool soft4s which was verified against

smart floating offshorewind turbine usflowt usflowt is funded by arpa e s atlantis program and has the goal of reducing fowt s lcoe via the innovative platform spiderfloat sf supporting a state of the art 10 mw class wind turbine the sf substructure fig 1 was conceived to enable ccd optimization including smart control systems for mass minimization system stability and performance the components of the substructure are fully modular and designed for ease of manufacturing through a combination of local content prefab and onsite manufacturing transport and installation the low fixity level of the joints transfers minimum bending loads among the members thus reducing demand on structural resistance and allowing for tunable system hydrodynamic stiffness rather than responding to the waves as a rigid unit sf s compliant members can have individual dynamics thus can mitigate wave hydrodynamic forces and damp unwanted energy with only a reduced portion transferred to the rotor nacelle assembly and tower compared to currently deployed heavy and stiff floaters of oil and gas o g derivation e g fig 2 sf s innovative ultracompliant approach becomes evident however this ultra flexible layout gives rise to complex dynamics and therefore requires a robust control system to maintain stability and performance sf makes use of reinforced concrete rc with an effective pre stressing strategy realized via the very same stay cables that guarantee the structural shape and functional integrity of the floater rc structures can offer ample versatility in design and construction can take advantage of local material and labor resources are virtually maintenance free feature cost competitive material concrete and steel utilization and have excellent fatigue and dynamic damping properties the sf can largely be manufactured at port and with relatively small footprint the legs are modular with three or more segments precast or slipformed at port the leg segments can be stacked in a relatively small staging area and picked up and moved to the assembly dock where they are bolted and grouted at their connections and installed onto the sf the central stem is also fabricated out of rc assembled in bolted grouted segments and benefits from the pre compression realized by the same stay post tensioning cables as well as additional internal tendons this modular industrialized construction method allows for simultaneous multi component fabrication and parallel staging with minimum real estate usage therefore mitigating the drawbacks often attributed to concrete construction the buoyancy cans are comprised of bundles of glass fiber reinforced plastic gfrp pressure vessels tied together and linked to the ends of the legs during assembly the cans can also be fabricated on site via filament winding in this study we developed an engineering model to determine the internal loads on the cables and legs that can then be used to size both components whereas this model can help size the sf central stem the stem design will be the object of a future article in our approach the classical linear elastic beam theory was analytically extended to include second order effects e g p δ moment amplification that could lead to both an amplification of the bending stresses and to global instability the theory was used to help close a system of equations for the static balance of the leg cable subsystem that would otherwise be indeterminate the new theory was developed from first principles and implemented into a python code i e spiderfloat offshore floater tool for sizing soft4s that can leverage openmdao s optimization framework gray et al 2019 and the aero hydro servo elastic ahse tools orcaflex orcina ltd 2020 and openfast jonkman 2013 soft4s can in fact produce input files for these ahse codes after determining the preliminary dimensions of the sf in turn ahse simulations provide more accurate estimates of the external loads needed to run soft4s as such soft4s allows for quick turn around analyses of the usflowt support structure and system dynamics within the ccd iterations numerically efficient tools such as the one we propose are in fact needed to guide the floater preliminary design through a multidisciplinary optimization infrastructure thereby rendering an effective balance between system mass thus costs and performance additionally within openmdao s framework when coupled to a system and plant cost model e g dykes et al 2011 soft4s allows for the full gamut of component investigations to arrive at lcoe optimized wind turbine and or

optimization criteria e g minimum subcomponent mass or overall total structural mass are customizable depending on the user s needs soft4s also allows for parametric investigations and sensitivity analyses of both external factors and geometric variables that may drive the characteristics of the structure thereby illustrating their impact on the mass stiffness strength reliability and expected costs soft4s can determine among other design variables the required leg length its outer and inner diameters its embedded reinforcement and the number size and prestress values of the cables a set of functions implement structural code checks per aci 2014 to verify the leg cross section under serviceability limit state sls and ultimate limit state uls and at various stations along the span the

loads are derived from ahse simulations acceptable ranges for the design variables e g maximum and minimum diameters prestress levels rebar and hoop reinforcement size and numbers must also be provided as input parameters the model has undergone preliminary verification a future version of the model will include a refined fatigue treatment and automatic selection of standard dimensions for the various subcomponents this document discusses the geometry of the sf in section 2 with an overview of the nomenclature used throughout this study the load determination problem and its indeterminate nature are presented in section 3 section 4 first presents the newly developed analytical beam theory and then a compatibility approach to make the force system of equations determinate section 5 discusses the necessary steps for sls and uls leg verification in section 6 soft4s is used to derive a preliminary design for legs and cables of the sf and a cross verification of the newly developed model is performed against a commercial finite element method fem package a summary of soft4s s development and planned future research are provided in section 7 2 geometry and coordinate systems the geometry of the sf main components is shown in fig 3 also shown are the symbols used in this study to denote the main design variables due to the 120 deg symmetry for simplicity we will focus on 1 3 of the sf and analyze one leg with its cable systems although the analytical development is carried out in the vertical plane for increased clarity the lateral plane statics is analogous and the axis symmetric nature of the leg allow for a combination of the loads in a new coordinate system the typical mooring line not shown is connected via a fairlead at the joint between the leg and the buoyancy can there are two main coordinates systems employed in this development one is the global reference frame also shown in fig 3 and the other is the beam local coordinate system shown in fig 4 the global reference frame has the origin at the intersection of the mean sea level plane and the central stem axis in the undisturbed configuration x g is along the nominal wind direction z g is vertical and pointing upward and y g per right hand rule in this study the rigid body rotation pitch roll and yaw expected less than 10 are assumed negligible without losing in generality ahse simulations proved that the largest distributed hydrodynamic loads exerted on the leg inertial plus viscous drag components on the order of 1 10 3 nm 1 are about an order of magnitude less than the buoyancy component on the order of 1 10 4 nm 1 the leg local reference frame fig 4 has origin in a joint between leg and central stem z b is along the leg axis x b is perpendicular to z b and nominally in the horizontal plane and y b points downward following the right hand rule 3 the load determination problem the sf in fig 3 can be reduced to an assembly of beams and tension only members the cables in fig 5 we examine the forces acting on the hinge b here we consider the action of the twin cables c 1 a c 1 b and c 2 a c 2 b in the vertical plane x g z g as a simplification in the treatment of this structure an equivalent single cable with a doubled cross sectional surface area replaces each cable pair these equivalent cables are denoted by c1 and c2 for the lower and upper cable respectively because of the expected sf geometry the difference between the tension calculated for the equivalent cable and the sum of the associated cable pair tensions is less than 0 6 accordingly we will denote the resultants of the cable tensions in the vertical plane as n c 1 and n c 2 for the lower and upper cable pairs respectively the lateral plane statics can be treated in a similar fashion to what will be presented here for sake of clarity and because the driving loads resulted to be those associated with the vertical plane statics we concentrate on the latter plane and forgo the treatment of the former in this article the lateral component of the cable tension as well as the leg shear and bending in the lateral plane however are fully included in our software soft4s implementation finally the structure in fig 5 is shown with the stem in the upright position as mentioned above a non nil heel angle has to be expected during turbine operation 10 but the theory development is virtually unchanged when accounting for a constant bias in the platform attitude angles for sake of clarity in this paper we omit the small listing angle effects though soft4s s implementation includes these details as well 3 1 statically indeterminate structural system we can write the balance of forces at b in the global coordinate system x g z g as in eq 1 1 n c 1 cos θ c 1 n e cos θ l n c 2 cos θ c 2 f c 0 n c 1 sin θ c 1 n e sin θ l n c 2 sin θ c 2 b e f f 0 where n e is the equivalent force aligned with a b and acting onto the leg therefore n e is the reaction from the leg onto joint b θ c 1 θ l θ c 2 are the angles between the normal to the stem axis and the various members after any deflection occurred f c is the horizontal component of the force exerted by the can and mooring line onto the leg due to hydrodynamic and inertial loading and assumed known b e f f is the effective buoyancy magnitude at joint b accounting for other hydrodynamic forces for the weight of the buoyancy can bundle half the weight of the cables and half the weight of the leg as shown in eq 2 2 b e f f b c m e f f l l 0 2 m c m c 1 m c 2 g 2 b c m g 2 where b c is the buoyancy force at b m e f f is the effective mass per unit length to account for hydrostatic buoyancy hydrodynamic and distributed inertial loads l l 0 is the leg length in the undeformed condition m c is the mass of the buoyancy can bundle at b m c 1 is the mass of cable set c 1 m c 2 is the mass of cable set c 2 and g is the magnitude of the gravitational acceleration assuming the angles θ c 1 θ l and θ c 2 as shown in fig 5 are known the unknowns are then three n c 1 n c 2 and n e note that because all of the forces intersect at b the resultant moment is intrinsically nil and therefore the system of equations is underdetermined it is straightforward to prove that the beam system is in fact one time hyperstatic this means that to close the system of equations in eq 1 one must account for the stiffness of the members and therefore obtain a new equation by examining the displacement of the joint b from b 0 i e its position before any load application to its final position one could write an equation linking the displacement u b w b in the global reference frame to that in the local beam reference frame as shown in eq 3 and fig 6 3 w l l 0 u b cos θ l w b sin θ l finally an expression for w l l 0 could be derived from the elastic line theory applied to the leg member as a function of the stiffness properties of the leg and then use eq 3 to tie that to the overall system geometry and close the system in eq 1 in the next section an innovative analytical beam theory is provided to help solve the indeterminate structural system 4 elastic beam theory extension and solution of the indeterminate structure a new theory is developed that is nonlinear in terms of final configuration geometry but still linear in terms of material stress strain relationship in this section we highlight the main equations of this new analytical method with the full mathematical development offered in appendix d in sections 4 1 4 3 the classical beam theory is modified to include a contribution from the bending deformation to the normal force by retaining a second order term in the taylor expansion of the axial strain this allows to write the equilibrium of the external loads and internal forces on the deformed configuration of the structure in turn this allows to include changes in the geometric stiffness of the leg and therefore second order p δ effects associated with potential buckling and instability most traditional methods for incorporating these effects in the analysis of structures are based on time consuming iterative techniques wilson 2002 powell 2010 in section 4 4 the indeterminate system of equations presented in the previous section is augmented with a compatibility equation derived from the modified beam theory which then allows its solution 4 1 derivation of the beam internal loads and transverse deflection given the slender geometry of the typical sf leg it is reasonable to treat the leg as an ideal euler bernoulli beam timoshenko and young 1965 we start this development by analyzing an infinitesimal segment of a leg as shown in fig 7 in eq 4 the balance of the forces acting on the infinitesimal beam segment is written along x b and z b in the local undeformed coordinate system 4 d n cos v d t sin v p z b d z b 0 d t cos v d n sin v q z b d z b 0 where n is the axial load at the span station of interest v is the deflection normal to beam axis in the y b direction t is the shear component along the y axis at span station of interest p z b is the component of the external distributed static loading along the beam z b axis q z b is the component of the external distributed static loading along the beam y b axis d denotes the differential operator throughout this paper the prime symbols and denote first second and third order spatial derivatives relative to z b respectively assuming a constant cross section leg p z b and q z b can be written as in eq 5 5 p z b m e f f g sin θ l q z b m e f f g cos θ l where θ l is the angle between global x and leg and m e f f z b m e f f is the effective mass per unit length to account for hydrostatic buoyancy hydrodynamic and distributed inertial loads results obtained from ahse simulations demonstrated that considering m e f f g as uniform along the leg span is a valid approximation the distributed buoyancy is in fact the largest contribution from the hydrodynamic actions and the peak values of other loading components do not vary significantly along the span under these hypotheses and considering the boundary conditions at z b 0 m see also fig 17 eq 4 can be integrated to give expressions for n and t as shown in eq 6 6 n n e m e f f g sin θ l l l 0 2 z b cos v m e f f g cos θ l l l 0 2 z b sin v t n e m e f f g sin θ l l l 0 2 z b sin v m e f f g cos θ l l l 0 2 z b cos v note that the reaction at the joint a was divided into two contributions one aligned with the global z g and one n e aligned as a b it is straightforward to verify that the vertical component must be equal to half the effective weight of the beam no other force can act on joint a for equilibrium of the leg the balance of moments about the right end of the beam segment and along the local x b y g can be written as in eq 7 7 m n sin v t cos v 1 w n cos v t sin v v 0 where m is the bending moment about the local x b axis at the span station of interest making use of eq 6 eq 7 can rewrite as in eq 8 8 m m e f f g cos θ l l l 0 2 z b 1 w n e m e f f g sin θ l l l 0 2 z b v by integrating eq 8 between z b 0 m and the generic z b ˆ and making use of the boundary conditions at the hinge at z b 0 m one arrives at the expression for the bending moment about x b eq 52 by neglecting further shear contributions to the curvature of the beam axis denoting by e c the concrete young s modulus and by j x x c e f f 1 1 see section 5 for its definition the normalized concrete cross sectional second area moment of inertia the euler approximation m e c j x x c e f f v could be used this would result into a second order linear ordinary differential equation ode for the deflection v this ode however does not lend itself to an analytical solution hence two simplifications are performed on eq 8 the first simplification neglects the terms containing w in concrete it is common to assume a maximum compressive strain at uls ε c u 0 003 thus the term 1 w in eq 8 can be taken as 1 however even with this simplification the resulting ode has variable coefficients and does not have a readily useful analytical solution therefore a second simplification consists of replacing the term m e f f g sin θ l l l 0 2 z b that multiplies v with its mean value in 0 l l 0 which can be easily proven to be 0 eq 8 can now be analytically integrated with nil boundary conditions at a to return an expression for v as in eq 9 9 v z b m e f f g n e α 2 cos θ l cos α z b 1 cos α l l 0 sin α l l 0 sin α z b l l 0 z b 2 z b α 2 1 where α is taken as 10 α n e e c j x x c e f f note that for α l l 0 0 the expression in eq 9 goes to infinity i e we have the eulerian buckling condition timoshenko and gere 1963 of α l l 0 i c π i c 1 2 which would render the critical load n e c r 11 n e c r π 2 e c j x x c e f f l l 0 2 i c 2 4 2 nonlinear constitutive equation and derivation of the beam axial deflection to complete this extension of the beam theory we seek to find an expression for w z b that can be used to solve eq 3 by retaining up to second order terms in the taylor expansion of its definition the total strain ε can be expressed as the sum of the axial strain w and the shortening of the beam due to bending 1 2 v 2 see appendix d 1 and fig 7 the axial force n can therefore be expressed as in eq 12 introducing a nonlinearity in the beam constitutive equation 12 n e c a l e f f ε e c a l e f f 1 2 v 2 w where a l e f f 1 is the leg cross sectional area normalized for the presence of rebar see also section 5 starting from eq 6 and acknowledging the constitutive equation in eq 12 one can write a partial differential equation pde for w that includes terms in v accounting for small angle deflection approximation v 1 thus cos v 1 and sin v v and replacing v z b with the expression in eq 9 and by integrating w can be attained as in eq 13 13 w z b 1 e c a l e f f n e z b m e f f g sin θ l l l 0 z b z b 2 2 m e f f g cos θ l 2 e c a l e f f n e 1 α 2 l l 0 2 z b cos α z

the extended elastic beam theory including the approximations assumed so far the beam internal loads can be written as in eq 14 14 n n e m e f f g sin θ l l l 0 2 z b m e f f g cos θ l l l 0 2 z b v t

final cable lengths i e l c 1 f l c 2 f can be expressed as a function of these three unknowns as it is shown below the sf assembly sequence starts with the central stem resting on a stand while the legs are being positioned at the correct elevation the cables are then connected at the a s and b s hinges and pre tensioning of the c1 and c2 cable sets occurs to reach a preset tensioning value e g σ c 1 p t σ c 2 p t as recorded by the tensioners once in the water with the system fully assembled the hinge at b would assume a new deflected position i e u b w b that also directly affects the loads in the cables first the cable tensions n c 1 and n c 2 can be thought as given by the superposition of the loads reached during the prestressing phase with prescribed stress values of σ c 1 p t and σ c 2 p t respectively and those due to the assumed deflection of the b hinge i e u b w b when in the water during operation the cable tensions can therefore be written as in eq 18 18 n c 1 n c 1

f f terms are appropriately modified to include distributed buoyancy effects hydrodynamic viscous and inertial drag and structural inertia loading 5 leg dimensioning the design verification against sls and uls of one of sf s rc legs is performed following the steps highlighted in this section here we focus solely on the structural design aspects and assume that the leg hydrodynamic requirements have already been addressed whereby specifying for example minimum leg length maximum leg mass and or buoyancy the latter demands would be verified by the external optimization loop of soft4s called soft generally speaking the structural verification consists of satisfying sls fatigue limit state fls accidental limit states als and uls design requirements in the case of sf boat impacts must be considered as concentrated loads at critical locations along the span of a leg and central stem other potential accidental load cases would require investigating the loss of a stay cable these aspects are certainly important and will require dedicated studies to assess the level of acceptable risk and redundancy required in this paper we concentrate on sls and uls which should also guarantee a certain level of safety against als and fls at least for the concrete leg a considerable amount of research is still ongoing on reinforced concrete fatigue but general rules based on damage equivalent load del and damage equivalent stress des fib 2013 ecs 2004 dnv gl 2016 can be employed with the internal load determination model as described in this paper furthermore simplified methods ecs 2004 check for an adequate fatigue life by using the maximum and minimum compressive stress under the most typical load combination therefore the methods described in this paper can be directly applied to assess the fatigue life of cables and leg we will address these aspects in a future article an additional verification should be performed on the system and component eigenfrequencies to ensure they lie within acceptable ranges for resonance avoidance the eigenfrequency check is outside the scope of this article but is an additional constraint that in parallel to the other structural checks must be satisfied by the design the eigenanalysis can be performed by calculating cross sectional inertial and stiffness properties and passing them to an ad hoc finite element analysis fea module young s and shear moduli to be used by the fea are the pure concrete ones and the effective density ρ c e f f is calculated as in eq 20 20 ρ c e f f ρ c a c ρ s a s t o t a g where ρ c is the concrete density a c is the pure concrete cross sectional surface area ρ s is the longitudinal reinforcement density a s t o t is the total nonprestressed reinforcement cross sectional area at the station of interest a g is the gross cross sectional area the main assumptions made in the leg dimensioning process described in this paper are 1 the leg cross section is assumed constant along the leg span this arrangement streamlines formwork and manufacturing as will be shown the middle span is the most stressed cross section hence tapering would have to be realized from the leg center toward the ends and the resulting mass advantage at this point is not deemed significant for the same reason the numbers and sizes of non prestressing reinforcement could theoretically change from section to section but this is beyond the scope of this study 2 the tensile strength of the concrete is assumed nil 3 the generic cross section is considered uncracked at sls but it is allowed to crack beyond that load level and at uls when the load reduces below the sls level the crack would close and the leg would retain the necessary integrity and dynamic properties of an uncracked structure under those assumptions and with reference to figs 3 and 8 the leg s geometry and structural properties are fully determined by outer and inner diameters d l d l the number and size of prestressing stay cables the number and size of nonprestressing reinforcement the number and size of shear reinforcement ties hoops or spirals material properties as shown for example in table 1 the structural verification process of a prestressed concrete psc leg design of given geometry and parameters as in table 1 starts with the identification of sls fls and uls loads the sls loads can be conservatively taken as those at quasi steady state with rated conditions and severe sea state e g design load case dlc 1 6 iec 2019 extreme sea states with faults e g dlc 6 2 iec 2019 extrapolated loads with return periods of once every 50 yr from dlc 1 1 or other emergency cases may give rise to the uls loads fls loads can be extracted from normal power production and parked idling cases e g dlc 1 2 and 6 4 iec 2019 these loads can be derived through dedicated ahse simulations the key steps for sls and uls verification are listed below 1 determine external loads via ahse and post processing of results 2 calculate cross section normalized area and second area moments of inertia 3 calculate eigenfrequencies and ensure they are within tolerances 4 sls verification a calculate internal loads solving eq 17 which also accounts for second order effects and moment amplification due to bending deflection in the vertical plane a conservative value of the resultant of the gravitational inertial and hydrodynamic distributed loads can be employed as mentioned in section 3 the lateral plane loads are not explicitly treated in this article but are verified in soft4s in a similar manner the resultant internal loads in this document are denoted by n axial load at the span station of interest negative if compressive m bending moment about the local x b axis at the span station of interest m z torque at the span station of interest and t shear component along the y axis at the span station of interest in fig 9 the local reference frame is shown with the typical leg cross section with the x axis aligned with the resultant bending moment m and therefore the y axis is normal to the neutral axis b ensure maximum cable prestress value below allowable e g σ c 1 p t σ c 2 p t a c 1 a c 2 0 7 f u c aci 2014 section 20 3 2 5 or per cable vendor recommendations f u c is the cable ultimate strength c ensure maximum acceptable leg tip deflection against an adequate threshold for example one that would guarantee a safe margin from the slack condition of c2 d ensure quantities of longitudinal and shear reinforcement are adequate to satisfy design standards e g aci 2014 e verify the stresses in the cross sections of interest against sls per section 5 1 1 additionally ensure longitudinal and shear reinforcement is adequate to satisfy spacing requirements by aci 2014 this verification will also lead to the sizing of cable pre tension cable cross sectional area concrete and if needed non prestressed reinforcement 5 uls verification a as for the sls calculate the internal loads for uls for simplicity the resultant loads are still denoted by the same symbols as for the sls load case n m m z and v b verify the strength of the cross sections of interest against uls per section 5 1 2 note that the soft4s code calculates all the geometric and inertial properties for a cross section defined as in fig 8 including the area first and second moments of inertia and centroids of the individual reinforcement groups and with respect to an axis of symmetry say the x axis or to a calculated chord location e g above the cross section neutral axis 5 1 verification of psc leg cross section and cable cross sections the assumed cross section of the psc leg and its main x y coordinate system with origin in the geometric center are depicted in fig 8 the meaning of the other symbols are given in table 1 and in the following sections 5 1 1 verification against sls limit states at sls the cross section is considered uncracked therefore with reference to fig 9 the neutral axis position must satisfy the condition 21 y n d l 2 where y n is the neutral axis distance from the cross section s centroid here the goal is to find the number and size of cables and the associated prestress levels necessary to guarantee minimum deflection and uncracked conditions of the leg the optimal design condition is to have the bottom fiber in fig 9 at 0 strain when the sls load set is applied the strain in the concrete ε c y can be expressed as shown in eq 22 22 ε c y y n y ε c m i n h n where h n is the neutral axis distance from the cross section extreme compressed fiber and ε c m i n is the ε c m i n if we ignore the nonlinearity between stress and strain as commonly done in sls verifications and leverage the uncracked condition and symmetry of the cross section then the normalized cross sectional area and second area moment i e a c e f f and j x x c e f f gilbert and mickleborough 2004 macgregor 2011 can be used to calculate the normal compressive stresses in the concrete σ c z as in eq 23 23 σ c z γ f s l s n a c e f f m j x x c e f f y where γ f s l s is the load partial safety factor for sls for the generic rebar located at y s assuming perfect bonding of rebar and concrete one could attain the compressive stress as in eq 24 24 σ s z y s σ c z y s n r c where nrc is the ratio of rebar steel to concrete young s moduli once the stresses and strains are known the criteria indicated in appendix e must be met per aci 2014 5 1 2 verification against uls limit states at uls the cross section is assumed to have reached the maximum compressive strain in the concrete and possibly cracked in the tension zone the verification consists of ensuring that the ultimate strength of the cross section is adequate for the ultimate loading conditions in the case of the leg a slender member subject to axial and flexure loading stability is obviously a possible failure the model developed in sections 3 4 implicitly included second order effects however hence here it will be sufficient to concentrate on the cross section uls design as would be done for a short member aci 2014 requires 25 φ a c i p n n u 26 φ a c i m n m u 27 φ a c i v n t u 28 φ a c i t q n m z u where p n n u are the nominal axial strength in compression for a given external bending moment and factored normal axial load at the station of interest respectively m n m u are the nominal bending moment resistance at the station of interest and factored bending moment at the station of interest respectively v n t u are the nominal shear strength and factored shear load at the station of interest respectively and t q n m z u are the nominal torsional strength and factored torsion load at the station of interest respectively first the axial and bending moment loads should be assessed against the design interaction curve then other code check criteria can be verified in fig 10 a the assumed concrete strain distribution with a maximum compressive strain value equal to ε c u and a stress distribution characterized by the stress block whitney 1937 aci 2014 sect 22 2 2 4 1 are shown for generality the cross section is shown with prestressed elements as well to extract the nominal cross

i th prestressed tendon element note that the strain in the rebar ε s y is the same as ε c y because the rebar is assumed fully bonded with the concrete for the prestressing tendons however ε p y p i must account for the prestress strain and for the concrete compressive strain at transfer finally the stresses in the reinforcement elements are calculated as eq s 39 40 39 σ s z y s i sign ε s y s i

at nominal axial strength of the cross section to complete the verification against uls the criteria listed in appendix f must be met 6 case study and model cross verification in this section we show the results of a preliminary design iteration for the sf leg and cable assembly based on expected overall footprint mass and required buoyancy to support a 10 mw turbine and a generic 70mpa strength concrete as the sf is covered by sensitive intellectual property ip we present normalized loads and geometry quantities from soft4s s results two loading scenarios were considered the first is representative of the load transfer at post tensioning during the assembly phase on land and the second represents the quasi steady state situation under operational conditions at sea typical values for effective buoyancy value and the horizontal component of the force exerted by the can and mooring line onto the leg during operation were derived through dedicated fully coupled ahse simulations on dry land the only external loads considered are due to gravitational effects both distributed along the leg span and concentrated at the joints the method described in section 3 was used to arrive at the internal loads for cables and legs first a sensitivity analysis of cable cross section is given in fig 11 a in this graph the upper cable diameter is shown as a function of the lower cable counterpart under the assumption that no vertical deflection w is permitted at post tensioning transfer and with cable pre tensioning loads equal to p 0 c 1 σ c 1 p t a c 1 and p 0 c 2 σ c 2 p t a c 2 for lower and upper cable respectively in fig 11a the diameters are normalized by the minimum value considered for c1 the upper cable is considerably less loaded than the lower cable due to the geometry and the difference between the angles θ c 1 and θ c 2 and this also translates in a relatively insensitive variation of the c2 diameter with respect to the size of c1 note in fact that increasing a c 1 for a given pre tensioning stress is equivalent to increasing both the leg axial load as well as the tension in the upper cable which then requires a larger cross section for the imposed strength constraints the increase in upper over lower cable diameter however is proportional to a 1 2 ratio this contributes to keeping the elevation of the substructure center of mass relatively low with obvious advantages on stability but at the price of higher load demand on the lower cable and leg alternatively the leg to stem joint could be designed at a higher elevation than that leg to can joint this optimization is outside the scope of this study however fig 11b shows that the component of the leg axial load aligned with a b n e increases more than the individual cable tensions as the cable size increases to fix a set of cable dimensions more analyses on the dynamic characteristics of the system should be performed for example to guarantee avoidance of modal frequencies that can lead to dangerous resonance here for sake of brevity we determined the size of the cables based on an acceptable mean leg tip deflection of 0 2 m at rated conditions and with normal sea state significant wave height of 1 13 m 7 22s peak spectral period in fig 12 a the leg tip deflections and the loads in the leg and cables are shown as functions of the normalized can buoyancy to note is a sharp variation in the deflection occurring when the external actions exceed a value of approximately 1 35 the mean buoyancy in that situation in fact the upper cable becomes slack fig 12b and the overall system may fail although not necessarily representing a chosen layout the present case study is an example of how the design method can be used to assess safety margins with respect to stability conditions for the entire system changes in the design for example by selecting a cable layout with higher pre tension or further limiting the leg tip deflection under operational conditions could guarantee a larger margin of safety with respect to cable slackness turning now to the design of the leg cross section fig 13 shows the leg s normal loads and the translational and rotational deflections along the span for the two load cases considered herein as seen from the graphs soft4s s nonlinear elastic beam method can account for bending brought forth by second order effects and the variation of the normal load as a function of span due to the transverse deflection at post tensioning transfer the leg maximum deflection occurs at mid span and it is approximately double the mean deflection calculated at operation at sea the component of the distributed weight along the leg axis is non nil due to the inclination of the leg and therefore the largest axial load is registered at the joint with the central stem soft4s calculated internal shear and bending moments are presented in fig 14 the largest shear values are found at the leg ends whereas the maximum bending moments occur at mid span for both loading scenarios the at sea case renders about half the internal load magnitudes than those at post tensioning transfer again this emphasizes how the assembly and the post tensioning of the sf are critical aspects of both the structural analysis and of the actual construction phases the cross section verification against sls and uls was conducted by conservatively assuming that the maximum shear acts together with the maximum bending moment and normal load at the mid span station the arrangement of the reinforcement is as in fig 9 for the mid span location a uls interaction diagram was compiled and the results are shown in fig 15 the curves represent the capacity baseline and factored per aci 2014 of the optimized minimum mass cross section and the markers denote the two loading conditions analyzed in this example the post tensioning load transfer scenario is the design driving case and the associated factored loads are just within the acceptable safe boundaries leading to a well balanced design the remainder safety margin 5 will account for additional effects unknown at preliminary design the component mass was calculated at some 27 t for the cables and 270 t for the leg including reinforcement with preliminary estimates on buoyancy can and stem masses we project the total structural mass of the sf at approximately 2000 t although this is a preliminary outcome it shows how the sf departs from heavier conventional designs e g ppi s steel windfloat at approximately 2400 tonne for an 8 mw turbine

mechanical apdl release 2019 r2 a commercial fea package to prove the validity of the newly devised analytical model the leg was assumed as made out of an equivalent isotropic material with young s modulus equal to e c and a concrete effective density as discussed above further modified for distributed buoyancy effects the beam was simulated with a set of beam188 elements more than one to better capture the deformed shape whereas the cables were discretized with a series of link180 subjected to a pretension proportional to their cross sectional areas data extracted from ansys runs fig s 12 14 fig 16 exhibited excellent agreement with the results from soft4s in terms of both internal loads and deflections in fig 16 we report ansys plots of the calculated nodal displacement w the normalized axial force in cables and legs and the bending moment in the leg for the studied operational case for completeness an eigenfrequency analysis was performed to assess the first few structural modes the first mode 1 94 hz is in the lateral plane whereas the first mode in the vertical plane showed a frequency of 3 68 hz see fig 16d the shape functions in ansys s beam element do not readily capture the second order effect that our new method includes and the fea had to be carried out in a fully nonlinear fashion to achieve results whereas ansys requires only a few seconds to solve the analysis versus soft4s s less than 1 s on a modern intel 7 cpu it also requires lengthier set up and post processing activities and does not lend itself to an expedited integration with gradient based optimization soft4s on the other hand facilitates the design of experiments and allows for a full exploration of the sensitivity to design variables and constraint parameters more importantly soft4s s analytical nature promotes a thorough understanding of the physics involved and guides the designers toward a more efficient optimization reducing risk to the project 7 conclusions and future work the floating substructure and mooring components comprise about one third of the capital expenditure capex of a typical floating offshore wind power plant and are responsible for 20 of the lcoe stehly and beiter 2019 reducing the cost of the floating platform can therefore greatly influence the final commercial viability of floating offshore wind the sf was conceived to reduce these costs via a modularized slender structure an efficient load path an effective use of materials leveraging the established concrete supply chain and an industrialized approach to manufacturing the structural design of the sf must both guarantee component reliability as well as floater stability in this paper we developed a new analytical model to size both the leg and the stay cables key components of the sf the employed nonlinear second order method is capable of accounting for beam shortening due to bending and second order bending due to compression as such this method inherently includes design and analyses against buckling instability the method is implemented in soft soft4s a tool for the optimization of the sf that includes hydrodynamic requirements ccd inputs and a cost model together with this new analytical beam theory the steps necessary for the qualification and verification of the rc leg cross section were presented primarily following aci 2014 the sls and uls verifications were the focus of this study although fls will be analyzed following fib 2013 and ecs 2004 once a complete load spectrum is captured by appropriate ahse simulations that are being carried out within the atlantis usflowt project the newly devised method will serve as the main design and analysis tool to extract dels and dess the majority of the leg loading originates from the cable tensions concentrated buoyancy thrust at the joint with the can and distributed buoyancy along the leg span transverse hydrodynamic loading and other components in the vertical plane e g viscous drag or inertial actions are orders of magnitude smaller as based on the preliminary results of ahse simulations additionally the listing angle of the sf is limited to 10 for these reasons and for added clarity the analysis was limited to the vertical plane statics without losing in generality with an obvious extension to the transverse statics a case study was provided to prove the capability of soft4s s structural model two loading situations were analyzed the load transfer at post tensioning and the at sea operational quasi steady state loading scenario first the results of the model helped select the cable size for a prescribed mean leg tip deflection then the returned internal loads were used to size the leg cross section and its reinforcement the data demonstrate that soft4s is capable of optimizing the cross section of the leg and cables given the constraints discussed in section 5 1 while also guaranteeing hydrostatic stability of the floater and other hydrodynamic performance parameters that will be discussed in a separate paper the model is computationally efficient and sensitivity analyses for assessing trade offs between structural mass and control demand to safeguard floater stability and performance can be performed with negligible impact on the design process timeline a cross verification against the commercial package ansys showed excellent agreement in the results of the static load and deformation analysis it is important to note that element shape functions in commercial fem software typically miss the second order effects that soft4s s beam model encompasses and require multiple nonlinear runs to reach the same results the model is now being extended to the central stem of the sf and with some modifications to the buoyancy cans additionally we are planning to include a modal analysis capability that will help identify viable designs against frequency acceptance bands when complete soft4s will then render mass or cost

vertical component must be equal to 1 2 the effective weight of the beam no other force can act on joint a for equilibrium of the leg thus one arrives at eq 46 46 n 0 cos v 0 t 0 sin v 0 n e m e f f g

be derived for the deflection v this ode does not lend itself to an analytical solution and in what follows we will perform some simplifications the first simplification neglects the terms containing w in concrete it is common to assume a maximum compressive strain at uls ε c u 0 003 thus the term 1 w in eq 8 can be taken as 1 and the integral equation becomes 53 e c j x x c e f f v n e v z b m e

and the conditions translates into having v l l 0 0 note that in general we cannot a priori set this boundary conditions for a non rigid beam eq 53 is an ode of the second order with variable coefficients which does not have a readily useful analytical solution the second simplification we carry out in the differential form of eq 8 is to replace the term m e f f g sin θ l l l 0 2 z b that multiplies v with its mean value in 0 l l 0 which can be easily proven to be 0 with this final approximation we obtain 55 e c j x x c e f f v n e v z b m e f f g cos θ l l l 0 2 z b 0 the solution to

20827,the spiderfloat sf is an offshore wind turbine substructure that promises to drastically reduce project capital expenditure via its modularized slender structure efficient load path and effective use of materials the structural design of the sf must both guarantee component reliability as well as floater stability this article discusses the theory and the analytically developed method to determine the internal loads and the required dimensions of the sf s main components during preliminary design the classical elastic beam theory is extended to a higher order to account for buckling risk and shortening due to bending and applied to the sf s typical leg member two key load cases are considered in this preliminary sizing analyzed against both service and ultimate limit states sls and uls the first loading scenario occurs on a dry dock during sf s assembly and is associated with the pretensioning of the cables which realizes both the overall structure stiffness as well as the concrete leg and stem prestress the second load case is an operational condition at sea and near turbine rated power after assessing the loads the leg dimensions and the reinforcement geometry are determined by satisfying both sls and uls requirements based on design standards the newly developed structural model is implemented in the software tool soft4s which was verified against ansys the excellent agreement between the two codes proved that the computationally light soft4s can be reliably used in the optimization of the sf components in the context of control co design where both controls and structures are simultaneously designed to reduce overall costs graphical abstract source j bauer nrel image 1 keywords soft4s floating offshore wind design spiderfloat floating platform design 2 nd order beam theory reinforced concrete beam design prestressed concrete beam design 1 introduction nearly 60 of the calculated u s offshore wind energy resource potential is over waters more than 60 m deep where development of fixed bottom offshore wind turbines is both technically and economically prohibitive musial et al 2016a though this area is estimated to be able to provide the equivalent of the entire u s annual electricity consumption if tapped with power plants composed of floating offshore wind turbines fowts musial et al 2016b the high cost of state of the art fowts poses a formidable barrier to its exploitation in response to this problem the u s department of energy doe s advanced research projects agency energy arpa e kicked off a new program aerodynamic turbines lighter and afloat with nautical technologies and integrated servo control atlantis this program among other goals seeks to promote the design of radically new fowts by maximizing their rotor area to total weight ratio while either maintaining or ideally increasing turbine generation efficiency this would yield levelized cost of energy lcoe values that make deep water sites economically viable to fowt wind development the program encourages the application of control co design ccd methodologies to integrate feedback control and dynamic interaction principles as the primary drivers of the design the floating wind technology company together with the department of electrical engineering at colorado school of mines csm and a multidisciplinary team comprised of the national renewable energy laboratory nrel the university of colorado at boulder cu the university of virgina uva and the american bureau of shipping abs are involved in a project named ultra flexible smart floating offshorewind turbine usflowt usflowt is funded by arpa e s atlantis program and has the goal of reducing fowt s lcoe via the innovative platform spiderfloat sf supporting a state of the art 10 mw class wind turbine the sf substructure fig 1 was conceived to enable ccd optimization including smart control systems for mass minimization system stability and performance the components of the substructure are fully modular and designed for ease of manufacturing through a combination of local content prefab and onsite manufacturing transport and installation the low fixity level of the joints transfers minimum bending loads among the members thus reducing demand on structural resistance and allowing for tunable system hydrodynamic stiffness rather than responding to the waves as a rigid unit sf s compliant members can have individual dynamics thus can mitigate wave hydrodynamic forces and damp unwanted energy with only a reduced portion transferred to the rotor nacelle assembly and tower compared to currently deployed heavy and stiff floaters of oil and gas o g derivation e g fig 2 sf s innovative ultracompliant approach becomes evident however this ultra flexible layout gives rise to complex dynamics and therefore requires a robust control system to maintain stability and performance sf makes use of reinforced concrete rc with an effective pre stressing strategy realized via the very same stay cables that guarantee the structural shape and functional integrity of the floater rc structures can offer ample versatility in design and construction can take advantage of local material and labor resources are virtually maintenance free feature cost competitive material concrete and steel utilization and have excellent fatigue and dynamic damping properties the sf can largely be manufactured at port and with relatively small footprint the legs are modular with three or more segments precast or slipformed at port the leg segments can be stacked in a relatively small staging area and picked up and moved to the assembly dock where they are bolted and grouted at their connections and installed onto the sf the central stem is also fabricated out of rc assembled in bolted grouted segments and benefits from the pre compression realized by the same stay post tensioning cables as well as additional internal tendons this modular industrialized construction method allows for simultaneous multi component fabrication and parallel staging with minimum real estate usage therefore mitigating the drawbacks often attributed to concrete construction the buoyancy cans are comprised of bundles of glass fiber reinforced plastic gfrp pressure vessels tied together and linked to the ends of the legs during assembly the cans can also be fabricated on site via filament winding in this study we developed an engineering model to determine the internal loads on the cables and legs that can then be used to size both components whereas this model can help size the sf central stem the stem design will be the object of a future article in our approach the classical linear elastic beam theory was analytically extended to include second order effects e g p δ moment amplification that could lead to both an amplification of the bending stresses and to global instability the theory was used to help close a system of equations for the static balance of the leg cable subsystem that would otherwise be indeterminate the new theory was developed from first principles and implemented into a python code i e spiderfloat offshore floater tool for sizing soft4s that can leverage openmdao s optimization framework gray et al 2019 and the aero hydro servo elastic ahse tools orcaflex orcina ltd 2020 and openfast jonkman 2013 soft4s can in fact produce input files for these ahse codes after determining the preliminary dimensions of the sf in turn ahse simulations provide more accurate estimates of the external loads needed to run soft4s as such soft4s allows for quick turn around analyses of the usflowt support structure and system dynamics within the ccd iterations numerically efficient tools such as the one we propose are in fact needed to guide the floater preliminary design through a multidisciplinary optimization infrastructure thereby rendering an effective balance between system mass thus costs and performance additionally within openmdao s framework when coupled to a system and plant cost model e g dykes et al 2011 soft4s allows for the full gamut of component investigations to arrive at lcoe optimized wind turbine and or

optimization criteria e g minimum subcomponent mass or overall total structural mass are customizable depending on the user s needs soft4s also allows for parametric investigations and sensitivity analyses of both external factors and geometric variables that may drive the characteristics of the structure thereby illustrating their impact on the mass stiffness strength reliability and expected costs soft4s can determine among other design variables the required leg length its outer and inner diameters its embedded reinforcement and the number size and prestress values of the cables a set of functions implement structural code checks per aci 2014 to verify the leg cross section under serviceability limit state sls and ultimate limit state uls and at various stations along the span the

loads are derived from ahse simulations acceptable ranges for the design variables e g maximum and minimum diameters prestress levels rebar and hoop reinforcement size and numbers must also be provided as input parameters the model has undergone preliminary verification a future version of the model will include a refined fatigue treatment and automatic selection of standard dimensions for the various subcomponents this document discusses the geometry of the sf in section 2 with an overview of the nomenclature used throughout this study the load determination problem and its indeterminate nature are presented in section 3 section 4 first presents the newly developed analytical beam theory and then a compatibility approach to make the force system of equations determinate section 5 discusses the necessary steps for sls and uls leg verification in section 6 soft4s is used to derive a preliminary design for legs and cables of the sf and a cross verification of the newly developed model is performed against a commercial finite element method fem package a summary of soft4s s development and planned future research are provided in section 7 2 geometry and coordinate systems the geometry of the sf main components is shown in fig 3 also shown are the symbols used in this study to denote the main design variables due to the 120 deg symmetry for simplicity we will focus on 1 3 of the sf and analyze one leg with its cable systems although the analytical development is carried out in the vertical plane for increased clarity the lateral plane statics is analogous and the axis symmetric nature of the leg allow for a combination of the loads in a new coordinate system the typical mooring line not shown is connected via a fairlead at the joint between the leg and the buoyancy can there are two main coordinates systems employed in this development one is the global reference frame also shown in fig 3 and the other is the beam local coordinate system shown in fig 4 the global reference frame has the origin at the intersection of the mean sea level plane and the central stem axis in the undisturbed configuration x g is along the nominal wind direction z g is vertical and pointing upward and y g per right hand rule in this study the rigid body rotation pitch roll and yaw expected less than 10 are assumed negligible without losing in generality ahse simulations proved that the largest distributed hydrodynamic loads exerted on the leg inertial plus viscous drag components on the order of 1 10 3 nm 1 are about an order of magnitude less than the buoyancy component on the order of 1 10 4 nm 1 the leg local reference frame fig 4 has origin in a joint between leg and central stem z b is along the leg axis x b is perpendicular to z b and nominally in the horizontal plane and y b points downward following the right hand rule 3 the load determination problem the sf in fig 3 can be reduced to an assembly of beams and tension only members the cables in fig 5 we examine the forces acting on the hinge b here we consider the action of the twin cables c 1 a c 1 b and c 2 a c 2 b in the vertical plane x g z g as a simplification in the treatment of this structure an equivalent single cable with a doubled cross sectional surface area replaces each cable pair these equivalent cables are denoted by c1 and c2 for the lower and upper cable respectively because of the expected sf geometry the difference between the tension calculated for the equivalent cable and the sum of the associated cable pair tensions is less than 0 6 accordingly we will denote the resultants of the cable tensions in the vertical plane as n c 1 and n c 2 for the lower and upper cable pairs respectively the lateral plane statics can be treated in a similar fashion to what will be presented here for sake of clarity and because the driving loads resulted to be those associated with the vertical plane statics we concentrate on the latter plane and forgo the treatment of the former in this article the lateral component of the cable tension as well as the leg shear and bending in the lateral plane however are fully included in our software soft4s implementation finally the structure in fig 5 is shown with the stem in the upright position as mentioned above a non nil heel angle has to be expected during turbine operation 10 but the theory development is virtually unchanged when accounting for a constant bias in the platform attitude angles for sake of clarity in this paper we omit the small listing angle effects though soft4s s implementation includes these details as well 3 1 statically indeterminate structural system we can write the balance of forces at b in the global coordinate system x g z g as in eq 1 1 n c 1 cos θ c 1 n e cos θ l n c 2 cos θ c 2 f c 0 n c 1 sin θ c 1 n e sin θ l n c 2 sin θ c 2 b e f f 0 where n e is the equivalent force aligned with a b and acting onto the leg therefore n e is the reaction from the leg onto joint b θ c 1 θ l θ c 2 are the angles between the normal to the stem axis and the various members after any deflection occurred f c is the horizontal component of the force exerted by the can and mooring line onto the leg due to hydrodynamic and inertial loading and assumed known b e f f is the effective buoyancy magnitude at joint b accounting for other hydrodynamic forces for the weight of the buoyancy can bundle half the weight of the cables and half the weight of the leg as shown in eq 2 2 b e f f b c m e f f l l 0 2 m c m c 1 m c 2 g 2 b c m g 2 where b c is the buoyancy force at b m e f f is the effective mass per unit length to account for hydrostatic buoyancy hydrodynamic and distributed inertial loads l l 0 is the leg length in the undeformed condition m c is the mass of the buoyancy can bundle at b m c 1 is the mass of cable set c 1 m c 2 is the mass of cable set c 2 and g is the magnitude of the gravitational acceleration assuming the angles θ c 1 θ l and θ c 2 as shown in fig 5 are known the unknowns are then three n c 1 n c 2 and n e note that because all of the forces intersect at b the resultant moment is intrinsically nil and therefore the system of equations is underdetermined it is straightforward to prove that the beam system is in fact one time hyperstatic this means that to close the system of equations in eq 1 one must account for the stiffness of the members and therefore obtain a new equation by examining the displacement of the joint b from b 0 i e its position before any load application to its final position one could write an equation linking the displacement u b w b in the global reference frame to that in the local beam reference frame as shown in eq 3 and fig 6 3 w l l 0 u b cos θ l w b sin θ l finally an expression for w l l 0 could be derived from the elastic line theory applied to the leg member as a function of the stiffness properties of the leg and then use eq 3 to tie that to the overall system geometry and close the system in eq 1 in the next section an innovative analytical beam theory is provided to help solve the indeterminate structural system 4 elastic beam theory extension and solution of the indeterminate structure a new theory is developed that is nonlinear in terms of final configuration geometry but still linear in terms of material stress strain relationship in this section we highlight the main equations of this new analytical method with the full mathematical development offered in appendix d in sections 4 1 4 3 the classical beam theory is modified to include a contribution from the bending deformation to the normal force by retaining a second order term in the taylor expansion of the axial strain this allows to write the equilibrium of the external loads and internal forces on the deformed configuration of the structure in turn this allows to include changes in the geometric stiffness of the leg and therefore second order p δ effects associated with potential buckling and instability most traditional methods for incorporating these effects in the analysis of structures are based on time consuming iterative techniques wilson 2002 powell 2010 in section 4 4 the indeterminate system of equations presented in the previous section is augmented with a compatibility equation derived from the modified beam theory which then allows its solution 4 1 derivation of the beam internal loads and transverse deflection given the slender geometry of the typical sf leg it is reasonable to treat the leg as an ideal euler bernoulli beam timoshenko and young 1965 we start this development by analyzing an infinitesimal segment of a leg as shown in fig 7 in eq 4 the balance of the forces acting on the infinitesimal beam segment is written along x b and z b in the local undeformed coordinate system 4 d n cos v d t sin v p z b d z b 0 d t cos v d n sin v q z b d z b 0 where n is the axial load at the span station of interest v is the deflection normal to beam axis in the y b direction t is the shear component along the y axis at span station of interest p z b is the component of the external distributed static loading along the beam z b axis q z b is the component of the external distributed static loading along the beam y b axis d denotes the differential operator throughout this paper the prime symbols and denote first second and third order spatial derivatives relative to z b respectively assuming a constant cross section leg p z b and q z b can be written as in eq 5 5 p z b m e f f g sin θ l q z b m e f f g cos θ l where θ l is the angle between global x and leg and m e f f z b m e f f is the effective mass per unit length to account for hydrostatic buoyancy hydrodynamic and distributed inertial loads results obtained from ahse simulations demonstrated that considering m e f f g as uniform along the leg span is a valid approximation the distributed buoyancy is in fact the largest contribution from the hydrodynamic actions and the peak values of other loading components do not vary significantly along the span under these hypotheses and considering the boundary conditions at z b 0 m see also fig 17 eq 4 can be integrated to give expressions for n and t as shown in eq 6 6 n n e m e f f g sin θ l l l 0 2 z b cos v m e f f g cos θ l l l 0 2 z b sin v t n e m e f f g sin θ l l l 0 2 z b sin v m e f f g cos θ l l l 0 2 z b cos v note that the reaction at the joint a was divided into two contributions one aligned with the global z g and one n e aligned as a b it is straightforward to verify that the vertical component must be equal to half the effective weight of the beam no other force can act on joint a for equilibrium of the leg the balance of moments about the right end of the beam segment and along the local x b y g can be written as in eq 7 7 m n sin v t cos v 1 w n cos v t sin v v 0 where m is the bending moment about the local x b axis at the span station of interest making use of eq 6 eq 7 can rewrite as in eq 8 8 m m e f f g cos θ l l l 0 2 z b 1 w n e m e f f g sin θ l l l 0 2 z b v by integrating eq 8 between z b 0 m and the generic z b ˆ and making use of the boundary conditions at the hinge at z b 0 m one arrives at the expression for the bending moment about x b eq 52 by neglecting further shear contributions to the curvature of the beam axis denoting by e c the concrete young s modulus and by j x x c e f f 1 1 see section 5 for its definition the normalized concrete cross sectional second area moment of inertia the euler approximation m e c j x x c e f f v could be used this would result into a second order linear ordinary differential equation ode for the deflection v this ode however does not lend itself to an analytical solution hence two simplifications are performed on eq 8 the first simplification neglects the terms containing w in concrete it is common to assume a maximum compressive strain at uls ε c u 0 003 thus the term 1 w in eq 8 can be taken as 1 however even with this simplification the resulting ode has variable coefficients and does not have a readily useful analytical solution therefore a second simplification consists of replacing the term m e f f g sin θ l l l 0 2 z b that multiplies v with its mean value in 0 l l 0 which can be easily proven to be 0 eq 8 can now be analytically integrated with nil boundary conditions at a to return an expression for v as in eq 9 9 v z b m e f f g n e α 2 cos θ l cos α z b 1 cos α l l 0 sin α l l 0 sin α z b l l 0 z b 2 z b α 2 1 where α is taken as 10 α n e e c j x x c e f f note that for α l l 0 0 the expression in eq 9 goes to infinity i e we have the eulerian buckling condition timoshenko and gere 1963 of α l l 0 i c π i c 1 2 which would render the critical load n e c r 11 n e c r π 2 e c j x x c e f f l l 0 2 i c 2 4 2 nonlinear constitutive equation and derivation of the beam axial deflection to complete this extension of the beam theory we seek to find an expression for w z b that can be used to solve eq 3 by retaining up to second order terms in the taylor expansion of its definition the total strain ε can be expressed as the sum of the axial strain w and the shortening of the beam due to bending 1 2 v 2 see appendix d 1 and fig 7 the axial force n can therefore be expressed as in eq 12 introducing a nonlinearity in the beam constitutive equation 12 n e c a l e f f ε e c a l e f f 1 2 v 2 w where a l e f f 1 is the leg cross sectional area normalized for the presence of rebar see also section 5 starting from eq 6 and acknowledging the constitutive equation in eq 12 one can write a partial differential equation pde for w that includes terms in v accounting for small angle deflection approximation v 1 thus cos v 1 and sin v v and replacing v z b with the expression in eq 9 and by integrating w can be attained as in eq 13 13 w z b 1 e c a l e f f n e z b m e f f g sin θ l l l 0 z b z b 2 2 m e f f g cos θ l 2 e c a l e f f n e 1 α 2 l l 0 2 z b cos α z

final cable lengths i e l c 1 f l c 2 f can be expressed as a function of these three unknowns as it is shown below the sf assembly sequence starts with the central stem resting on a stand while the legs are being positioned at the correct elevation the cables are then connected at the a s and b s hinges and pre tensioning of the c1 and c2 cable sets occurs to reach a preset tensioning value e g σ c 1 p t σ c 2 p t as recorded by the tensioners once in the water with the system fully assembled the hinge at b would assume a new deflected position i e u b w b that also directly affects the loads in the cables first the cable tensions n c 1 and n c 2 can be thought as given by the superposition of the loads reached during the prestressing phase with prescribed stress values of σ c 1 p t

sls and uls of one of sf s rc legs is performed following the steps highlighted in this section here we focus solely on the structural design aspects and assume that the leg hydrodynamic requirements have already been addressed whereby specifying for example minimum leg length maximum leg mass and or buoyancy the latter demands would be verified by the external optimization loop of soft4s called soft generally speaking the structural verification consists of satisfying sls fatigue limit state fls accidental limit states als and uls design requirements in the case of sf boat impacts must be considered as concentrated loads at critical locations along the span of a leg and central stem other potential accidental load cases would require investigating the loss of a stay cable these aspects are certainly important and will require dedicated studies to assess the level of acceptable risk and redundancy required in this paper we concentrate on sls and uls which should also guarantee a certain level of safety against als and fls at least for the concrete leg a considerable amount of research is still ongoing on reinforced concrete fatigue but general rules based on damage equivalent load del and damage equivalent stress des fib 2013 ecs 2004 dnv gl 2016 can be employed with the internal load determination model as described in this paper furthermore simplified methods ecs 2004 check for an adequate fatigue life by using the maximum and minimum compressive stress under the most typical load combination therefore the methods described in this paper can be directly applied to assess the fatigue life of cables and leg we will address these aspects in a future article an additional verification should be performed on the system and component eigenfrequencies to ensure they lie within acceptable ranges for resonance avoidance the eigenfrequency check is outside the scope of this article but is an additional constraint that in parallel to the other structural checks must be satisfied by the design the eigenanalysis can be performed by calculating cross sectional inertial and stiffness properties and passing them to an ad hoc finite element analysis fea module young s and shear moduli to be used by the fea are the pure concrete ones and the effective density ρ c e f f is calculated as in eq 20 20 ρ c e f f ρ c a c ρ s a s t o t a g where ρ c is the concrete density a c is the pure concrete cross sectional surface area ρ s is the longitudinal reinforcement density a s t o t is the total nonprestressed reinforcement cross sectional area at the station of interest a g is the gross cross sectional area the main assumptions made in the leg dimensioning process described in this paper are 1 the leg cross section is assumed constant along the leg span this arrangement streamlines formwork and manufacturing as will be shown the middle span is the most stressed cross section hence tapering would have to be realized from the leg center toward the ends and the resulting mass advantage at this point is not deemed significant for the same reason the numbers and sizes of non prestressing reinforcement could theoretically change from section to section but this is beyond the scope of this study 2 the tensile strength of the concrete is assumed nil 3 the generic cross section is considered uncracked at sls but it is allowed to crack beyond that load level and at uls when the load reduces below the sls level the crack would close and the leg would retain the necessary integrity and dynamic properties of an uncracked structure under those assumptions and with reference to figs 3 and 8 the leg s geometry and structural properties are fully determined by outer and inner diameters d l d l the number and size of prestressing stay cables the number and size of nonprestressing reinforcement the number and size of shear reinforcement ties hoops or spirals material properties as shown for example in table 1 the structural verification process of a prestressed concrete psc leg design of given geometry and parameters as in table 1 starts with the identification of sls fls and uls loads the sls loads can be conservatively taken as those at quasi steady state with rated conditions and severe sea state e g design load case dlc 1 6 iec 2019 extreme sea states with faults e g dlc 6 2 iec 2019 extrapolated loads with return periods of once every 50 yr from dlc 1 1 or other emergency cases may give rise to the uls loads fls loads can be extracted from normal power production and parked idling cases e g dlc 1 2 and 6 4 iec 2019 these loads can be derived through dedicated ahse simulations the key steps for sls and uls verification are listed below 1 determine external loads via ahse and post processing of results 2 calculate cross section normalized area and second area moments of inertia 3 calculate eigenfrequencies and ensure they are within tolerances 4 sls verification a calculate internal loads solving eq 17 which also accounts for second order effects and moment amplification due to bending deflection in the vertical plane a conservative value of the resultant of the gravitational inertial and hydrodynamic distributed loads can be employed as mentioned in section 3 the lateral plane loads are not explicitly treated in this article but are verified in soft4s in a similar manner the resultant internal loads in this document are denoted by n axial load at the span station of interest negative if compressive m bending moment about the local x b axis at the span station of interest m z torque at the span station of interest and t shear component along the y axis at the span station of interest in fig 9 the local reference frame is shown with the typical leg cross section with the x axis aligned with the resultant bending moment m and therefore the y axis is normal to the neutral axis b ensure maximum cable prestress value below allowable e g σ c 1 p t σ c 2 p t a c 1 a c 2 0 7 f u c aci 2014 section 20 3 2 5 or per cable vendor recommendations f u c is the cable ultimate strength c ensure maximum acceptable leg tip deflection against an adequate threshold for example one that would guarantee a safe margin from the slack condition of c2 d ensure quantities of longitudinal and shear reinforcement are adequate to satisfy design standards e g aci 2014 e verify the stresses in the cross sections of interest against sls per section 5 1 1 additionally ensure longitudinal and shear reinforcement is adequate to satisfy spacing requirements by aci 2014 this verification will also lead to the sizing of cable pre tension cable cross sectional area concrete and if needed non prestressed reinforcement 5 uls verification a as for the sls calculate the internal loads for uls for simplicity the resultant loads are still denoted by the same symbols as for the sls load case n m m z and v b verify the strength of the cross sections of interest against uls per section 5 1 2 note that the soft4s code calculates all the geometric and inertial properties for a cross section defined as in fig 8 including the area first and second moments of inertia and centroids of the individual reinforcement groups and with respect to an axis of symmetry say the x axis or to a calculated chord location e g above the cross section neutral axis 5 1 verification of psc leg cross section and cable cross sections the assumed cross section of the psc leg and its main x y coordinate system with origin in the geometric center are depicted in fig 8 the meaning of the other symbols are given in table 1 and in the following sections 5 1 1 verification against sls limit states at sls the cross section is considered uncracked therefore with reference to fig 9 the neutral axis position must satisfy the condition 21 y n d l 2 where y n is the neutral axis distance from the cross section s centroid here the goal is to find the number and size of cables and the associated prestress levels necessary to guarantee minimum deflection and uncracked conditions of the leg the optimal design condition is to have the bottom fiber in fig 9 at 0 strain when the sls load set is applied the strain in the concrete ε c y can be expressed as shown in eq 22 22 ε c y y n y ε c m i n h n where h n is the neutral axis distance from the cross section extreme compressed fiber and ε c m i n is the ε c m i n if we ignore the nonlinearity between stress and strain as commonly done in sls verifications and leverage the uncracked condition and symmetry of the cross section then the normalized cross sectional area and second area moment i e a c e f f and j x x c e f f gilbert and mickleborough 2004 macgregor 2011 can be used to calculate the normal compressive stresses in the concrete σ c z as in eq 23 23 σ c z γ f s l s n a c e f f m j x x c e f f y where γ f s l s is the load partial safety factor for sls for the generic rebar located at y s assuming perfect bonding of rebar and concrete one could attain the compressive stress as in eq 24 24 σ s z y s σ c z y s n r c where nrc is the ratio of rebar steel to concrete young s moduli once the stresses and strains are known the criteria indicated in appendix e must be met per aci 2014 5 1 2 verification against uls limit states at uls the cross section is assumed to have reached the maximum compressive strain in the concrete and possibly cracked in the tension zone the verification consists of ensuring that the ultimate strength of the cross section is adequate for the ultimate loading conditions in the case of the leg a slender member subject to axial and flexure loading stability is obviously a possible failure the model developed in sections 3 4 implicitly included second order effects however hence here it will be sufficient to concentrate on the cross section uls design as would be done for a short member aci 2014 requires 25 φ a c i p n n u 26 φ a c i m n m u 27 φ a c i v n t u 28 φ a c i t q n m z u where p

resistance at the station of interest and factored bending moment at the station of interest respectively v n t u are the nominal shear strength and factored shear load at the station of interest respectively and t q n m z u are the nominal torsional strength and factored torsion load at the station of interest respectively first the axial and bending moment loads should be assessed against the design interaction curve then other code check criteria can be verified in fig 10 a the assumed concrete strain distribution with a maximum compressive strain value equal to ε c u and a stress

at nominal axial strength of the cross section to complete the verification against uls the criteria listed in appendix f must be met 6 case study and model cross verification in this section we show the results of a preliminary design iteration for the sf leg and cable assembly based on expected overall footprint mass and required buoyancy to support a 10 mw turbine and a generic 70mpa strength concrete as the sf is covered by sensitive intellectual property ip we present normalized loads and geometry quantities from soft4s s results two loading scenarios were considered the first is representative of the load transfer at post tensioning during the assembly phase on land and the second represents the quasi steady state situation under operational conditions at sea typical values for effective buoyancy value and the horizontal component of the force exerted by the can and mooring line onto the leg during operation were derived through dedicated fully coupled ahse simulations on dry land the only external loads considered are due to gravitational effects both distributed along the leg span and concentrated at the joints the method described in section 3 was used to arrive at the internal loads for cables and legs first a sensitivity analysis of cable cross section is given in fig 11 a in this graph the upper cable diameter is shown as a function of the lower cable counterpart under the assumption that no vertical deflection w is permitted at post tensioning transfer and with cable pre tensioning loads equal to p 0 c 1 σ c 1 p t a c 1 and p 0 c 2 σ c 2 p t a c 2 for lower and upper cable respectively in fig 11a the diameters are normalized by the minimum value considered for c1 the upper cable is considerably less loaded than the lower cable due to the geometry and the difference between the angles θ c 1 and θ c 2 and this also translates in a relatively insensitive variation of the c2 diameter with respect to the size of c1 note in fact that increasing a c 1 for a given pre tensioning stress is equivalent to increasing both the leg axial load as well as the tension in the upper cable which then requires a larger cross section for the imposed strength constraints the increase in upper over lower cable diameter however is proportional to a 1 2 ratio this contributes to keeping the elevation of the substructure center of mass relatively low with obvious advantages on stability but at the price of higher load demand on the lower cable and leg alternatively the leg to stem joint could be designed at a higher elevation than that leg to can joint this optimization is outside the scope of this study however fig 11b shows that the component of the leg axial load aligned with a b n e increases more than the individual cable tensions as the cable size increases to fix a set of cable dimensions more analyses on the dynamic characteristics of the system should be performed for example to guarantee avoidance of modal frequencies that can lead to dangerous resonance here for sake of brevity we determined the size of the cables based on an acceptable mean leg tip deflection of 0 2 m at rated conditions and with normal sea state significant wave height of 1 13 m 7 22s peak spectral period in fig 12 a the leg tip deflections and the loads in the leg and cables are shown as functions of the normalized can buoyancy to note is a sharp variation in the deflection occurring when the external actions exceed a value of approximately 1 35 the mean buoyancy in that situation in fact the upper cable becomes slack fig 12b and the overall system may fail although not necessarily representing a chosen layout the present case study is an example of how the design method can be used to assess safety margins with respect to stability conditions for the entire system changes in the design for example by selecting a cable layout with higher pre tension or further limiting the leg tip deflection under operational conditions could guarantee a larger margin of safety with respect to cable slackness turning now to the design of the leg cross section fig 13 shows the leg s normal loads and the translational and rotational deflections along the span for the two load cases considered herein as seen from the graphs soft4s s nonlinear elastic beam method can account for bending brought forth by second order effects and the variation of the normal load as a function of span due to the transverse deflection at post tensioning transfer the leg maximum deflection occurs at mid span and it is approximately double the mean deflection calculated at operation at sea the component of the distributed weight along the leg axis is non nil due to the inclination of the leg and therefore the largest axial load is registered at the joint with the central stem soft4s calculated internal shear and bending moments are presented in fig 14 the largest shear values are found at the leg ends whereas the maximum bending moments occur at mid span for both loading scenarios the at sea case renders about half the internal load magnitudes than those at post tensioning transfer again this emphasizes how the assembly and the post tensioning of the sf are critical aspects of both the structural analysis and of the actual construction phases the cross section verification against sls and uls was conducted by conservatively assuming that the maximum shear acts together with the maximum bending moment and normal load at the mid span station the arrangement of the reinforcement is as in fig 9 for the mid span location a uls interaction diagram was compiled and the results are shown in fig 15 the curves represent the capacity baseline and factored per aci 2014 of the optimized minimum mass cross section and the markers denote the two loading conditions analyzed in this example the post tensioning load transfer scenario is the design driving case and the associated factored loads are just within the acceptable safe boundaries leading to a well balanced design the remainder safety margin 5 will account for additional effects unknown at preliminary design the component mass was calculated at some 27 t for the cables and 270 t for the leg including reinforcement with preliminary estimates on buoyancy can and stem masses we project the total structural mass of the sf at approximately 2000 t although this is a preliminary outcome it shows how the sf departs from heavier conventional designs e g ppi s steel windfloat at approximately 2400 tonne for an 8 mw turbine

mechanical apdl release 2019 r2 a commercial fea package to prove the validity of the newly devised analytical model the leg was assumed as made out of an equivalent isotropic material with young s modulus equal to e c and a concrete effective density as discussed above further modified for distributed buoyancy effects the beam was simulated with a set of beam188 elements more than one to better capture the deformed shape whereas the cables were discretized with a series of link180 subjected to a pretension proportional to their cross sectional areas data extracted from ansys runs fig s 12 14 fig 16 exhibited excellent agreement with the results from soft4s in terms of both internal loads and deflections in fig 16 we report ansys plots of the calculated nodal displacement w the normalized axial force in cables and legs and the bending moment in the leg for the studied operational case for completeness an eigenfrequency analysis was performed to assess the first few structural modes the first mode 1 94 hz is in the lateral plane whereas the first mode in the vertical plane showed a frequency of 3 68 hz see fig 16d the shape functions in ansys s beam element do not readily capture the second order effect that our new method includes and the fea had to be carried out in a fully nonlinear fashion to achieve results whereas ansys requires only a few seconds to solve the analysis versus soft4s s less than 1 s on a modern intel 7 cpu it also requires lengthier set up and post processing activities and does not lend itself to an expedited integration with gradient based optimization soft4s on the other hand facilitates the design of experiments and allows for a full exploration of the sensitivity to design variables and constraint parameters more importantly soft4s s analytical nature promotes a thorough understanding of the physics involved and guides the designers toward a more efficient optimization reducing risk to the project 7 conclusions and future work the floating substructure and mooring components comprise about one third of the capital expenditure capex of a typical floating offshore wind power plant and are responsible for 20 of the lcoe stehly and beiter 2019 reducing the cost of the floating platform can therefore greatly influence the final commercial viability of floating offshore wind the sf was conceived to reduce these costs via a modularized slender structure an efficient load path an effective use of materials leveraging the established concrete supply chain and an industrialized approach to manufacturing the structural design of the sf must both guarantee component reliability as well as floater stability in this paper we developed a new analytical model to size both the leg and the stay cables key components of the sf the employed nonlinear second order method is capable of accounting for beam shortening due to bending and second order bending due to compression as such this method inherently includes design and analyses against buckling instability the method is implemented in soft soft4s a tool for the optimization of the sf that includes hydrodynamic requirements ccd inputs and a cost model together with this new analytical beam theory the steps necessary for the qualification and verification of the rc leg cross section were presented primarily following aci 2014 the sls and uls verifications were the focus of this study although fls will be analyzed following fib 2013 and ecs 2004 once a complete load spectrum is captured by appropriate ahse simulations that are being carried out within the atlantis usflowt project the newly devised method will serve as the main design and analysis tool to extract dels and dess the majority of the leg loading originates from the cable tensions concentrated buoyancy thrust at the joint with the can and distributed buoyancy along the leg span transverse hydrodynamic loading and other components in the vertical plane e g viscous drag or inertial actions are orders of magnitude smaller as based on the preliminary results of ahse simulations additionally the listing angle of the sf is limited to 10 for these reasons and for added clarity the analysis was limited to the vertical plane statics without losing in generality with an obvious extension to the transverse statics a case study was provided to prove the capability of soft4s s structural model two loading situations were analyzed the load transfer at post tensioning and the at sea operational quasi steady state loading scenario first the results of the model helped select the cable size for a prescribed mean leg tip deflection then the returned internal loads were used to size the leg cross section and its reinforcement the data demonstrate that soft4s is capable of optimizing the cross section of the leg and cables given the constraints discussed in section 5 1 while also guaranteeing hydrostatic stability of the floater and other hydrodynamic performance parameters that will be discussed in a separate paper the model is computationally efficient and sensitivity analyses for assessing trade offs between structural mass and control demand to safeguard floater stability and performance can be performed with negligible impact on the design process timeline a cross verification against the commercial package ansys showed excellent agreement in the results of the static load and deformation analysis it is important to note that element shape functions in commercial fem software typically miss the second order effects that soft4s s beam model encompasses and require multiple nonlinear runs to reach the same results the model is now being extended to the central stem of the sf and with some modifications to the buoyancy cans additionally we are planning to include a modal analysis capability that will help identify viable designs against frequency acceptance bands when complete soft4s will then render mass or cost

interest p z b is the component of the external distributed static loading along the beam z b axis q z b is the component of the external distributed static loading along the beam y b axis d denotes the differential operator the prime symbols and denote first second and third order spatial derivatives relative to z b respectively by adopting the definitions in eq 44 one obtains eq 4 44 n d n n z

vertical component must be equal to 1 2 the effective weight of the beam no other force can act on joint a for equilibrium of the leg thus one arrives at eq 46 46 n 0 cos v 0 t 0 sin v 0 n e m e f f g

be derived for the deflection v this ode does not lend itself to an analytical solution and in what follows we will perform some simplifications the first simplification neglects the terms containing

and the conditions translates into having v l l 0 0 note that in general we cannot a priori set this boundary conditions for a non rigid beam eq 53 is an ode of the second order with variable coefficients which does not have a readily useful analytical solution the second simplification we carry out in the differential form of eq 8 is to replace the term m e f f g sin θ l l l 0 2 z b that multiplies v with its mean value in 0 l l 0 which can be easily proven to be 0 with this final approximation we obtain 55 e c j x x c e f f v n e v z b m e f f g cos θ l l l 0 2 z b 0 the solution to

20828,the flexible pipe industry has been confronted with the potential threat of armour wires lateral buckling for over two decades cyclic bending is recognized to play a significant role in the lateral buckling mechanism since it facilitates the armour wire sliding against the frictional resistance if a flexible pipe is exposed to axial compression larger than the critical load for a certain period the risk of lateral buckling may be controlled by limiting the number of bending cycles thus the estimation of the bending cycles number to initiate buckling is favorable to prevent buckling failure and enlarge the potential application scope of flexible pipes the present paper presents an analytical model for an approximate estimation of the number of bending cycles required to initiate the lateral buckling in wet annulus conditions the analytical results are compared with the available test data in the literature and relatively good correlations are observed on the cycle numbers to buckle based on this analytical model parameter studies are performed and the effects of axial compression bending curvatures and friction coefficient on the number of bending cycles to initiate buckling as well as the stress states at the onset of buckling are discussed keywords flexible pipes tensile armour wires lateral buckling bending cycles number 1 introduction flexible pipes are critical elements in offshore oil and gas field development they often serve as risers flowlines or jumpers for the transportation of the produced hydrocarbons injection fluids and gas lift between the drilling and production facilities and the subsea installations the main characteristic of a flexible pipe is its relatively low bending to longitudinal stiffness which makes it ideal for use with floating facilities flexible pipes encompass a layered structure with various materials as illustrated in fig 1 each layer plays specific functions like withstanding the internal and external pressures coping with the axial loads preventing leaks of inner fluids reducing the friction between metallic layers protecting against seawater ingress etc a flexible pipe may lose its integrity due to many failure mechanisms one of those failure mechanisms that has attracted considerable attention is the armour wires lateral buckling as shown in fig 1 the armour wires layers are helical structures made by steel wires with a quasi rectangular cross section which are the principal layers to withstand the axial load in most application scenarios two armour wires layers are manufactured with opposite directions during flexible pipe installation or operation a flexible pipe may be exposed to large axial compression due to the reversed end cap effect brack et al 2005 or extreme weather conditions driven by this axial compressive load the armour wires are prone to deflect in either radial or lateral directions thus high strength tapes are usually applied over the armour wires to resist their radial expansion in axial compression sousa et al 2012 rabelo et al 2015 sævik and thorsen 2017 li et al 2019c aiming at investigating the birdcaging mechanism lu et al 2017 studied the instability of four steel wires symmetrically and helically wound over a cylinder subjected to axial compression through a novel experimental approach interesting conclusions were reached regarding the effects of wire helical winding geometries on the buckling behavior moreover based on the analytical model for the birdcaging limit estimation developed by sævik and thorsen 2017 wu et al 2018 proposed a criterion for torsion induced birdcaging formation regardless of the anti birdcage tape layer if the armour wires radial expansions are strongly restricted they may be vulnerable to buckle in the lateral direction for a flexible pipe subjected to pure axial compression the lateral buckling is not easy to be instigated since the armour wires sliding is strongly restrained by the frictional force at the interfaces between the armour wires and the neighboring layers thus cyclic bending is broadly necessary for the triggering of lateral buckling as it facilitates the armour wire sliding against the frictional resistance during cyclic bending energy dissipation is expected due to the friction and relative sliding between those helical components such a cyclic bending condition is usually encountered at the touchdown zone of a flexible pipe the lateral buckling is usually observed when the pipe annulus is flooded as it significantly reduces the frictional resistance moreover as the inner armour wires sustain less frictional resistance than the outer armour wires the lateral buckling always initiates by the failure of the inner armour wires layer fig 2 shows the configurations of inner and outer tensile armour wires during the dissection of a flexible pipe that failed due to the lateral buckling while the outer tensile armour wires were still intact the inner tensile armour wires endured severe lateral deflections li et al 2019a presented an analytical estimation for the critical axial compression that may cause the lateral buckling after numerous bending cycles where the critical load only depends on the armour wires geometrical and material properties it was demonstrated that no lateral buckling would be generated in cyclic bending if the applied axial compression is below this critical load thus for safety s sake it is recommended to ensure that the maximum axial compression that may be encountered in the service life of a flexible pipe should be inferior to the critical load nevertheless even if the applied axial compression is larger than the critical load the flexible pipe would only fail after a number of bending cycles thus by limiting the bending cycles number in the critical axial loading condition the lateral buckling failure still could be precluded for instance consider the installation of a flexible pipe with empty bore at a water depth in which the reversed end cap axial compression is slightly larger than the lateral buckling limit if the installation can be completed quickly so that only limited bending cycles are experienced the armour wires deformations may still be small and in the elastic region when the pipe bore is filled with fluids after the installation the flexible pipe would be mostly tensioned which tends to draw the armour wires back to the helical configurations similarly this also applies to the shutdown period where large axial compression may be generated thus the estimation of the bending cycles number to initiate the lateral buckling under certain loading conditions is favorable to inhibit the lateral buckling failure and enlarge the potential application scope of flexible pipes additionally the prediction of the bending cycles number also helps in the planning of tests to simulate flexible pipe armour wires lateral buckling the present study is then focused on the estimation of the bending cycles number to initiate the lateral buckling to date many tests have been performed on flexible pipe armour wires lateral buckling either offshore or in laboratories the tests performed in the offshore field are well known as dip tests deep immersion performance tests where flexible pipes are evaluated in conditions similar to what they may experience during installation bectarte and coutarel 2004 however it is difficult to control and measure the loading in the touchdown zone in contrast it is easier to control the axial compression bending curvatures as well as the number of cycles in lab tests through mechanical rigs or hyperbaric chamber which is beneficial to improve the understanding of the buckling mechanism braga 2003 secher et al 2011 østergaard 2012 amarante et al 2018 li et al 2019a however each test is only performed for a particular pipe under a specific condition and high expenses limit the number of tests available in the literature therefore to further reveal the underlying buckling mechanism numerical and analytical tools are in great demand several finite element models have been developed to investigate the armour wire lateral buckling for straight pipe condition where each armour wires layer is only represented by a single armour wire brack et al 2005 vaz and rizzo 2011 nygård 2012 li 2014 yang et al 2015 moreover still concerning the axisymmetric loading context finite element studies were also presented by malta and martins 2014 2017 2019 tang et al 2019 and liu et al 2019 where full armour wires layers were modeled in those studies the effects of the torsional resistance on the armour wire radial resistance from the anti birdcage tape and external hydrostatic pressure friction coefficient elastic slip as well as the initial imperfection in the armour wire configuration were extensively discussed however since cyclic bending was not considered in those finite element studies it is difficult to cause the lateral buckling applying a normal friction coefficient 0 1 0 2 unless very large axial compression is applied moreover sertã et al 2012 developed a finite element model containing all those armour wires which is applicable to simulate a flexible pipe in axial compression associated with cyclic bending however no detailed results were presented besides assuming the armour wires within the same layer deform identically in cyclic bending with uniform curvature caleyron et al 2014 2017 proposed a simplified numerical approach invoking periodic boundary condition which allows to model the full armour wires layer with a single wire thus considerably reducing the computational costs through this approach the armour wires lateral buckling in combined axial compression and cyclic bending was simulated considering the lateral contact between neighboring armour wires thereafter a finite element model was developed by lukassen 2019 applying a similar methodology and additional interesting results on lateral buckling were presented more recently yang et al 2020 studied the lateral buckling mechanism through a 3d numerical model of four tensile armour wires with a symmetrical arrangement over a cylindrical foundation the effect of friction coefficient on the buckling limit was discussed and suggestions on a flexible pipe design against the lateral buckling failure were presented besides by establishing a differential equation system for a space curved beam and solving it as a boundary value problem østergaard et al 2011 studied a single armour wire lateral buckling subjected to axial compression and cyclic bending considering the frictional resistance it was claimed that the lateral buckling limit including the frictional effect was slightly larger than that determined regardless of the friction moreover zhou et al 2015 investigated the armour wires lateral buckling through a finite element approach where each armour wires layer was represented by four armour wires around 122 bending cycles were applied within 2450 s and the pipe was defined failed if the yield strength of the armour wire material was reached the numerical results demonstrated some conservatism comparing with the test data presented by østergaard 2012 besides gonzalez et al 2019 developed a finite element model for lateral buckling study where the pipe bending was addressed by assuming the armour wire pre buckling configurations as prescribed by geodesic or loxodromic curves more recently an asymmetric non linear finite element model was developed by li and vaz 2020a b to investigate the circular armour wire lateral buckling in umbilicals in their studies the circular armour wire sliding and buckling in cyclic bending were investigated and a good correlation with the analytical estimation of lateral buckling limit proposed by li and vaz 2019 was observed in small cyclic curvatures the effects of friction coefficient elastic slip bending curvatures and axial compression on the number of bending cycles to buckle as well as the stress state at the onset of buckling were discussed besides the numerical studies several analytical models on armour wire lateral buckling are available in the literature custódio 2005 proposed an analytical model to assess the armour wire buckling limit under axisymmetric loading through the application of perturbation methods by establishing an eigenvalue problem tan et al 2006 developed an analytical model for the simulations of the armor wires buckling and post buckling behavior based on a total strain energy approach however no details were presented paiva and vaz 2017 proposed an empirical model using symbolic regression for the prediction of armour wires lateral buckling limit on a frictionless cylindrical surface based on a predefined harmonic deflection assumption sævik and ji 2014 proposed an analytical model for the prediction of armour wire lateral buckling limit on a straight frictionless cylindrical surface the results lie on the conservative side comparing with the test data presented by østergaard 2012 more recently by establishing a differential equation system based on space curved beam theory and solving it analytically through a perturbation technique a series of analytical studies were presented by li et al 2018 2019b a on the armour wire lateral buckling mechanism indicating that the armour wires are susceptible to buckle in a periodic mode rather than a global mode considering the effect of friction and cyclic bending the analytical estimation of the buckling limit demonstrates good agreements with all the test data available in the literature based on a similar theoretical approach an analytical model for the circular armour wire lateral buckling in umbilicals was also developed by li and vaz 2019 considering the armour wire axial rotation in the present work an analytical model is developed for an approximate estimation of the number of bending cycles required to initiate the armour wire lateral buckling in the wet annulus condition applying the elastic and plastic bucking criteria a comparison with the available test data is presented this is followed by parameter studies discussing the effects of axial compression friction coefficient and bending curvatures on the number of bending cycles to initiate buckling as well as the stress state at the onset of buckling 2 analytical model the present analytical model for the estimation of the number of bending cycles to initiate lateral buckling is based on the analytical model developed in li et al 2019a upon the introduction of additional assumptions to avoid repetition only the fundamental information from the previous study is retained and presented 2 1 armour wire sliding rate in bending cycles the armour wire is modeled as a space curved beam with a rectangular cross section within the wall of a toroidal surface the width and thickness of the armour wire cross section are denoted respectively by w and h the armour wire lay angle in the initial straight pipe condition with respect to the generatrix is denoted by ϕ the minor and major radii of the toroid are denoted respectively by r and r 1 κ as illustrated in fig 3 the triad of unit vectors t n b attached to the armour wire represents its tangent normal and bi normal directions respectively the toroidal surface is parameterized by the longitudinal coordinate u and angular coordinate θ the armour wire path on this toroidal surface can be determined by specifying a relationship between u and θ denote the armour wire displacement in the longitudinal direction relative to the underlying toroid surface by δ u θ and define a corresponding nondimensional parameter δ u θ δ u θ r based on space curved beam theory timoshenko and gere 1961 a differential equation system for the armour wire is established and linearized through the application of a perturbation technique applying the classical isotropic coulomb friction model the sliding rate of the inner armour wire in the longitudinal direction in the wet annulus condition subjected to compression and bending is approximately evaluated by li et al 2019a as 1 d δ u θ d κ r cos 3 ϕ sin ϕ sin θ r sin ϕ sin θ μ η e i n χ p t r 2 sin 2 2 ϕ 4 d 4 δ u d θ 4 1 p 1 χ p t cos 2 ϕ d 2 δ u d θ 2 κ r 1 p 2 χ p t 1 sin 2 ϕ cot 3 ϕ sin θ where μ is the friction coefficient κ is the bending curvature whose positive direction is defined as shown in fig 3 χ is a nondimensional parameter given by eq 2 and η is a sign of plus or minus depending on the circumferential position and bending direction as shown in table 1 2 χ θ e η μ sin ϕ θ 0 5 π 0 θ π e η μ sin ϕ θ 1 5 π π θ 2 π besides p t is the cross sectional force in the armour wire axial direction in the straight pipe condition which can be approximately evaluated by 3 p t p e n d n i n n e x cos ϕ where p e n d is the axial load carried by the flexible pipe n i n and n e x are respectively the numbers of armour wires in the inner and outer armour wires layers in the present context compressive loads are taken as negative values moreover p 1 and p 2 are two constants corresponding to the armour wire characteristics given by 4 p 1 sin 2 ϕ r 2 e i n cos 2 ϕ 4 e i b cos 2 ϕ g j cos 2 ϕ 5 p 2 sin 2 ϕ r 2 e i n 1 cos 2 ϕ e i b 2 cos 2 ϕ cos 2 ϕ 1 sin 2 ϕ g j sin 2 2 ϕ 2 2 sin 2 ϕ in which e is the young s modulus i n and i b are the cross sectional inertias in the normal and bi normal directions respectively and j is the torsional stiffness which can be evaluated by timoshenko and goodier 1951 6 j w h 3 1 3 64 π 5 h w the analytical formulation for armour wire sliding rate in bending was obtained based on the following assumptions the ratio of the minor to major toroid radii is a small term the armour wire radial expansion in axial compression is ignored the flexible pipe axial rotation is negligible before the initiation of armour wire lateral buckling the armour wire is assumed pinned on the toroidal surface at the intrados and extrados due to the geometrical symmetry the neighboring armour wires within the same armour wire layer are not in contact when the lateral buckling is initiated the armour wire sliding rate in the transverse direction is much smaller than that in the tangential direction the entire armour wire slides in bending and the frictional force is equal to the full dynamic frictional force note that the analytical model for the sliding rate was developed to describe the final equilibrium state of an armour wire after numerous bending cycles while those assumptions may be acceptable in this condition they may be somewhat strong to describe the armour wire sliding during each bending cycle towards the final state for instance assuming that the transverse sliding is much smaller than the tangential sliding is expected to underestimate the sliding rate in the transverse direction on the other hand ignoring the stick slip phenomenon is expected to overestimate the sliding rate moreover for a flexible pipe with lateral buckling failure axial shortening and twist will be generated consequently the coupling effect from the other layers may retard or facilitate the buckling process especially in the post buckling stage therefore due to the complex frictional mechanism and geometric nonlinearity it is extremely difficult to precisely describe the armour wire sliding and buckling process in cyclic bending through an analytical approach 2 2 armour wire path progression in cyclic bending despite the complexity of the armour wire sliding and buckling mechanism there are still opportunities to develop an analytical tool to approximately estimate the number of bending cycles that may initiate the lateral buckling upon the introduction of strong assumptions according to the studies of zhou and vaz 2017 and li and vaz 2020a the armour wire develops into a quasi sinusoidal deflection shape very quickly after a few bending cycles based on this observation it is enforced that the armour wire deflection shape in cyclic bending is sinusoidal accordingly the armour wire nondimensional sliding in the longitudinal direction is herein assumed as 7 δ u θ δ u sin θ where δ u corresponds to the armour wire nondimensional sliding in the longitudinal direction at the neutral plane θ π 2 which is approximately evaluated by substituting θ π 2 into eq 1 consequently the following relationship can be obtained 8a d 2 δ u d θ 2 π 2 δ u 8b d 4 δ u d θ 4 π 2 δ u this assumption may be moderately strong but significantly simplifies the problem and renders the analytical study feasible due to symmetry only half pitch of the armour wire 0 θ π is discussed in the present context substituting eqs 8a 8b and θ π 2 into eq 1 the inner armour wire sliding rate at the neutral plane can be approximately given by 9 d δ u d κ κ δ u r cos 3 ϕ sin ϕ κ r 2 η μ 1 p 2 p t 1 sin 2 ϕ sin ϕ cot 3 ϕ δ u r η μ 1 p 3 p t sin ϕ cos 2 ϕ in which p 3 is a constant corresponding to the armour wire characteristics given by 10 p 3 sin 2 ϕ r 2 e i n 1 cos 2 ϕ 4 e i b cos 2 ϕ g j cos 2 ϕ it can be seen that the sliding rate depends not only on the bending curvature but also on the current armour wire position considering the armour wire deflection progression is usually very slow in cyclic bending the sliding rate during each bending cycle is approximately evaluated by using the armour wire position at the beginning of this bending cycle thus denoting the armour wire nondimensional longitudinal sliding at the neutral plane after n th bending cycle by δ u n the recursive formula for the series of δ u n can be described by 11 δ u n δ u n 1 κ min κ max d δ u d κ δ u n 1 d κ κ max κ min d δ u d κ δ u n 1 d κ where κ m i n and κ m a x are respectively the minimum and maximum bending curvatures in cyclic bending those two terms on the right side of the equation represent respectively the armour wire nondimensional sliding during the n th bending cycle when the bending curvature increases from κ m i n to κ m a x and decreases from κ m a x to κ m i n this analytical model is applicable to cyclic bending curvatures in the same or opposite directions note that at the touchdown zone of a flexible pipe the minimum and maximum bending curvatures are usually in the same direction subsequently substituting eq 9 into 11 yields 12 δ u n 1 λ δ u n 1 β where 13 λ κ max κ min 2 r μ 1 p 3 p t sin ϕ cos 2 ϕ 14 β κ max 2 κ min 2 r 2 μ 1 p 2 p t 1 sin 2 ϕ cos 3 ϕ sin 2 ϕ assuming that there is no initial imperfection i e δ u 0 at the beginning of cyclic loading the armour wire nondimensional sliding in the longitudinal direction at the neutral plane after each bending cycle can be obtained from eq 12 as 15 δ u 1 β δ u 2 β 1 1 λ δ u 3 β 1 1 λ 1 λ 2 δ u n β 1 1 λ 1 λ n 1 consequently the general term formula of this series can be easily obtained as 16 δ u n β 1 λ n 1 λ substituting eq 16 into 7 the armour wire path after the n th bending cycle can be evaluated by 17 δ u n θ β 1 λ n 1 λ sin θ in which β represents the armour wire nondimensional sliding at the neutral plane after the first bending cycle and λ corresponds to the displacement growing rate according to eq 14 when p t p 2 is bigger or smaller than 1 β is positive or negative which indicates that the armour wire slides towards the extrados or intrados when p t p 2 1 β is zero which demonstrates that the armour wire tends to remain in the initial helical path in cyclic bending under this circumstance besides fig 4 shows δ u n θ β in terms of the number of bending cycles with different values of λ using eq 16 it can be seen that when λ 0 i e p t p 3 1 the armour wire deflection grows constantly after each bending cycle which will eventually cause the lateral buckling the bigger the λ is the faster the armour wire slides in cyclic bending on the other hand when 1 λ 0 i e 0 p t p 3 1 1 λ n tends to be zero after infinite bending cycles n and this sequence will converge to the following path 18 δ u θ κ min κ max r 1 sin 2 ϕ cos ϕ 2 sin 3 ϕ p t p 2 p t p 3 sin θ which is consistent with the equilibrium path presented by li et al 2019a as shown in fig 4 the smaller the λ is the faster the armour wire reaches the equilibrium path in cyclic bending when λ approaches zero eq 16 can be approximately simplified as δ u n n β which is illustrated by the dashed line in fig 4 this implies that the armour wire sliding rate is nearly constant in terms of the bending cycles number when the applied axial compression p t is close to p 3 it needs to be emphasized that the equilibrium path described by eq 18 only has physical meaning if the two buckling criteria presented in the following section are not satisfied 2 3 lateral buckling criteria the armour wire lateral buckling may take place when the armour wire reaches the yield limit or when the frictional force is not capable of holding the armour wire equilibrium state therefore two buckling criteria are proposed in this study 2 3 1 plastic buckling criterion the four corners in the armour wire cross section shown in fig 5 are the most critical to reach the material yield stress depending on bending directions the maximum compressive stress in each armour wire cross section will be observed at one of those corners which can be approximately evaluated by 19 σ θ p t θ a w m n θ 2 i n h m b θ 2 i b where a is the armour wire cross sectional area m n θ and m b θ are the armour wire cross sectional moments in the normal and bi normal directions respectively which can be evaluated by 20 m n θ e i n κ 1 sin 2 ϕ cos ϕ sin θ sin 3 ϕ r 2 d 2 δ u d θ 2 21 m b θ e i b κ 2 sin 2 ϕ 1 cos 2 ϕ cos θ 2 sin 3 ϕ cos ϕ r 2 d δ u d θ substituting eq 17 into 20 and 21 the cross sectional moments during each bending cycle can be approximately evaluated by 22 m n θ e i n κ 1 sin 2 ϕ cos ϕ sin 3 ϕ r 2 δ u n sin θ 23 m b θ e i b κ 2 sin 2 ϕ 1 cos 2 ϕ 2 sin 3 ϕ cos ϕ r 2 δ u n cos θ considering that it is more critical when the pipe is bent to the maximum curvature applying κ κ m a x and substituting eqs 22 and 23 into 19 the maximum compressive stress can be found by searching the maximum value of σ θ in the range 0 θ π herein the maximum compressive stress in the armour wire during the n th bending cycle is denoted by σ m a x n considering that the shear stress in the armour wire is small when the maximum compressive stress reaches the yielding limit the armour wire is expected to soften to a level that accelerates its sliding and deflection in the subsequent bending cycles thus the plastic buckling initiation criterion is described by 24 c p σ max n σ s 1 where σ s is the yield stress note that the armour wire may not fail immediately when only a small portion reaches the plastic stage after the lateral buckling initiation the armour wire can still withstand some additional bending cycles until it completely fails 2 3 2 elastic buckling criteria as the armour wire continually slides in the transverse direction in cyclic bending the required frictional force to hold the equilibrium state also increases if the armour wire transverse deflection is too large the frictional force may not be sufficient to hold the equilibrium state which may also result in the lateral buckling the required frictional force in the bi normal direction to keep the armour wire equilibrium state can be evaluated by 25 p b θ e i n sin 5 ϕ r 3 d 4 δ u d θ 4 p t p 1 sin 3 ϕ r d 2 δ u d θ 2 κ p t p 2 1 sin 2 ϕ cos ϕ sin θ substituting eq 17 into 25 the required frictional force in the bi normal direction during the n th bending cycle can be obtained as 26 p b θ p t p 3 sin 3 ϕ r δ u n κ p t p 2 1 sin 2 ϕ cos ϕ sin θ assuming a sinusoidal deflection shape the maximum transverse frictional force is located at the neutral plane θ π 2 when the bending curvature reaches the maximum value ignoring the fabrication pressure the maximum frictional force per unit arc length generated by axial compression on the inner armour wire at the neutral plane can be evaluated by 27 f μ p t sin 2 ϕ r when the required transverse frictional force at the neutral plane surpasses the maximum frictional force at this location the armour wire is not able to hold this sinusoidal shape anymore so that the lateral buckling may be initiated after this moment thus the elastic buckling initiation criterion is described by 28 c e p b θ π 2 κ κ max μ p t sin 2 ϕ r 1 again note that the armour wire may not buckle immediately when only a small arc length near the neutral plane overcomes the frictional resistance the armour wire may continually withstand some additional bending cycles until it completely fails eqs 19 20 21 25 and 27 are derived in li et al 2019a 3 comparison with test data a series of experimental tests on flexible pipe armour wire lateral buckling were performed by østergaard 2012 using mechanical rigs applying axial compression associated with cyclic bending in the vertical plane the test loading conditions and results including pipe end shortenings and twists in terms of bending cycles were well described constituting good reference for comparison with the present analytical model three flexible pipes were tested and the armour wires geometrical and material characteristics are presented in table 2 table 3 shows the loading conditions and test results where the bending radius constitutes the minimum radius in cyclic bending in all those tests cyclic bending was imposed between straight and maximum bending pipe configurations since the samples were tensioned with a 50 kn load and bent between 10 to 20 times before the test to draw the armour wires towards the initial helical configuration the initial imperfections may be neglected which corresponds to the assumption of the analytical model applying the data presented in tables 2 and 3 the analytical results for each test are shown in table 4 where e and p within parentheses represent the elastic and plastic buckling status respectively note that the bending curvature is not uniform in the tests of 14 jumper sample i the non dimensional parameter κ m a x r in table 4 for this sample is calculated using the average curvature p t p 2 and p 3 are obtained from eqs 3 5 and 10 respectively the friction coefficient is considered between 0 10 and 0 15 in accordance with østergaard et al 2011 and sævik and ji 2014 the bending cycles to initiate buckling as well as the buckling triggering mechanism are estimated by comparing the two buckling criteria which will be discussed in detail below 3 1 trial test firstly a trial test was performed using the 6 riser where the pipe end shortenings and twists in terms of loading time are presented in fig 6 the period of each bending cycle is approximately 46 s the data is extracted from the original figures in the middle of the variation amplitude during each bending cycle through digitizer before this test it was not expected that the pipe end shortening and twist after lateral buckling would be so large as a consequence the measuring interval of the instrument was exceeded and the pipe responses were unknown after a certain number of bending cycles as shown in fig 6 right the inclinometer reached its measuring limit and was torn off after respectively 2000 s and 2450 s subsequently the experiment was stopped after 3000 s and the inclinometer was unmounted this period is marked by the dashed circle in fig 6 left thereafter the experiment was continued and the data is illustrated by the rising segment after 5000 s in fig 6 left although the pipe responses were unknown after a certain number of bending cycles the obtained data captured the turning point where the pipe response end shortening or twist started to be accelerated in terms of bending cycles such a turning point is herein considered as the initiation of lateral buckling which is around 2000 s for this trial test as shown in fig 6 applying friction coefficients 0 10 and 0 15 into the present analytical model the variations of c e and c p given by eqs 24 and 28 respectively in terms of bending cycles are plotted in fig 7 from which it can be seen that the plastic buckling criterion is satisfied firstly for both friction coefficients 0 10 and 0 15 the corresponding bending cycles numbers to satisfy the plastic buckling criterion for friction coefficients 0 10 and 0 15 are respectively 30 and 44 to illustrate the frictional force and stress evolution in cyclic bending figs 8 and 9 show respectively the transverse friction and maximum compressive stress in the armour wire after different bending cycles using eqs 26 and 19 with friction coefficient 0 1 the dashed lines in figs 8 and 9 represent respectively the maximum frictional resistance at the neutral plane given by eq 27 and the yield stress while the frictional force is still sufficient to resist the elastic buckling the maximum compressive stress already surpasses the yield limit after 30 bending cycles moreover to further illustrate the contribution of different bending components to the stress in the armour wire right before the buckling initiation moment fig 10 shows the stress components in eq 19 after 29 bending cycles it can be observed that the maximum compressive stress located at the positions below and above the neutral plane symmetrically is contributed mostly from the bending in the normal direction the range of 30 to 44 bending cycles corresponding to a loading time of 1380 s to 2024 s is marked by red lines in fig 6 within this bending cycle range the flexible pipe response indeed started to be accelerated in other words the lateral buckling was initiated after the number of bending cycles estimated by the analytical model 3 2 6 riser series tests after the trial test a series of tests were performed using the 6 riser where the pipe end shortenings and twists of each test are shown in fig 11 accordingly the turning points of the failed cases i 1 ii 2 iii 2 are respectively near 160 300 and 90 bending cycles thereafter to estimate the bending cycles number to initiate the lateral buckling under the given conditions the variations of c e and c p in terms of bending cycles for each test are shown in figs 12 to 14 according to figs 12 13 right and 14 right the tests i 1 ii 2 iii 2 are estimated to reach the turning point after 112 to 167 288 to 431 68 to 101 bending cycles respectively due to plastic buckling the estimated bending cycle ranges to initiate the lateral buckling for those tests with failures are marked by red lines in fig 11 which cover or very close to the turning points for those tests note that the estimated bending cycle range for the test ii 2 is bigger than that for the other tests this is because the applied axial compression in this test is close to the critical load given by the analytical model as shown in table 4 in this test p t p 3 is equal to 1 08 which is very close to 1 when the applied axial compression is merely slightly larger than the critical load the required bending cycles number to initiate lateral buckling is very sensitive under this circumstance any small perturbation would cause a big difference in the bending cycles number estimation this phenomenon will be discussed in section 4 besides according to figs 13 left and 14 left c e and c p approach stable values smaller than 1 after respectively 50 and 200 bending cycles in tests ii 1 and iii 1 indicating that those two tests are estimated to be stable the estimated final states as well as the bending cycles to reach the equilibrium states agree with the pipe responses in tests ii 1 and iii 1 as shown in fig 11 3 3 8 riser series tests thereafter a series of tests were performed using the 8 riser where the pipe end shortenings and twists are illustrated in fig 15 as the plots of twist are crowded at the beginning of cyclic bending the turning point of the failed case i 1 is determined from the plot of end shortening which is near 70 bending cycles applying the analytical model the variations of c e and c p in terms of bending cycles for each test are plotted in figs 16 and 17 the results presented in fig 16 indicate that the test i 1 may reach the turning point after 66 to 121 bending cycles due to elastic buckling the bending cycle range of 66 to 121 is marked by red lines in fig 15 which is very close to the turning point observed during the test moreover the results in fig 17 indicate that the tests ii 1 and ii 2 reach the stable state after approximately 100 and 500 bending cycles respectively while the data of test ii 1 does show a stable response both the pipe end shortening and twist of test ii 2 increase monotonically in 2400 bending cycles as shown in fig 15 it was estimated that the lateral buckling had occurred however no sign of lateral buckling was observed during the dissection of this test pipe sample this may because the armour wires in this test sample were slowly deflecting into a global mode rather than the periodic mode due to the boundary effect 3 4 14 jumper series tests moreover a series of tests were performed using the 14 jumper where the pipe end shortenings and twists are illustrated in figs 18 and 19 the variations of c e and c p in terms of bending cycles for each test are plotted in figs 20 and 21 the 14 sample i was firstly loaded by 6000 bending cycles to simulate shut down periods for every 1200 bending cycles the test was interrupted and the sample was tensioned and bent repeatedly to draw the armour wires back towards the helical configurations no sign of failure was detected which agrees with the analytical estimation as shown in fig 20 left thereafter 1200 bending cycles were applied at approximately the same axial compression but with a larger bending curvature again the pipe end shortening and twists approached stable values with no failure within 200 bending cycles which also agrees with the analytical estimation as shown in fig 20 right for the test i 3 the analytical model suggests that the lateral buckling may be initiated after 39 to 74 bending cycles due to elastic buckling see fig 21 left this bending cycle range is marked by red lines in fig 18 however it can be observed that the pipe end shortening and twist in this test started to be accelerated after a few hundred bending cycles which is much larger than the analytical estimation in the 14 sample ii test very large axial compression was applied to examine the pipe response to extreme loads a sudden twist occurred after 18 bending cycles and the experiment was stopped immediately see fig 19 left no reason for this phenomenon was found this sample was left for approximately two days tension and cyclic bending were applied to restore the armour wires helical configurations thereafter the same axial compression and bending curvature were applied and the pipe twist grows much slower than that encountered in the first load case see fig 19 right according to the analytical model as the applied axial compression is more than three times larger than the critical load this 14 pipe is estimated to buckle very quickly after 12 to 26 bending cycles due to elastic buckling see fig 21 right this bending cycle range is marked by red lines in fig 19 which covers the turning point observed in the first loading case but much less than that observed in the second loading case the discrepancy between the measured and calculated critical bending cycle numbers for tests 14 i 3 and 14 ii 2 may be attributed to the fact that those inner armour wires failed in a global mode rather than the periodic mode employed in the analytical development which will be discussed in the following section 3 5 discussions all those samples were dissected and the inner armour wires buckling configurations can be found in østergaard 2012 as an illustration fig 22 shows the configurations of the inner armour wires layers of the 6 pipe sample i and 14 pipe sample i after failures occurred while the failed samples of 6 and 8 risers showed signs of localized s shape buckling configuration as illustrated in fig 22 top in the samples of 14 jumper only gaps of moderate size occurred and no sign of s shape configuration was observed as illustrated in fig 22 bottom this indicates that the samples of 14 jumper may fail due to a global buckling mode instead of the typical s shape mode as claimed by østergaard 2012 the finite element studies presented by li and vaz 2020a b indicate that such s shape buckling configuration is the consequence of the periodic deflection induced by cyclic bending which is formed firstly near the extrados symmetrically to the bending plane afterward a large pipe twist will be generated in the subsequent bending cycles which may cause the s shape buckling configuration to appear in other circumferential positions instead of the extrados as the present analytical model assumes a sinusoidal deflection shape and those tests of 6 and 8 risers indeed failed in the s shape buckling mode a relatively good correlation was observed however as the 14 test i 3 and ii 2 did not fail in the periodic shape the comparison with analytical estimation is not good since the analytical estimation based on the sinusoidal deflection shape is very close to that observed in the first loading case of 14 sample ii probably a periodic buckling was initiated in this test however as this test was stopped immediately after the sudden twist and the armour wire cross sectional area in this pipe is quite large the plastic deformation may not be severe after this loading case thus the armour wires may to some extent be recovered by applying tension and cyclic bending the reason why the 14 jumper failed in a global buckling mode demands further evaluation perhaps armour wires with large cross sectional areas are prone to deflect in global rather than periodic shape considering the boundary effect especially when the frictional resistance is not sufficiently strong besides while the 6 and 8 risers were tested for fixed bending radii the 14 jumpers were not conducted for fixed pipe curvature which may also affect the buckling shape based on the discussions above the following statements can be outlined good agreements were achieved between the analytical estimation and all those test data on the failure or no failure status relatively good correlations were observed between the analytical estimation and the test data of 6 and 8 risers on the bending cycles number to initiate the lateral buckling however caution needs to be paid when the applied axial compression on the inner armour wire p t is very close to the critical load p 3 as the bending cycles number becomes very sensitive while the analytical estimation on the number of bending cycles to initiate the lateral buckling applies for the s shape mode it may be too conservative for the global mode 4 parameter studies according to the analytical model the number of bending cycles to initiate the lateral buckling depends on the axial compression the minimum and maximum curvatures in cyclic bending as well as the friction coefficient which can be described by four non dimensional parameters p t p 3 κ m i n r κ m a x r and μ parameter studies are then performed to investigate the effect of those factors on the buckling mechanism using the 6 flexible riser presented in table 2 qualitatively similar results are obtained for different flexible pipe cross sections 4 1 effect of axial load firstly the number of bending cycles to initiate lateral buckling is plotted in terms of the non dimensional parameter related to the axial compression p t p 3 with different friction coefficients and bending curvatures as illustrated in figs 23 and 24 where the solid and dashed lines represent respectively the elastic and plastic buckling with certain curvatures and friction coefficient the required bending cycles number to initiate lateral buckling increases monotonically with reducing axial compression when the axial compression approaches the critical load p 3 the required bending cycles number to buckle increases rapidly note that the estimation of the actual critical load may be slightly distinguished from p 3 because of the analytical model s assumptions besides considering the axial loads carried by inner and outer armour wires are not exactly equal and other layers also carry some axial loads the axial load on each inner armour wire is a little different from that estimated by eq 3 moreover the friction model adopted in this analytical study is simplified and the contact pressure due to the residual stress caused by fabrication is not considered additionally the armour wires may contain some initial imperfections due to fabrication and previous loading history as a consequence when the axial compression verges upon the critical load the effects of any small deviations mentioned above would be amplified so that the absolute error of the bending cycles number estimation would become enhanced this has been observed in the comparison with the test data of 6 ii 2 besides from figs 23 and 24 conviction could be deduced that with certain cyclic curvatures and friction coefficient the armour wires buckling is likely to be triggered in the plastic or elastic stage when the applied axial compression is close to or much larger than the critical load for instance when the applied axial compression p t is smaller or bigger than 1 6 times the critical load p 3 the armour wires buckling is estimated to be initiated in the plastic or elastic stage respectively under the given cyclic curvatures and friction coefficient 0 1 as illustrated in fig 23 4 2 effect of friction coefficient moreover figs 25 and 26 show respectively the relationships between the bending cycles number to initiate lateral buckling and friction coefficient at different axial compression and bending curvatures where the solid and dashed lines represent respectively the elastic and plastic buckling it is noteworthy that there exists a bi linear relationship between the critical bending cycles number and friction coefficient where the connecting point is at the boundary between the elastic and plastic buckling conditions the slope of the bending cycles number in terms of friction coefficient for elastic buckling is slightly steeper than that for plastic buckling increasing the axial compression and maximum bending curvature or reducing the minimum bending curvature will cause the slope to diminish it is also observed that under certain axial compression and cyclic curvatures more bending cycles are needed to initiate the lateral buckling when the friction coefficient is bigger and the armour wires buckling is prone to be initiated in the elastic or plastic stages when the friction coefficient is relatively small or big which can also be seen from fig 23 for descriptive purposes when the friction coefficient is smaller or larger than 0 12 the armour wires buckling is estimated to be initiated in the elastic or plastic stages respectively under the given cyclic curvatures and axial load p t 2 p 3 as illustrated in fig 25 4 3 effect of bending curvatures additionally considering the minimum bending curvature as zero figs 27 and 28 show respectively the number of bending cycles to initiate lateral buckling in terms of the maximum bending curvature with different axial compression and friction coefficients where the solid and dashed lines represent respectively the elastic and plastic buckling under certain axial load friction coefficient and minimum bending curvature increasing the maximum bending curvature causes the required bending cycles number to decrease besides from figs 24 and 26 it can be seen that under certain maximum bending curvature more bending cycles are needed to initiate buckling when the minimum bending curvature increases in other words the armour wires buckle faster in cyclic bending with large curvature variation amplitude moreover it is also important to note that the bending cycles number to initiate buckling depends not only on the curvature variation amplitude but also on the average curvature for instance comparing the loading cases with κ m i n r 0 κ m a x r 0 005 and κ m i n r 0 015 κ m a x r 0 02 in figs 24 and 26 although the curvature variation amplitudes are equal the lateral buckling is estimated to be initiated after less bending cycles in the second loading case indicating that less bending cycles are needed to initiate bucking with a larger average bending curvature another interesting observation is that the boundary axial compression to cause elastic and plastic buckling decreases with the increasing maximum bending curvature and does not depend on the minimum bending curvature for instance as shown in fig 24 the boundary values of p t p 3 to cause the elastic and plastic buckling for the cases with κ m i n r 0 κ m a x r 0 005 0 01 0 015 0 02 are respectively 1 69 1 61 1 55 1 51 which shows a negative correlation on the other hand also as shown in fig 24 the boundary values of p t p 3 to cause the elastic and plastic buckling for the cases with κ m i n r 0 0 005 0 01 0 015 κ m a x r 0 02 are all equal to 1 51 in other words the minimum bending curvature has a negligible effect on the buckling types 4 4 boundary of loading conditions for elastic plastic buckling to illustrate the map of the elastic and plastic buckling under different loading conditions fig 29 shows the minimum axial compression to cause the elastic buckling in terms of the maximum bending curvature with various friction coefficients and zero minimum bending curvature as it has a negligible effect on the buckling type besides the corresponding numbers of bending cycles to initiate buckling applying the loading conditions from fig 29 are plotted in fig 30 the integer bending cycles number is responsible for the zigzag jump curves shape from fig 29 it can be observed that the minimum axial compression to cause the elastic buckling decreases with the maximum bending curvature and increases with the friction coefficient when the friction coefficient is relatively big the armour wire is only possible to buckle plastically in small cyclic curvatures for instance when the friction coefficient is equal to 0 14 no matter how large the applied axial compression is the elastic buckling cannot be provoked in cyclic bending between κ m i n r 0 and κ m a x r 0 01 on the other hand it is also interesting to note from fig 30 that for different combinations of curvatures axial compressions and friction coefficients in fig 29 the corresponding numbers of bending cycles to initiate buckling are very close and they increase asymptotically with the decreasing maximum bending curvature 5 conclusions in this work an analytical model is formulated for the approximate estimation of the number of bending cycles to initiate the flexible pipe armour wire lateral buckling in wet annulus conditions applying both elastic and plastic buckling criteria the analytical model assumes a sinusoidal deflection shape in the armour wire thus is only applicable to the periodic buckling mode which is the most common buckling mode in flexible pipes the results given by the analytical model are compared with the available test data from the literature and relatively good correlations are observed for the tests of 6 and 8 flexible risers on the number of bending cycles to initiate buckling however the analytical estimation demonstrates some conservatism in the comparison with the tests of 14 flexible jumper which may be justified by the fact that the samples did not fail in the periodic mode although the development of the analytical model relies on some strong assumptions and each one of them may have a positive or negative effect on the armour wire sliding mechanism it appears that their overall effects are counterbalanced to some extent the analytical model indicates that the number of bending cycles to initiate lateral buckling depends on the axial compression bending curvatures as well as the friction coefficient increasing the axial compression average and amplitude of cyclic curvatures or reducing the frictional coefficient cause the armour wire to buckle faster after less bending cycles on the contrary when the axial compression is merely slightly larger than the critical load substantial bending cycles become the prerequisite of buckling occurrence the analytical model should be used with caution under this circumstance since the bending cycles number estimation is very sensitive to any small deviations moreover the analytical model also illustrates that the armour wire is susceptible to buckle elastically in the conditions of large axial compression large maximum bending curvature and small friction coefficient when the friction coefficient is relatively big and the bending curvature is relatively small the armour wires may only buckle plastically eventually restricted by available experimental data in the literature additional tests are needed to further validate and verify the analytical formulation therefore the effect of each assumption adopted in this research needs to be carefully evaluated in future studies credit authorship contribution statement xiaotian

20828,the flexible pipe industry has been confronted with the potential threat of armour wires lateral buckling for over two decades cyclic bending is recognized to play a significant role in the lateral buckling mechanism since it facilitates the armour wire sliding against the frictional resistance if a flexible pipe is exposed to axial compression larger than the critical load for a certain period the risk of lateral buckling may be controlled by limiting the number of bending cycles thus the estimation of the bending cycles number to initiate buckling is favorable to prevent buckling failure and enlarge the potential application scope of flexible pipes the present paper presents an analytical model for an approximate estimation of the number of bending cycles required to initiate the lateral buckling in wet annulus conditions the analytical results are compared with the available test data in the literature and relatively good correlations are observed on the cycle numbers to buckle based on this analytical model parameter studies are performed and the effects of axial compression bending curvatures and friction coefficient on the number of bending cycles to initiate buckling as well as the stress states at the onset of buckling are discussed keywords flexible pipes tensile armour wires lateral buckling bending cycles number 1 introduction flexible pipes are critical elements in offshore oil and gas field development they often serve as risers flowlines or jumpers for the transportation of the produced hydrocarbons injection fluids and gas lift between the drilling and production facilities and the subsea installations the main characteristic of a flexible pipe is its relatively low bending to longitudinal stiffness which makes it ideal for use with floating facilities flexible pipes encompass a layered structure with various materials as illustrated in fig 1 each layer plays specific functions like withstanding the internal and external pressures coping with the axial loads preventing leaks of inner fluids reducing the friction between metallic layers protecting against seawater ingress etc a flexible pipe may lose its integrity due to many failure mechanisms one of those failure mechanisms that has attracted considerable attention is the armour wires lateral buckling as shown in fig 1 the armour wires layers are helical structures made by steel wires with a quasi rectangular cross section which are the principal layers to withstand the axial load in most application scenarios two armour wires layers are manufactured with opposite directions during flexible pipe installation or operation a flexible pipe may be exposed to large axial compression due to the reversed end cap effect brack et al 2005 or extreme weather conditions driven by this axial compressive load the armour wires are prone to deflect in either radial or lateral directions thus high strength tapes are usually applied over the armour wires to resist their radial expansion in axial compression sousa et al 2012 rabelo et al 2015 sævik and thorsen 2017 li et al 2019c aiming at investigating the birdcaging mechanism lu et al 2017 studied the instability of four steel wires symmetrically and helically wound over a cylinder subjected to axial compression through a novel experimental approach interesting conclusions were reached regarding the effects of wire helical winding geometries on the buckling behavior moreover based on the analytical model for the birdcaging limit estimation developed by sævik and thorsen 2017 wu et al 2018 proposed a criterion for torsion induced birdcaging formation regardless of the anti birdcage tape layer if the armour wires radial expansions are strongly restricted they may be vulnerable to buckle in the lateral direction for a flexible pipe subjected to pure axial compression the lateral buckling is not easy to be instigated since the armour wires sliding is strongly restrained by the frictional force at the interfaces between the armour wires and the neighboring layers thus cyclic bending is broadly necessary for the triggering of lateral buckling as it facilitates the armour wire sliding against the frictional resistance during cyclic bending energy dissipation is expected due to the friction and relative sliding between those helical components such a cyclic bending condition is usually encountered at the touchdown zone of a flexible pipe the lateral buckling is usually observed when the pipe annulus is flooded as it significantly reduces the frictional resistance moreover as the inner armour wires sustain less frictional resistance than the outer armour wires the lateral buckling always initiates by the failure of the inner armour wires layer fig 2 shows the configurations of inner and outer tensile armour wires during the dissection of a flexible pipe that failed due to the lateral buckling while the outer tensile armour wires were still intact the inner tensile armour wires endured severe lateral deflections li et al 2019a presented an analytical estimation for the critical axial compression that may cause the lateral buckling after numerous bending cycles where the critical load only depends on the armour wires geometrical and material properties it was demonstrated that no lateral buckling would be generated in cyclic bending if the applied axial compression is below this critical load thus for safety s sake it is recommended to ensure that the maximum axial compression that may be encountered in the service life of a flexible pipe should be inferior to the critical load nevertheless even if the applied axial compression is larger than the critical load the flexible pipe would only fail after a number of bending cycles thus by limiting the bending cycles number in the critical axial loading condition the lateral buckling failure still could be precluded for instance consider the installation of a flexible pipe with empty bore at a water depth in which the reversed end cap axial compression is slightly larger than the lateral buckling limit if the installation can be completed quickly so that only limited bending cycles are experienced the armour wires deformations may still be small and in the elastic region when the pipe bore is filled with fluids after the installation the flexible pipe would be mostly tensioned which tends to draw the armour wires back to the helical configurations similarly this also applies to the shutdown period where large axial compression may be generated thus the estimation of the bending cycles number to initiate the lateral buckling under certain loading conditions is favorable to inhibit the lateral buckling failure and enlarge the potential application scope of flexible pipes additionally the prediction of the bending cycles number also helps in the planning of tests to simulate flexible pipe armour wires lateral buckling the present study is then focused on the estimation of the bending cycles number to initiate the lateral buckling to date many tests have been performed on flexible pipe armour wires lateral buckling either offshore or in laboratories the tests performed in the offshore field are well known as dip tests deep immersion performance tests where flexible pipes are evaluated in conditions similar to what they may experience during installation bectarte and coutarel 2004 however it is difficult to control and measure the loading in the touchdown zone in contrast it is easier to control the axial compression bending curvatures as well as the number of cycles in lab tests through mechanical rigs or hyperbaric chamber which is beneficial to improve the understanding of the buckling mechanism braga 2003 secher et al 2011 østergaard 2012 amarante et al 2018 li et al 2019a however each test is only performed for a particular pipe under a specific condition and high expenses limit the number of tests available in the literature therefore to further reveal the underlying buckling mechanism numerical and analytical tools are in great demand several finite element models have been developed to investigate the armour wire lateral buckling for straight pipe condition where each armour wires layer is only represented by a single armour wire brack et al 2005 vaz and rizzo 2011 nygård 2012 li 2014 yang et al 2015 moreover still concerning the axisymmetric loading context finite element studies were also presented by malta and martins 2014 2017 2019 tang et al 2019 and liu et al 2019 where full armour wires layers were modeled in those studies the effects of the torsional resistance on the armour wire radial resistance from the anti birdcage tape and external hydrostatic pressure friction coefficient elastic slip as well as the initial imperfection in the armour wire configuration were extensively discussed however since cyclic bending was not considered in those finite element studies it is difficult to cause the lateral buckling applying a normal friction coefficient 0 1 0 2 unless very large axial compression is applied moreover sertã et al 2012 developed a finite element model containing all those armour wires which is applicable to simulate a flexible pipe in axial compression associated with cyclic bending however no detailed results were presented besides assuming the armour wires within the same layer deform identically in cyclic bending with uniform curvature caleyron et al 2014 2017 proposed a simplified numerical approach invoking periodic boundary condition which allows to model the full armour wires layer with a single wire thus considerably reducing the computational costs through this approach the armour wires lateral buckling in combined axial compression and cyclic bending was simulated considering the lateral contact between neighboring armour wires thereafter a finite element model was developed by lukassen 2019 applying a similar methodology and additional interesting results on lateral buckling were presented more recently yang et al 2020 studied the lateral buckling mechanism through a 3d numerical model of four tensile armour wires with a symmetrical arrangement over a cylindrical foundation the effect of friction coefficient on the buckling limit was discussed and suggestions on a flexible pipe design against the lateral buckling failure were presented besides by establishing a differential equation system for a space curved beam and solving it as a boundary value problem østergaard et al 2011 studied a single armour wire lateral buckling subjected to axial compression and cyclic bending considering the frictional resistance it was claimed that the lateral buckling limit including the frictional effect was slightly larger than that determined regardless of the friction moreover zhou et al 2015 investigated the armour wires lateral buckling through a finite element approach where each armour wires layer was represented by four armour wires around 122 bending cycles were applied within 2450 s and the pipe was defined failed if the yield strength of the armour wire material was reached the numerical results demonstrated some conservatism comparing with the test data presented by østergaard 2012 besides gonzalez et al 2019 developed a finite element model for lateral buckling study where the pipe bending was addressed by assuming the armour wire pre buckling configurations as prescribed by geodesic or loxodromic curves more recently an asymmetric non linear finite element model was developed by li and vaz 2020a b to investigate the circular armour wire lateral buckling in umbilicals in their studies the circular armour wire sliding and buckling in cyclic bending were investigated and a good correlation with the analytical estimation of lateral buckling limit proposed by li and vaz 2019 was observed in small cyclic curvatures the effects of friction coefficient elastic slip bending curvatures and axial compression on the number of bending cycles to buckle as well as the stress state at the onset of buckling were discussed besides the numerical studies several analytical models on armour wire lateral buckling are available in the literature custódio 2005 proposed an analytical model to assess the armour wire buckling limit under axisymmetric loading through the application of perturbation methods by establishing an eigenvalue problem tan et al 2006 developed an analytical model for the simulations of the armor wires buckling and post buckling behavior based on a total strain energy approach however no details were presented paiva and vaz 2017 proposed an empirical model using symbolic regression for the prediction of armour wires lateral buckling limit on a frictionless cylindrical surface based on a predefined harmonic deflection assumption sævik and ji 2014 proposed an analytical model for the prediction of armour wire lateral buckling limit on a straight frictionless cylindrical surface the results lie on the conservative side comparing with the test data presented by østergaard 2012 more recently by establishing a differential equation system based on space curved beam theory and solving it analytically through a perturbation technique a series of analytical studies were presented by li et al 2018 2019b a on the armour wire lateral buckling mechanism indicating that the armour wires are susceptible to buckle in a periodic mode rather than a global mode considering the effect of friction and cyclic bending the analytical estimation of the buckling limit demonstrates good agreements with all the test data available in the literature based on a similar theoretical approach an analytical model for the circular armour wire lateral buckling in umbilicals was also developed by li and vaz 2019 considering the armour wire axial rotation in the present work an analytical model is developed for an approximate estimation of the number of bending cycles required to initiate the armour wire lateral buckling in the wet annulus condition applying the elastic and plastic bucking criteria a comparison with the available test data is presented this is followed by parameter studies discussing the effects of axial compression friction coefficient and bending curvatures on the number of bending cycles to initiate buckling as well as the stress state at the onset of buckling 2 analytical model the present analytical model for the estimation of the number of bending cycles to initiate lateral buckling is based on the analytical model developed in li et al 2019a upon the introduction of additional assumptions to avoid repetition only the fundamental information from the previous study is retained and presented 2 1 armour wire sliding rate in bending cycles the armour wire is modeled as a space curved beam with a rectangular cross section within the wall of a toroidal surface the width and thickness of the armour wire cross section are denoted respectively by w and h the armour wire lay angle in the initial straight pipe condition with respect to the generatrix is denoted by ϕ the minor and major radii of the toroid are denoted respectively by r and r 1 κ as illustrated in fig 3 the triad of unit vectors t n b attached to the armour wire represents its tangent normal and bi normal directions respectively the toroidal surface is parameterized by the longitudinal coordinate u and angular coordinate θ the armour wire path on this toroidal surface can be determined by specifying a relationship between u and θ denote the armour wire displacement in the longitudinal direction relative to the underlying toroid surface by δ u θ and define a corresponding nondimensional parameter δ u θ δ u θ r based on space curved beam theory timoshenko and gere 1961 a differential equation system for the armour wire is established and linearized through the application of a perturbation technique applying the classical isotropic coulomb friction model the sliding rate of the inner armour wire in the longitudinal direction in the wet annulus condition subjected to compression and bending is approximately evaluated by li et al 2019a as 1 d δ u θ d κ r cos 3 ϕ sin ϕ sin θ r sin ϕ sin θ μ η e i n χ p t r 2 sin 2 2 ϕ 4 d 4 δ u d θ 4 1 p 1 χ p t cos 2 ϕ d 2 δ u d θ 2 κ r 1 p 2 χ p t 1 sin 2 ϕ cot 3 ϕ sin θ where μ is the friction coefficient κ is the bending curvature whose positive direction is defined as shown in fig 3 χ is a nondimensional parameter given by eq 2 and η is a sign of plus or minus depending on the circumferential position and bending direction as shown in table 1 2 χ θ e η μ sin ϕ θ 0 5 π 0 θ π e η μ sin ϕ θ 1 5 π π θ 2 π besides p t is the cross sectional force in the armour wire axial direction in the straight pipe condition which can be approximately evaluated by 3 p t p e n d n i n n e x cos ϕ where p e n d is the axial load carried by the flexible pipe n i n and n e x are respectively the numbers of armour wires in the inner and outer armour wires layers in the present context compressive loads are taken as negative values moreover p 1 and p 2 are two constants corresponding to the armour wire characteristics given by 4 p 1 sin 2 ϕ r 2 e i n cos 2 ϕ 4 e i b cos 2 ϕ g j cos 2 ϕ 5 p 2 sin 2 ϕ r 2 e i n 1 cos 2 ϕ e i b 2 cos 2 ϕ cos 2 ϕ 1 sin 2 ϕ g j sin 2 2 ϕ 2 2 sin 2 ϕ in which e is the young s modulus i n and i b are the cross sectional inertias in the normal and bi normal directions respectively and j is the torsional stiffness which can be evaluated by timoshenko and goodier 1951 6 j w h 3 1 3 64 π 5 h w the analytical formulation for armour wire sliding rate in bending was obtained based on the following assumptions the ratio of the minor to major toroid radii is a small term the armour wire radial expansion in axial compression is ignored the flexible pipe axial rotation is negligible before the initiation of armour wire lateral buckling the armour wire is assumed pinned on the toroidal surface at the intrados and extrados due to the geometrical symmetry the neighboring armour wires within the same armour wire layer are not in contact when the lateral buckling is initiated the armour wire sliding rate in the transverse direction is much smaller than that in the tangential direction the entire armour wire slides in bending and the frictional force is equal to the full dynamic frictional force note that the analytical model for the sliding rate was developed to describe the final equilibrium state of an armour wire after numerous bending cycles while those assumptions may be acceptable in this condition they may be somewhat strong to describe the armour wire sliding during each bending cycle towards the final state for instance assuming that the transverse sliding is much smaller than the tangential sliding is expected to underestimate the sliding rate in the transverse direction on the other hand ignoring the stick slip phenomenon is expected to overestimate the sliding rate moreover for a flexible pipe with lateral buckling failure axial shortening and twist will be generated consequently the coupling effect from the other layers may retard or facilitate the buckling process especially in the post buckling stage therefore due to the complex frictional mechanism and geometric nonlinearity it is extremely difficult to precisely describe the armour wire sliding and buckling process in cyclic bending through an analytical approach 2 2 armour wire path progression in cyclic bending despite the complexity of the armour wire sliding and buckling mechanism there are still opportunities to develop an analytical tool to approximately estimate the number of bending cycles that may initiate the lateral buckling upon the introduction of strong assumptions according to the studies of zhou and vaz 2017 and li and vaz 2020a the armour wire develops into a quasi sinusoidal deflection shape very quickly after a few bending cycles based on this observation it is enforced that the armour wire deflection shape in cyclic bending is sinusoidal accordingly the armour wire nondimensional sliding in the longitudinal direction is herein assumed as 7 δ u θ δ u sin θ where δ u corresponds to the armour wire nondimensional sliding in the longitudinal direction at the neutral plane θ π 2 which is approximately evaluated by substituting θ π 2 into eq 1 consequently the following relationship can be obtained 8a d 2 δ u d θ 2 π 2 δ u 8b d 4 δ u d θ 4 π 2 δ u this assumption may be moderately strong but significantly simplifies the problem and renders the analytical study feasible due to symmetry only half pitch of the armour wire 0 θ π is discussed in the present context substituting eqs 8a 8b and θ π 2 into eq 1 the inner armour wire sliding rate at the neutral plane can be approximately given by 9 d δ u d κ κ δ u r cos 3 ϕ sin ϕ κ r 2 η μ 1 p 2 p t 1 sin 2 ϕ sin ϕ cot 3 ϕ δ u r η μ 1 p 3 p t sin ϕ cos 2 ϕ in which p 3 is a constant corresponding to the armour wire characteristics given by 10 p 3 sin 2 ϕ r 2 e i n 1 cos 2 ϕ 4 e i b cos 2 ϕ g j cos 2 ϕ it can be seen that the sliding rate depends not only on the bending curvature but also on the current armour wire position considering the armour wire deflection progression is usually very slow in cyclic bending the sliding rate during each bending cycle is approximately evaluated by using the armour wire position at the beginning of this bending cycle thus denoting the armour wire nondimensional longitudinal sliding at the neutral plane after n th bending cycle by δ u n the recursive formula for the series of δ u n can be described by 11 δ u n δ u n 1 κ min κ max d δ u d κ δ u n 1 d κ κ max κ min d δ u d κ δ u n 1 d κ where κ m i n and κ m a x are respectively the minimum and maximum bending curvatures in cyclic bending those two terms on the right side of the equation represent respectively the armour wire nondimensional sliding during the n th bending cycle when the bending curvature increases from κ m i n to κ m a x and decreases from κ m a x to κ m i n this analytical model is applicable to cyclic bending curvatures in the same or opposite directions note that at the touchdown zone of a flexible pipe the minimum and maximum bending curvatures are usually in the same direction subsequently substituting eq 9 into 11 yields 12 δ u n 1 λ δ u n 1 β where 13 λ κ max κ min 2 r μ 1 p 3 p t sin ϕ cos 2 ϕ 14 β κ max 2 κ min 2 r 2 μ 1 p 2 p t 1 sin 2 ϕ cos 3 ϕ sin 2 ϕ assuming that there is no initial imperfection i e δ u 0 at the beginning of cyclic loading the armour wire nondimensional sliding in the longitudinal direction at the neutral plane after each bending cycle can be obtained from eq 12 as 15 δ u 1 β δ u 2 β 1 1 λ δ u 3 β 1 1 λ 1 λ 2 δ u n β 1 1 λ 1 λ n 1 consequently the general term formula of this series can be easily obtained as 16 δ u n β 1 λ n 1 λ substituting eq 16 into 7 the armour wire path after the n th bending cycle can be evaluated by 17 δ u n θ β 1 λ n 1 λ sin θ in which β represents the armour wire nondimensional sliding at the neutral plane after the first bending cycle and λ corresponds to the displacement growing rate according to eq 14 when p t p 2 is bigger or smaller than 1 β is positive or negative which indicates that the armour wire slides towards the extrados or intrados when p t p 2 1 β is zero which demonstrates that the armour wire tends to remain in the initial helical path in cyclic bending under this circumstance besides fig 4 shows δ u n θ β in terms of the number of bending cycles with different values of λ using eq 16 it can be seen that when λ 0 i e p t p 3 1 the armour wire deflection grows constantly after each bending cycle which will eventually cause the lateral buckling the bigger the λ is the faster the armour wire slides in cyclic bending on the other hand when 1 λ 0 i e 0 p t p 3 1 1 λ n tends to be zero after infinite bending cycles n and this sequence will converge to the following path 18 δ u θ κ min κ max r 1 sin 2 ϕ cos ϕ 2 sin 3 ϕ p t p 2 p t p 3 sin θ which is consistent with the equilibrium path presented by li et al 2019a as shown in fig 4 the smaller the λ is the faster the armour wire reaches the equilibrium path in cyclic bending when λ approaches zero eq 16 can be approximately simplified as δ u n n β which is illustrated by the dashed line in fig 4 this implies that the armour wire sliding rate is nearly constant in terms of the bending cycles number when the applied axial compression p t is close to p 3 it needs to be emphasized that the equilibrium path described by eq 18 only has physical meaning if the two buckling criteria presented in the following section are not satisfied 2 3 lateral buckling criteria the armour wire lateral buckling may take place when the armour wire reaches the yield limit or when the frictional force is not capable of holding the armour wire equilibrium state therefore two buckling criteria are proposed in this study 2 3 1 plastic buckling criterion the four corners in the armour wire cross section shown in fig 5 are the most critical to reach the material yield stress depending on bending directions the maximum compressive stress in each armour wire cross section will be observed at one of those corners which can be approximately evaluated by 19 σ θ p t θ a w m n θ 2 i n h m b θ 2 i b where a is the armour wire cross sectional area m n θ and m b θ are the armour wire cross sectional moments in the normal and bi normal directions respectively which can be evaluated by 20 m n θ e i n κ 1 sin 2 ϕ cos ϕ sin θ sin 3 ϕ r 2 d 2 δ u d θ 2 21 m b θ e i b κ 2 sin 2 ϕ 1 cos 2 ϕ cos θ 2 sin 3 ϕ cos ϕ r 2 d δ u d θ substituting eq 17 into 20 and 21 the cross sectional moments during each bending cycle can be approximately evaluated by 22 m n θ e i n κ 1 sin 2 ϕ cos ϕ sin 3 ϕ r 2 δ u n sin θ 23 m b θ e i b κ 2 sin 2 ϕ 1 cos 2 ϕ 2 sin 3 ϕ cos ϕ r 2 δ u n cos θ considering that it is more critical when the pipe is bent to the maximum curvature applying κ κ m a x and substituting eqs 22 and 23 into 19 the maximum compressive stress can be found by searching the maximum value of σ θ in the range 0 θ π herein the maximum compressive stress in the armour wire during the n th bending cycle is denoted by σ m a x n considering that the shear stress in the armour wire is small when the maximum compressive stress reaches the yielding limit the armour wire is expected to soften to a level that accelerates its sliding and deflection in the subsequent bending cycles thus the plastic buckling initiation criterion is described by 24 c p σ max n σ s 1 where σ s is the yield stress note that the armour wire may not fail immediately when only a small portion reaches the plastic stage after the lateral buckling initiation the armour wire can still withstand some additional bending cycles until it completely fails 2 3 2 elastic buckling criteria as the armour wire continually slides in the transverse direction in cyclic bending the required frictional force to hold the equilibrium state also increases if the armour wire transverse deflection is too large the frictional force may not be sufficient to hold the equilibrium state which may also result in the lateral buckling the required frictional force in the bi normal direction to keep the armour wire equilibrium state can be evaluated by 25 p b θ e i n sin 5 ϕ r 3 d 4 δ u d θ 4 p t p 1 sin 3 ϕ r d 2 δ u d θ 2 κ p t p 2 1 sin 2 ϕ cos ϕ sin θ substituting eq 17 into 25 the required frictional force in the bi normal direction during the n th bending cycle can be obtained as 26 p b θ p t p 3 sin 3 ϕ r δ u n κ p t p 2 1 sin 2 ϕ cos ϕ sin θ assuming a sinusoidal deflection shape the maximum transverse frictional force is located at the neutral plane θ π 2 when the bending curvature reaches the maximum value ignoring the fabrication pressure the maximum frictional force per unit arc length generated by axial compression on the inner armour wire at the neutral plane can be evaluated by 27 f μ p t sin 2 ϕ r when the required transverse frictional force at the neutral plane surpasses the maximum frictional force at this location the armour wire is not able to hold this sinusoidal shape anymore so that the lateral buckling may be initiated after this moment thus the elastic buckling initiation criterion is described by 28 c e p b θ π 2 κ κ max μ p t sin 2 ϕ r 1 again note that the armour wire may not buckle immediately when only a small arc length near the neutral plane overcomes the frictional resistance the armour wire may continually withstand some additional bending cycles until it completely fails eqs 19 20 21 25 and 27 are derived in li et al 2019a 3 comparison with test data a series of experimental tests on flexible pipe armour wire lateral buckling were performed by østergaard 2012 using mechanical rigs applying axial compression associated with cyclic bending in the vertical plane the test loading conditions and results including pipe end shortenings and twists in terms of bending cycles were well described constituting good reference for comparison with the present analytical model three flexible pipes were tested and the armour wires geometrical and material characteristics are presented in table 2 table 3 shows the loading conditions and test results where the bending radius constitutes the minimum radius in cyclic bending in all those tests cyclic bending was imposed between straight and maximum bending pipe configurations since the samples were tensioned with a 50 kn load and bent between 10 to 20 times before the test to draw the armour wires towards the initial helical configuration the initial imperfections may be neglected which corresponds to the assumption of the analytical model applying the data presented in tables 2 and 3 the analytical results for each test are shown in table 4 where e and p within parentheses represent the elastic and plastic buckling status respectively note that the bending curvature is not uniform in the tests of 14 jumper sample i the non dimensional parameter κ m a x r in table 4 for this sample is calculated using the average curvature p t p 2 and p 3 are obtained from eqs 3 5 and 10 respectively the friction coefficient is considered between 0 10 and 0 15 in accordance with østergaard et al 2011 and sævik and ji 2014 the bending cycles to initiate buckling as well as the buckling triggering mechanism are estimated by comparing the two buckling criteria which will be discussed in detail below 3 1 trial test firstly a trial test was performed using the 6 riser where the pipe end shortenings and twists in terms of loading time are presented in fig 6 the period of each bending cycle is approximately 46 s the data is extracted from the original figures in the middle of the variation amplitude during each bending cycle through digitizer before this test it was not expected that the pipe end shortening and twist after lateral buckling would be so large as a consequence the measuring interval of the instrument was exceeded and the pipe responses were unknown after a certain number of bending cycles as shown in fig 6 right the inclinometer reached its measuring limit and was torn off after respectively 2000 s and 2450 s subsequently the experiment was stopped after 3000 s and the inclinometer was unmounted this period is marked by the dashed circle in fig 6 left thereafter the experiment was continued and the data is illustrated by the rising segment after 5000 s in fig 6 left although the pipe responses were unknown after a certain number of bending cycles the obtained data captured the turning point where the pipe response end shortening or twist started to be accelerated in terms of bending cycles such a turning point is herein considered as the initiation of lateral buckling which is around 2000 s for this trial test as shown in fig 6 applying friction coefficients 0 10 and 0 15 into the present analytical model the variations of c e and c p given by eqs 24 and 28 respectively in terms of bending cycles are plotted in fig 7 from which it can be seen that the plastic buckling criterion is satisfied firstly for both friction coefficients 0 10 and 0 15 the corresponding bending cycles numbers to satisfy the plastic buckling criterion for friction coefficients 0 10 and 0 15 are respectively 30 and 44 to illustrate the frictional force and stress evolution in cyclic bending figs 8 and 9 show respectively the transverse friction and maximum compressive stress in the armour wire after different bending cycles using eqs 26 and 19 with friction coefficient 0 1 the dashed lines in figs 8 and 9 represent respectively the maximum frictional resistance at the neutral plane given by eq 27 and the yield stress while the frictional force is still sufficient to resist the elastic buckling the maximum compressive stress already surpasses the yield limit after 30 bending cycles moreover to further illustrate the contribution of different bending components to the stress in the armour wire right before the buckling initiation moment fig 10 shows the stress components in eq 19 after 29 bending cycles it can be observed that the maximum compressive stress located at the positions below and above the neutral plane symmetrically is contributed mostly from the bending in the normal direction the range of 30 to 44 bending cycles corresponding to a loading time of 1380 s to 2024 s is marked by red lines in fig 6 within this bending cycle range the flexible pipe response indeed started to be accelerated in other words the lateral buckling was initiated after the number of bending cycles estimated by the analytical model 3 2 6 riser series tests after the trial test a series of tests were performed using the 6 riser where the pipe end shortenings and twists of each test are shown in fig 11 accordingly the turning points of the failed cases i 1 ii 2 iii 2 are respectively near 160 300 and 90 bending cycles thereafter to estimate the bending cycles number to initiate the lateral buckling under the given conditions the variations of c e and c p in terms of bending cycles for each test are shown in figs 12 to 14 according to figs 12 13 right and 14 right the tests i 1 ii 2 iii 2 are estimated to reach the turning point after 112 to 167 288 to 431 68 to 101 bending cycles respectively due to plastic buckling the estimated bending cycle ranges to initiate the lateral buckling for those tests with failures are marked by red lines in fig 11 which cover or very close to the turning points for those tests note that the estimated bending cycle range for the test ii 2 is bigger than that for the other tests this is because the applied axial compression in this test is close to the critical load given by the analytical model as shown in table 4 in this test p t p 3 is equal to 1 08 which is very close to 1 when the applied axial compression is merely slightly larger than the critical load the required bending cycles number to initiate lateral buckling is very sensitive under this circumstance any small perturbation would cause a big difference in the bending cycles number estimation this phenomenon will be discussed in section 4 besides according to figs 13 left and 14 left c e and c p approach stable values smaller than 1 after respectively 50 and 200 bending cycles in tests ii 1 and iii 1 indicating that those two tests are estimated to be stable the estimated final states as well as the bending cycles to reach the equilibrium states agree with the pipe responses in tests ii 1 and iii 1 as shown in fig 11 3 3 8 riser series tests thereafter a series of tests were performed using the 8 riser where the pipe end shortenings and twists are illustrated in fig 15 as the plots of twist are crowded at the beginning of cyclic bending the turning point of the failed case i 1 is determined from the plot of end shortening which is near 70 bending cycles applying the analytical model the variations of c e and c p in terms of bending cycles for each test are plotted in figs 16 and 17 the results presented in fig 16 indicate that the test i 1 may reach the turning point after 66 to 121 bending cycles due to elastic buckling the bending cycle range of 66 to 121 is marked by red lines in fig 15 which is very close to the turning point observed during the test moreover the results in fig 17 indicate that the tests ii 1 and ii 2 reach the stable state after approximately 100 and 500 bending cycles respectively while the data of test ii 1 does show a stable response both the pipe end shortening and twist of test ii 2 increase monotonically in 2400 bending cycles as shown in fig 15 it was estimated that the lateral buckling had occurred however no sign of lateral buckling was observed during the dissection of this test pipe sample this may because the armour wires in this test sample were slowly deflecting into a global mode rather than the periodic mode due to the boundary effect 3 4 14 jumper series tests moreover a series of tests were performed using the 14 jumper where the pipe end shortenings and twists are illustrated in figs 18 and 19 the variations of c e and c p in terms of bending cycles for each test are plotted in figs 20 and 21 the 14 sample i was firstly loaded by 6000 bending cycles to simulate shut down periods for every 1200 bending cycles the test was interrupted and the sample was tensioned and bent repeatedly to draw the armour wires back towards the helical configurations no sign of failure was detected which agrees with the analytical estimation as shown in fig 20 left thereafter 1200 bending cycles were applied at approximately the same axial compression but with a larger bending curvature again the pipe end shortening and twists approached stable values with no failure within 200 bending cycles which also agrees with the analytical estimation as shown in fig 20 right for the test i 3 the analytical model suggests that the lateral buckling may be initiated after 39 to 74 bending cycles due to elastic buckling see fig 21 left this bending cycle range is marked by red lines in fig 18 however it can be observed that the pipe end shortening and twist in this test started to be accelerated after a few hundred bending cycles which is much larger than the analytical estimation in the 14 sample ii test very large axial compression was applied to examine the pipe response to extreme loads a sudden twist occurred after 18 bending cycles and the experiment was stopped immediately see fig 19 left no reason for this phenomenon was found this sample was left for approximately two days tension and cyclic bending were applied to restore the armour wires helical configurations thereafter the same axial compression and bending curvature were applied and the pipe twist grows much slower than that encountered in the first load case see fig 19 right according to the analytical model as the applied axial compression is more than three times larger than the critical load this 14 pipe is estimated to buckle very quickly after 12 to 26 bending cycles due to elastic buckling see fig 21 right this bending cycle range is marked by red lines in fig 19 which covers the turning point observed in the first loading case but much less than that observed in the second loading case the discrepancy between the measured and calculated critical bending cycle numbers for tests 14 i 3 and 14 ii 2 may be attributed to the fact that those inner armour wires failed in a global mode rather than the periodic mode employed in the analytical development which will be discussed in the following section 3 5 discussions all those samples were dissected and the inner armour wires buckling configurations can be found in østergaard 2012 as an illustration fig 22 shows the configurations of the inner armour wires layers of the 6 pipe sample i and 14 pipe sample i after failures occurred while the failed samples of 6 and 8 risers showed signs of localized s shape buckling configuration as illustrated in fig 22 top in the samples of 14 jumper only gaps of moderate size occurred and no sign of s shape configuration was observed as illustrated in fig 22 bottom this indicates that the samples of 14 jumper may fail due to a global buckling mode instead of the typical s shape mode as claimed by østergaard 2012 the finite element studies presented by li and vaz 2020a b indicate that such s shape buckling configuration is the consequence of the periodic deflection induced by cyclic bending which is formed firstly near the extrados symmetrically to the bending plane afterward a large pipe twist will be generated in the subsequent bending cycles which may cause the s shape buckling configuration to appear in other circumferential positions instead of the extrados as the present analytical model assumes a sinusoidal deflection shape and those tests of 6 and 8 risers indeed failed in the s shape buckling mode a relatively good correlation was observed however as the 14 test i 3 and ii 2 did not fail in the periodic shape the comparison with analytical estimation is not good since the analytical estimation based on the sinusoidal deflection shape is very close to that observed in the first loading case of 14 sample ii probably a periodic buckling was initiated in this test however as this test was stopped immediately after the sudden twist and the armour wire cross sectional area in this pipe is quite large the plastic deformation may not be severe after this loading case thus the armour wires may to some extent be recovered by applying tension and cyclic bending the reason why the 14 jumper failed in a global buckling mode demands further evaluation perhaps armour wires with large cross sectional areas are prone to deflect in global rather than periodic shape considering the boundary effect especially when the frictional resistance is not sufficiently strong besides while the 6 and 8 risers were tested for fixed bending radii the 14 jumpers were not conducted for fixed pipe curvature which may also affect the buckling shape based on the discussions above the following statements can be outlined good agreements were achieved between the analytical estimation and all those test data on the failure or no failure status relatively good correlations were observed between the analytical estimation and the test data of 6 and 8 risers on the bending cycles number to initiate the lateral buckling however caution needs to be paid when the applied axial compression on the inner armour wire p t is very close to the critical load p 3 as the bending cycles number becomes very sensitive while the analytical estimation on the number of bending cycles to initiate the lateral buckling applies for the s shape mode it may be too conservative for the global mode 4 parameter studies according to the analytical model the number of bending cycles to initiate the lateral buckling depends on the axial compression the minimum and maximum curvatures in cyclic bending as well as the friction coefficient which can be described by four non dimensional parameters p t p 3 κ m i n r κ m a x r and μ parameter studies are then performed to investigate the effect of those factors on the buckling mechanism using the 6 flexible riser presented in table 2 qualitatively similar results are obtained for different flexible pipe cross sections 4 1 effect of axial load firstly the number of bending cycles to initiate lateral buckling is plotted in terms of the non dimensional parameter related to the axial compression p t p 3 with different friction coefficients and bending curvatures as illustrated in figs 23 and 24 where the solid and dashed lines represent respectively the elastic and plastic buckling with certain curvatures and friction coefficient the required bending cycles number to initiate lateral buckling increases monotonically with reducing axial compression when the axial compression approaches the critical load p 3 the required bending cycles number to buckle increases rapidly note that the estimation of the actual critical load may be slightly distinguished from p 3 because of the analytical model s assumptions besides considering the axial loads carried by inner and outer armour wires are not exactly equal and other layers also carry some axial loads the axial load on each inner armour wire is a little different from that estimated by eq 3 moreover the friction model adopted in this analytical study is simplified and the contact pressure due to the residual stress caused by fabrication is not considered additionally the armour wires may contain some initial imperfections due to fabrication and previous loading history as a consequence when the axial compression verges upon the critical load the effects of any small deviations mentioned above would be amplified so that the absolute error of the bending cycles number estimation would become enhanced this has been observed in the comparison with the test data of 6 ii 2 besides from figs 23 and 24 conviction could be deduced that with certain cyclic curvatures and friction coefficient the armour wires buckling is likely to be triggered in the plastic or elastic stage when the applied axial compression is close to or much larger than the critical load for instance when the applied axial compression p t is smaller or bigger than 1 6 times the critical load p 3 the armour wires buckling is estimated to be initiated in the plastic or elastic stage respectively under the given cyclic curvatures and friction coefficient 0 1 as illustrated in fig 23 4 2 effect of friction coefficient moreover figs 25 and 26 show respectively the relationships between the bending cycles number to initiate lateral buckling and friction coefficient at different axial compression and bending curvatures where the solid and dashed lines represent respectively the elastic and plastic buckling it is noteworthy that there exists a bi linear relationship between the critical bending cycles number and friction coefficient where the connecting point is at the boundary between the elastic and plastic buckling conditions the slope of the bending cycles number in terms of friction coefficient for elastic buckling is slightly steeper than that for plastic buckling increasing the axial compression and maximum bending curvature or reducing the minimum bending curvature will cause the slope to diminish it is also observed that under certain axial compression and cyclic curvatures more bending cycles are needed to initiate the lateral buckling when the friction coefficient is bigger and the armour wires buckling is prone to be initiated in the elastic or plastic stages when the friction coefficient is relatively small or big which can also be seen from fig 23 for descriptive purposes when the friction coefficient is smaller or larger than 0 12 the armour wires buckling is estimated to be initiated in the elastic or plastic stages respectively under the given cyclic curvatures and axial load p t 2 p 3 as illustrated in fig 25 4 3 effect of bending curvatures additionally considering the minimum bending curvature as zero figs 27 and 28 show respectively the number of bending cycles to initiate lateral buckling in terms of the maximum bending curvature with different axial compression and friction coefficients where the solid and dashed lines represent respectively the elastic and plastic buckling under certain axial load friction coefficient and minimum bending curvature increasing the maximum bending curvature causes the required bending cycles number to decrease besides from figs 24 and 26 it can be seen that under certain maximum bending curvature more bending cycles are needed to initiate buckling when the minimum bending curvature increases in other words the armour wires buckle faster in cyclic bending with large curvature variation amplitude moreover it is also important to note that the bending cycles number to initiate buckling depends not only on the curvature variation amplitude but also on the average curvature for instance comparing the loading cases with κ m i n r 0 κ m a x r 0 005 and κ m i n r 0 015 κ m a x r 0 02 in figs 24 and 26 although the curvature variation amplitudes are equal the lateral buckling is estimated to be initiated after less bending cycles in the second loading case indicating that less bending cycles are needed to initiate bucking with a larger average bending curvature another interesting observation is that the boundary axial compression to cause elastic and plastic buckling decreases with the increasing maximum bending curvature and does not depend on the minimum bending curvature for instance as shown in fig 24 the boundary values of p t p 3 to cause the elastic and plastic buckling for the cases with κ m i n r 0 κ m a x r 0 005 0 01 0 015 0 02 are respectively 1 69 1 61 1 55 1 51 which shows a negative correlation on the other hand also as shown in fig 24 the boundary values of p t p 3 to cause the elastic and plastic buckling for the cases with κ m i n r 0 0 005 0 01 0 015 κ m a x r 0 02 are all equal to 1 51 in other words the minimum bending curvature has a negligible effect on the buckling types 4 4 boundary of loading conditions for elastic plastic buckling to illustrate the map of the elastic and plastic buckling under different loading conditions fig 29 shows the minimum axial compression to cause the elastic buckling in terms of the maximum bending curvature with various friction coefficients and zero minimum bending curvature as it has a negligible effect on the buckling type besides the corresponding numbers of bending cycles to initiate buckling applying the loading conditions from fig 29 are plotted in fig 30 the integer bending cycles number is responsible for the zigzag jump curves shape from fig 29 it can be observed that the minimum axial compression to cause the elastic buckling decreases with the maximum bending curvature and increases with the friction coefficient when the friction coefficient is relatively big the armour wire is only possible to buckle plastically in small cyclic curvatures for instance when the friction coefficient is equal to 0 14 no matter how large the applied axial compression is the elastic buckling cannot be provoked in cyclic bending between κ m i n r 0 and κ m a x r 0 01 on the other hand it is also interesting to note from fig 30 that for different combinations of curvatures axial compressions and friction coefficients in fig 29 the corresponding numbers of bending cycles to initiate buckling are very close and they increase asymptotically with the decreasing maximum bending curvature 5 conclusions in this work an analytical model is formulated for the approximate estimation of the number of bending cycles to initiate the flexible pipe armour wire lateral buckling in wet annulus conditions applying both elastic and plastic buckling criteria the analytical model assumes a sinusoidal deflection shape in the armour wire thus is only applicable to the periodic buckling mode which is the most common buckling mode in flexible pipes the results given by the analytical model are compared with the available test data from the literature and relatively good correlations are observed for the tests of 6 and 8 flexible risers on the number of bending cycles to initiate buckling however the analytical estimation demonstrates some conservatism in the comparison with the tests of 14 flexible jumper which may be justified by the fact that the samples did not fail in the periodic mode although the development of the analytical model relies on some strong assumptions and each one of them may have a positive or negative effect on the armour wire sliding mechanism it appears that their overall effects are counterbalanced to some extent the analytical model indicates that the number of bending cycles to initiate lateral buckling depends on the axial compression bending curvatures as well as the friction coefficient increasing the axial compression average and amplitude of cyclic curvatures or reducing the frictional coefficient cause the armour wire to buckle faster after less bending cycles on the contrary when the axial compression is merely slightly larger than the critical load substantial bending cycles become the prerequisite of buckling occurrence the analytical model should be used with caution under this circumstance since the bending cycles number estimation is very sensitive to any small deviations moreover the analytical model also illustrates that the armour wire is susceptible to buckle elastically in the conditions of large axial compression large maximum bending curvature and small friction coefficient when the friction coefficient is relatively big and the bending curvature is relatively small the armour wires may only buckle plastically eventually restricted by available experimental data in the literature additional tests are needed to further validate and verify the analytical formulation therefore the effect of each assumption adopted in this research needs to be carefully evaluated in future studies credit authorship contribution statement xiaotian

technology mekelweg 2 2628 cd delft the netherlands delft university of technology mekelweg 2 delft 2628 cd the netherlands the delft twist 11 hydrofoil is a common test case for investigating the interaction between turbulence and cavitation modelling in computational fluid dynamics despite repeated investigations results reported for the lift and drag coefficient are accompanied by significant uncertainties both in experimental and numerical studies when using scale resolving approaches it is known that turbulent fluctuations must be inserted into the domain in order to prevent the flow from remaining laminar around the body of interest although this has been overlooked until now for the present test case this work investigates the errors occurring when a laminar inflow is applied for mildly separated or attached flows by employing the partially averaged navier stokes equations with varying values for the ratio of modelled to total turbulence kinetic energy and with varying grid densities it is shown that depending on the grid resolution laminar leading edge separation can occur when turbulent fluctuations are added to the inflow the leading edge separation is suppressed completely and the turbulent separation zone near the trailing edge reduces in size the inflow turbulence has a large effect on the skin friction which increases with increasing turbulence intensity to a limit determined by the grid resolution in cavitating conditions the integral quantities are dominated by the shedding sheet cavity the turbulence intensity has little effect on the pressure distribution leading to a largely unaffected sheet cavitation although the shedding behaviour is affected it is shown that especially in wetted flow conditions with scale resolving methods inflow turbulence is necessary to match the experimental flow field keywords synthetic inflow turbulence delft twist 11 hydrofoil pans cavitation verification validation 1 introduction in both research and industrial contexts computational fluid dynamics cfd is being increasingly used to resolve a part of the turbulence spectrum through the application of scale resolving simulations srs instead of more traditional reynolds averaged navier stokes rans modelling methods srs consist of several approaches such as large eddy simulation les partially averaged navier stokes pans or rans les hybrid methods such as detached eddy simulation des the increased physical resolution in the obtained solutions is necessary for flow cases exhibiting important time varying stochastic features such as strongly separated flows cavitation broadband noise etc it is well known from literature that for attached flows srs require synthetic inflow turbulence or leading edge roughness to induce transition to turbulence in order to prevent laminar solutions tabor and baba ahmadi 2010 klapwijk et al 2020 nevertheless it is clear from literature that for maritime applications including cavitation the use of a resolved turbulent inflow is often neglected potentially leading to large modelling errors the current study aims to explore the reduction in modelling errors when using resolved inflow turbulence and the application of a synthetic turbulence generator for simulating cavitation dynamics such a methodology can result in an increased physical resolution while using smaller domains i e less computational cells potential use cases include simulating a propeller in a cavitation tunnel simulating a propeller in behind condition without resolving the entire flow around the hull upstream or predicting the interaction between two wings while only simulating the downstream wing the test case of choice in the current work is the 3d twisted hydrofoil studied by foeth et al 2006 this is a well documented test case exhibiting a shedding sheet cavity representative of a ship propeller while avoiding the additional complications due to a rotating body the test case was experimentally studied in both wetted and cavitating conditions and is a common numerical test case hoekstra et al 2011 due to the cavitation occurring inside the boundary layer the cavitation behaviour is strongly dependent on the interaction between turbulence and cavitation modelling emphasizing the need for proper inflow boundary conditions an overview of previous investigations into this test case is given in section 3 2 the test case was designed to study cavitation behaviour which naturally has led to a focus on attempting to capture the cavitating behaviour unfortunately an effect of this is that some of the difficulties in simulating this test case have been overlooked although it is known from literature that inflow turbulence is necessary for srs methods all srs results in the open literature for this test case do not employ such methods indeed they obtain reasonable results for the cavity length and shedding behaviour it seems that the presence of a sheet cavity on the wing surface obscures some of the difficulties in simulating this flow the laminar inflow leads to an incorrect boundary layer prediction but still the presence of cavitation leads to a production of turbulence and vorticity due to the occurrence of shear layers in the flow due to these turbulent perturbations turbulence like structures arise when solving the navier stokes equations masking the modelling errors due to the laminar inflow due to the complex interaction between modelling and numerical errors such results strongly depend on the used grid time step and turbulence model commonly coarser grids results in lower eddy viscosity levels see e g diskin et al 2015 leading to the occurrence of increased dynamics in such cases grid refinement can suppress dynamics thereby leading to an increasing comparison error with grid refinement in contrast under wetted flow conditions the lack of inflow turbulence structures can lead to unrealistic flow results when using srs approaches in the current work we attempt to show the mismatch between computations and experiments which can occur for this case when using a steady inflow for srs the focus will therefore be on wetted flow conditions to prevent the presence of turbulence due to cavitation obscuring the errors nevertheless results for cavitating conditions are also presented all results are obtained using pans in order to be able to systematically vary the turbulence resolution between rans and underresolved direct numerical simulation dns while simultaneously utilising several grid densities a theoretical advantage of pans is that due to the explicit setting of the filter between rans and dns the discretisation and modelling errors are decoupled pereira et al 2018 klapwijk et al 2020 the use of a single formulation ranging from rans to dns prevents ad hoc behaviour when switching between resolving and modelling turbulence as can occur for hybrid methods vaz et al 2017 klapwijk et al 2020 iterative statistical and discretisation errors are assessed the turbulent unsteady inflow is provided by a modified version of the body forcing approach developed in klapwijk et al 2020 which is based on the digital filtering method by xie and castro 2008 the paper is organised as follows section 2 describes the different mathematical approaches for simulating turbulence phase change due to cavitation and synthetic inflow turbulence section 3 describes the test case and numerical setup while section 4 details the estimation of the numerical errors after this the results are addressed in two sections wetted flow in section 5 and cavitating flow in section 6 the discussion and conclusions in sections 7 and 8 complete the study 2 mathematical modelling approaches the approach to resolving and modelling turbulence employed in this work is the partially averaged navier stokes pans method girimaji and abdol hamid 2005 in this methodology the instantaneous quantities φ are decomposed into a resolved φ and a modelled unresolved component ϕ applying this decomposition to the conservation of mass and navier stokes equations for a newtonian fluid including phase change by cavitation yields 1 ρ u i x i 1 ρ v 1 ρ l m and 2 ρ u i t u j ρ u i x j p x i x j ν ρ u i x j ρ u j x i τ u i u j x j in these equations u i denotes the velocity

quantities defined according to 3 ρ α v ρ v 1 α v ρ l and ν α v ν v 1 α v ν l α v and m indicate the vapour volume fraction and source term provided by the cavitation model see section 2 2 and τ u i u

kinetic energy δ i j the kronecker delta and s i j the resolved strain rate tensor defined as 5 s i j 1 2 u i x j u j x i to close the set of equations a rans model is used the pans model in this work is based on the k ω sst model pereira et al 2018 menter et al 2003 the transport equations of the sst model are reformulated to include the ratio of modelled to total turbulence kinetic energy and dissipation rate 6 f k k k and f ω ω ω f ϵ f k this leads to the modified transport equations 7 d ρ k d t p k β ρ ω k x j ρ ν ρ ν t σ k f ω f k k x j and 8 d ρ ω d t α ν t p k p p f ω β ω f ω ρ ω x j

2 see menter et al 2003 while for more details on the implementation of the pans model used here the reader is referred to pereira et al 2005 the filtering of the navier stokes equations depends on the values chosen for f k and f ϵ f k determines the physical resolution of the flow i e to what extent the turbulence spectrum is resolved f ϵ determines the overlap between the energy containing and the dissipation ranges following klapwijk et al 2019b f ϵ 1 0 to avoid adding excessive dissipation f k can either vary in space and time or be kept constant in the domain the drawback of the first approach is that this entangles the modelling error and numerical error thereby destroying one of the key advantages of the pans model as shown in klapwijk et al 2019a there is no consensus on what estimate for f k to use and the estimates are unreliable in boundary layers and problematic to apply in combination with inflow turbulence consequently in this work constant a priori chosen values of f k 1 00 0 75 0 50 0 25 and 0 00 are employed by definition pans computations using f k 0 00 are equal to implicit les computations also sometimes referred to as underresolved dns where it is assumed that the added numerical diffusion due to the use of coarse r grids and low order upwinding schemes acts as a sub filter model previous studies in klapwijk et al 2019a showed that the real ratio of modelled to total levels of turbulence solved is lower than the a priori chosen values which is a desirable conservative characteristic of the approach 2 1 synthetic turbulence generator synthetic inflow turbulence is generated using the method developed in klapwijk et al 2020 which is a modified version of the digital filter method by xie and castro 2008 and kim et al 2013 in this method random numbers r m l i with a zero mean and unit variance are generated on a cartesian grid at each time step here m l indicate the position indices and i the velocity component these numbers are spatially correlated using 10 ψ m l i j n n k n n b j b k r m j l k i after which they are temporally correlated with the numbers generated during the previous time step using 11 ψ i t ψ i t δ t exp π δ t 2 t ψ i t 1 exp π δ t 2 t here t l u i is the lagrangian time scale based on the desired integral length scale l b j and b k are filter coefficients used to generate spatial correlations the spatially and temporally correlated numbers are transformed to velocity fluctuations using 12 u i a i j ψ i in which a i j indicates the lund transformation matrix which is based on a cholesky decomposition of the desired reynolds stress tensor τ i j following klapwijk et al 2020 the velocity fluctuations are transformed to body forces term in the momentum equations explicitly added on the right hand side of the equations note that in the current work a string of pseudo random numbers i e the same range of random numbers for every computation is used to compare different computations to improve the iterative convergence a divergence free velocity field is enforced by adding a source term s t g to the mass equation every non linear loop this source term is computed by computing the flux q f c through each face for every cell c of the turbulence generator 13 q f c s u n d s the source term equals a summation of the fluxes over the n f faces 14 s t g c c 1 n f q f c and is added to maintain mass conservation in the cells of the turbulence generator 2 2 cavitation model the multiphase flow is modelled using the homogeneous mixture eulerian volume of fluid approach an additional transport equation is solved for the vapour volume fraction α v v v v v v l with v indicating the phase volume the transport equation is formulated as 15 d α v d t m ρ v from α v the mixture properties can be calculated using eq 3 under the condition that 16 α l α v 1 the source term m is modelled by the schnerr sauer cavitation model schnerr and sauer 2001 hoekstra and vaz 2009 which is based on the linearised rayleigh plesset equation for bubble dynamics and reads 17 m ρ v 4 π r b 2 n b 1 α v 2 3 p v p ρ l if p p v 3 α v r b 2 3 p v p ρ l if p p v the dependence on the local pressure leads to an vastly simplified inception criterion compared to reality but the method is widely applied in literature r b indicates the maximum bubble radius n b the bubble concentration and p v the vapour pressure in the present study the bubble radius and concentration were set to n b 1 1 0 8 and r b 1 1 0 5 respectively based on vaz et al 2017 3 test case and setup 3 1 test case description the delft twist 11 hydrofoil is a naca0009 profile with aspanwise varying angle of attack from 0 at the sides to 11 at midspan mounted with an angle of attack at the wall α w a l l 2 the chord length c 0 15 m and the span s 2 c the spanwise twist is given by foeth et al 2006 foeth 2008 18 α α m a x 2 y c 3 3 y c 2 1 α w a l l the reynolds number is r e u c ν 1 1 0 6 leading to an uniform inflow velocity of u 6 97 m s in cavitating conditions the cavitation number is σ p p v q 1 07 with the dynamic pressure q 1 2 ρ u 2 in the experiments sand roughness with a grain size of 10 4 m was applied at the leading edge at x c 0 04 to force transition to turbulence but also leading to an increase in drag foeth 2008 measured the lift force the pressure at different locations on the suction side and applied particle image velocimetry piv to analyse the developing cavity shape and shedding behaviour the drag was not measured for the lift and pressures the calibration errors of the sensors are reported but no total uncertainties are given regarding the setup an uncertainty of 2 7 is reported for the inflow velocity and 5 for the cavitation number inflow turbulence levels of the cavitation tunnel were 2 3 at the location of the hydrofoil this is higher than the more recent values reported for the same cavitation tunnel by varadharajan 2019 1 5 but those were obtained with a 50 lower mean tunnel velocity from both sources no information is available on the integral length scale which makes matching the experimental setup and quantitative validation difficult for more details the reader is referred to foeth 2008 3 2 literature overview the delft twist 11 hydrofoil is a common test case for investigating the interaction between turbulence and cavitation modelling in cfd in literature a number of different turbulence modelling approaches for this case have been applied such as euler equations koop 2008 schnerr et al 2008 unsteady rans oprea 2013 bensow 2011 ji et al 2014a whitworth 2011 vaz et al 2017 unsteady rans with an ad hoc eddy viscosity correction such as the so called reboud correction reboud et al 1998 bensow 2011 li et al 2010 vaz et al 2017 hong and zhang 2020 reynolds stress models rsm whitworth 2011 les bensow 2011 asnaghi et al 2017 chen et al 2017 ji et al 2013 long et al 2018 lu et al 2010 hybrid models bensow 2011 whitworth 2011 vaz et al 2017 and pans ji et al 2014b the use of unsteady rans typically suppresses the cavity dynamics while les results show a shape and shedding behaviour which is more in agreement with the experiments although the cavity length is underpredicted hybrid models such as des shed less cavity structures due to the sheet cavity being close to the wing surface i e in a rans region the use of the reboud correction leads to increased cavity dynamics and cavity length however its ad hoc empirical nature introduces additional modelling error in the results the pans results reported show a shedding behaviour comparable to experiments however only one ratio of modelled to total turbulent kinetic energy was investigated from literature it is know that the results can vary significantly based on this ratio pereira et al 2018 klapwijk et al 2019a 2020 most investigations oprea 2013 li et al 2010 bensow 2011 whitworth 2011 ji et al 2013 2014a lidtke et al 2016 vaz et al 2017 make use of the schnerr sauer cavitation model which is also employed in the current work an overview of the reported mean lift coefficient c l l q c s and strouhal number s t f c u as function of the number of grid cells n c in cavitating conditions can be found in fig 1 the coefficients are defined using the lift force l and the shedding frequency f and divided by the turbulence model the mean lift coefficient is underpredicted by every simulation found in the open literature which indicates that the cavitation extent is underestimated lidtke et al 2016 a wide variety of grid types and densities is employed in the literature it must be noted that in general the grids are relatively coarse considering the reynolds number with high wall normal resolutions the stream and spanwise resolutions are regularly not reported and the sensitivity of the results towards the grid is often not investigated this leads to few reported uncertainties for integral values as mentioned in the introduction the literature focusses on cavitation conditions nevertheless some results for wetted flow are reported hoekstra et al 2011 lidtke et al 2016 vaz et al 2017 asnaghi et al 2018 these results are mostly limited to the forces and the pressure distribution on the centreline no flow visualizations are given hoekstra et al 2011 do report that within their workshop all participants report an attached boundary layer on the entire foil i e no boundary layer separation is observed on the wing surface see fig 2 for an overview of the reported mean lift c l and drag coefficient c d d q c s as function of the number of grid cells and turbulence model some results match the experimental lift coefficient well however again the spread in results is significant 3 3 numerical setup the computational domain extends two chord lengths upstream of the leading edge and five chord lengths downstream half of the wing is modelled with a symmetry plane at the centre of the wing the use of a symmetry plane in the setup can lead to modelling errors when attempting to resolve turbulence using srs and when adding synthetic turbulence nevertheless it was employed to reduce numerical cost it must be remarked that most results in literature including the les results employ the same simplification the top and bottom of the domain are located one chord length from the wing matching the dimensions of the cavitation tunnel used by foeth et al 2006 the boundaries of the domain are modelled as slip walls whereas on the wing a no slip boundary condition is applied at the inlet an inflow boundary condition is used fixed pressure is defined at the outlet fig 3 shows the wing geometry computational domain and grid topology the boundary conditions at the inlet are a dirichlet condition for all velocity components and turbulence quantities and at the outlet a dirichlet condition for the pressure the wing s surface is modelled as a non slip wall with a symmetry boundary condition at the centre of the wing all other domain boundaries are modelled as slip walls four geometrically similar multi block hexahedral structured grids g 1 g 2 g 3 and g 4 are used but for comparison purposes also an additional grid g 0 is employed this grid is identical to grid g 1 but it includes a local refinement box with dimensions 4 3 c c 2 3 c surrounding the wing in this refinement box the grid is refined by a factor 2 with respect to grid g 1 the average values of the non dimensional wall cell sizes x n x c and x s normal chordwise and spanwise on the suction side centreline of the different grids are given in table 1 due to the 3d geometry and grid topology the averaged values do not give a good indication of the cell distribution over the wing fig 4 shows the x n x c and x s distribution over the chord at the wing centreline on the suction side over the entire wing x n is well below 1 for all grids on the suction side x c reaches high values at the leading edge drops immediately after the leading edge and then increases again it remains relatively constant but decreases again towards the trailing edge finally x s is high at the leading edge and decreases along the wing the values for x s at the wing midspan are lower than the values towards the wall of the cavitation tunnel where α 2 when comparing these resolutions to guidelines from literature for a well resolved les or pans x n 1 50 x c 150 and 15 x s 40 piomelli and balaras 2002 it is clear that in wall normal direction all grids are sufficiently fine grids g 0 and g 1 do comply with the required x c however none of the applied grids reaches the required resolution in spanwise direction due to the computational cost the grids are not refined below these levels for computations with a resolved turbulent inflow the turbulence generator is located at x t g 2 c with respect to the leading edge of the wing which is close to the inflow boundary condition 3 4 solver the numerical solver used for all simulations in this work is refresco vaz et al 2009 a simple based multiphase unsteady incompressible viscous flow solver using rans and srs methods complemented with cavitation models and volume fraction transport equations for different phases the code traditionally focusses strongly on code and solution verification and validation as one can see by several studies klapwijk et al 2020 pereira et al 2018 liebrand et al 2020 vaz et al 2015 lloyd et al 2017 for the current work time integration is performed using a second order implicit three time level scheme the convection terms in the momentum equations are discretised using a second order accurate flux limited quadratic upstream interpolation for convective kinematics quick scheme the turbulence and cavitation equations are discretised using a first order upwind scheme diffusion is central second order accurate and non orthogonality and eccentricity of the grid are considered by extra deferred corrections 4 numerical errors as is generally accepted numerical errors can be divided into input round off iterative discretisation and in the case of unsteady computations statistical errors roache 2009 the round off error is assumed to be negligible due to the use of double precision arithmetic eça and hoekstra 2006 one of the sources of input error are boundary conditions the effect of changing the inflow boundary condition is assessed in section 5 in this section the iterative discretisation and statistical error are assessed the iterative convergence is assessed based on the residuals normalised by the diagonal element of the left hand side matrix of the linear system of equations all wetted flow calculations with steady inflow condition are converged until l is below 10 6 computations with a resolved turbulent inflow are converged until l 2 is below 10 4 and l below 10 2 the largest residuals occur near the turbulence generator and the wing leading edge residuals can be reduced further by increasing the number of outerloops with the exception of the ω equation which stagnates for cavitating computations the l 2 norm is generally in the order of 10 3 while the l norm is in the order of 10 1 for all equations except for the ω equation for this equation the l 2 norm is in the order of 10 3 and the l norm in the order of 1 0 0 1 0 1 the finite length of a cfd simulation introduces a random uncertainty in the mean of the signal to estimate the statistical uncertainty and to remove the start up effect we use the transient scanning technique tst developed by brouwer et al 2015 and applied before in klapwijk et al 2020 for wetted flow cases with a steady inflow or low levels of inflow turbulence intensity i l e 10 the statistical uncertainty for integral quantities is below 1 for higher inflow turbulence intensities i l e 10 it is below 5 for cavitating computations the statistical uncertainty for the mean lift and drag forces is below 3 the discretisation error e d ϕ is estimated using a power series expansion roache 2009 pereira et al 2018 19 e d ϕ ϕ 1 ϕ 0 ϕ i 1 ϕ 1 r i 1 p 1 where ϕ 0 indicates the estimated solution for zero discretisation error and r is the refinement ratio based on 20 r i r h i h 1 with h the cell length based on the data it is not possible to obtain an accurate estimation of p so both a value of 1 0 and 2 0 are used p 1 0 leads to a conservative estimate e d m a x whereas p 2 0 yields a lower value e d m i n 5 wetted flow results this section describes the results for wetted flow simulations i e without cavitation among the results reported are the lift coefficient c l l q c s the drag coefficient c d d q c s the pressure coefficient c p p p q and the streamwise skin friction coefficient c f x τ w x q at the wing midspan the results are compared against experimental results by aït bouziad 2005 designated epfl and against results obtained with the panel code xfoil drela 1989 with xfoil the 2d naca0009 cross section was computed at an angle of attack at the centreline α 9 since the 3d effects due to the twist are not included in xfoil differences in the magnitude of c p are to be expected nevertheless it gives a good indication of the pressure distribution along the chord 5 1 steady inflow condition most of the computations with a steady inflow converge to a steady solution with the exception of flow solutions which show leading edge separation extending along the chord consequently the results in this section are obtained with a larger time step which is kept fixed to δ t u δ t c 6 97 1 0 3 leading to a maximum and average courant number of 48 and 2 3 on the finest grid and 22 and 1 2 on the coarsest grid respectively these large courant numbers were deemed acceptable based on preliminary computations with a smaller timestep which showed the same solutions with a similar iterative convergence fig 5 shows the lift and drag coefficient as a function of the grid refinement h i h 1 and the physical resolution f k together with the discretisation error as error bars the plotted values are also given in the appendix both the lift and drag have a low grid dependency leading to small discretisation errors f k has little influence on the lift coefficient in the range 1 00 0 50 however the lift coefficient suddenly drops by almost 10 for f k 0 25 for f k 0 00 lift increases again we will comment on this later the drag coefficient shows a linear decrease with decreasing f k with the exception for f k 0 25 on the two finest grids and f k 0 00 where the drag suddenly increases a division of the drag into pressure and friction drag shows that the friction drags linearly decreases with f k however for f k 0 00 and 0 25 on the fine grids the pressure drag doubles due to flow separation occurring at the leading edge as will be explained later based on flow visualizations the effect of reducing f k is visualized in fig 6 by showing the time averaged streamwise skin friction coefficient limiting streamlines and time averaged normalized streamwise velocity u u with a reduction in f k the streamwise skin friction decreases for f k 0 25 the flow starts to change depending on the grid resolution two solution regimes are predicted for the coarser grids g 3 and g 4 turbulent separation is observed in the streamlines near the trailing edge along the entire span of the wing along the spanwise position the angle of attack varies the separation region moves towards the leading edge with increasing angle of attack this is accompanied by a negative friction coefficient on the wing surface indicating recirculating flow over the wing on the finer grids g 1 and g 2 the separation location moves further upstream and the flow exhibits laminar separation close to the leading edge the flow solution is now also unsteady which together with the separation at the leading edge is a clear indication of a stall condition after the laminar separation bubble the flow periodically detaches and reattaches leading to a time averaged positive skin friction which increases the pressure drag as observed in fig 5 the grid sensitivity of the flow separation is likely related to the x c resolution behind the leading edge see fig 4 while it is low at the leading edge on grids g 3 and g 4 it more than doubles over a chordwise distance of c 30 thereby suppressing the flow separation on the finer grids x c still increases but the increase is less drastic allowing the grid to resolve the flow separation the results for f k 0 00 show this stall condition on all grids due to the absence of a turbulence model the flow instability is not suppressed by any eddy viscosity again the time averaged skin friction is positive behind the separation bubble at the leading edge leading to an increased pressure drag for this f k value the largest differences occur more towards the tunnel side wall where the angle of attack is lower on the coarse grid there is a large region with negative friction which decreases in size on the finer grids to quantify the differences in time averaged skin friction coefficient fig 7 shows c f x at the wing centreline c f x decreases with decreasing f k for f k 1 00 c f x is close to the xfoil prediction the deviation in slope is likely related to 3d effects which are not included in the xfoil prediction the trend remains the same in the range 0 5 f k 1 0 only the magnitude varies for f k 0 25 on the coarse grids c f x shows a trough for 0 05 x c 0 1 after which it increases until x c 0 2 and then decreases again until it becomes negative for x c 0 4 on these coarser grids the low c f values are likely related to an absence of transition i e the flow remains laminar along the chord on the finer grids the flow separates at the leading edge so c f x shows a peak at x c 0 05 after which it becomes negative until x c 0 4 and then remains positive until the trailing edge the leading edge separation induces transition at x c 0 4 leading to a higher c f than observed for f k 0 25 on the coarser grids fig 6 already showed that this pattern varies significantly along the span of the wing finally for f k 0 00 the pattern is similar on all grids there is a large separation region at the leading edge inducing transition c f x on the fine grids g 2 and g 1 equals the c f x predicted by f k 0 25 which is in line with the earlier visual observations the pressure distribution at the wing surface is less affected by the flow pattern as shown in fig 8 the different computations show little difference with the exception of the f k 0 00 and 0 25 on grids g 2 and g 1 which is of course directly linked to the unsteady flow separation the other computations predict similar c p distributions but for f k 0 25 c p is slightly lower in the range 0 2 x c 0 7 and higher for x c 0 7 two observations can now be made firstly both c f x and c d are strongly affected by f k and vary for each f k value while c p and c l show two sets of solutions based on f k being above or below a certain threshold secondly in the range x c 0 4 c p does not depend on f k which is favourable for cavitation inception predictions the cavitation behaviour and attached sheet cavity extent will be insensitive to f k and consequently to the lack of inflow turbulence what happens when we reduce f k the change in the flow is related to changes in the turbulence intensity both modelled and resolved due to the reduction of f k the effect of modelled turbulence is reduced while due to the steady inflow boundary condition the resolved flow is laminar i e the resolved turbulence intensity is zero this is clearly visible in fig 9 which shows k ω and ν t ν between the location where we will later insert resolved inflow turbulence and the leading edge both k and ω decrease downstream but since ν t ν depends on the ratio of k and ω eq 9 ν t ν is relatively constant along the streamwise direction however with decreasing f k ν t ν decreases leading to the flow becoming laminar with decreasing f k note that for f k 0 00 ν t ν 0 by definition due to low inflow turbulence level bypass transition on the wing surface is delayed and the flow separates at the trailing edge for even lower f k the flow becomes completely laminar and separates at the leading edge this was already observed by foeth 2008 who recognised that for the limited reynolds numbers typical for model scale hydrofoils transition to turbulence does not occur at the leading edge unless the boundary layer is locally disturbed hence the application of surface roughness in the experiments it is known from literature that laminar boundary layers separate earlier than turbulent boundary layers rist and augustin 2006 the occurrence of turbulent trailing edge separation leads to the decrease in lift coefficient and the decrease in drag coefficient is proportional to the reduction in skin friction due to the laminar boundary layer along the chord with leading edge separation the lift and drag coefficient increase again due to a different pressure distribution unsteady structures can be observed e g based on the q criterion potentially leading to a wrong conclusion that the approach is resolving a turbulent boundary layer up to now with the exception of the work by foeth 2008 who employed surface roughness separation has not been reported in literature for this test case a number of reasons can be identified to explain this simulations using rans or hybrid models do not show flow separation due to the inherent assumptions employed in rans in the boundary layer leading to transition to turbulent flow at the leading edge for srs results such as les and pans it is shown that for intermediate f k values such as 0 25 the behaviour is grid sensitive and only occurs on fine grids the literature overview in figs 1 and 2 showed that most les results reported in literature are obtained using coarser grids than the ones here thereby potentially hiding this behaviour it must also be remarked that most investigations in literature focus on cavitation dynamics however due to the nature of the test case when cavitation is included this separation is again masked since due to the cavitation inception criterion used in cfd the sheet cavity occurs at the same location as the flow separation at the leading edge the use of xfoil further confirms the hypothesis that the leading edge separation with a laminar inflow is physical when using a turbulent inflow similar c f x and c p distributions are found however when reducing the inflow turbulence when moving from what is known in xfoil as a dirty towards a clean wind tunnel the solution becomes more and more difficult to converge again pointing to unsteady flow separation at the leading edge to ensure that further grid refinement does not yield different flow behaviour additional f k 0 25 and 0 00 computations were performed on a grid with a local refinement box surrounding the wing grid g 0 the integral values are c l 0 35 and 0 42 c d 1 0 2 1 00 and 0 85 for f k 0 25 and 0 00 respectively the drag appears to continue to increase with increasing simulation time fig 10 shows c f x and c p at the midspan along with a flow visualization for f k 0 00 for this additionally refined grid the wing does not show such a large region of recirculating flow at the leading edge as for grid g 1 leading to a pressure distribution closer matching the experiments at a first glance it appears that refining the grid to this level solves the problems observed previously in this section however investigation of c f shows that leading edge separation still occurs the difference is that here c f becomes positive again at x c 0 1 after which it remains positive until close towards the trailing edge on grid g 1 c f also seemed to recover at x c 0 07 but then decreases again and does not become positive until x c 0 4 the increased grid resolution decreases the leading edge separation and therefore leads to a reasonable prediction of the drag the lift however is even lower than for the pans results on coarser grids potentially the leading edge separation is reduced even more on a further refined grid however it is important to realise that this grid is already refined to a level which is currently unaffordable for industrially oriented cases this grid is significantly finer than les grids employed in the literature for this test case to summarise it is clear that flow predictions with srs with a steady inflow do not match experimental conditions but it could be argued that this would have little effect on cavitation predictions due to the inception criterion used in cfd c p does not vary so the inception behaviour will be the same however we emphasize that the laminarization of the flow is a problem as also known from literature tabor and baba ahmadi 2010 klapwijk et al 2020 firstly c p does change towards the trailing edge potentially affecting the development and dynamics of shed cavities secondly the integral quantities lift and drag differ significantly from experiments making validation impossible it is interesting to note that the lift decreases with f k away from the experimental value with the exception of f k 0 00 which gives higher values than f k 1 00 from this the incorrect conclusion could be made that f k 0 00 also known as implicit les does not suffer from these problems and yields the best match for experimental values nevertheless as shown c d c f x and c p are different and in fact the entire flow changes from a steady attached flow to an unsteady flow separating at the leading edge indeed the lift is better predicted but for the wrong reasons instead it is necessary to introduce synthetic inflow turbulence to obtain a turbulent boundary layer from the leading edge onwards to better match the experimental results 5 2 resolved turbulent inflow condition to trigger the flow to become turbulent and suppress unphysical separation synthetic turbulence is added at the inflow the need for such boundary conditions is well known for les and pans tabor and baba ahmadi 2010 klapwijk et al 2020 however les results in the open literature for this specific test case do not employ such methods the turbulence generator is located at x t g 2 c with turbulent fluctuations inserted in a plane perpendicular to the flow with dimensions c c and a thickness in primary flow direction of c 15 which corresponds to 2 3 cells in streamwise direction a number of conditions with varying levels of turbulence intensity and integral length scale are investigated the settings at the location of the turbulence generator are summarized in table 2 the decay in turbulence kinetic energy is compared to the slope of theoretical decay of isotropic homogeneous turbulence comte bellot and corrsin 1966 21 u i u i u 2 x x t g l n in this equation x indicates the measurement location and n is approximately equal to 1 27 based on experiments table 2 also shows the turbulence intensity i 2 3 k u u i u i u expected at the leading edge based on the theoretical decay for case a and c the turbulence intensity is comparable to the experimental setup no integral length scale was reported for the experiments from a theoretical perspective it is incorrect to insert velocity fluctuations in a computation with f k 1 00 since for such a f k value all turbulence should be modelled in this work it is still done to investigate the trends due to the use of pseudo random numbers the curves for the different computations overlap the time step for these computations is kept fixed to δ t u δ t c 6 97 1 0 4 with maximum courant numbers of approximately 5 occurring close to the leading edge in the remainder of the domain the courant number is well below 1 the l 2 norms of the residuals are o 1 0 4 o 1 0 6 o 1 0 7 and o 1 0 7 for momentum pressure turbulence kinetic energy and dissipation respectively of these equations only the ω equation stagnates the other equations keep on converging and decrease at least one order of magnitude during a time step the l norms for the same equations are o 1 0 2 o 1 0 3 o 1 0 4 and o 1 0 3 the largest residuals occur in the cells where the turbulence generator is located during the computation the flow passes the chord seven times with averaging applied during the final four time units t w f c u leading to a maximum statistical error of 5 which occurs for the case with highest inflow turbulence intensity first cases a and b are compared on all grids with 0 0 f k 1 0 the streamwise development of the synthetic isotropic turbulence between the generator and the leading edge is shown for f k 0 25 in fig 11 the reynolds stresses decrease around two orders of magnitude on the coarse grid while on the fine grid the decrease is about one order of magnitude which is comparable to eq 21 an initially surprising observation is that the decay of resolved turbulence is almost insensitive to the f k value not shown in the graph suggesting no effect of the chosen f k on the computations however the statistical representation of turbulence the rans contribution does vary with f k a higher f k leads to a higher eddy viscosity as observed earlier on finer grids the eddy viscosity levels also increase these results in combination with results from literature pereira et al 2005 klapwijk et al 2020 suggest that while the selected value of f k strongly affects the production of modelled turbulence it does not affect the decay of resolved turbulence in this streamwise range while this might seem counterintuitive it can be explained from the equations which are being solved the filtered navier stokes equations are independent of f k f k only affects the turbulence transport equations for k and ω due to the formulation of the turbulence generator fluctuations are introduced regardless of f k which can lead to the unphysical combination of f k 1 00 i e rans with resolved turbulent fluctuations after their addition to the flow the development of the fluctuations is described by the navier stokes equations the difference between computations with different f k values is the level of ν t ν however in this short range the effect of the increased eddy viscosity is too small to significantly dampen the velocity fluctuations and therefore the decay of resolved turbulence is comparable a similar observation was made when using synthetic turbulence for a channel flow in klapwijk et al 2020 close to the turbulence generator the solutions for different f k values are comparable and velocity fluctuations are being dampened only further downstream the comparable decay is also an indication that the grids are fine enough to not add excessive diffusion in figs 12 and 13 the flow is visualized using the time averaged streamwise velocity and friction coefficient at the wing surface for different f k values on grids g 4 and g 1 the visualization shows that while the flow at the surface is affected by the inflow turbulence for f k 0 25 a region of separated flow still occurs near the trailing edge the size of the separated flow region is reduced compared to the results obtained with a steady inflow especially on the finer grid the separation is also smaller for case b than for case a when f k 0 00 the region of separation is larger especially on the coarser grid this is an indication of the increased grid sensitivity of iles due to the absence of a sub filter model note that for both these levels of inflow turbulence for all f k values the large flow separation at the leading edge as observed for low f k values without inflow turbulence fig 6 disappears the effect on the skin friction coefficient is further analysed in fig 14 by plotting c f x versus x c at midspan for varying f k for the two cases a comparison with the steady inflow results shows that c f x increases with the addition of inflow turbulence an increase in r e i i also leads to an increase in c f x independent of f k used in the computation as expected f k 1 00 gives a rans distribution where c f x has a peak at the leading edge and then decreases along the chord while remaining positive the magnitude is comparable to the xfoil prediction with decreasing f k the magnitude of c f x decreases along the chord for f k 0 50 there is a slight kink at x c 0 1 but the profile remains similar to the rans results however the result for f k 0 25 clearly shows not only a much lower c f x but also drops after the leading edge to a negative value after which it increases again to a constant value along the wing this shows that the flow is still laminar at the leading edge but transitions to turbulent flow at x c 0 1 indicating that the inflow turbulence is not sufficient to trigger a turbulent flow at the leading edge for case a it can also be observed that for x c 0 9 c f x still becomes negative indicating turbulent flow separation it is noteworthy that on finer grids c f x always increases independent of f k for f k 0 25 this has the effect that while still present the separation region at the trailing edge is reduced as was observed previously in fig 12 on the coarse grid c f x for f k 0 00 remains close to zero for both cases indicating that transition does not occur and that the flow remains laminar on the finer grid it increases but remains close to zero along the chord when comparing case b to case a we can see that the increase in inflow turbulence leads to an increase in c f x along the chord for all f k values except for f k 0 00 on the coarse grid for case b on the coarse grid there is still a small region where c f x 0 close to the leading edge while on the fine grid c f x remains positive along the wing the effect on the pressure coefficient is limited and is therefore not shown there is no difference between different f k values except at the trailing edge x c 0 9 in the location of turbulent flow separation as expected this difference is larger on the coarse grid g 4 and larger for case a than for case b for case a there is a still a difference between f k 0 25 and 0 00 and the other f k values on the finest grid for case b there is no longer an observable difference between the different f k values on the finest grid the effect on the integral quantities is presented in fig 15 where the time averaged lift and drag coefficient are given as a function of the grid refinement and f k the predicted trend for the lift for case a is similar to what was observed without inflow turbulence fig 5 there is a sudden decrease in c l for f k 0 25 but the predicted lift by f k 0 00 is again approximately 5 larger than for f k 1 00 which is caused by a higher pressure on the pressure side of the wing between the leading edge and midchord close to the tunnel wall for case b the decrease at f k 0 25 is smaller and c l is more constant across the f k range especially on the finest grid the addition of inflow turbulence leads to a temporally varying lift coefficient since now the effective angle of attack varies in time as expected the standard deviation σ c l for case b is larger than for case a due to the higher turbulence intensity for case a σ c l 1 0 3 6 while for case b σ c l 1 0 3 23 for the drag coefficient in both cases a and b the trend is the same as for the case with a steady inflow c d decreases with decreasing f k for both cases c d increases across the f k range compared to the steady inflow and c f x for case b is larger than for case a again the standard deviation in the drag coefficient is larger for case b than for case a i e σ c d 1 0 3 1 3 versus σ c d 1 0 3 0 4 it is again emphasized that while iles f k 0 00 theoretically should involve the least modelling of turbulence it is not the best approach it does yield the highest lift coefficient but at the same time the predicted drag force is lower than all other results the skin friction shows that the flow is still laminar but due to the now absent leading edge separation the lift coefficient is reduced compared to the results with steady inflow the use of a different convection scheme in the momentum equation might improve these results it is known from literature that iles requires a convection scheme which adds enough dissipation to act as a sub filter model in the current work quick is used which might not fulfil that requirement by either adding too much or not sufficient dissipation an investigation into different convection schemes is outside of the scope of the current work the difficulties in predicting integral quantities do indicate that the use of iles is rather sensitive to the setup next to the entanglement of modelling and discretisation errors which is inherent to the method klapwijk et al 2020 consequently in the remainder of this work f k 0 25 is employed 5 3 increasing l versus i l e when varying both l and i l e systematically cases a b c and d a distinction can be made between the effect of l versus i l e these variations are only investigated for f k 0 25 on the finest grid since here the largest difference between results from cases with and without inflow turbulence occur varying l has almost no effect on the time averaged lift and drag coefficient however with a smaller integral length scale the standard deviation of the signal increases see table 3 increasing i l e leads to an increase of 5 10 in time averaged quantities as expected the increase in standard deviation is again significantly larger between 2 and 3 times larger the streamwise decay of i l e not shown is as expected comparable for all computations but varies in magnitude depending on the inflow i l e the flow visualization in fig 16 is in line with previous results modifying l shows only small differences while increasing i l e decreases the size of separation region at the trailing edge this is also clearly visible in fig 17 where c f x increases with i l e it is important to realise that the location of transition is not affected by the settings of the turbulence generator only the magnitude of the skin friction for i l e 2 0 there is only a difference between l c 0 013 and 0 033 near the trailing edge whereas for i l e 6 3 l c 0 013 yields a higher skin friction along the chord the increase in c f x manifests itself already at the leading edge all computations show a trough at x c 0 05 but the minimum c f x varies for i l e 2 0 for both integral length scales min c f x 1 0 3 1 indicating locally recirculating flow the lack of difference between the two integral values indicates that while the inflow turbulence intensity is high enough to prevent leading edge separation on the wing due to the turbulence decay it is too low at the leading edge to further affect the boundary layer flow when the inflow turbulence intensity is increased to i l e 6 3 min c f x increases when l c 0 033 the minimum is close to 0 while for the smaller integral length scale the minimum is approximately 1 here the inflow turbulence intensity does affect the boundary layer flow the smaller integral length is closer in magnitude to the turbulent length scales occurring closer to the wing surface leading to an increasingly turbulent boundary layer and therefore increased skin friction for the pressure distribution again no differences are observed except near the trailing edge these observations imply that a sufficiently small integral length scale can trigger transition directly at the leading edge similarly to roughness applied to the wing however such a small length scale must be supported by the grid to be convected from the turbulence generator until the leading edge and enter the boundary layer due to the employed grid resolutions in this work no integral length scales below l c 0 013 are investigated for the remainder of this work this smaller length scale is employed 5 4 the effect of increasing inflow turbulence intensity to investigate the effect of increasing the inflow turbulence intensity cases b c e f g and h are compared the integral length scale is kept fixed to l c 0 013 and only grid g 1 with f k 0 25 is investigated the streamwise development of r e i i follows the theoretical decay for all cases and an increase in r e i i also leads to an increase in ν t ν the effect on the integral quantities is shown in fig 18 both the time averaged lift and drag increase with increasing inflow turbulence and both quantities increase by approximately 10 between the lowest and the highest inflow turbulence levels however the difference between a rans solution and a srs solution without inflow turbulence is much larger for the drag than for the lift as seen in previous sections so while the increase in inflow turbulence results in a lift force which is comparable to the rans solution the drag force is still significantly underpredicted note also that for both lift and drag the increase with increasing i l e seems to converge meaning even higher inflow turbulence intensities will likely not result in a significantly higher mean force value note that for i l e 15 5 u i u i u 2 t g 0 60 which is very high but it is employed for the sake of completeness the standard deviation of the signal has not converged furthermore the large value for c d at i l e 0 0 is caused by the separation at the leading edge so this should not be interpreted as the correct result finally the effect of increasing inflow turbulence intensity on c f x and c p is investigated in fig 19 the c f x profiles show a small separation at the leading edge for non zero u i u i u 2 leading to transition this transition location does not vary with the inflow turbulence intensity although an increase in i l e does lead to an increase in skin friction along the wing which is also observed in rans computations in literature lopes et al 2020 for c f x the results with the highest i l e seem to converge indicating a limit to the skin friction which can be obtained using the turbulence generator on this grid with this value for the integral length scale the minimum value of c f x at x c 0 05 also increases until a limit is reached at approximately c f x 1 0 3 1 1 a consequence of the increasing inflow turbulence intensity is a change of the slope of c f x in the range 0 1 x c 0 7 the peak at x c 0 1 reaches a maximum for i l e 6 3 after which it decreases again while at x c 0 7 the c f x keeps increasing with increasing i l e finally again for c p there is little difference between the computations with inflow turbulence 5 5 conclusions based on wetted flow computations with inflow turbulence based on these comparisons the use of synthetic turbulence at the inflow can suppress the large leading edge separation as observed for pans with a low f k value and usual steady inflow conditions provided that the grid can support the selected integral length scale a decrease in integral length scales increases the skin friction the effect of varying i l e is larger no inflow turbulence leads to either a large leading edge separation zone or a laminar flow along the wing a small amount of inflow turbulence already suppresses the leading edge separation and leads to a small separation at the leading edge inducing transition to increase the lift and drag coefficient higher inflow turbulence intensities are required c f x shows that even with the highest levels of turbulence attempted in this work still laminar to turbulent transition is visible downstream of the leading edge to trigger transition further towards the leading edge the integral length scale should be reduced this does require the grids to be refined further due to the computational costs this was not attempted in the current work the application of inflow turbulence does also decrease the turbulent separation region at the trailing edge however it was not completely removed separation at the trailing edge is never mentioned in literature however there is an indication that this phenomenon was also present in the experiments when we compare one of the few reported wetted flow velocity fields obtained with piv by foeth 2008 with the current computations using the same colour scale it becomes clear that the turbulent separation at the leading edge also occurred in the experiments fig 20 shows the same wavy region of low velocity at the trailing edge although the velocity scale prohibits the observation of negative velocities at the trailing edge this implies that turbulent separation at the trailing edge is a feature of this test case and we should not aim to attempt to remove this by increasing the inflow turbulence intensity c p is only affected near the trailing edge closer to the leading edge it matches the limited experimental data well this indicates that the presence of synthetic turbulence should have little effect on cavitation inception this will be investigated in the next section this does not mean that cavitation is not affected at all the presence of resolved turbulence in the flow can potentially disturb the formed cavity leading to additional dynamics varying wing loading or noise together with the ability to tune the turbulence inflow statistics the procedure here used is a promising method to compute noise due to cavitation dynamics or dynamically varying blade loading for cavitating or non cavitating propellers in a non uniform wake field 6 cavitating results the final investigation in this work concerns the application of inflow turbulence to a case with cavitation thus far in literature pans is rarely combined with multi phase flows a notable exception being the work by ji et al 2014b however this work focusses on analysing the cavity dynamics only a single f k is attempted with a steady inflow and the associated modelling errors are not investigated to the knowledge of the authors the combination of cavitation with inflow turbulence has not been attempted before the computations are compared against numerical results obtained with ddes and iddes and against experimental results by aït bouziad 2005 and foeth 2008 designated epfl and delft respectively in the computations we match the cavitation number σ 1 07 while the settings for the inflow turbulence correspond to case b of the wetted flow computations meaning l c 0 013 and i l e 6 3 the turbulence intensity is comparable to the experiments for this level of inflow turbulence the lift coefficient is relatively insensitive to the selected f k value the relatively low turbulence intensities limit the risk of numerical instabilities when cavitation modelling is included higher inflow turbulence intensities lead to improved drag predictions but in cavitating computations can also lead to increased computational instability due to the combination of shedding sheet cavitation and inflow turbulence the integral length scale in the experiments is unknown the currently employed value is selected based on numerical reasons the courant number is well below 1 with the exception of some cells at the trailing edge where a maximum value of 4 is reached the computations are started from a wetted flow computation with cavitation introduced over a period corresponding to around 0 5 shedding cycles based on the tst it is found that the first five shedding cycles must be removed to eliminate the start up effects computations are then continued for an additional six cycles in the stationary range reducing the statistical uncertainty for the mean lift and drag forces below 3 a shedding cycle t s is 1 s t larger than the wetted flow time unit so t s t w f s t the normalised residuals reach at least 10 3 for l 2 for all equations the l norms are higher and occur near the leading edge fig 21 shows the developed time signal and power spectral density psd of the lift coefficient and vapour volume compared with ddes and iddes results following removal of the start up effects as discussed in section 4 the psd is computed using the pwelch algorithm and applying a hann window with 50 overlap resulting in averaging over 6 segments note the significantly larger variations in v v for iddes the psds for the pans computations show no clear dominant shedding frequency due to the windowing but show that the resolved turbulent inflow leads to a higher psd at higher frequencies the integral values can be found in table 4 as for wetted flow the application of a resolved turbulent inflow condition increases the lift for the pans computations c l is below the lift predicted by the hybrid models ddes and iddes when comparing to experiments all models underpredict the lift fig 1 already showed that this is common in literature indicating that the discrepancy might also be attributed to unknown experimental uncertainty it is remarkable that the fluctuations in lift are also significantly smaller for pans than for the hybrid models we will comment on this later note that the standard deviation of the lift coefficient is an order of magnitude larger than for the wetted flow computations section 5 indicating that the fluctuations in the lift due to the inflow turbulence are negligible compared to the cavitation induced fluctuations unsurprisingly the predicted drag is higher for all models which employ rans close the wall the fluctuations in drag however are comparable for all models for pans the standard deviation of the drag has increased by a factor 2 compared to wetted flow again indicating that the fluctuations due to cavitation are dominant this is confirmed by the observation that the standard deviation for a steady inflow condition is slightly higher than for a resolved turbulent inflow the average vapour volume increases for pans when the resolved turbulent inflow condition is employed but the mean and standard deviation of the vapour volume remain below the predictions done by ddes and iddes finally the strouhal number is computed from a single segment psd of the lift coefficient and vapour volume to emphasize the lower frequencies of the shedding sheet cavity not shown in the paper for pans without inflow turbulence s t v v is larger than s t c l implying different mechanisms are responsible for the vapour and lift fluctuations respectively and indicating additional dynamics in the sheet cavity for pans with a resolved inflow the shedding frequency halves although it must be remarked that this shedding frequency is difficult to discern fig 22 shows both the instantaneous and time averaged streamwise skin friction and velocity at the centreline for both cases with pans the trailing edge separation can still be observed towards the tunnel wall where the angle of attack is smaller but in the regions downstream of the sheet cavity it is absent the size decreases again when inflow turbulence is added an interesting observation is that the low momentum inside the cavity leads to a time averaged velocity field which looks similar to the time averaged velocity field for wetted flow with low f k without inflow turbulence i e when flow separation occurs at the leading edge see fig 6 in this case the presence of cavitation masks the leading edge separation which was observed in the wetted flow computation similar observations can be made from the time averaged skin friction and pressure coefficients at midspan see fig 23 the skin friction coefficient is based on the density of the liquid to enable comparing to the wetted flow results again the similarity with wetted flow cases without inflow turbulence is clear in the shape of c f x compare for example figs 23 and 7 the application of inflow turbulence leads to a higher c f x in the range x c 0 5 but towards the leading edge in the cavitation region little differences occur this is not surprising since in this region the local flow is dominated by the presence of the low momentum fluid inside the cavity in the range 0 25 x c 0 35 the steady inflow results show more re circulation than the resolved turbulent inflow results indicating that the application of inflow turbulence affects the boundary layer in the region where the cavity is periodically being shed the time averaged pressure coefficient clearly shows the presence of cavitation compared to the results obtained for wetted flow at the leading edge the pressure coefficient shows the suction peak due to the presence of a stagnation point the magnitude of this peak depends on the value of n 0 chosen in the schnerr sauer cavitation model but does not affect the dynamic cavitation behaviour vaz et al 2017 downstream of the suction peak the pressure coefficient has a constant value approximately equal to the cavitation number until x c 0 3 the length of this horizontal plateau indicates the mean length of the cavity when comparing to the experimental results the cavity length is underpredicted by all numerical approaches the application of a resolved turbulent inflow has little effect on the mean cavity length however the mean cavity length predicted by pans is lower than the cavity length predicted by ddes or iddes related to the higher shedding frequency this also explains the lower predicted vapour volume again note the similarity between c p for cavitating conditions with the laminar wetted flow condition on grid g 1 which also exhibits a horizontal plateau at c p 1 1 in the range 0 x c 0 2 see fig 8 the effect of the resolved turbulent inflow is most visible in the standard deviation of the streamwise skin friction and pressure coefficients near the leading edge for the skin friction in the region x c 0 2 the standard deviation fluctuates but is at some points almost 30 higher while the standard deviation of the pressure coefficient increases almost 50 in the same region along the remainder of the chord the standard deviation for both pans computations is similar and in magnitude σ c p is comparable to the results obtained with ddes and iddes however the chordwise variation is sensitive to the model choice for iddes two clear peaks can be observed the largest is related to the varying length of the sheet while the peak at the leading edge is due to the cavity detaching from the leading edge and growing again a somewhat similar behaviour is observed for pans with a steady inflow however for the resolved turbulent inflow σ c p reduces at the leading edge indicating a different shedding behaviour instead of the periodically growing and detaching cavity as observed in experiments and obtained with iddes for pans only parts of the sheet are shed similar to what was observed for ddes vaz et al 2017 for pans this happens at a higher shedding frequency leading to a lower standard deviation of the lift coefficient and a lower time averaged vapour volume 7 discussion in this work a synthetic turbulence generator is used to reduce the modelling errors in srs incurred by using a steady rans like inflow both in wetted and cavitating conditions for the test case considered when applying f k 0 5 it is necessary to insert turbulent fluctuations upstream of the wing in order to obtain a flow field predicted by srs which is close to the experimentally observed flow field since lowering f k reduces the amount of modelled inflow turbulence this must be replaced by resolved turbulence in order to maintain a physically correct flow field approaching the object of interest when a steady inflow is applied the flow around the object remains laminar along most or all of the chord and for certain combinations of sufficiently fine grid resolution and low f k separates already at the leading edge flow separation was not previously reported for numerical results found in literature although an indication of this phenomenon can be found in the experimental work by foeth 2008 the reasons for this oversight vary the results obtained with rans or hybrid models do not exhibit flow separation due to the rans assumption of a fully developed turbulent boundary layer the les results reported in literature also did not exhibit this although this could be related to the employed grid resolution at the wall not just in wall normal direction but also in the directions parallel to the wall which is in literature much coarser than the ones here used we observed in the current work that the inclusion of cavitation in the computation tends to mask the leading edge separation which is likely also the case for the les results from literature using synthetic inflow turbulence transition is triggered closer to the leading edge resulting in turbulent flow along the wing thereby avoiding laminar flow separation this behaviour is reminiscent of the application of vortex generators on aerofoils where the vortex generators energize the boundary layer thereby improving the stall behaviour by preventing leading edge separation clancy 2006 rist and augustin 2006 sreejith and sathyabhama 2018 the turbulent flow separation at the trailing edge seen in certain simulations is however thought to be physically correct since this was also observable in the experiments it is noted that the sensitivity to inflow turbulence quantities for srs is analogous to what is commonly observed when using rans with transition models where modest differences in inflow turbulence intensity can dramatically affect boundary layer development see e g liebrand et al 2019 2020 lopes et al 2020 an alternative approach for obtaining a turbulent boundary layer in the simulations is to trip the boundary layer close to the leading edge this is commonly applied for measurements of turbulent boundary layers performed at moderate reynolds numbers 1 0 4 1 0 5 or for flow control purposes in order to reduce the size of laminar separation bubbles and reduce the associated drag applications include aircraft wings wind turbines or blades of turbomachinery rist and augustin 2006 sreejith and sathyabhama 2018 the sand grain roughness applied in the experiments of the present test case could be reproduced numerically in a number of ways by geometrically resolving the roughness asnaghi and bensow 2020 applying a simplified trip in the geometry e g sreejith and sathyabhama 2018 winkler et al 2020 or by adding wall normal velocity fluctuations e g rist and augustin 2006 schlatter and örlü 2012 wolf et al 2012 an advantage of a trip is that there is no need to tune the turbulence generator to obtain a turbulent boundary layer nevertheless there are several challenges involved in applying this type of approach geometrically resolved sand grain roughness is far from standard practice in cfd and will in any case only quantitatively agree with what is used in experiments while wall normal velocity fluctuations and a trip despite the much simpler geometry must also be tuned to obtain a flow disturbance equivalent to the roughness applied in the experiments wall normal velocity fluctuations could also have a detrimental effect on iterative convergence although these approaches do reduce the need for a refined grid upstream of the object leading to slightly reduced numerical cost per simulation the required modification to the grid makes it a less general methodology which is more difficult to apply across a range of test cases or operating conditions sreejith and sathyabhama 2018 in real life engineering applications it can be expected that inflow turbulence is present consequently the use of a steady inflow in combination with srs always introduces a certain level of modelling error when trips are used there is also the risk that a too thick turbulent boundary layer develops which may affect the flow prediction downstream it can also introduce a pressure jump sreejith and sathyabhama 2018 which can have implications for numerical cavitation inception which is typically based on the simplified criterion c p σ therefore when the development of a turbulent boundary layer is the primary goal applying leading edge roughness is probably the better approach however should the focus of simulations be more on large scale dynamics such as noise generation of propellers due to inflow turbulence lloyd et al 2014 or cavitation dynamics the development of the boundary layer is of less importance compared to the interaction of turbulence with the leading edge in such cases the inflow turbulence generator is the more appropriate choice it was shown in this work that despite specifying unphysically high inflow turbulence intensities in the simulations significantly higher than the reported 2 3 in the experiments it was not possible to obtain transition directly at the leading edge since the inflow turbulence fluctuations do not enter the boundary layer due to insufficient spanwise grid resolution this agrees with the findings of tangermann and klein 2020 who studied the effect of inflow turbulence for a naca profile at moderate angle of attack using ddes while using inflow turbulence with similar l c to that used in the present work they observed that smaller integral length scales are needed to enter the boundary layer and cause transition while larger length scales mainly affect loading as they induce angle of attack fluctuations however to be able to properly resolve a fully turbulent boundary layer from the leading edge onwards the grid resolution has to be increased by several orders of magnitude to support these smaller length scales as well as the transition process they initiate the lack of resolution leads to a limit in skin friction for computations with low f k values the skin friction remains significantly lower than the results with higher f k values it is noted however that when applying a trip it might also be difficult to numerically reproduce the transition behaviour behind the trip due to the fine grid resolution required as already mentioned in the introduction the delft twist 11 hydrofoil was used as a test case representative of a simplified propeller the results in this work indicated that the fundamental shedding frequency of the sheet cavity was not affected by the synthetic inflow turbulence for a propeller operating in a wake field this finding likely holds since the dynamics of a sheet cavity at the blade passage frequency are governed by the rotation of the blade in a non uniform mean velocity field although cavity shedding and higher frequency dynamics are expected to be somewhat sensitive to inflow turbulence simulating a non uniform wake field in srs leads to the additional requirement of specifying inhomogeneous anisotropic inflow turbulence this is already possible using the current methodology klapwijk et al 2020 making the extension to engineering applications feasible the current setup is also well suited to investigate tip vortex cavitation dynamics for wings or propellers where the inflow turbulence can perturb the cavitating vortex bosschers 2018 using this approach underwater radiated noise could also be assessed 8 conclusion the delft twist 11 hydrofoil was evaluated in wetted and cavitating flow conditions using the pans methodology with a varying ratio of modelled to total kinetic energy on different grids and using both a steady and a resolved turbulent inflow it was shown that modelling errors can occur when applying a steady inflow condition as used for rans due to the flow around the object remaining laminar this leads to underpredicted lift and drag forces making validation impossible depending on the grid resolution the wing can even exhibit laminar leading edge separation i e stall when employing a resolved turbulent inflow where homogeneous isotropic turbulence is inserted into the flow the leading edge separation disappears regardless of the chosen input values for the turbulence generator the region of trailing edge separation is reduced by increasing the inflow turbulence intensity which also increases the skin friction along the wing the separation at the trailing edge is also observed in the experimental results meaning that although this was not reported previously we do obtain a proper match with the experimental flow field increasing the inflow turbulence intensity also increases the mean lift and drag force though only till a certain limit the fluctuations in lift and drag keep increasing an important observation is that the inflow turbulence has almost no effect on the pressure distribution this implies that inception remains unaffected when using the in cfd commonly applied cavitation inception criterion varying the integral length scale has less effect on the flow separation when using a resolved turbulent inflow it is necessary that srs grids are refined upstream to support the convection and development of inflow turbulence for cavitating conditions the variations in lift and drag due to inflow turbulence are significantly smaller than the fluctuations due to the shedding sheet cavity the addition of inflow turbulence does affect the shedding behaviour smaller parts of the sheet cavity are being shed at a higher frequency the predicted mean lift and drag match the numerical results reported in the literature while the predicted strouhal number is higher than the experimental value to the knowledge of the authors this is the first application of synthetic inflow turbulence to a test case including cavitation as part of future work it is desirable to improve the iterative convergence of the computations which was seen to reduce due to the interaction of cavitation and inflow turbulence secondly the influence of applying a symmetry plane at the foil midspan in order to reduce the domain size and thereby also the required number of grid cells should be further investigated when resolving turbulence the symmetry plane introduces a modelling error and with the inclusion of inflow turbulence this error becomes even larger being already present upstream of the wing it is also clear that further refined grids are a necessity to obtain a proper resolved boundary layer and properly capture transition behaviour with srs methods with respect to the validation the inclusion of more physics in the cfd computations leads to more stringent demands for experimental data it is recommended to not only measure integral quantities but also characteristics of the setup such as turbulence intensity and integral length scale and the flow in the boundary layer the absence of this information for the delft twist foil highlights the need for new experimental test cases aimed at

technology mekelweg 2 2628 cd delft the netherlands delft university of technology mekelweg 2 delft 2628 cd the netherlands the delft twist 11 hydrofoil is a common test case for investigating the interaction between turbulence and cavitation modelling in computational fluid dynamics despite repeated investigations results reported for the lift and drag coefficient are accompanied by significant uncertainties both in experimental and numerical studies when using scale resolving approaches it is known that turbulent fluctuations must be inserted into the domain in order to prevent the flow from remaining laminar around the body of interest although this has been overlooked until now for the present test case this work investigates the errors occurring when a laminar inflow is applied for mildly separated or attached flows by employing the partially averaged navier stokes equations with varying values for the ratio of modelled to total turbulence kinetic energy and with varying grid densities it is shown that depending on the grid resolution laminar leading edge separation can occur when turbulent fluctuations are added to the inflow the leading edge separation is suppressed completely and the turbulent separation zone near the trailing edge reduces in size the inflow turbulence has a large effect on the skin friction which increases with increasing turbulence intensity to a limit determined by the grid resolution in cavitating conditions the integral quantities are dominated by the shedding sheet cavity the turbulence intensity has little effect on the pressure distribution leading to a largely unaffected sheet cavitation although the shedding behaviour is affected it is shown that especially in wetted flow conditions with scale resolving methods inflow turbulence is necessary to match the experimental flow field keywords synthetic inflow turbulence delft twist 11 hydrofoil pans cavitation verification validation 1 introduction in both research and industrial contexts computational fluid dynamics cfd is being increasingly used to resolve a part of the turbulence spectrum through the application of scale resolving simulations srs instead of more traditional reynolds averaged navier stokes rans modelling methods srs consist of several approaches such as large eddy simulation les partially averaged navier stokes pans or rans les hybrid methods such as detached eddy simulation des the increased physical resolution in the obtained solutions is necessary for flow cases exhibiting important time varying stochastic features such as strongly separated flows cavitation broadband noise etc it is well known from literature that for attached flows srs require synthetic inflow turbulence or leading edge roughness to induce transition to turbulence in order to prevent laminar solutions tabor and baba ahmadi 2010 klapwijk et al 2020 nevertheless it is clear from literature that for maritime applications including cavitation the use of a resolved turbulent inflow is often neglected potentially leading to large modelling errors the current study aims to explore the reduction in modelling errors when using resolved inflow turbulence and the application of a synthetic turbulence generator for simulating cavitation dynamics such a methodology can result in an increased physical resolution while using smaller domains i e less computational cells potential use cases include simulating a propeller in a cavitation tunnel simulating a propeller in behind condition without resolving the entire flow around the hull upstream or predicting the interaction between two wings while only simulating the downstream wing the test case of choice in the current work is the 3d twisted hydrofoil studied by foeth et al 2006 this is a well documented test case exhibiting a shedding sheet cavity representative of a ship propeller while avoiding the additional complications due to a rotating body the test case was experimentally studied in both wetted and cavitating conditions and is a common numerical test case hoekstra et al 2011 due to the cavitation occurring inside the boundary layer the cavitation behaviour is strongly dependent on the interaction between turbulence and cavitation modelling emphasizing the need for proper inflow boundary conditions an overview of previous investigations into this test case is given in section 3 2 the test case was designed to study cavitation behaviour which naturally has led to a focus on attempting to capture the cavitating behaviour unfortunately an effect of this is that some of the difficulties in simulating this test case have been overlooked although it is known from literature that inflow turbulence is necessary for srs methods all srs results in the open literature for this test case do not employ such methods indeed they obtain reasonable results for the cavity length and shedding behaviour it seems that the presence of a sheet cavity on the wing surface obscures some of the difficulties in simulating this flow the laminar inflow leads to an incorrect boundary layer prediction but still the presence of cavitation leads to a production of turbulence and vorticity due to the occurrence of shear layers in the flow due to these turbulent perturbations turbulence like structures arise when solving the navier stokes equations masking the modelling errors due to the laminar inflow due to the complex interaction between modelling and numerical errors such results strongly depend on the used grid time step and turbulence model commonly coarser grids results in lower eddy viscosity levels see e g diskin et al 2015 leading to the occurrence of increased dynamics in such cases grid refinement can suppress dynamics thereby leading to an increasing comparison error with grid refinement in contrast under wetted flow conditions the lack of inflow turbulence structures can lead to unrealistic flow results when using srs approaches in the current work we attempt to show the mismatch between computations and experiments which can occur for this case when using a steady inflow for srs the focus will therefore be on wetted flow conditions to prevent the presence of turbulence due to cavitation obscuring the errors nevertheless results for cavitating conditions are also presented all results are obtained using pans in order to be able to systematically vary the turbulence resolution between rans and underresolved direct numerical simulation dns while simultaneously utilising several grid densities a theoretical advantage of pans is that due to the explicit setting of the filter between rans and dns the discretisation and modelling errors are decoupled pereira et al 2018 klapwijk et al 2020 the use of a single formulation ranging from rans to dns prevents ad hoc behaviour when switching between resolving and modelling turbulence as can occur for hybrid methods vaz et al 2017 klapwijk et al 2020 iterative statistical and discretisation errors are assessed the turbulent unsteady inflow is provided by a modified version of the body forcing approach developed in klapwijk et al 2020 which is based on the digital filtering method by xie and castro 2008 the paper is organised as follows section 2 describes the different mathematical approaches for simulating turbulence phase change due to cavitation and synthetic inflow turbulence section 3 describes the test case and numerical setup while section 4 details the estimation of the numerical errors after this the results are addressed in two sections wetted flow in section 5 and cavitating flow in section 6 the discussion and conclusions in sections 7 and 8 complete the study 2 mathematical modelling approaches the approach to resolving and modelling turbulence employed in this work is the partially averaged navier stokes pans method girimaji and abdol hamid 2005 in this methodology the instantaneous quantities φ are decomposed into a resolved φ and a modelled unresolved component ϕ applying this decomposition to the conservation of mass and navier stokes equations for a newtonian

2 see menter et al 2003 while for more details on the implementation of the pans model used here the reader is referred to pereira et al 2005 the filtering of the navier stokes equations depends on the values chosen for f k and f ϵ f k determines the physical resolution of the flow i e to what extent the turbulence spectrum is resolved f ϵ determines the overlap between the energy containing and the dissipation ranges following klapwijk et al 2019b f ϵ 1 0 to avoid adding excessive dissipation f k can either vary in space and time or be kept constant in the domain the drawback of the first approach is that this entangles the modelling error and numerical error thereby destroying one of the key advantages of the pans model as shown in klapwijk et al 2019a there is no consensus on what estimate for f k to use and the estimates are unreliable in boundary layers and problematic to apply in combination with inflow turbulence consequently in this work constant a priori chosen values of f k 1 00 0 75 0 50 0 25 and 0 00 are employed by definition pans computations using f k 0 00 are equal to implicit les computations also sometimes referred to as underresolved dns where it is assumed that the added numerical diffusion due to the use of coarse r grids and low order upwinding schemes acts as a sub filter model previous studies in klapwijk et al 2019a showed that the real ratio of modelled to total levels of turbulence solved is lower than the a priori chosen values which is a desirable conservative characteristic of the approach 2 1 synthetic turbulence generator synthetic inflow turbulence is generated using the method developed in klapwijk et al 2020 which is a modified version of the digital filter method by xie and castro 2008 and kim et al 2013 in this method random numbers r m l i with a zero mean and unit variance are generated on a cartesian grid at each time step here m l indicate the position indices and i the velocity component these numbers are spatially correlated using 10 ψ m l i j n n k n n b j b k r m j l k i after which they are temporally correlated with the numbers generated during the previous time step using 11 ψ i t ψ i t δ t exp π δ t 2 t ψ i t 1 exp π δ t 2 t here t l u i is the lagrangian time scale based on the desired integral length scale l b j and b k are filter coefficients used to generate spatial correlations the spatially and temporally correlated numbers are transformed to velocity fluctuations using 12 u i a i j ψ i in which a i j indicates the lund transformation matrix which is based on a cholesky decomposition of the desired reynolds stress tensor τ i j following klapwijk et al 2020 the velocity fluctuations are transformed to body forces term in the momentum equations explicitly added on the right hand side of the equations note that in the current work a string of pseudo random numbers i e the same range of random numbers for every computation is used to compare different computations to improve the iterative convergence a divergence free velocity field is enforced by adding a source term s t g to the mass equation every non linear loop this source term is computed by computing the flux q f c through each face for every cell c of the turbulence generator 13 q f c s u n d s the source term equals a summation of the fluxes over the n f faces 14 s t g c c 1 n f q f c and is added to maintain mass conservation in the cells of the turbulence generator 2 2 cavitation model the multiphase flow is modelled using the homogeneous mixture eulerian volume of fluid approach an additional transport equation is solved for the vapour volume fraction α v v v v v v l with v indicating the phase volume the transport equation is formulated as 15 d α v d t m ρ v from α v the mixture properties can be calculated using eq 3 under the condition that 16 α l α v 1 the source term m is modelled by the schnerr sauer cavitation model schnerr and sauer 2001 hoekstra and vaz 2009 which is based on the linearised rayleigh plesset equation for bubble dynamics and reads 17 m ρ v 4 π r b 2 n b 1 α v 2 3 p v p ρ l if p p v 3 α v r b 2 3 p v p ρ l if p p v the dependence on the local pressure leads to an vastly simplified inception criterion compared to reality but the method is widely applied in literature r b indicates the maximum bubble radius n b the bubble concentration and p v the vapour pressure in the present study the bubble radius and concentration were set to n b 1 1 0 8 and r b 1 1 0 5 respectively based on vaz et al 2017 3 test case and setup 3 1 test case description the delft twist 11 hydrofoil is a naca0009 profile with aspanwise varying angle of attack from 0 at the sides to 11 at midspan mounted with an angle of attack at the wall α w a l l 2 the chord length c 0 15 m and the span s 2 c the spanwise twist is given by foeth et al 2006 foeth 2008 18 α α m a x 2 y c 3 3 y c 2 1 α w a l l the reynolds number is r e u c ν 1 1 0 6 leading to an uniform inflow velocity of u 6 97 m s in cavitating conditions the cavitation number is σ p p v q 1 07 with the dynamic pressure q 1 2 ρ u 2 in the experiments sand roughness with a grain size of 10 4 m was applied at the leading edge at x c 0 04 to force transition to turbulence but also leading to an increase in drag foeth 2008 measured the lift force the pressure at different locations on the suction side and applied particle image velocimetry piv to analyse the developing cavity shape and shedding behaviour the drag was not measured for the lift and pressures the calibration errors of the sensors are reported but no total uncertainties are given regarding the setup an uncertainty of 2 7 is reported for the inflow velocity and 5 for the cavitation number inflow turbulence levels of the cavitation tunnel were 2 3 at the location of the hydrofoil this is higher than the more recent values reported for the same cavitation tunnel by varadharajan 2019 1 5 but those were obtained with a 50 lower mean tunnel velocity from both sources no information is available on the integral length scale which makes matching the experimental setup and quantitative validation difficult for more details the reader is referred to foeth 2008 3 2 literature overview the delft twist 11 hydrofoil is a common test case for investigating the interaction between turbulence and cavitation modelling in cfd in literature a number of different turbulence modelling approaches for this case have been applied such as euler equations koop 2008 schnerr et al 2008 unsteady rans oprea 2013 bensow 2011 ji et al 2014a whitworth 2011 vaz et al 2017 unsteady rans with an ad hoc eddy viscosity correction such as the so called reboud correction reboud et al 1998 bensow 2011 li et al 2010 vaz et al 2017 hong and zhang 2020 reynolds stress models rsm whitworth 2011 les bensow 2011 asnaghi et al 2017 chen et al 2017 ji et al 2013 long et al 2018 lu et al 2010 hybrid models bensow 2011 whitworth 2011 vaz et al 2017 and pans ji et al 2014b the use of unsteady rans typically suppresses the cavity dynamics while les results show a shape and shedding behaviour which is more in agreement with the experiments although the cavity length is underpredicted hybrid models such as des shed less cavity structures due to the sheet cavity being close to the wing surface i e in a rans region the use of the reboud correction leads to increased cavity dynamics and cavity length however its ad hoc empirical nature introduces additional modelling error in the results the pans results reported show a shedding behaviour comparable to experiments however only one ratio of modelled to total turbulent kinetic energy was investigated from literature it is know that the results can vary significantly based on this ratio pereira et al 2018 klapwijk et al 2019a 2020 most investigations oprea 2013 li et al 2010 bensow 2011 whitworth 2011 ji et al 2013 2014a lidtke et al 2016 vaz et al 2017 make use of the schnerr sauer cavitation model which is also employed in the current work an overview of the reported mean lift coefficient c l l q c s and strouhal number s t f c u as function of the number of grid cells n c in cavitating conditions can be found in fig 1 the coefficients are defined using the lift force l and the shedding frequency f and divided by the turbulence model the mean lift coefficient is underpredicted by every simulation found in the open literature which indicates that the cavitation extent is underestimated lidtke et al 2016 a wide variety of grid types and densities is employed in the literature it must be noted that in general the grids are relatively coarse considering the reynolds number with high wall normal resolutions the stream and spanwise resolutions are regularly not reported and the sensitivity of the results towards the grid is often not investigated this leads to few reported uncertainties for integral values as mentioned in the introduction the literature focusses on cavitation conditions nevertheless some results for wetted flow are reported hoekstra et al 2011 lidtke et al 2016 vaz et al 2017 asnaghi et al 2018 these results are mostly limited to the forces and the pressure distribution on the centreline no flow visualizations are given hoekstra et al 2011 do report that within their workshop all participants report an attached boundary layer on the entire foil i e no boundary layer separation is observed on the wing surface see fig 2 for an overview of the reported mean lift c l and drag coefficient c d d q c s as function of the number of grid cells and turbulence model some results match the experimental lift coefficient well however again the spread in results is significant 3 3 numerical setup the computational domain extends two chord lengths upstream of the leading edge and five chord lengths downstream half of the wing is modelled with a symmetry plane at the centre of the wing the use of a symmetry plane in the setup can lead to modelling errors when attempting to resolve turbulence using srs and when adding synthetic turbulence nevertheless it was employed to reduce numerical cost it must be remarked that most results in literature including the les results employ the same simplification the top and bottom of the domain are located one chord length from the wing matching the dimensions of the cavitation tunnel used by foeth et al 2006 the boundaries of the domain are modelled as slip walls whereas on the wing a no slip boundary condition is applied at the inlet an inflow boundary condition is used fixed pressure is defined at the outlet fig 3 shows the wing geometry computational domain and grid topology the boundary conditions at the inlet are a dirichlet condition for all velocity components and turbulence quantities and at the outlet a dirichlet condition for the pressure the wing s surface is modelled as a non slip wall with a symmetry boundary condition at the centre of the wing all other domain boundaries are modelled as slip walls four geometrically similar multi block hexahedral structured grids g 1 g 2 g 3 and g 4 are used but for comparison purposes also an additional grid g 0 is employed this grid is identical to grid g 1 but it includes a local refinement box with dimensions 4 3 c c 2 3 c surrounding the wing in this refinement box the grid is refined by a factor 2 with respect to grid g 1 the average values of the non dimensional wall cell sizes x n x c and x s normal chordwise and spanwise on the suction side centreline of the different grids are given in table 1 due to the 3d geometry and grid topology the averaged values do not give a good indication of the cell distribution over the wing fig 4 shows the x n x c and x s distribution over the chord at the wing centreline on the suction side over the entire wing x n is well below 1 for all grids on the suction side x c reaches high values at the leading edge drops immediately after the leading edge and then increases again it remains relatively constant but decreases again towards the trailing edge finally x s is high at the leading edge and decreases along the wing the values for x s at the wing midspan are lower than the values towards the wall of the cavitation tunnel where α 2 when comparing these resolutions to guidelines from literature for a well resolved les or pans x n 1 50 x c 150 and 15 x s 40 piomelli and balaras 2002 it is clear that in wall normal direction all grids are sufficiently fine grids g 0 and g 1 do comply with the required x c however none of the applied grids reaches the required resolution in spanwise direction due to the computational cost the grids are not refined below these levels for computations with a resolved turbulent inflow the turbulence generator is located at x t g 2 c with respect to the leading edge of the wing which is close to the inflow boundary condition 3 4 solver the numerical solver used for all simulations in this work is refresco vaz et al 2009 a simple based multiphase unsteady incompressible viscous flow solver using rans and srs methods complemented with cavitation models and volume fraction transport equations for different phases the code traditionally focusses strongly on code and solution verification and validation as one can see by several studies klapwijk et al 2020 pereira et al 2018 liebrand et al 2020 vaz et al 2015 lloyd et al 2017 for the current work time integration is performed using a second order implicit three time level scheme the convection terms in the momentum equations are discretised using a second order accurate flux limited quadratic upstream interpolation for convective kinematics quick scheme the turbulence and cavitation equations are discretised using a first order upwind scheme diffusion is central second order accurate and non orthogonality and eccentricity of the grid are considered by extra deferred corrections 4 numerical errors as is generally accepted numerical errors can be divided into input round off iterative discretisation and in the case of unsteady computations statistical errors roache 2009 the round off error is assumed to be negligible due to the use of double precision arithmetic eça and hoekstra 2006 one of the sources of input error are boundary conditions the effect of changing the inflow boundary condition is assessed in section 5 in this section the iterative discretisation and statistical error are assessed the iterative convergence is assessed based on the residuals normalised by the diagonal element of the left hand side matrix of the linear system of equations all wetted flow calculations with steady inflow condition are converged until l is below 10 6 computations with a resolved turbulent inflow are converged until l 2 is below 10 4 and l below 10 2 the largest residuals occur near the turbulence generator and the wing leading edge residuals can be reduced further by increasing the number of outerloops with the exception of the ω equation which stagnates for cavitating computations the l 2 norm is generally in the order of 10 3 while the l norm is in the order of 10 1 for all equations except for the ω equation for this equation the l 2 norm is in the order of 10 3 and the l norm in the order of 1 0 0 1 0 1 the finite length of a cfd simulation introduces a random uncertainty in the mean of the signal to estimate the statistical uncertainty and to remove the start up effect we use the transient scanning technique tst developed by brouwer et al 2015 and applied before in klapwijk et al 2020 for wetted flow cases with a steady inflow or low levels of inflow turbulence intensity i l e 10 the statistical uncertainty for integral quantities is below 1 for higher inflow turbulence intensities i l e 10 it is below 5 for cavitating computations the statistical uncertainty for the mean lift and drag forces is below 3 the discretisation error e d ϕ is estimated using a power series expansion roache 2009 pereira et al 2018 19 e d ϕ ϕ 1 ϕ 0 ϕ i 1 ϕ 1 r i 1 p 1 where ϕ 0 indicates the estimated solution for zero discretisation error and r is the refinement ratio based on 20 r i r h i h 1 with h the cell length based on the data it is not possible to obtain an accurate estimation of p so both a value of 1 0 and 2 0 are used p 1 0 leads to a conservative estimate e d m a x whereas p 2 0 yields a lower value e d m i n 5 wetted flow results this section describes the results for wetted flow simulations i e without cavitation among the results reported are the lift coefficient c l l q c s the drag coefficient c d d q c s the pressure coefficient c p p p q and the streamwise skin friction coefficient c f x τ w x q at the wing midspan the results are compared against experimental results by aït bouziad 2005 designated epfl and against results obtained with the panel code xfoil drela 1989 with xfoil the 2d naca0009 cross section was computed at an angle of attack at the centreline α 9 since the 3d effects due to the twist are not included in xfoil differences in the magnitude of c p are to be expected nevertheless it gives a good indication of the pressure distribution along the chord 5 1 steady inflow condition most of the computations with a steady inflow converge to a steady solution with the exception of flow solutions which show leading edge separation extending along the chord consequently the results in this section are obtained with a larger time step which is kept fixed to δ t u δ t c 6 97 1 0 3 leading to a maximum and average courant number of 48 and 2 3 on the finest grid and 22 and 1 2 on the coarsest grid respectively these large courant numbers were deemed acceptable based on preliminary computations with a smaller timestep which showed the same solutions with a similar iterative convergence fig 5 shows the lift and drag coefficient as a function of the grid refinement h i h 1 and the physical resolution f k together with the discretisation error as error bars the plotted values are also given in the appendix both the lift and drag have a low grid dependency leading to small discretisation errors f k has little influence on the lift coefficient in the range 1 00 0 50 however the lift coefficient suddenly drops by almost 10 for f k 0 25 for f k 0 00 lift increases again we will comment on this later the drag coefficient shows a linear decrease with decreasing f k with the exception for f k 0 25 on the two finest grids and f k 0 00 where the drag suddenly increases a division of the drag into pressure and friction drag shows that the friction drags linearly decreases with f k however for f k 0 00 and 0 25 on the fine grids the pressure drag doubles due to flow separation occurring at the leading edge as will be explained later based on flow visualizations the effect of reducing f k is visualized in fig 6 by showing the time averaged streamwise skin friction coefficient limiting streamlines and time averaged normalized streamwise velocity u u with a reduction in f k the streamwise skin friction decreases for f k 0 25 the flow starts to change depending on the grid resolution two solution regimes are predicted for the coarser grids g 3 and g 4 turbulent separation is observed in the streamlines near the trailing edge along the entire span of the wing along the spanwise position the angle of attack varies the separation region moves towards the leading edge with increasing angle of attack this is accompanied by a negative friction coefficient on the wing surface indicating recirculating flow over the wing on the finer grids g 1 and g 2 the separation location moves further upstream and the flow exhibits laminar separation close to the leading edge the flow solution is now also unsteady which together with the separation at the leading edge is a clear indication of a stall condition after the laminar separation bubble the flow periodically detaches and reattaches leading to a time averaged positive skin friction which increases the pressure drag as observed in fig 5 the grid sensitivity of the flow separation is likely related to the x c resolution behind the leading edge see fig 4 while it is low at the leading edge on grids g 3 and g 4 it more than doubles over a chordwise distance of c 30 thereby suppressing the flow separation on the finer grids x c still increases but the increase is less drastic allowing the grid to resolve the flow separation the results for f k 0 00 show this stall condition on all grids due to the absence of a turbulence model the flow instability is not suppressed by any eddy viscosity again the time averaged skin friction is positive behind the separation bubble at the leading edge leading to an increased pressure drag for this f k value the largest differences occur more towards the tunnel side wall where the angle of attack is lower on the coarse grid there is a large region with negative friction which decreases in size on the finer grids to quantify the differences in time averaged skin friction coefficient fig 7 shows c f x at the wing centreline c f x decreases with decreasing f k for f k 1 00 c f x is close to the xfoil prediction the deviation in slope is likely related to 3d effects which are not included in the xfoil prediction the trend remains the same in the range 0 5 f k 1 0 only the magnitude varies for f k 0 25 on the coarse grids c f x shows a trough for 0 05 x c 0 1 after which it increases until x c 0 2 and then decreases again until it becomes negative for x c 0 4 on these coarser grids the low c f values are likely related to an absence of transition i e the flow remains laminar along the chord on the finer grids the flow separates at the leading edge so c f x shows a peak at x c 0 05 after which it becomes negative until x c 0 4 and then remains positive until the trailing edge the leading edge separation induces transition at x c 0 4 leading to a higher c f than observed for f k 0 25 on the coarser grids fig 6 already showed that this pattern varies significantly along the span of the wing finally for f k 0 00 the pattern is similar on all grids there is a large separation region at the leading edge inducing transition c f x on the fine grids g 2 and g 1 equals the c f x predicted by f k 0 25 which is in line with the earlier visual observations the pressure distribution at the wing surface is less affected by the flow pattern as shown in fig 8 the different computations show little difference with the exception of the f k 0 00 and 0 25 on grids g 2 and g 1 which is of course directly linked to the unsteady flow separation the other computations predict similar c p distributions but for f k 0 25 c p is slightly lower in the range 0 2 x c 0 7 and higher for x c 0 7 two observations can now be made firstly both c f x and c d are strongly affected by f k and vary for each f k value while c p and c l show two sets of solutions based on f k being above or below a certain threshold secondly in the range x c 0 4 c p does not depend on f k which is favourable for cavitation inception predictions the cavitation behaviour and attached sheet cavity extent will be insensitive to f k and consequently to the lack of inflow turbulence what happens when we reduce f k the change in the flow is related to changes in the turbulence intensity both modelled and resolved due to the reduction of f k the effect of modelled turbulence is reduced while due to the steady inflow boundary condition the resolved flow is laminar i e the resolved turbulence intensity is zero this is clearly visible in fig 9 which shows k ω and ν t ν between the location where we will later insert resolved inflow turbulence and the leading edge both k and ω decrease downstream but since ν t ν depends on the ratio of k and ω eq 9 ν t ν is relatively constant along the streamwise direction however with decreasing f k ν t ν decreases leading to the flow becoming laminar with decreasing f k note that for f k 0 00 ν t ν 0 by definition due to low inflow turbulence level bypass transition on the wing surface is delayed and the flow separates at the trailing edge for even lower f k the flow becomes completely laminar and separates at the leading edge this was already observed by foeth 2008 who recognised that for the limited reynolds numbers typical for model scale hydrofoils transition to turbulence does not occur at the leading edge unless the boundary layer is locally disturbed hence the application of surface roughness in the experiments it is known from literature that laminar boundary layers separate earlier than turbulent boundary layers rist and augustin 2006 the occurrence of turbulent trailing edge separation leads to the decrease in lift coefficient and the decrease in drag coefficient is proportional to the reduction in skin friction due to the laminar boundary layer along the chord with leading edge separation the lift and drag coefficient increase again due to a different pressure distribution unsteady structures can be observed e g based on the q criterion potentially leading to a wrong conclusion that the approach is resolving a turbulent boundary layer up to now with the exception of the work by foeth 2008 who employed surface roughness separation has not been reported in literature for this test case a number of reasons can be identified to explain this simulations using rans or hybrid models do not show flow separation due to the inherent assumptions employed in rans in the boundary layer leading to transition to turbulent flow at the leading edge for srs results such as les and pans it is shown that for intermediate f k values such as 0 25 the behaviour is grid sensitive and only occurs on fine grids the literature overview in figs 1 and 2 showed that most les results reported in literature are obtained using coarser grids than the ones here thereby potentially hiding this behaviour it must also be remarked that most investigations in literature focus on cavitation dynamics however due to the nature of the test case when cavitation is included this separation is again masked since due to the cavitation inception criterion used in cfd the sheet cavity occurs at the same location as the flow separation at the leading edge the use of xfoil further confirms the hypothesis that the leading edge separation with a laminar inflow is physical when using a turbulent inflow similar c f x and c p distributions are found however when reducing the inflow turbulence when moving from what is known in xfoil as a dirty towards a clean wind tunnel the solution becomes more and more difficult to converge again pointing to unsteady flow separation at the leading edge to ensure that further grid refinement does not yield different flow behaviour additional f k 0 25 and 0 00 computations were performed on a grid with a local refinement box surrounding the wing grid g 0 the integral values are c l 0 35 and 0 42 c d 1 0 2 1 00 and 0 85 for f k 0 25 and 0 00 respectively the drag appears to continue to increase with increasing simulation time fig 10 shows c f x and c p at the midspan along with a flow visualization for f k 0 00 for this additionally refined grid the wing does not show such a large region of recirculating flow at the leading edge as for grid g 1 leading to a pressure distribution closer matching the experiments at a first glance it appears that refining the grid to this level solves the problems observed previously in this section however investigation of c f shows that leading edge separation still occurs the difference is that here c f becomes positive again at x c 0 1 after which it remains positive until close towards the trailing edge on grid g 1 c f also seemed to recover at x c 0 07 but then decreases again and does not become positive until x c 0 4 the increased grid resolution decreases the leading edge separation and therefore leads to a reasonable prediction of the drag the lift however is even lower than for the pans results on coarser grids potentially the leading edge separation is reduced even more on a further refined grid however it is important to realise that this grid is already refined to a level which is currently unaffordable for industrially oriented cases this grid is significantly finer than les grids employed in the literature for this test case to summarise it is clear that flow predictions with srs with a steady inflow do not match experimental conditions but it could be argued that this would have little effect on cavitation predictions due to the inception criterion used in cfd c p does not vary so the inception behaviour will be the same however we emphasize that the laminarization of the flow is a problem as also known from literature tabor and baba ahmadi 2010 klapwijk et al 2020 firstly c p does change towards the trailing edge potentially affecting the development and dynamics of shed cavities secondly the integral quantities lift and drag differ significantly from experiments making validation impossible it is interesting to note that the lift decreases with f k away from the experimental value with the exception of f k 0 00 which gives higher values than f k 1 00 from this the incorrect conclusion could be made that f k 0 00 also known as implicit les does not suffer from these problems and yields the best match for experimental values nevertheless as shown c d c f x and c p are different and in fact the entire flow changes from a steady attached flow to an unsteady flow separating at the leading edge indeed the lift is better predicted but for the wrong reasons instead it is necessary to introduce synthetic inflow turbulence to obtain a turbulent boundary layer from the leading edge onwards to better match the experimental results 5 2 resolved turbulent inflow condition to trigger the flow to become turbulent and suppress unphysical separation synthetic turbulence is added at the inflow the need for such boundary conditions is well known for les and pans tabor and baba ahmadi 2010 klapwijk et al 2020 however les results in the open literature for this specific test case do not employ such methods the turbulence generator is located at x t g 2 c with turbulent fluctuations inserted in a plane perpendicular to the flow with dimensions c c and a thickness in primary flow direction of c 15 which corresponds to 2 3 cells in streamwise direction a number of conditions with varying levels of turbulence intensity and integral length scale are investigated the settings at the location of the turbulence generator are summarized in table 2 the decay in turbulence kinetic energy is compared to the slope of theoretical decay of isotropic homogeneous turbulence comte bellot and corrsin 1966 21 u i u i u 2 x x t g l n in this equation x indicates the measurement location and n is approximately equal to 1 27 based on experiments table 2 also shows the turbulence intensity i 2 3 k u u i u i u expected at the leading edge based on the theoretical decay for case a and c the turbulence intensity is comparable to the experimental setup no integral length scale was reported for the experiments from a theoretical perspective it is incorrect to insert velocity fluctuations in a computation with f k 1 00 since for such a f k value all turbulence should be modelled in this work it is still done to investigate the trends due to the use of pseudo random numbers the curves for the different computations overlap the time step for these computations is kept fixed to δ t u δ t c 6 97 1 0 4 with maximum courant numbers of approximately 5 occurring close to the leading edge in the remainder of the domain the courant number is well below 1 the l 2 norms of the residuals are o 1 0 4 o 1 0 6 o 1 0 7 and o 1 0 7 for momentum pressure turbulence kinetic energy and dissipation respectively of these equations only the ω equation stagnates the other equations keep on converging and decrease at least one order of magnitude during a time step the l norms for the same equations are o 1 0 2 o 1 0 3 o 1 0 4 and o 1 0 3 the largest residuals occur in the cells where the turbulence generator is located during the computation the flow passes the chord seven times with averaging applied during the final four time units t w f c u leading to a maximum statistical error of 5 which occurs for the case with highest inflow turbulence intensity first cases a and b are compared on all grids with 0 0 f k 1 0 the streamwise development of the synthetic isotropic turbulence between the generator and the leading edge is shown for f k 0 25 in fig 11 the reynolds stresses decrease around two orders of magnitude on the coarse grid while on the fine grid the decrease is about one order of magnitude which is comparable to eq 21 an initially surprising observation is that the decay of resolved turbulence is almost insensitive to the f k value not shown in the graph suggesting no effect of the chosen f k on the computations however the statistical representation of turbulence the rans contribution does vary with f k a higher f k leads to a higher eddy viscosity as observed earlier on finer grids the eddy viscosity levels also increase these results in combination with results from literature pereira et al 2005 klapwijk et al 2020 suggest that while the selected value of f k strongly affects the production of modelled turbulence it does not affect the decay of resolved turbulence in this streamwise range while this might seem counterintuitive it can be explained from the equations which are being solved the filtered navier stokes equations are independent of f k f k only affects the turbulence transport equations for k and ω due to the formulation of the turbulence generator fluctuations are introduced regardless of f k which can lead to the unphysical combination of f k 1 00 i e rans with resolved turbulent fluctuations after their addition to the flow the development of the fluctuations is described by the navier stokes equations the difference between computations with different f k values is the level of ν t ν however in this short range the effect of the increased eddy viscosity is too small to significantly dampen the velocity fluctuations and therefore the decay of resolved turbulence is comparable a similar observation was made when using synthetic turbulence for a channel flow in klapwijk et al 2020 close to the turbulence generator the solutions for different f k values are comparable and velocity fluctuations are being dampened only further downstream the comparable decay is also an indication that the grids are fine enough to not add excessive diffusion in figs 12 and 13 the flow is visualized using the time averaged streamwise velocity and friction coefficient at the wing surface for different f k values on grids g 4 and g 1 the visualization shows that while the flow at the surface is affected by the inflow turbulence for f k 0 25 a region of separated flow still occurs near the trailing edge the size of the separated flow region is reduced compared to the results obtained with a steady inflow especially on the finer grid the separation is also smaller for case b than for case a when f k 0 00 the region of separation is larger especially on the coarser grid this is an indication of the increased grid sensitivity of iles due to the absence of a sub filter model note that for both these levels of inflow turbulence for all f k values the large flow separation at the leading edge as observed for low f k values without inflow turbulence fig 6 disappears the effect on the skin friction coefficient is further analysed in fig 14 by plotting c f x versus x c at midspan for varying f k for the two cases a comparison with the steady inflow results shows that c f x increases with the addition of inflow turbulence an increase in r e i i also leads to an increase in c f x independent of f k used in the computation as expected f k 1 00 gives a rans distribution where c f x has a peak at the leading edge and then decreases along the chord while remaining positive the magnitude is comparable to the xfoil prediction with decreasing f k the magnitude of c f x decreases along the chord for f k 0 50 there is a slight kink at x c 0 1 but the profile remains similar to the rans results however the result for f k 0 25 clearly shows not only a much lower c f x but also drops after the leading edge to a negative value after which it increases again to a constant value along the wing this shows that the flow is still laminar at the leading edge but transitions to turbulent flow at x c 0 1 indicating that the inflow turbulence is not sufficient to trigger a turbulent flow at the leading edge for case a it can also be observed that for x c 0 9 c f x still becomes negative indicating turbulent flow separation it is noteworthy that on finer grids c f x always increases independent of f k for f k 0 25 this has the effect that while still present the separation region at the trailing edge is reduced as was observed previously in fig 12 on the coarse grid c f x for f k 0 00 remains close to zero for both cases indicating that transition does not occur and that the flow remains laminar on the finer grid it increases but remains close to zero along the chord when comparing case b to case a we can see that the increase in inflow turbulence leads to an increase in c f x along the chord for all f k values except for f k 0 00 on the coarse grid for case b on the coarse grid there is still a small region where c f x 0 close to the leading edge while on the fine grid c f x remains positive along the wing the effect on the pressure coefficient is limited and is therefore not shown there is no difference between different f k values except at the trailing edge x c 0 9 in the location of turbulent flow separation as expected this difference is larger on the coarse grid g 4 and larger for case a than for case b for case a there is a still a difference between f k 0 25 and 0 00 and the other f k values on the finest grid for case b there is no longer an observable difference between the different f k values on the finest grid the effect on the integral quantities is presented in fig 15 where the time averaged lift and drag coefficient are given as a function of the grid refinement and f k the predicted trend for the lift for case a is similar to what was observed without inflow turbulence fig 5 there is a sudden decrease in c l for f k 0 25 but the predicted lift by f k 0 00 is again approximately 5 larger than for f k 1 00 which is caused by a higher pressure on the pressure side of the wing between the leading edge and midchord close to the tunnel wall for case b the decrease at f k 0 25 is smaller and c l is more constant across the f k range especially on the finest grid the addition of inflow turbulence leads to a temporally varying lift coefficient since now the effective angle of attack varies in time as expected the standard deviation σ c l for case b is larger than for case a due to the higher turbulence intensity for case a σ c l 1 0 3 6 while for case b σ c l 1 0 3 23 for the drag coefficient in both cases a and b the trend is the same as for the case with a steady inflow c d decreases with decreasing f k for both cases c d increases across the f k range compared to the steady inflow and c f x for case b is larger than for case a again the standard deviation in the drag coefficient is larger for case b than for case a i e σ c d 1 0 3 1 3 versus σ c d 1 0 3 0 4 it is again emphasized that while iles f k 0 00 theoretically should involve the least modelling of turbulence it is not the best approach it does yield the highest lift coefficient but at the same time the predicted drag force is lower than all other results the skin friction shows that the flow is still laminar but due to the now absent leading edge separation the lift coefficient is reduced compared to the results with steady inflow the use of a different convection scheme in the momentum equation might improve these results it is known from literature that iles requires a convection scheme which adds enough dissipation to act as a sub filter model in the current work quick is used which might not fulfil that requirement by either adding too much or not sufficient dissipation an investigation into different convection schemes is outside of the scope of the current work the difficulties in predicting integral quantities do indicate that the use of iles is rather sensitive to the setup next to the entanglement of modelling and discretisation errors which is inherent to the method klapwijk et al 2020 consequently in the remainder of this work f k 0 25 is employed 5 3 increasing l versus i l e when varying both l and i l e systematically cases a b c and d a distinction can be made between the effect of l versus i l e these variations are only investigated for f k 0 25 on the finest grid since here the largest difference between results from cases with and without inflow turbulence occur varying l has almost no effect on the time averaged lift and drag coefficient however with a smaller integral length scale the standard deviation of the signal increases see table 3 increasing i l e leads to an increase of 5 10 in time averaged quantities as expected the increase in standard deviation is again significantly larger between 2 and 3 times larger the streamwise decay of i l e not shown is as expected comparable for all computations but varies in magnitude depending on the inflow i l e the flow visualization in fig 16 is in line with previous results modifying l shows only small differences while increasing i l e decreases the size of separation region at the trailing edge this is also clearly visible in fig 17 where c f x increases with i l e it is important to realise that the location of transition is not affected by the settings of the turbulence generator only the magnitude of the skin friction for i l e 2 0 there is only a difference between l c 0 013 and 0 033 near the trailing edge whereas for i l e 6 3 l c 0 013 yields a higher skin friction along the chord the increase in c f x manifests itself already at the leading edge all computations show a trough at x c 0 05 but the minimum c f x varies for i l e 2 0 for both integral length scales min c f x 1 0 3 1 indicating locally recirculating flow the lack of difference between the two integral values indicates that while the inflow turbulence intensity is high enough to prevent leading edge separation on the wing due to the turbulence decay it is too low at the leading edge to further affect the boundary layer flow when the inflow turbulence intensity is increased to i l e 6 3 min c f x increases when l c 0 033 the minimum is close to 0 while for the smaller integral length scale the minimum is approximately 1 here the inflow turbulence intensity does affect the boundary layer flow the smaller integral length is closer in magnitude to the turbulent length scales occurring closer to the wing surface leading to an increasingly turbulent boundary layer and therefore increased skin friction for the pressure distribution again no differences are observed except near the trailing edge these observations imply that a sufficiently small integral length scale can trigger transition directly at the leading edge similarly to roughness applied to the wing however such a small length scale must be supported by the grid to be convected from the turbulence generator until the leading edge and enter the boundary layer due to the employed grid resolutions in this work no integral length scales below l c 0 013 are investigated for the remainder of this work this smaller length scale is employed 5 4 the effect of increasing inflow turbulence intensity to investigate the effect of increasing the inflow turbulence intensity cases b c e f g and h are compared the integral length scale is kept fixed to l c 0 013 and only grid g 1 with f k 0 25 is investigated the streamwise development of r e i i follows the theoretical decay for all cases and an increase in r e i i also leads to an increase in ν t ν the effect on the integral quantities is shown in fig 18 both the time averaged lift and drag increase with increasing inflow turbulence and both quantities increase by approximately 10 between the lowest and the highest inflow turbulence levels however the difference between a rans solution and a srs solution without inflow turbulence is much larger for the drag than for the lift as seen in previous sections so while the increase in inflow turbulence results in a lift force which is comparable to the rans solution the drag force is still significantly underpredicted note also that for both lift and drag the increase with increasing i l e seems to converge meaning even higher inflow turbulence intensities will likely not result in a significantly higher mean force value note that for i l e 15 5 u i u i u 2 t g 0 60 which is very high but it is employed for the sake of completeness the standard deviation of the signal has not converged furthermore the large value for c d at i l e 0 0 is caused by the separation at the leading edge so this should not be interpreted as the correct result finally the effect of increasing inflow turbulence intensity on c f x and c p is investigated in fig 19 the c f x profiles show a small separation at the leading edge for non zero u i u i u 2 leading to transition this transition location does not vary with the inflow turbulence intensity although an increase in i l e does lead to an increase in skin friction along the wing which is also observed in rans computations in literature lopes et al 2020 for c f x the results with the highest i l e seem to converge indicating a limit to the skin friction which can be obtained using the turbulence generator on this grid with this value for the integral length scale the minimum value of c f x at x c 0 05 also increases until a limit is reached at approximately c f x 1 0 3 1 1 a consequence of the increasing inflow turbulence intensity is a change of the slope of c f x in the range 0 1 x c 0 7 the peak at x c 0 1 reaches a maximum for i l e 6 3 after which it decreases again while at x c 0 7 the c f x keeps increasing with increasing i l e finally again for c p there is little difference between the computations with inflow turbulence 5 5 conclusions based on wetted flow computations with inflow turbulence based on these comparisons the use of synthetic turbulence at the inflow can suppress the large leading edge separation as observed for pans with a low f k value and usual steady inflow conditions provided that the grid can support the selected integral length scale a decrease in integral length scales increases the skin friction the effect of varying i l e is larger no inflow turbulence leads to either a large leading edge separation zone or a laminar flow along the wing a small amount of inflow turbulence already suppresses the leading edge separation and leads to a small separation at the leading edge inducing transition to increase the lift and drag coefficient higher inflow turbulence intensities are required c f x shows that even with the highest levels of turbulence attempted in this work still laminar to turbulent transition is visible downstream of the leading edge to trigger transition further towards the leading edge the integral length scale should be reduced this does require the grids to be refined further due to the computational costs this was not attempted in the current work the application of inflow turbulence does also decrease the turbulent separation region at the trailing edge however it was not completely removed separation at the trailing edge is never mentioned in literature however there is an indication that this phenomenon was also present in the experiments when we compare one of the few reported wetted flow velocity fields obtained with piv by foeth 2008 with the current computations using the same colour scale it becomes clear that the turbulent separation at the leading edge also occurred in the experiments fig 20 shows the same wavy region of low velocity at the trailing edge although the velocity scale prohibits the observation of negative velocities at the trailing edge this implies that turbulent separation at the trailing edge is a feature of this test case and we should not aim to attempt to remove this by increasing the inflow turbulence intensity c p is only affected near the trailing edge closer to the leading edge it matches the limited experimental data well this indicates that the presence of synthetic turbulence should have little effect on cavitation inception this will be investigated in the next section this does not mean that cavitation is not affected at all the presence of resolved turbulence in the flow can potentially disturb the formed cavity leading to additional dynamics varying wing loading or noise together with the ability to tune the turbulence inflow statistics the procedure here used is a promising method to compute noise due to cavitation dynamics or dynamically varying blade loading for cavitating or non cavitating propellers in a non uniform wake field 6 cavitating results the final investigation in this work concerns the application of inflow turbulence to a case with cavitation thus far in literature pans is rarely combined with multi phase flows a notable exception being the work by ji et al 2014b however this work focusses on analysing the cavity dynamics only a single f k is attempted with a steady inflow and the associated modelling errors are not investigated to the knowledge of the authors the combination of cavitation with inflow turbulence has not been attempted before the computations are compared against numerical results obtained with ddes and iddes and against experimental results by aït bouziad 2005 and foeth 2008 designated epfl and delft respectively in the computations we match the cavitation number σ 1 07 while the settings for the inflow turbulence correspond to case b of the wetted flow computations meaning l c 0 013 and i l e 6 3 the turbulence intensity is comparable to the experiments for this level of inflow turbulence the lift coefficient is relatively insensitive to the selected f k value the relatively low turbulence intensities limit the risk of numerical instabilities when cavitation modelling is included higher inflow turbulence intensities lead to improved drag predictions but in cavitating computations can also lead to increased computational instability due to the combination of shedding sheet cavitation and inflow turbulence the integral length scale in the experiments is unknown the currently employed value is selected based on numerical reasons the courant number is well below 1 with the exception of some cells at the trailing edge where a maximum value of 4 is reached the computations are started from a wetted flow computation with cavitation introduced over a period corresponding to around 0 5 shedding cycles based on the tst it is found that the first five shedding cycles must be removed to eliminate the start up effects computations are then continued for an additional six cycles in the stationary range reducing the statistical uncertainty for the mean lift and drag forces below 3 a shedding cycle t s is 1 s t larger than the wetted flow time unit so t s t w f s t the normalised residuals reach at least 10 3 for l 2 for all equations the l norms are higher and occur near the leading edge fig 21 shows the developed time signal and power spectral density psd of the lift coefficient and vapour volume compared with ddes and iddes results following removal of the start up effects as discussed in section 4 the psd is computed using the pwelch algorithm and applying a hann window with 50 overlap resulting in averaging over 6 segments note the significantly larger variations in v v for iddes the psds for the pans computations show no clear dominant shedding frequency due to the windowing but show that the resolved turbulent inflow leads to a higher psd at higher frequencies the integral values can be found in table 4 as for wetted flow the application of a resolved turbulent inflow condition increases the lift for the pans computations c l is below the lift predicted by the hybrid models ddes and iddes when comparing to experiments all models underpredict the lift fig 1 already showed that this is common in literature indicating that the discrepancy might also be attributed to unknown experimental uncertainty it is remarkable that the fluctuations in lift are also significantly smaller for pans than for the hybrid models we will comment on this later note that the standard deviation of the lift coefficient is an order of magnitude larger than for the wetted flow computations section 5 indicating that the fluctuations in the lift due to the inflow turbulence are negligible compared to the cavitation induced fluctuations unsurprisingly the predicted drag is higher for all models which employ rans close the wall the fluctuations in drag however are comparable for all models for pans the standard deviation of the drag has increased by a factor 2 compared to wetted flow again indicating that the fluctuations due to cavitation are dominant this is confirmed by the observation that the standard deviation for a steady inflow condition is slightly higher than for a resolved turbulent inflow the average vapour volume increases for pans when the resolved turbulent inflow condition is employed but the mean and standard deviation of the vapour volume remain below the predictions done by ddes and iddes finally the strouhal number is computed from a single segment psd of the lift coefficient and vapour volume to emphasize the lower frequencies of the shedding sheet cavity not shown in the paper for pans without inflow turbulence s t v v is larger than s t c l implying different mechanisms are responsible for the vapour and lift fluctuations respectively and indicating additional dynamics in the sheet cavity for pans with a resolved inflow the shedding frequency halves although it must be remarked that this shedding frequency is difficult to discern fig 22 shows both the instantaneous and time averaged streamwise skin friction and velocity at the centreline for both cases with pans the trailing edge separation can still be observed towards the tunnel wall where the angle of attack is smaller but in the regions downstream of the sheet cavity it is absent the size decreases again when inflow turbulence is added an interesting observation is that the low momentum inside the cavity leads to a time averaged velocity field which looks similar to the time averaged velocity field for wetted flow with low f k without inflow turbulence i e when flow separation occurs at the leading edge see fig 6 in this case the presence of cavitation masks the leading edge separation which was observed in the wetted flow computation similar observations can be made from the time averaged skin friction and pressure coefficients at midspan see fig 23 the skin friction coefficient is based on the density of the liquid to enable comparing to the wetted flow results again the similarity with wetted flow cases without inflow turbulence is clear in the shape of c f x compare for example figs 23 and 7 the application of inflow turbulence leads to a higher c f x in the range x c 0 5 but towards the leading edge in the cavitation region little differences occur this is not surprising since in this region the local flow is dominated by the presence of the low momentum fluid inside the cavity in the range 0 25 x c 0 35 the steady inflow results show more re circulation than the resolved turbulent inflow results indicating that the application of inflow turbulence affects the boundary layer in the region where the cavity is periodically being shed the time averaged pressure coefficient clearly shows the presence of cavitation compared to the results obtained for wetted flow at the leading edge the pressure coefficient shows the suction peak due to the presence of a stagnation point the magnitude of this peak depends on the value of n 0 chosen in the schnerr sauer cavitation model but does not affect the dynamic cavitation behaviour vaz et al 2017 downstream of the suction peak the pressure coefficient has a constant value approximately equal to the cavitation number until x c 0 3 the length of this horizontal plateau indicates the mean length of the cavity when comparing to the experimental results the cavity length is underpredicted by all numerical approaches the application of a resolved turbulent inflow has little effect on the mean cavity length however the mean cavity length predicted by pans is lower than the cavity length predicted by ddes or iddes related to the higher shedding frequency this also explains the lower predicted vapour volume again note the similarity between c p for cavitating conditions with the laminar wetted flow condition on grid g 1 which also exhibits a horizontal plateau at c p 1 1 in the range 0 x c 0 2 see fig 8 the effect of the resolved turbulent inflow is most visible in the standard deviation of the streamwise skin friction and pressure coefficients near the leading edge for the skin friction in the region x c 0 2 the standard deviation fluctuates but is at some points almost 30 higher while the standard deviation of the pressure coefficient increases almost 50 in the same region along the remainder of the chord the standard deviation for both pans computations is similar and in magnitude σ c p is comparable to the results obtained with ddes and iddes however the chordwise variation is sensitive to the model choice for iddes two clear peaks can be observed the largest is related to the varying length of the sheet while the peak at the leading edge is due to the cavity detaching from the leading edge and growing again a somewhat similar behaviour is observed for pans with a steady inflow however for the resolved turbulent inflow σ c p reduces at the leading edge indicating a different shedding behaviour instead of the periodically growing and detaching cavity as observed in experiments and obtained with iddes for pans only parts of the sheet are shed similar to what was observed for ddes vaz et al 2017 for pans this happens at a higher shedding frequency leading to a lower standard deviation of the lift coefficient and a lower time averaged vapour volume 7 discussion in this work a synthetic turbulence generator is used to reduce the modelling errors in srs incurred by using a steady rans like inflow both in wetted and cavitating conditions for the test case considered when applying f k 0 5 it is necessary to insert turbulent fluctuations upstream of the wing in order to obtain a flow field predicted by srs which is close to the experimentally observed flow field since lowering f k reduces the amount of modelled inflow turbulence this must be replaced by resolved turbulence in order to maintain a physically correct flow field approaching the object of interest when a steady inflow is applied the flow around the object remains laminar along most or all of the chord and for certain combinations of sufficiently fine grid resolution and low f k separates already at the leading edge flow separation was not previously reported for numerical results found in literature although an indication of this phenomenon can be found in the experimental work by foeth 2008 the reasons for this oversight vary the results obtained with rans or hybrid models do not exhibit flow separation due to the rans assumption of a fully developed turbulent boundary layer the les results reported in literature also did not exhibit this although this could be related to the employed grid resolution at the wall not just in wall normal direction but also in the directions parallel to the wall which is in literature much coarser than the ones here used we observed in the current work that the inclusion of cavitation in the computation tends to mask the leading edge separation which is likely also the case for the les results from literature using synthetic inflow turbulence transition is triggered closer to the leading edge resulting in turbulent flow along the wing thereby avoiding laminar flow separation this behaviour is reminiscent of the application of vortex generators on aerofoils where the vortex generators energize the boundary layer thereby improving the stall behaviour by preventing leading edge separation clancy 2006 rist and augustin 2006 sreejith and sathyabhama 2018 the turbulent flow separation at the trailing edge seen in certain simulations is however thought to be physically correct since this was also observable in the experiments it is noted that the sensitivity to inflow turbulence quantities for srs is analogous to what is commonly observed when using rans with transition models where modest differences in inflow turbulence intensity can dramatically affect boundary layer development see e g liebrand et al 2019 2020 lopes et al 2020 an alternative approach for obtaining a turbulent boundary layer in the simulations is to trip the boundary layer close to the leading edge this is commonly applied for measurements of turbulent boundary layers performed at moderate reynolds numbers 1 0 4 1 0 5 or for flow control purposes in order to reduce the size of laminar separation bubbles and reduce the associated drag applications include aircraft wings wind turbines or blades of turbomachinery rist and augustin 2006 sreejith and sathyabhama 2018 the sand grain roughness applied in the experiments of the present test case could be reproduced numerically in a number of ways by geometrically resolving the roughness asnaghi and bensow 2020 applying a simplified trip in the geometry e g sreejith and sathyabhama 2018 winkler et al 2020 or by adding wall normal velocity fluctuations e g rist and augustin 2006 schlatter and örlü 2012 wolf et al 2012 an advantage of a trip is that there is no need to tune the turbulence generator to obtain a turbulent boundary layer nevertheless there are several challenges involved in applying this type of approach geometrically resolved sand grain roughness is far from standard practice in cfd and will in any case only quantitatively agree with what is used in experiments while wall normal velocity fluctuations and a trip despite the much simpler geometry must also be tuned to obtain a flow disturbance equivalent to the roughness applied in the experiments wall normal velocity fluctuations could also have a detrimental effect on iterative convergence although these approaches do reduce the need for a refined grid upstream of the object leading to slightly reduced numerical cost per simulation the required modification to the grid makes it a less general methodology which is more difficult to apply across a range of test cases or operating conditions sreejith and sathyabhama 2018 in real life engineering applications it can be expected that inflow turbulence is present consequently the use of a steady inflow in combination with srs always introduces a certain level of modelling error when trips are used there is also the risk that a too thick turbulent boundary layer develops which may affect the flow prediction downstream it can also introduce a pressure jump sreejith and sathyabhama 2018 which can have implications for numerical cavitation inception which is typically based on the simplified criterion c p σ therefore when the development of a turbulent boundary layer is the primary goal applying leading edge roughness is probably the better approach however should the focus of simulations be more on large scale dynamics such as noise generation of propellers due to inflow turbulence lloyd et al 2014 or cavitation dynamics the development of the boundary layer is of less importance compared to the interaction of turbulence with the leading edge in such cases the inflow turbulence generator is the more appropriate choice it was shown in this work that despite specifying unphysically high inflow turbulence intensities in the simulations significantly higher than the reported 2 3 in the experiments it was not possible to obtain transition directly at the leading edge since the inflow turbulence fluctuations do not enter the boundary layer due to insufficient spanwise grid resolution this agrees with the findings of tangermann and klein 2020 who studied the effect of inflow turbulence for a naca profile at moderate angle of attack using ddes while using inflow turbulence with similar l c to that used in the present work they observed that smaller integral length scales are needed to enter the boundary layer and cause transition while larger length scales mainly affect loading as they induce angle of attack fluctuations however to be able to properly resolve a fully turbulent boundary layer from the leading edge onwards the grid resolution has to be increased by several orders of magnitude to support these smaller length scales as well as the transition process they initiate the lack of resolution leads to a limit in skin friction for computations with low f k values the skin friction remains significantly lower than the results with higher f k values it is noted however that when applying a trip it might also be difficult to numerically reproduce the transition behaviour behind the trip due to the fine grid resolution required as already mentioned in the introduction the delft twist 11 hydrofoil was used as a test case representative of a simplified propeller the results in this work indicated that the fundamental shedding frequency of the sheet cavity was not affected by the synthetic inflow turbulence for a propeller operating in a wake field this finding likely holds since the dynamics of a sheet cavity at the blade passage frequency are governed by the rotation of the blade in a non uniform mean velocity field although cavity shedding and higher frequency dynamics are expected to be somewhat sensitive to inflow turbulence simulating a non uniform wake field in srs leads to the additional requirement of specifying inhomogeneous anisotropic inflow turbulence this is already possible using the current methodology klapwijk et al 2020 making the extension to engineering applications feasible the current setup is also well suited to investigate tip vortex cavitation dynamics for wings or propellers where the inflow turbulence can perturb the cavitating vortex bosschers 2018 using this approach underwater radiated noise could also be assessed 8 conclusion the delft twist 11 hydrofoil was evaluated in wetted and cavitating flow conditions using the pans methodology with a varying ratio of modelled to total kinetic energy on different grids and using both a steady and a resolved turbulent inflow it was shown that modelling errors can occur when applying a steady inflow condition as used for rans due to the flow around the object remaining laminar this leads to underpredicted lift and drag forces making validation impossible depending on the grid resolution the wing can even exhibit laminar leading edge separation i e stall when employing a resolved turbulent inflow where homogeneous isotropic turbulence is inserted into the flow the leading edge separation disappears regardless of the chosen input values for the turbulence generator the region of trailing edge separation is reduced by increasing the inflow turbulence intensity which also increases the skin friction along the wing the separation at the trailing edge is also observed in the experimental results meaning that although this was not reported previously we do obtain a proper match with the experimental flow field increasing the inflow turbulence intensity also increases the mean lift and drag force though only till a certain limit the fluctuations in lift and drag keep increasing an important observation is that the inflow turbulence has almost no effect on the pressure distribution this implies that inception remains unaffected when using the in cfd commonly applied cavitation inception criterion varying the integral length scale has less effect on the flow separation when using a resolved turbulent inflow it is necessary that srs grids are refined upstream to support the convection and development of inflow turbulence for cavitating conditions the variations in lift and drag due to inflow turbulence are significantly smaller than the fluctuations due to the shedding sheet cavity the addition of inflow turbulence does affect the shedding behaviour smaller parts of the sheet cavity are being shed at a higher frequency the predicted mean lift and drag match the numerical results reported in the literature while the predicted strouhal number is higher than the experimental value to the knowledge of the authors this is the first application of synthetic inflow turbulence to a test case including cavitation as part of future work it is desirable to improve the iterative convergence of the computations which was seen to reduce due to the interaction of cavitation and inflow turbulence secondly the influence of applying a symmetry plane at the foil midspan in order to reduce the domain size and thereby also the required number of grid cells should be further investigated when resolving turbulence the symmetry plane introduces a modelling error and with the inclusion of inflow turbulence this error becomes even larger being already present upstream of the wing it is also clear that further refined grids are a necessity to obtain a proper resolved boundary layer and properly capture transition behaviour with srs methods with respect to the validation the inclusion of more physics in the cfd computations leads to more stringent demands for experimental data it is recommended to not only measure integral quantities but also characteristics of the setup such as turbulence intensity and integral length scale and the flow in the boundary layer the absence of this information for the delft twist foil highlights the need for new experimental test cases aimed at
