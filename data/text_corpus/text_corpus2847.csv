heterogeneous photocatalytic process for treatment of organic pollutants in waste water doping these nanomaterials with polysulfone ps to prepared modified flat sheet membrane using phase inversion method 1 introduction nowadays water contamination has become a widespread issue the aspect of global water insufficiency is a vital need to prevent pollution of water resources from numerous impurities type 1 2 the aromatics fabric dyes pesticide and other industrial organic contaminants are not only visually disagreeable however are excessively toxic to some creatures consequently a procedure to clean the organic pollutants from the wastewater is a crucial requirement newly numerous techniques have been used to remove organic impurities from wastewater for instance physical procedures chemical oxidation photocatalytic methods electrochemical oxidation and biological usage 3 the former procedure is one of the greatest and favorable expertises for removing organic impurities due to its great proficiency with sunlight 4 5 the photocatalytic reaction show practical to environmental cleaning by using the oxidation of organic complexes via semiconductor materials for instance tio2 cds fe2o3 sio2 and zno 6 zno and tio2 are renowned catalysts in various photocatalytic reactions 7 between these numerous semiconductors the titanium dioxide tio2 have a higher photocatalytic activity non toxic showing suitable regular potential band vbp and chemically stable conversely these oxides absorb only a small portion of solar light and are little applied use 8 the photocatalytic activity of tio2 differs reliant on its crystallinity surface area particle size and the method of preparation 9 there are various methods for nanomaterials preparation such as sol gel 10 micro emulsion 11 and a hydrothermal method 12 among these processes the hydrothermal techniques is the most effective techniques for adjusting size and surface characteristics of nanomaterial s to create uniform nanoparticles with a high surface area further the hydrothermal technique does not require the use of organic solvents and considered an ecological friendly procedure wherever the preparation is achieved in a closed system 13 zno nps is a proper photo catalyst as it is non toxic and lower cost however its wide band gap eg necessitates an excitation in the uv expanse conversely a substantial excitation is delivered via sunlight which covers about 60 w of uv light irradiation 14 conversely abundant effort has been completed to enhance the photocatalytic efficacy of zno nps via reducing the band gap through doping with non metal 15 and noble metal 16 the photocatylitic activity of tio2 can be enhanced via the adding of sio2 which advances the obtainable surface area of the catalyst letting an increase adsorption of pollutant composites the enhanced adsorption of contaminant particles on the surface of sio2 consecutively developed the photocatalytic activity of tio2 sio2 doped oxides compared to pure tio2 moreover the adding of sio2 growths the quantity of surface adsorbed h2o and oh groups which affects the photocatalytic activity of tio2 sio2 doped oxides 17 furthermore the sio2 nps is added to the combination as a support substantial to improve the thermal strength of the photocatalyst and to enhance its surface acidity which is an effectual means of rising photocatalytic activity recently foremost challenge is to rearrange the ecb hvb recombination level to develop the tio2 photocatalyst proficiency and spread the absorption spectra to the visible region 18 this process generates a modification in the concentration of the electron or hole thus growing the charge carrier concentration and enhancing the conductivity of these materials an additional technique is to couple tio2 with a slight band gap semiconductors sio2 and or zno owning a higher conveyance band than that of tio2 the extensive band gap of tio2 is 3 2 ev which means that it can only be produced by uv light l 387 5 nm 19 consequently to decrease the energy gap of tio2 nps it should be doped with other metal oxides zno cds fe2o3 sio2 and sio2 to increase photocatalytic efficiency 20 the enhancement of observable light photocatalysis has come to be the greatest substantial topics in photocatalysis today and in the future research the photocatalytic activity of tio2 can be enhanced by doping with metal and non metal ions such as sio2 tio2 and zro2 tio2 tio2 zno and sio2 are the most oxides used in photocatalytic applications these oxides are considered as semi conductors with wide band gab 4 the sio2 tio2 ncs have much consideration 21 due to higher photocatalytic activity surface area surface acidity and thermal stability than pure tio2 22 23 the photocatalytic activity can be enhanced via growing the number of active places where the electron donor and acceptor are promoted and adsorbed in the photocatalytic reaction the effects of sio2 and zno nps contents on the photocatalytic activity of tio2 were also considered the photocatalytic activities of the prepared zno tio2 and sio2 tio2 ncs were compared with pure tio2 as a reference catalyst under the same conditions membrane separation technologies have been approximately beneficial for water cleaning 24 the greatest appropriate supportive membrane used in photocatalytic degradation is prepared from ps due to its thermal stability high mechanical and chemical properties by presenting these nanomaterials into the membrane structure several progressive properties can be achieved the former examination exhibited the improvement of the antifouling efficiencies and photocatalytic hydrophilicity and permeability of the ps membrane after the combination of tio2 nps 3 25 the tio2 ps ncs membrane was used for the elimination of cr vi as well as the subtraction of its toxicity via photocatalytic degradation 26 furthermore the membrane performances have been enhanced via doping of ncs such as zno tio2 7 sio2 go 27 al zno 28 ag zno 29 co zno 30 and graphene oxide silver ncs 31 this incorporation is mainly attributed to the growth of the visible area of the photocatalyst briefly the nanomaterials concentration embedded into the membrane surface is limited it is significant to consider the catalytic effect of the nanomaterials which are inserted inside the membrane the objective of this study is to fabricate and design the continuous flow pr for treatment of organic contaminants in wastewater using heterogeneous photocatalytic process the greatest advantage of this technique is lower maintenance costs and construction as well as it presented favorable results in degradation of organic contaminations from wastewaters preparation of zno and sio2 via a hydrothermal process and mixed with tio2 degussa aims to enhance the photocatalytic activity in sunlight these nanomaterials were incorporated with ps to synthesize the modified flat sheet membrane through the phase inversion process the characterization of the synthesized nanomaterials and membranes were carried out using particle size analyzer scanning electron microscope sem atr ftir spectroscopy and contact angle measurement also the efficiency of both synthetized polymeric ncs membranes and the pr were evaluated by studying the effect of different parameters these parameters included feed water ph flow rate oxygen content pollutant types and pollutant concentrations the pollutants such as phenolic compound and methyl orange were used as examples of organic pollutants this

the output samples are collected every 15 30 min the particulars regarding the continuous flow photoreactor structure of model unit are presented in fig 1a 2 3 anticipated photocatalytic mechanism of the continuous flow photoreactor according to photocatalytic theory we have advanced an anticipated reaction mechanism for the tio2 sio2 and tio2 zno catalyzed photo degradation of aqueous mo and phenol fig 1b under uv and or sun light the tio2 can decompose the organic compounds and generate substitutional carbon deficiencies 17 alike procedures of metal oxides doping have been displayed to decrease the band gap of catalysts such as sio2 and zno 7 32 the uv vis absorption spectrum of the tio2 doped sio2 and tio2 doped zno shows a red shift as compared with the spectrum of pure tio2 33 the tio2 sio2 and tio2 zno ncs are used as a photocatalysts they are capable of concurrent adsorption absorption of both the reactants the organic compounds and dissolved dioxygen and the required light energy fig 1b displays the represent the simple photocatalytic procedure in which excited electrons created via absorption of nearby the uv light are first shifted to the deficiency level at that time they absorb extra energy lower than that of the first excitation to relocation toward the transmission band using the creation of the excited state species tio2 sio2 and tio2 zno this excited state species is an additional significant redox reactant than usual tio2 because of the creation of electron hole pairs in addition to the holes and electrons in the tio2 sio2 and tio2 zno consequently react with o2 and oh molecules on the catalyst surface to form superoxide anion radicals o and oh radicals respectively the o2 radicals at that time interact with adsorbed h2o to create more oh radicals which are identified to be an influential oxidizing species which formerly interact with the methyl orange and or phenol compounds to decompose them by way of the dissociation of the organic compounds improvements the adsorption balance is shifted and more methyl orange and or phenol compounds can passage from aqueous solution to the catalyst boundary where it is consequently dissociated this anticipated mechanism is partially depend on various published studies regarding the creation of oh radicals throughout photocatalytic procedure 34 in this work operational photocatalytic removal of mo and or phenol from aqueous solutions was reported using ps tio2 ncs membrane under uv light irradiation tio2 is a nontoxic material with high photocatalytic activity in visible light tio2 absorbs onto the surface of the membrane leading to in situ generation of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 which acts as activating agent the incorporation of tio2 with ps membrane can improve the negative surface charge of the ps membrane which improves the degradation capabilities of the membrane surface due to the presence of reactive oxygen species such as o2 h2o2 and ho radicals generated by tio2 or the direct uv illumination 35 in the presence of tio2 nps photocatalytic reactions take place at the coating surface with oxygen and water these radicals have photocatalytic activities that destroy various toxic organic pollutants and oxidize organs 36 the photocatalytic activities of the ps tio2 ncs membrane under uv light irradiation take place based on the following mechanism 37 1 h m o d y e d y e o x i d a t i o n o f s u b s t r a t e m o d y e 2 o r g a n i c p o l l u tan t s d y e o h s e m i c o n d u c t o r u v l i g h t deg r a d a t i o n

dissolved in 20 ml of deionized water 16 ml of a 5 m naoh solution was added dropwise to the zinc chloride solution while gently stirring for a period of 60 min at 50 c during this period 1 5 g of sls was dissolved in 15 ml of distilled water di and was added to the zinc chloride mixture 13 sls shows a vital role in the adjustment of the zno particles and doings as an insulator between the nanoparticles letting them overcome the interacting forces between them to create a uniform distribution a white precipitate performs directly upon mixing the zinc chloride solution the mixture was moved into a teflon stainless steel autoclave volume 80 ml and filled with deionized water up to 80 of the reactor volume for hydrothermal treatment at 120 c for 5 h then stainless steel autoclave was permissible to cool down naturally the suspended zno nps were centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 15 min and collected as a white precipitate the precipitates were washed 2 3 times with deionized water and

ratios 1 1 1 2 and 2 1 2 4 2 synthesis of nanocomposite membranes the freshly microporous ps substrate was prepared just before use through the phase inversion method the ps membrane was cast from a homogeneous polymer solution containing 18wt ps and 82wt dmac 40 tio2 nps or mixtures of tio2 with different metal oxide 0 16 wt were doped with 20 ml of dmac the mixture was sonicated for 3 h at 25 c in sonication cell to confirm a homogeneous spread of the nanoparticles then the mixture was stirred with the rest amount of the solvent containing18wt ps for 8 h at 60 80 c to have best dispersions of the nanoparticles in the polymer matrix these membranes will be used as support layers ps will be stirred and heated till the polymer mixture was totally dissolved and then degassing was achieved in an ultrasonic water bath the resulting polymer solution was reserved in the atmosphere until the temperature of the polymer solution reached room temperature and cast to the desired thicknesses

tio2 zno and tio2 sio2 ncs are presented in fig 2 the peaks at 3420 cm 1 and 1620 cm 1 are due to the stretching vibration and twisting vibration of the oh group respectively these beaks is related to si oh or ti oh this peaks still prevails even though the sample was calcined at high temperature due to si oh presence is the physically absorbed water molecules from the environs via silica 42 43 the presence of sio2 is verified by absorption bands at 958 cm 1 si oh stretching vibrations and symmetric si o si stretching vibrations at 796 cm 1 44 the absorption peak at 1058 cm 1 is ascribed to the asymmetric si o ti stretching vibration 45 furthermore the peak at 672 cm 1 can be owed to stretching vibrations of tio the peak at 440 cm 1 is the stretching vibration of siosi and tioti 46 mendez vivar et al 2001 these outcomes point to ti element have been effectively incorporated into the matrix of the sio2 shell thus enhancing a hydrophilic property of sio2 shell the surface morphology of the tio2 nps tio2 zno and tio2 sio2 ncs were characterized by scanning electron microscopy sem fig 3 the sem image of tio2 nps shows it in the form of spots with the size ranges from 10 to 30 nm with an average 16 5 nm and appears as spheres in shapes fig 3a moreover the chemical reactivity of the nanoparticles has a tendency to be developed through reducing particle size owing to improve in the surface to volume ratio 7 fig 3b and c of the sem images of tio2 zno ncs and the sem images of tio2 sio2 ncs are also showed with the different ratio in fig 3d f it can be seen that the tio2 sio2 ncs have a diameter of around 58 nm and it shows a spherical and rougher surface if compared to tio2 zno meanwhile as can be seen in fig 3e f sio2 layers have a porous structure onto the surface of tio2 nps the xrd diffraction patterns of tio2 tio2 sio2 and tio2 zno ncs are shown in fig 4 the degree of crystallinity of tio2 tio2 sio2 and tio2 zno ncs was evaluated qualitatively via x ray diffraction by determination of the area of the scattering peaks presented in it was observed that all of the xrd configurations of the nanoparticles are relatively similar the peaks corresponding to the anatase tio2 phase were appeared at 2θ 25 2 37 8 48 0 54 5 and 62 6 a weak peak at 2θ 27 5 represent the rutile form 47 there are sharp and strong peaks of anatase phase 2θ 25 2 in the xrd patterns of all samples 48 also the peaks corresponding to zno nps are indexed as 31 82 34 54 36 42 47 46 56 74 62 92 66 06 68 42 69 06 and 78 82 respectively all diffusion peaks of the sample are corresponding to the typical hexagonal wurtzite configuration of zno nps similarly x ray diffraction pattern was described by 49 the peak at 11 52 for sls surfactant indicates that some impurities of sls found in zno nps table 1 showing that the crystallinity of the tio2 nps decreases after doping with sio2 and zno nps 38 39 fig 5 shows a histogram of the outcomes gotten from the measurements of the particle size distribution psd of tio2 tio2 zno and tio2 sio2 ncs it is obvious that the mean diameter and standard deviation values of the tio2 nps size were 42 8 nm and 30 nm 69 8 fig 5a the mean diameter and standard deviation values of the tio2 zno ncs size were 109 9 nm and 65 5 nm 59 9 fig 5b the mean diameter and standard deviation values of the tio2 sio2 ncs size were 91 5 nm and 56 2 nm 61 4 fig 5c which are in contract with the preceding magnitudes attained from the sem results 3 1 2 characterizations of the nanocomposite membranes the ft ir spectra of neat ps ps tio2 ps tio2 zno and ps tio2 sio2 ncs membranes are existing in fig 6 the ft ir curves show a peak band seeming at 721 cm 1 due to the ch bond in the aromatic group the presences of hydrogen bending of para substituted aromatic groups are shown at the absorption band at 871 cm 1 the spectrum band was observed at 1241 cm 1 which can be attributed to the stretching vibration of the coc in the aryl ether group the appearance of asymmetric stretching vibration band 1340 cm 1 is due to oso groups of neat ps 50 the detected band around 1595 cm 1 is mainly due to the rotation of the cc of the benzene ring furthermore the absorption peaks at434 and 505cm 1 confirm the presence of the stretching vibration band of tioti 51 for the ps tio2 ps tio2 zno and ps tio2 sio2 ncs membranes the incorporation of tio2 sio2 ncs is confirmed by absorption bands at 970 and 792 cm 1 due to the stretching vibrations band of sioh and siosi respectively 52 onto the ps tio2 sio2 ncs membrane moreover the absorption peaks of the synthesized ps tio2 zno ncs membrane at 439 635 691 and 716 cm 1 can be assigned to significant absorption peaks of zno and ti o 53 onto the ps tio2 zno ncs membrane the detected band around 556 cm 1 is corresponding to stretching vibration of zno nps the appearance of the stretching band around 1584 cm 1 which confirms the hoh bending vibration comes from the atmospheric moisture 7 in conclusion these peaks confirmed the successful combination of tio2 tio2 zno and tio2 sio2 ncs onto the ps membranes 3 1 3 morphology analysis of membranes sem was used to detect the membrane surface morphology of each membrane including neat ps ps tio2 ps tio2 zno and ps tio2 sio2 ncs membranes with a different magnification respectively fig 7 a c display the ps support layer is porous with a nano metric pore size and a smooth surface it can be shown from fig 7d l that the membranes surfaces have a nano metric pore size and a smooth surface and with higher magnification there are several white spots on the ncs membrane surfaces this demonstrates that tio2 tio2 zno and tio2 sio2 ncs particles are uniformly dispersed in the membranes surfaces moreover from figs 7d l it can be detected that tio2 tio2 zno and tio2 sio2 ncs are inserted in the membranes tissue nonetheless the tio2 tio2 zno and tio2 sio2 ncs have a propensity of agglomeration onto the membrane surfaces furthermore ps tio2 ps tio2 zno and ps tio2 sio2 ncs membranes have several networks confirming contaminants diffuse and pass through the networks these networks of ps tio2 ps tio2 zno and ps tio2 sio2 ncs membranes can improve the mass removal of organic impurities confirming the restriction of the ncs membranes with better photocatalytic properties as well as they have positively prepared the water contact angle wca θ is the greatest shared factor used to describe the hydrophilicity of membrane surfaces hydrophilic membranes have a wca of 0 θ 90 while hydrophobic membranes have a ca of 90 θ 180 in fig 8 the mean wca for the neat ps ps tio2 ps tio2 sio2 and ps tio2 zno ncs membranes were 71 2 2 44 7 2 41 4 2 3 and 57 32 1 8 respectively demonstrating they have a hydrophilic surface which could reflect the antifouling competency of the membranes fig 8 shows the lower wca of neat ps tio2 membrane 44 7 2 due to the hydroxyl group of the tio2 nps which improves the membrane surface hydrophilicity the decreasing in the wca of ps tio2 sio2 ncs membrane with incorporation of tio2 sio2 ncs materials leads to the higher surface hydrophilicity the enhancement of wac may be attributed to the combination of sio2 nps which responsible for the hydrogen bonds with hydroxyl groups and adsorb water molecules on the tio2 sio2 surface 54 this consideration approves that hydrophilicity and wettability of the ps tio2 sio2 ncs membrane could be enhanced by the incorporation of hydrophilic inorganic tio2 sio2 ncs into the polymer structure during membrane fabrication the improved hydrophilicity of the ps tio2 sio2 ncs membrane may be due to a greater attraction of water molecules by the nanomaterials and to the presence of energetic hydrophilic efficient groups on the membranes surfaces on the other hand the membrane hydrophilicity decreased upon doping of the zno nps to the ncs membrane when compared to the neat ps tio2 membrane the mechanical properties of neat ps ps tio2 ps tio2 zno and ps tio2 sio2 ncs membranes are revealed in table 2 and the stress strain curves are shown in fig 9 the ps tio2 zno and ps tio2 sio2 ncs membranes show enhanced stress mpa and strain when compared to the neat ps and ps tio2 ncs membrane the membranes have stress mpa and strain values in the following order ps tio2 zno ps tio2 sio2 ps tio2 neat ps ncs membranes the membranes have young s modulus mpa values in the following order neat ps tio2 neat ps ps tio2 sio2 ps tio2 zno ncs membranes the enhancement in the mechanical properties of ps tio2 zno ncs membranes is mostly owing to the cross linked polymeric structure in the rigid aromatic structure in the membrane backbone and the incorporation of inorganic ncs onto the polymeric membrane causing increased flexibility and strength in addition to the incorporation of zno nps addicted to the membrane creates it more crystalline and the crystalline membrane is more solid than the amorphous ones as well as improves the rigidity of the membrane chain 13 the mechanical properties of the ncs membrane are contingent mostly on the membrane inter molecular forces functional along the membrane backbone 55 the development of the ps tio2 sio2 ncs membrane may be due to the titania silica bond structure through tio and sio bonds which improve the membrane mechanical properties and enhanced the polymeric backbone 54 the embedding of tio2 sio2 ncs to the polymeric membrane improved the tensile strength due to the ti o si bonds structure which reinforced the network structure due to the more porous silicon oxide 56 3 2 performance evaluation of photocatalytic process 3 2 1 factors affecting photocatalytic nanocomposite membranes after the system reaches equilibrium depending upon the nature concentration of the organic compound and the flow rate as specified via identical inlet outlet mo and or phenol concentration the uv light is turned on the outlet sample is then collected manually at regular intervals time the steady state is achieved around 30 min after finishing the experimentations the photoreactor is flushed under uv light for 1 h using di water the photocatalytic removal of mo and or phenol is take place at a built up scale by means of prototype unit with sample flow rate changing from 20 to 80 m3 h in photocatalytic degradation of mo and or phenol as a wastewaters model using different synthesized ps tio2 membrane was considered to examine the activity of synthesized ncs membranes for degradation of an organic impurity below uv radiation the outcomes were achieved using different parameters such as the solution ph was ranged from 4 to 10 flow rate of motor speed ranged from 20 to 80 m3 h at 5 to 20 hz respectively mo and or phenol concentrations of 1 to 7 mg l different concentrations of tio2 extended from 0 2 to 0 4 wt and various concentration of h2o2 extended from 0 1 to 2 see fig 10 the experiments were prepared at room temperature 25 c with interval time ranged from 0 to 180 min because the time of the degradation efficiency is an imperative factor in the photocatalytic procedure in uv light radiation the ph is a considerable factor in the assessment of photocatalytic activity in an aqueous solution the effect of ph was deliberate via keeping all other experimental circumstances constant and changing the initial ph value the initial ph plays an essential role in photocatalytic activity it is responsible for the separation of active functional sites on the catalyst and adsorbent to evaluate the influence of ph on the charge possessions of the semiconductor and photocatlytic degradation of phenol using ps tio2 ncs membrane to conclude the optimum ph for the degradation of phenol the effect of ph was considered in the range 4 10 keeping all other factors constant the phenol removal increases with raising ph to reach the higher degradation at ph 7 fig 10a the consequences show that the degradation efficiency of ps tio2 membrane increased at ph 7 the difference of the pollutants ph effects on the changes of the external charge of tio2 nps and shifts the potentials of catalytic reactions under alkaline or acidic circumstance the tio2 nps surfaces can be deprotonated or protonated respectively according to the following equations 5 and 6 tio2 is described to possess a greater oxidizing activity at lower ph nevertheless additional h at very low ph can reduce the reaction rate however in alkaline ph under columbic force aims revulsion among oh ions and the negatively charged surface of the catalyst thus preventing the formation of oh radicals and reducing the degradation hence the optimization of ph is essential for better degradation results 57 furthermore the ps tio2 membrane surface becomes negatively charged at ph 7 while the phenolic compound and mo have static positive charge therefore the degradation efficiency of ps tio2 membrane increased at ph 7 fig 10a this is mainly due to the formation of oh radicals by photoholes oh is a strong oxidizing specie in advanced oxidation processes aops while at ph 7 both ps tio2 membrane surface and the organic pollutants become negatively charged and repulsive forces appeared therefore reducing the photocatalytic activity and degradation efficiency of ps tio2 membrane 14 the degradation efficiency of ps tio2 membrane decreased at ph 7 due to the presence of h ions on the membrane and catalyst surfaces which declined the photocatalytic activity and degradation efficiency of ps tio2 membrane the adsorption of ps tio2 membrane was estimated via exposure the membrane to mo dyes for a certain time ranged from 0 to 90 min without uv light irradiation and calculates the adsorption of the dye onto the ps tio2 membrane surface it is found that the adsorption reached the steady state at 30 min 5 tioh h tioh2 6 tioh oh tio h2o to examine the influence of residence time on the removal efficiency of phenol three flow rates 20 40 and 80 m3 h at 5 10 and 20 hrtz respectively are estimated at different time intervals from 0 to 180 min the photocatalytic efficiency depends mainly on the electrical panel with a variable speed drive for the feed pump motor speed flow rate fig 10b the photocatalytic efficiency increases at a low motor speed equal 5hrtz 20 m3 h in ps tio2 membrane conversely the photocatalytic degradation decreases with the speed flow rate increase due to the acceleration of the photocatalytic reaction with increasing the fed solution flow rate it is concluded that the degradation efficiency decreased when the flow rate increased the feed flow rate is inversely proportional to the photocatylitic efficiency this is mainly attributed to at lower flow rate various photoactive sites continue available for the reaction 36 at higher flow rate the photoactive sites tend to a limit which can be described via the rise of unavailable sites the procedure at higher flow rate becomes a systematized chemical stage consequently it is showed that residence time is an important factor for the application of ps tio2 photocatalytic expertise for wastewater treatment fig 10b showed that the removal efficiency of pollutants increases with decreasing flow rate the flow rate of the feed solution depends mainly on its viscosity and concentrations the photocatalytic reaction rates may be dependent on the bulk feed solution to the catalyst mass diffusion 58 there are two evident aspects get up from affecting feed flow rate on the photocatalytic degradation process firstly is the availability of the ps tio2 surface to the phenol and the photons and secondly is a significant effect of the exterior mass diffusion resistance mostly at low feed flow rates owing to the increasing dispersion size of the reactant the mo and or phenol from the solution to the ps tio2 surface therefore its observable that flow rate plays an essential role in the degradation procedure for low flow rates the feed water flow is little the oxygen species is greatly more capable of getting into interaction with a ps tio2 membrane surface additionally a feed water flow contributes to satisfactory uv light intensity however for higher flow rates the feed water flow increases which has the difficulty of photon in going into the ps tio2 membrane surface conversely increasing the feed flow rate also indicates to a higher mass diffusion especially with higher mass diffusion and electron hole recombination there was an improve of contaminant degradation the effect of initial concentration of methyl orange mo dye are ranging from 1 to 7 mg l on degradation efficiency was considered using ps tio2 membrane at flow rate 5hrtz 20 m3 h and ph 7 as shown in fig 10c the consequences exhibited that with increasing the mo concentration from 1 mg l to 7 mg l the degradation efficiency increased in fig 10c it is found that as the mo concentration and the time exposure increase the degradation efficiency increases this result may be due to that the oh radicals should be mainly formed from the adsorbed ho and h2o molecules by electron donation to the photogenerated holes the rate of the determination step of the reaction could be the formation of oh radicals since they react very rapidly with aromatic ring compound 59 the influence of initial phenol concentration ranging from 1 to7 mg l on the rate of degradation efficiency was deliberate by means of ps tio2 ncs membrane at flow rate 5hrtz 20 m3 h and ph 7 as shown in fig 10d it is clear that with increasing the initial concentration of phenol from 1 mg l to 7 mg l the degradation efficiency increase fig 10e shows the photo degradation results using ps membrane doped with diverse concentrations of tio2 nps the operation conditions included dye concentration equal to 20 mg l reaction time ranged from 0 to 180 min ph value equals 5 it was believed that as the quantity of catalyst improves the number of dye molecules engrosses and the numbers of photons absorbed were increased due to an increase in the number of catalyst particles the rate of photo degradation reaction improves via increasing the quantity of tio2 nps and reaches its exciting at 0 4 wt this indicates that the increase in catalyst amount actually increases the number of active spots on the photocatalyst surface thus casing an increase in the number of oh radicals is responsible for the organic pollutant degradations 60 the examination searcher shows that oh radicals are the highest active species in the photocatalytic procedure to improve the quantity of active species we added hydrogen peroxide h2o2 as oxidant agents hydrogen peroxide is a chemical compound with the formula h2o2 it is a clear liquid slightly more viscous than water hydrogen peroxide is the simplest peroxide a compound with an oxygen oxygen single bond it is used as an oxidizer agent and antiseptic with the adding of h2o2 and the adsorption desorption equilibrium was reached the photocatalytic degradation procedure was rapidly increasing this mainly owing to the added h2o2 was first adsorbed on the ps tio2 membrane surface which contributed to the amount of organic compound mo and or phenol desorption thus the observed mo and or phenol concentration declined much more rapidly because of the existence of h2o2 fig 10f showed that 2 wt h2o2 was the optimal concentration in the ps tio2 uv h2o2 system which was enhanced than the other concentration the photocatalytic efficiency was increased by the addition of h2o2 with a small amount which accelerates the reaction rate of the ps tio2 membranes and reaches its maximum degradation at 2 wt fig 10f the ps tio2 h2o2 uv procedure is more effective than the ps tio2 uv radiation procedure for organic compound mo and or phenol degradation due to influence of oh and o the results highlighted that with adding h2o2 shows an improvement of organic compound mo and or phenol degradation rate the mineralization of organic compound i e elimination of toc from an aqueous solution is presented in fig 10g the degradation of mo dye was monitored via toc estimation where the toc calculated as organic matter it is found that the organic matter increased with increasing the degradation efficiency as in fig 10g compared to the degradation efficiency mineralization is dawdling which is also confirmed via 61 0 043 of the organic matter of mo was estimated after 30 min of the reaction time while the removal efficiency reached 12 5 observably the degradation produces of the mo dyes definitely still exist in the aqueous solution the organic matter reached 0 0725 with efficiency 13 5 after 180 mints using 7 mg l methyl orange as a pollutant model under uv light and at flow rate 20 m3 h 5 hz the results gotten in this study matched with 61 for their total removal the period of uv light exposure should be elongated a lower elimination of toc content as organic matter was expected as the advanced intermediates contend with the initial mo dye molecules throughout the degradation procedure furthermore the slow kinetics of mo dye degradation afterward a certain time may be clarified via the exertion in changing the nitrogen atoms of the dyes into oxidized nitrogen complexes as anticipated in sakthivel et al 62 as well as the presence of the higher number of azo groups in mo dyes molecules delay the degradation procedure 3 2 2 the enhancement of photocatalytic activity of ps tio2 nanocomposite membranes in this study ps mixed with tio2 zno and tio2 sio2 ncs with different ratios 1 1 1 2 and 2 1 the best ratios are tio2 doped zno 1 1 wt gives ps tio2 zno ncs membrane i and ps mixed with tio2 doped sio2 2 1 wt resulting ps tio2 sio2 ncs membrane ii fig 11 a shows that the performance of photo degradation increases in case of ncs membrane i under uv light in case of phenol and mo than in case of visible light for both phenol and mo respectively this is due to that the band boundaries of these semiconductor materials is lying in the uv area which creates them inactive below visible light irradiation fig 11b shows that the photo degradation performance improved in case of ncs membrane ii under uv light in case of phenol and mo than in case of visible light for both phenol and mo respectively this is owing to that the band boundaries of these semiconductor materials lie in the uv area which creates them less active in visible light irradiation fig 11c shows the effect of the addition of h2o2 1 wt concentration on the photo degradation performance of ncs membrane i under visible light for both phenol and mo the fig 11c indicates that the degradation efficiency improved in the case of phenol 52 3 after 180 min than in the case of mo dye 42 9 after 180 min fig 11d shows the effect of the addition of h2o2 1 wt concentration on the photo degradation performance of ncs membrane ii under visible light for both phenol and mo the fig 11d indicates that the degradation efficiency improved in the case of mo 97 after 180 min than in the case of phenol 95 after 180 min 4 conclusions the innovation of this work is to fabricate and design the continuous flow pr for treatment of organic impurities in

of both synthetized polymeric ncs membranes and the continuous pr were evaluated by studying the influence of various parameters these parameters included feed water ph motor speed flow rate oxygen content pollutant types and pollutant concentrations the impurities as methyl orange and phenol compound were used as a model of organic pollutants the achieved results indicated that the ps tio2 zno ncs membrane i showed a degradation of 72 and 16 5 in the case of phenol and mo under ultraviolet light respectively conversely the degradation was 30 and 11 in the case of phenol and mo under visible light respectively moreover the ps tio2 sio2 ncs membrane ii was able to degrade 18 1 and 40 3 in the case of phenol under uv radiation and visible light respectively the performance was enhanced by increase the oxygen content i e the addition of h2o2 and the degradation was 97 and 95 under visible light in case of mo and phenol respectively using ps tio2 sio2 ncs membrane ii it was also realized that the presence of h2o2 leads to an improvement of removal efficiency of the organic compound mo and or phenol a superior photocatalytic degradation enactment is perceived when using continuous flow pr and ps tio2 sio2 ncs membrane ii because it had a good stability with a developed photocatalytic activity we expect that this procedure is good as a favorable photocatalysts in the treatment of

heterogeneous photocatalytic process for treatment of organic pollutants in waste water doping these nanomaterials with polysulfone ps to prepared modified flat sheet membrane using phase inversion method 1 introduction nowadays water contamination has become a widespread issue the aspect of global water insufficiency is a vital need to prevent pollution of water resources from numerous impurities type 1 2 the aromatics fabric dyes pesticide and other industrial organic contaminants are not only visually disagreeable however are excessively toxic to some creatures consequently a procedure to clean the organic pollutants from the wastewater is a crucial requirement newly numerous techniques have been used to remove organic impurities from wastewater for instance physical procedures chemical oxidation photocatalytic methods electrochemical oxidation and biological usage 3 the former procedure is one of the greatest and favorable expertises for removing organic impurities due to its great proficiency with sunlight 4 5 the photocatalytic reaction show practical to environmental cleaning by using the oxidation of organic complexes via semiconductor materials for instance tio2 cds fe2o3 sio2 and zno 6 zno and tio2 are renowned catalysts in various photocatalytic reactions 7 between these numerous semiconductors the titanium dioxide tio2 have a higher photocatalytic activity non toxic showing suitable regular potential band vbp and chemically stable conversely these oxides absorb only a small portion of solar light and are little applied use 8 the photocatalytic activity of tio2 differs reliant on its crystallinity surface area particle size and the method of preparation 9 there are various methods for nanomaterials preparation such as sol gel 10 micro emulsion 11 and a hydrothermal method 12 among these processes the hydrothermal techniques is the most effective techniques for adjusting size and surface characteristics of nanomaterial s to create uniform nanoparticles with a high surface area further the hydrothermal technique does not require the use of organic solvents and considered an ecological friendly procedure wherever the preparation is achieved in a closed system 13 zno nps is a proper photo catalyst as it is non toxic and lower cost however its wide band gap eg necessitates an excitation in the uv expanse conversely a substantial excitation is delivered via sunlight which covers about 60 w of uv light irradiation 14 conversely abundant effort has been completed to enhance the photocatalytic efficacy of zno nps via reducing the band gap through doping with non metal 15 and noble metal 16 the photocatylitic activity of tio2 can be enhanced via the adding of sio2 which advances the obtainable surface area of the catalyst letting an increase adsorption of pollutant composites the enhanced adsorption of contaminant particles on the surface of sio2 consecutively developed the photocatalytic activity of tio2 sio2 doped oxides compared to pure tio2 moreover the adding of sio2 growths the quantity of surface adsorbed h2o and oh groups which affects the photocatalytic activity of tio2 sio2 doped oxides 17 furthermore the sio2 nps is added to the combination as a support substantial to improve the thermal strength of the photocatalyst and to enhance its surface acidity which is an effectual means of rising photocatalytic activity recently foremost challenge is to rearrange the ecb hvb recombination level to develop the tio2 photocatalyst proficiency and spread the absorption spectra to the visible region 18 this process generates a modification in the concentration of the electron or hole thus growing the charge carrier concentration and enhancing the conductivity of these materials an additional technique is to couple tio2 with a slight band gap semiconductors sio2 and or zno owning a higher conveyance band than that of tio2 the extensive band gap of tio2 is 3 2 ev which means that it can only be produced by uv light l 387 5 nm 19 consequently to decrease the energy gap of tio2 nps it should be doped with other metal oxides zno cds fe2o3 sio2 and sio2 to increase photocatalytic efficiency 20 the enhancement of observable light photocatalysis has come to be the greatest substantial topics in photocatalysis today and in the future research the photocatalytic activity of tio2 can be enhanced by doping with metal and non metal ions such as sio2 tio2 and zro2 tio2 tio2 zno and sio2 are the most oxides used in photocatalytic applications these oxides are considered as semi conductors with wide band gab 4 the sio2 tio2 ncs have much consideration 21 due to higher photocatalytic activity surface area surface acidity and thermal stability than pure tio2 22 23 the photocatalytic activity can be enhanced via growing the number of active places where the electron donor and acceptor are promoted and adsorbed in the photocatalytic reaction the effects of sio2 and zno nps contents on the photocatalytic activity of tio2 were also considered the photocatalytic activities of the prepared zno tio2 and sio2 tio2 ncs were compared with pure tio2 as a reference catalyst under the same conditions membrane separation technologies have been approximately beneficial for water cleaning 24 the greatest appropriate supportive membrane used in photocatalytic degradation is prepared from ps due to its thermal stability high mechanical and chemical properties by presenting these nanomaterials into the membrane structure several progressive properties can be achieved the former examination exhibited the improvement of the antifouling efficiencies and photocatalytic hydrophilicity and permeability of the ps membrane after the combination of tio2 nps 3 25 the tio2 ps ncs membrane was used for the elimination of cr vi as well as the subtraction of its toxicity via photocatalytic degradation 26 furthermore the membrane performances have been enhanced via doping of ncs such as zno tio2 7 sio2 go 27 al zno 28 ag zno 29 co zno 30 and graphene oxide silver ncs 31 this incorporation is mainly attributed to the growth of the visible area of the photocatalyst briefly the nanomaterials concentration embedded into the membrane surface is limited it is significant to consider the catalytic effect of the nanomaterials which are inserted inside the membrane the objective of this study is to fabricate and design the continuous flow pr for treatment of organic contaminants in wastewater using heterogeneous photocatalytic process the greatest advantage of this technique is lower maintenance costs and construction as well as it presented favorable results in degradation of organic contaminations from wastewaters preparation of zno and sio2 via a hydrothermal process and mixed with tio2 degussa aims to enhance the photocatalytic activity in sunlight these nanomaterials were incorporated with ps to synthesize the modified flat sheet membrane through the phase inversion process the characterization of the synthesized nanomaterials and membranes were carried out using particle size analyzer scanning electron microscope sem atr ftir spectroscopy and contact angle measurement also the efficiency of both synthetized polymeric ncs membranes and the pr were evaluated by studying the effect of different parameters these parameters included feed water ph flow rate oxygen content pollutant types and pollutant concentrations the pollutants such as phenolic compound and methyl orange were used as examples of organic pollutants this

the feed flows directly over the ps membrane surface with flow rates ranging from 10 to 80m3 h the continuous flow photoreactor is fabricated with seven uv lamps to make sure good radiation dispersion fig 1a a sylvania uva lamp f40w 2ft t12 bl368 with a tube length of 55 cm and was fixed onto the carrier trolley the fabricated system was illuminated with a 365 nm uv lamps the flow rate is organized via a flow meter ittu integrated technology transfer unit the photocatalytic degradation efficiency of mo and or phenol through each test is measured when steady state values are touched after 30 min the output samples are collected every 15 30 min the particulars regarding the continuous flow photoreactor structure of model unit are presented in fig 1a 2 3 anticipated photocatalytic mechanism of the continuous flow photoreactor according to photocatalytic theory we have advanced an anticipated reaction mechanism for the tio2 sio2 and tio2 zno catalyzed photo degradation of aqueous mo and phenol fig 1b under uv and or sun light the tio2 can decompose the organic compounds and generate substitutional carbon deficiencies 17 alike procedures of metal oxides doping have been displayed to decrease the band gap of catalysts such as sio2 and zno 7 32 the uv vis absorption spectrum of the tio2 doped sio2 and tio2 doped zno shows a red shift as compared with the spectrum of pure tio2 33 the tio2 sio2 and tio2 zno ncs are used as a photocatalysts they are capable of concurrent adsorption absorption of both the reactants the organic compounds and dissolved dioxygen and the required light energy fig 1b displays the represent the simple photocatalytic procedure in which excited electrons created via absorption of nearby the uv light are first shifted to the deficiency level at that time they absorb extra energy lower than that of the first excitation to relocation toward the transmission band using the creation of the excited state species tio2 sio2 and tio2 zno this excited state species is an additional significant redox reactant than usual tio2 because of the creation of electron hole pairs in addition to the holes and electrons in the tio2 sio2 and tio2 zno consequently react with o2 and oh molecules on the catalyst surface to form superoxide anion radicals o and oh radicals respectively the o2 radicals at that time interact with adsorbed h2o to create more oh radicals which are identified to be an influential oxidizing species which formerly interact with the methyl orange and or phenol compounds to decompose them by way of the dissociation of the organic compounds improvements the adsorption balance is shifted and more methyl orange and or phenol compounds can passage from aqueous solution to the catalyst boundary where it is consequently dissociated this anticipated mechanism is partially depend on various published studies regarding the creation of oh radicals throughout photocatalytic procedure 34 in this work operational photocatalytic removal of mo and or phenol from aqueous solutions was reported using ps tio2 ncs membrane under uv light irradiation tio2 is a nontoxic material with high photocatalytic activity in visible light tio2 absorbs onto the surface of the membrane leading to in situ generation of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 which acts as activating agent the incorporation of tio2 with ps membrane can improve the negative surface charge of the ps membrane which improves the degradation capabilities of the membrane surface due to the presence of reactive oxygen species such as o2 h2o2 and ho radicals generated by tio2 or the direct uv illumination 35 in the presence of tio2 nps photocatalytic reactions take place at the coating surface with oxygen and water these radicals have photocatalytic activities that destroy various toxic organic pollutants and oxidize organs 36 the photocatalytic activities of the ps tio2 ncs membrane under uv light irradiation take place based on the following mechanism 37 1 h m o d y e d y e o x i d a t i o n o f s u b s t r a t e m o d y e 2 o r g a n i c p o l l u tan t s d y e o h s e m i c o n d u c t o r u v l i g h t deg r a d a t i o n

sio2 nanoparticles were prepared via the hydrothermal method which does not need the use of organic solvents and can be considered an ecologically friendly procedure three grams of zinc chloride was dissolved in 20 ml of deionized water 16 ml of a 5 m naoh solution was added dropwise to the zinc chloride solution while gently stirring for a period of 60 min at 50 c during this period 1 5 g of sls was dissolved in 15 ml of distilled water di and was added to the zinc chloride mixture 13 sls shows a vital role in the adjustment of the zno particles and doings as an insulator between the nanoparticles letting them overcome the interacting forces between them to create a uniform distribution a white precipitate performs directly upon mixing the zinc chloride solution the mixture was moved into a teflon stainless steel autoclave volume 80 ml and filled with deionized water up to 80 of the reactor volume for hydrothermal treatment at 120 c for 5 h then stainless steel autoclave was

tio2 zno and tio2 sio2 ncs are presented in fig 2 the peaks at 3420 cm 1 and 1620 cm 1 are due to the stretching vibration and twisting vibration of the oh group respectively these beaks is related to si oh or ti oh this peaks still prevails even though the sample was calcined at high temperature due to si oh presence is the physically absorbed water molecules from the environs via silica 42 43 the presence of sio2 is verified by absorption bands at 958 cm 1 si oh stretching vibrations and symmetric si o si stretching vibrations at 796 cm 1 44 the absorption peak at 1058 cm 1 is ascribed to the asymmetric si o ti stretching vibration 45 furthermore the peak at 672 cm 1 can be owed to stretching vibrations of tio the peak at 440 cm 1 is the stretching vibration of siosi and tioti 46 mendez vivar et al 2001 these outcomes point to ti element have been effectively incorporated into the matrix of the sio2 shell thus enhancing a hydrophilic property of sio2 shell the surface morphology of the tio2 nps tio2 zno and tio2 sio2 ncs were characterized by scanning electron microscopy sem fig 3 the sem image of tio2 nps shows it in the form of spots with the size ranges from 10 to 30 nm with an average 16 5 nm and appears as spheres in shapes fig 3a moreover the chemical reactivity of the nanoparticles has a tendency to be developed through reducing particle size owing to improve in the surface to volume ratio 7 fig 3b and c of the sem images of tio2 zno ncs and the sem images of tio2 sio2 ncs are also showed with the different ratio in fig 3d f it can be seen that the tio2 sio2 ncs have a diameter of around 58 nm and it shows a spherical and rougher surface if compared to tio2 zno meanwhile as can be seen in fig 3e f sio2 layers have a porous structure onto the surface of tio2 nps the xrd diffraction patterns of tio2 tio2 sio2 and tio2 zno ncs are shown in fig 4 the degree of crystallinity of tio2 tio2 sio2 and tio2 zno ncs was evaluated qualitatively via x ray diffraction by determination of the area of the scattering peaks presented in it was observed that all of the xrd configurations of the nanoparticles are relatively similar the peaks corresponding to the anatase tio2 phase were appeared at 2θ 25 2 37 8 48 0 54 5 and 62 6 a weak peak at 2θ 27 5 represent the rutile form 47 there are sharp and strong peaks of anatase phase 2θ 25 2 in the xrd patterns of all samples 48 also the peaks corresponding to zno nps are indexed as 31 82 34 54 36 42 47 46 56 74 62 92 66 06 68 42 69 06 and 78 82 respectively all diffusion peaks of the sample are corresponding to the typical hexagonal wurtzite configuration of zno nps similarly x ray diffraction pattern was described by 49 the peak at 11 52 for sls surfactant indicates that some impurities of sls found in zno nps table 1 showing that the crystallinity of the tio2 nps decreases after doping with sio2 and zno nps 38 39 fig 5 shows a histogram of the outcomes gotten from the measurements of the particle size distribution psd of tio2 tio2 zno and tio2 sio2 ncs it is obvious that the mean diameter and standard deviation values of the tio2 nps size were 42 8 nm and 30 nm 69 8 fig 5a the mean diameter and standard deviation values of the tio2 zno ncs size were 109 9 nm and 65 5 nm 59 9 fig 5b the mean diameter and standard deviation values of the tio2 sio2 ncs size were 91 5 nm and 56 2 nm 61 4 fig 5c which are in contract with the preceding magnitudes attained from the sem results 3 1 2 characterizations of the nanocomposite membranes the ft ir spectra of neat ps ps tio2 ps tio2 zno and ps tio2 sio2 ncs membranes are existing in fig 6 the ft ir curves show a peak band seeming at 721 cm 1 due to the ch bond in the aromatic group the presences of hydrogen bending of para substituted aromatic groups are shown at the absorption band at 871 cm 1 the spectrum band was observed at 1241 cm 1 which can be attributed to the stretching vibration of the coc in the aryl ether group the appearance of asymmetric stretching vibration band 1340 cm 1 is due to oso groups of neat ps 50 the detected band around 1595 cm 1 is mainly due to the rotation of the cc of the benzene ring furthermore the absorption peaks at434 and 505cm 1 confirm the presence of the stretching vibration band of tioti 51 for the ps tio2 ps tio2 zno and ps tio2 sio2 ncs membranes the incorporation of tio2 sio2 ncs is confirmed by absorption bands at 970 and 792 cm 1 due to the stretching vibrations band of sioh and siosi respectively 52 onto the ps tio2 sio2 ncs membrane moreover the absorption peaks of the synthesized ps tio2 zno ncs membrane at 439 635 691 and 716 cm 1 can be assigned to significant absorption peaks of zno and ti o 53 onto the ps tio2 zno ncs membrane the detected band around 556 cm 1 is corresponding to stretching vibration of zno nps the appearance of the stretching band around 1584 cm 1 which confirms the hoh bending vibration comes from the atmospheric moisture 7 in conclusion these peaks confirmed the successful combination of tio2 tio2 zno and tio2 sio2 ncs onto the ps membranes 3 1 3 morphology analysis of membranes sem was used to detect the membrane surface morphology of each membrane including neat ps ps tio2 ps tio2 zno and ps tio2 sio2 ncs membranes with a different magnification respectively fig 7 a c display the ps support layer is porous with a nano metric pore size and a smooth surface it can be shown from fig 7d l that the membranes surfaces have a nano metric pore size and a smooth surface and with higher magnification there are several white spots on the ncs membrane surfaces this demonstrates that tio2 tio2 zno and tio2 sio2 ncs particles are uniformly dispersed in the membranes surfaces moreover from figs 7d l it can be detected that tio2 tio2 zno and tio2 sio2 ncs are inserted in the membranes tissue nonetheless the tio2 tio2 zno and tio2 sio2 ncs have a propensity of agglomeration onto the membrane surfaces furthermore ps tio2 ps tio2 zno and ps tio2 sio2 ncs membranes have several networks confirming contaminants diffuse and pass through the networks these networks of ps tio2 ps tio2 zno and ps tio2 sio2 ncs membranes can improve the mass removal of organic impurities confirming the restriction of the ncs membranes with better photocatalytic properties as well as they have positively prepared the water contact angle wca θ is the greatest shared factor used to describe the hydrophilicity of membrane surfaces hydrophilic membranes have a wca of 0 θ 90 while hydrophobic membranes have a ca of 90 θ 180 in fig 8 the mean wca for the neat ps ps tio2 ps tio2 sio2 and ps tio2 zno ncs membranes were 71 2 2 44 7 2 41 4 2 3 and 57 32 1 8 respectively demonstrating they have a hydrophilic surface which could reflect the antifouling competency of the membranes fig 8 shows the lower wca of neat ps tio2 membrane 44 7 2 due to the hydroxyl group of the tio2 nps which improves the membrane surface hydrophilicity the decreasing in the wca of ps tio2 sio2 ncs membrane with incorporation of tio2 sio2 ncs materials leads to the higher surface hydrophilicity the enhancement of wac may be attributed to the combination of sio2 nps which responsible for the hydrogen bonds with hydroxyl groups and adsorb water molecules on the tio2 sio2 surface 54 this consideration approves that hydrophilicity and wettability of the ps tio2 sio2 ncs membrane could be enhanced by the incorporation of hydrophilic inorganic tio2 sio2 ncs into the polymer structure during membrane fabrication the improved hydrophilicity of the ps tio2 sio2 ncs membrane may be due to a greater attraction of water molecules by the nanomaterials and to the presence of energetic hydrophilic efficient groups on the membranes surfaces on the other hand the membrane hydrophilicity decreased upon doping of the zno nps to the ncs membrane when compared to the neat ps tio2 membrane the mechanical properties of neat ps ps tio2 ps tio2 zno and ps tio2 sio2 ncs membranes are revealed in table 2 and the stress strain curves are shown in fig 9 the ps tio2 zno and ps tio2 sio2 ncs membranes show enhanced stress mpa and strain when compared to the neat ps and ps tio2 ncs membrane the membranes have stress mpa and strain values in the following order ps tio2 zno ps tio2 sio2 ps tio2 neat ps ncs membranes the membranes have young s modulus mpa values in the following order neat ps tio2 neat ps ps tio2 sio2 ps tio2 zno ncs membranes the enhancement in the mechanical properties of ps tio2 zno ncs membranes is mostly owing to the cross linked polymeric structure in the rigid aromatic structure in the membrane backbone and the incorporation of inorganic ncs onto the polymeric membrane causing increased flexibility and strength in addition to the incorporation of zno nps addicted to the membrane creates it more crystalline and the crystalline membrane is more solid than the amorphous ones as well as improves the rigidity of the membrane chain 13 the mechanical properties of the ncs membrane are contingent mostly on the membrane inter molecular forces functional along the membrane backbone 55 the development of the ps tio2 sio2 ncs membrane may be due to the titania silica bond structure through tio and sio bonds which improve the membrane mechanical properties and enhanced the polymeric backbone 54 the embedding of tio2 sio2 ncs to the polymeric membrane improved the tensile strength due to the ti o si bonds structure which reinforced the network structure due to the more porous silicon oxide 56 3 2 performance evaluation of photocatalytic process 3 2 1 factors affecting photocatalytic nanocomposite membranes after the system reaches equilibrium depending upon the nature concentration of the organic compound and the flow rate as specified via identical inlet outlet mo and or phenol concentration the uv light is turned on the outlet sample is then collected manually at regular intervals time the steady state is achieved around 30 min after finishing the experimentations the photoreactor is flushed under uv light for 1 h using di water the photocatalytic removal of mo and or phenol is take place at a built up scale by means of prototype unit with sample flow rate changing from 20 to 80 m3 h in photocatalytic degradation of mo and or phenol as a wastewaters model using different synthesized ps tio2 membrane was considered to examine the activity of synthesized ncs membranes for degradation of an organic impurity below uv radiation the outcomes were achieved using different parameters such as the solution ph was ranged from 4 to 10 flow rate of motor speed ranged from 20 to 80 m3 h at 5 to 20 hz respectively mo and or phenol concentrations of 1 to 7 mg l different concentrations of tio2 extended from 0 2 to 0 4 wt and various concentration of h2o2 extended from 0 1 to 2 see fig 10 the experiments were prepared at room temperature 25 c with interval time ranged from 0 to 180 min because the time of the degradation efficiency is an imperative factor in the photocatalytic procedure in uv light radiation the ph is a considerable factor in the assessment of photocatalytic activity in an aqueous solution the effect of ph was deliberate via keeping all other experimental circumstances constant and changing the initial ph value the initial ph plays an essential role in photocatalytic activity it is responsible for the separation of active functional sites on the catalyst and adsorbent to evaluate the influence of ph on the charge possessions of the semiconductor and photocatlytic degradation of phenol using ps tio2 ncs membrane to conclude the optimum ph for the degradation of phenol the effect of ph was considered in the range 4 10 keeping all other factors constant the phenol removal increases with raising ph to reach the higher degradation at ph 7 fig 10a the consequences show that the degradation efficiency of ps tio2 membrane increased at ph 7 the difference of the pollutants ph effects on the changes of the external charge of tio2 nps and shifts the potentials of catalytic reactions under alkaline or acidic circumstance the tio2 nps surfaces can be deprotonated or protonated respectively according to the following equations 5 and 6 tio2 is described to possess a greater oxidizing activity at lower ph nevertheless additional h at very low ph can reduce the reaction rate however in alkaline ph under columbic force aims revulsion among oh ions and the negatively charged surface of the catalyst thus preventing the formation of oh radicals and reducing the degradation hence the optimization of ph is essential for better degradation results 57 furthermore the ps tio2 membrane surface becomes negatively charged at ph 7 while the phenolic compound and mo have static positive charge therefore the degradation efficiency of ps tio2 membrane increased at ph 7 fig 10a this is mainly due to the formation of oh radicals by photoholes oh is a strong oxidizing specie in advanced oxidation processes aops while at ph 7 both ps tio2 membrane surface and the organic pollutants become negatively charged and repulsive forces appeared therefore reducing the photocatalytic activity and degradation efficiency of ps tio2 membrane 14 the degradation efficiency of ps tio2 membrane decreased at ph 7 due to the presence of h ions on the membrane and catalyst surfaces which declined the photocatalytic activity and degradation efficiency of ps tio2 membrane the adsorption of ps tio2 membrane was estimated via exposure the membrane to mo dyes for a certain time ranged from 0 to 90 min without uv light irradiation and calculates the adsorption of the dye onto the ps tio2 membrane surface it is found that the adsorption reached the steady state at 30 min 5 tioh h tioh2 6 tioh oh tio h2o to examine the influence of residence time on the removal efficiency of phenol three flow rates 20 40 and 80 m3 h at 5 10 and 20 hrtz respectively are estimated at different time intervals from 0 to 180 min the photocatalytic efficiency depends mainly on the electrical panel with a variable speed drive for the feed pump motor speed flow rate fig 10b the photocatalytic efficiency increases at a low motor speed equal 5hrtz 20 m3 h in ps tio2 membrane conversely the photocatalytic degradation decreases with the speed flow rate increase due to the acceleration of the photocatalytic reaction with increasing the fed solution flow rate it is concluded that the degradation efficiency decreased when the flow rate increased the feed flow rate is inversely proportional to the photocatylitic efficiency this is mainly attributed to at lower flow rate various photoactive sites continue available for the reaction 36 at higher flow rate the photoactive sites tend to a limit which can be described via the rise of unavailable sites the procedure at higher flow rate becomes a systematized chemical stage consequently it is showed that residence time is an important factor for the application of ps tio2 photocatalytic expertise for wastewater treatment fig 10b showed that the removal efficiency of pollutants increases with decreasing flow rate the flow rate of the feed solution depends mainly on its viscosity and concentrations the photocatalytic reaction rates may be dependent on the bulk feed solution to the catalyst mass diffusion 58 there are two evident aspects get up from affecting feed flow rate on the photocatalytic degradation process firstly is the availability of the ps tio2 surface to the phenol and the photons and secondly is a significant effect of the exterior mass diffusion resistance mostly at low feed flow rates owing to the increasing dispersion size of the reactant the mo and or phenol from the solution to the ps tio2 surface therefore its observable that flow rate plays an essential role in the degradation procedure for low flow rates the feed water flow is little the oxygen species is greatly more capable of getting into interaction with a ps tio2 membrane surface additionally a feed water flow contributes to satisfactory uv light intensity however for higher flow rates the feed water flow increases which has the difficulty of photon in going into the ps tio2 membrane surface conversely increasing the feed flow rate also indicates to a higher mass diffusion especially with higher mass diffusion and electron hole recombination there was an improve of contaminant degradation the effect of initial concentration of methyl orange mo dye are ranging from 1 to 7 mg l on degradation efficiency was considered using ps tio2 membrane at flow rate 5hrtz 20 m3 h and ph 7 as shown in fig 10c the consequences exhibited that with increasing the mo concentration from 1 mg l to 7 mg l the degradation efficiency increased in fig 10c it is found that as the mo concentration and the time exposure increase the degradation efficiency increases this result may be due to that the oh radicals should be mainly formed from the adsorbed ho and h2o molecules by electron donation to the photogenerated holes the rate of the determination step of the reaction could be the formation of oh radicals since they react very rapidly with aromatic ring compound 59 the influence of initial phenol concentration ranging from 1 to7 mg l on the rate of degradation efficiency was deliberate by means of ps tio2 ncs membrane at flow rate 5hrtz 20 m3 h and ph 7 as shown in fig 10d it is clear that with increasing the initial concentration of phenol from 1 mg l to 7 mg l the degradation efficiency increase fig 10e shows the photo degradation results using ps membrane doped with diverse concentrations of tio2 nps the operation conditions included dye concentration equal to 20 mg l reaction time ranged from 0 to 180 min ph value equals 5 it was believed that as the quantity of catalyst improves the number of dye molecules engrosses and the numbers of photons absorbed were increased due to an increase in the number of catalyst particles the rate of photo degradation reaction improves via increasing the quantity of tio2 nps and reaches its exciting at 0 4 wt this indicates that the increase in catalyst amount actually increases the number of active spots on the photocatalyst surface thus casing an increase in the number of oh radicals is responsible for the organic pollutant degradations 60 the examination searcher shows that oh radicals are the highest active species in the photocatalytic procedure to improve the quantity of active species we added hydrogen peroxide h2o2 as oxidant agents hydrogen peroxide is a chemical compound with the formula h2o2 it is a clear liquid slightly more viscous than water hydrogen peroxide is the simplest peroxide a compound with an oxygen oxygen single bond it is used as an oxidizer agent and antiseptic with the adding of h2o2 and the adsorption desorption equilibrium was reached the photocatalytic degradation procedure was rapidly increasing this mainly owing to the added h2o2 was first adsorbed on the ps tio2 membrane surface which contributed to the amount of organic compound mo and or phenol desorption thus the observed mo and or phenol concentration declined much more rapidly because of the existence of h2o2 fig 10f showed that 2 wt h2o2 was the optimal concentration in the ps tio2 uv h2o2 system which was enhanced than the other concentration the photocatalytic efficiency was increased by the addition of h2o2 with a small amount which accelerates the reaction rate of the ps tio2 membranes and reaches its maximum degradation at 2 wt fig 10f the ps tio2 h2o2 uv procedure is more effective than the ps tio2 uv radiation procedure for organic compound mo and or phenol degradation due to influence of oh and o the results highlighted that with adding h2o2 shows an improvement of organic compound mo and or phenol degradation rate the mineralization of organic compound i e elimination of toc from an aqueous solution is presented in fig 10g the degradation of mo dye was monitored via toc estimation where the toc calculated as organic matter it is found that the organic matter increased with increasing the degradation efficiency as in fig 10g compared to the degradation efficiency mineralization is dawdling which is also confirmed via 61 0 043 of the organic matter of mo was estimated after 30 min of the reaction time while the removal efficiency reached 12 5 observably the degradation produces of the mo dyes definitely still exist in the aqueous solution the organic matter reached 0 0725 with efficiency 13 5 after 180 mints using 7 mg l methyl orange as a pollutant model under uv light and at flow rate 20 m3 h 5 hz the results gotten in this study matched with 61 for their total removal the period of uv light exposure should be elongated a lower elimination of toc content as organic matter was expected as the advanced intermediates contend with the initial mo dye molecules throughout the degradation procedure furthermore the slow kinetics of mo dye degradation afterward a certain time may be clarified via the exertion in changing the nitrogen atoms of the dyes into oxidized nitrogen complexes as anticipated in sakthivel et al 62 as well as the presence of the higher number of azo groups in mo dyes molecules delay the degradation procedure 3 2 2 the enhancement of photocatalytic activity of ps tio2 nanocomposite membranes in this study ps mixed with tio2 zno and tio2 sio2 ncs with different ratios 1 1 1 2 and 2 1 the best ratios are tio2 doped zno 1 1 wt gives ps tio2 zno ncs membrane i and ps mixed with tio2 doped sio2 2 1 wt resulting ps tio2 sio2 ncs membrane ii fig 11 a shows that the performance of photo degradation increases in case of ncs membrane i under uv light in case of phenol and mo than in case of visible light for both phenol and mo respectively this is due to that the band boundaries of these semiconductor materials is lying in the uv area which creates them inactive below visible light irradiation fig 11b shows that the photo degradation performance improved in case of ncs membrane ii under uv light in case of phenol and mo than in case of visible light for both phenol and mo respectively this is owing to that the band boundaries of these semiconductor materials lie in the uv area which creates them less active in visible light irradiation fig 11c shows the effect of the addition of h2o2 1 wt concentration on the photo degradation performance of ncs membrane i under visible light for both phenol and mo the fig 11c indicates that the degradation efficiency improved in the case of phenol 52 3 after 180 min than in the case of mo dye 42 9 after 180 min fig 11d shows the effect of the addition of h2o2 1 wt concentration on the photo degradation performance of ncs membrane ii under visible light for both phenol and mo the fig 11d indicates that the degradation efficiency improved in the case of mo 97 after 180 min than in the case of phenol 95 after 180 min 4 conclusions the innovation of this work is to fabricate and design the continuous flow pr for treatment of organic impurities in wastewater using heterogeneous photocatalytic process different nano metal oxides such as zno and sio2 were synthesized by the hydrothermal method and mixed with tio2 degussa to act as a catalyst to improve the photo degradation procedure under visible light these different nanomaterials were doped with ps support membrane to prepare modified flat sheet membrane using the phase inversion procedure the synthesized nanoparticles and membranes were described via atr ftir spectroscopy contact angle measurement particle size analyzer and scanning electron microscope sem also the efficiency of both synthetized polymeric ncs membranes and the continuous pr were evaluated by studying the influence of various parameters these parameters included feed water ph motor speed flow rate oxygen content pollutant types and pollutant concentrations the impurities as methyl orange and phenol compound were used as a model of organic pollutants the achieved results indicated that the ps tio2 zno ncs membrane i showed a degradation of 72 and 16 5 in the case of phenol and mo under ultraviolet light respectively conversely the degradation was 30 and 11 in the case of phenol and mo under visible light respectively moreover the ps tio2 sio2 ncs membrane ii was able to degrade 18 1 and 40 3 in the case of phenol under uv radiation and visible light respectively the performance was enhanced by increase the oxygen content i e the addition of h2o2 and the degradation was 97 and 95 under visible light in case of mo and phenol respectively using ps tio2 sio2 ncs membrane ii it was also realized that the presence of h2o2 leads to an improvement of removal efficiency of the organic compound mo and or phenol a superior photocatalytic degradation enactment is perceived when using continuous flow pr and ps tio2 sio2 ncs membrane ii because it had a good stability with a developed photocatalytic activity we expect that this procedure is good as a favorable photocatalysts in the treatment of organic compound discharges and other wastewater treatment acknowledgments this work was supported by misr el kheir foundation the authors acknowledge the overall help from engineering in the arab

14236,fenton process and fenton coupled biological treatment were examined for the treatment of the textile nanofiltration nf membrane concentrate maximum chemical oxygen demand cod and total organic carbon toc removal efficiency was found to be 87 1 and 80 8 respectively at molar concentrations of 35 mm fe2 and 175 mm h2o2 and ph 3 for 30 min in the single fenton process as a second alternative

during the treatment of membrane concentrate with fenton process had no inhibitory toxic effects on the hetetrophic biomass the maximum cod removal efficiency in biological treatment after fenton process was 75 under equilibrium condition using a sbr operated at 10 days of sludge retention time and 12 h of hydraulic retention time hrt keywords textile wastewater nanofiltration membrane concentrate fenton sequencing batch reactor biodegradability 1 introduction textile wastewaters comprise a wide range of dyes as biologic resistance and recalcitrant compounds which is hardly biodegraded with conventional biological treatment systems 1 2 moreover large amount of textile wastewater is produced and discharged to the water bodies annually which requires to efficient treatment methods before being discharged to water resources it has been assumed that over 50 of dyes used in textile industries are discharge into the wastewaters and make them resistant to biodegradation 1 3 toxicity skin irritation carcinogenic and mutagenic effects of dyes on aquatic environment have been demonstrated 4 additionally textile wastewaters are characterized with high cod large amount of suspended solids chlorinated aromatic hydrocarbons heavy metals and surfactants which cauese the difficulties of treatment strategies 1 5 generally different combinations of physical chemical and biological systems are employed for the treatment of textile wastewaters 6 7 it is well known that advanced oxidation processes aops can oxidized effectively recalcitrant constituents in wastewater high capital and operational cost addition to production of high amounts of chemical sludge limit the application of aops 8 many studies which are related to the recovery and treatment of textile industry wastewater using biological chemical and advanced treatment technologies have been published physico chemical methods have some disadvantages such as less efficient expensive limited application and sludge production 8 on the other side biological processes are well known and cost effective but most of the dyes used in textile industry are not biodegradable 7 unfortunately conventional treatment technologies cannot provide sufficient effluent standards and needed quality for water reuse non conventional treatment technologies which known advanced oxidation processes aops using various types of oxidants are effective to degrade recalcitrant and chemically complex contaminants 8 aops generate highly active oxidizing species which attack and decompose organic components and provide more efficient processes compared to other physically based techniques in this respect fenton and fenton like oxidation with using catalyst fe2 fe3 and h2o2 have been reported to be one of the most effective processes for degradation of organic pollutants in wastewater 9 to overcome some practical limitations such as production of high amount chemical sludge and secondary pollution toxicity operation ph 2 4 neutralization requirements and not allow to recovery or reuse the catalyst many researchers has also focused to produce and use of heterogeneous catalysts which provide high performance easy separation and recovery 10 membrane process is a promising technology for the treatment of textile wastewater due to allow recovery and reuse nf and reverse osmosis ro membrane are frequently performed to remove dyes salts and inorganic and organic constituents from textile wastewater besides membrane processes have still limitations such as membrane fouling and production of concentrate membrane concentrate is a key problem to operate membrane processes due to the higher pollution concentration compared to initial feed wastewater 11 15 treatment technologies and volume reduction of concentrate must be chosen according to the characteristics of the membrane concentrate as well as the operational conditions of membrane processes the composition of wastewater operational conditions of the membrane systems and other system elements such as pre treatment cleaning chemicals etc can affect both characteristics and volume of the produced membrane concentrate the membrane concentrate is considered with high concentrations of organic salts and inorganic matters due to the high concentration of refractory pollutants and salts textile membrane concentrates have low biodegradability moreover when the textile wastewater is treated with biological process before membrane systems the biodegradability of membrane concentrate is extremely low because of the removal of biodegradable substances during biological treatment 16 because of the characterization of membrane concentrate physicochemical treatments are usually first choice for their treatment recycle to feed stream coagulation adsorption evaporation electrodialysis and membrane distillation are the main processes used for treating membrane concentrates cost effective management strategies for concentrate have been already investigated while most of articles have focused on recent advances in traditional membrane technologies there are only a few studies addressing treatment options for textile membrane concentrate recycling concentrate to feed stream is not the only option and further research has been studied on integrated treatment systems combinations of membrane processes or hybrid processes would improve treatment efficiency and provide almost near zero discharge 17 however cost effective treatment technologies for membrane concentrate need to be investigated as a result of increased usage of membrane processes and the tighter regulations there are only a few papers focused on treatment of textile membrane concentrates yaman et al 18 focused on ozonation aerobic treatment of textile membran concentrate and reported that biodegradability of the membrane concentrate was improved by the ozonation ozonation of real nf membrane concentrate was studied by lopez et al 19 and obtained an increase in bod5 from 0 to 75 mg l coupled fenton and biological processes have increased attention for the treatment of refractory wastewater 20 22 fenton process is usually used as a pretreatment to improve biodegradability which indicate bod5 cod the sequencing batch reactor sbr process is usually applied with the combined process because of its advantages such as good removal efficiency easy and flexible operation simplicity and low space requirement 23 recently the combination of fenton and sbr process has been investigated to treat recalcitrant wastewaters such as antibiotic wastewater 24 landfill leachate 25 26 textile effluent 27 28 dyes 29 30 and other wastewater 31 32 membrane concentrate treatment with the combination of fenton and sbr process has not been studied yet first part of this study focused on the effect of operational conditions fe2 h2o2 molar ratio and optimum concentrations of h2o2 and fe2 of fenton pretreatment of textile nf membrane concentrate second part of the study focused on the combination of fenton and sbr processes for the treatment of the fenton pre treated textile nf membrane concentrate effect of fenton process on biodegradability of membrane concentrate cod particle size distribution and respirometric tests were also evaluated 2 materials and methods 2 1 textile

solids the wastewater was filtered thorough nf membrane after that nf permeate was fed to ro membrane though ro permeate can be utilized as process water nf concentrate was planned to treat with fenton characterization of nf membrane concentrate was given in table 1 previous study summarized the detailed information about the characteristics of the membranes and the results of membrane

for ro of water recovery was achieved 2 3 fenton experiments all experiments were performed with nf membrane concentrate which was provided from pilot membrane system a sequence of fenton s experiments was performed at different fe2 and h2o2 concentrations in the wide range of 1 35 mm and 5 175 mm respectively fenton s oxidation of 500 ml membrane concentrate samples was conducted in a glass beaker at room temperature as follows firstly the ph of membrane concentrate was adjusted to 2 95 0 5 e g the optimal ph of fenton s reaction 34 36 with concentrated h2so4 solution 6 n subsequently fe2 catalyst was added to membrane concentrate sample from a daily prepared feso4 7h2o solution under a continuously stirring speed of 200 rpm the reaction was started by adding the desired amount of h2o2 35 w w to the solution after 40 min the reaction was stopped by adding the naoh solution 6 n to the samples to increase the ph to 7 8 the samples were filtered through 45 μm membranes to eliminate the formed fe oh 3 flocs 2 4 particle size distribution filtration ultrafiltration tests were carried out under pressure in a cell with a capacity of 300 ml permeate was collected to determine cod experiments in duplicates samples were filtered sequentially through conventional filters with pore sizes of 40 000 nm 450 nm and 220 nm through the ultrafiltration tests permeates obtained from 220 nm membrane filter were filtered through different molecular weight cut off mwco 150 30 10 and 5 kda ultrafiltration membranes 2 5 respirometric biodegradation test respirometric measurements are important on the monitoring and control of biological systems microorganisms in activated sludge deplete oxygen while they consume organic material the level of microbial activity level in activated sludge is an indication of the oxygen uptake rate our batch respirometric tests were performed with adapted biomass from activated sludge system of municipal wastewater treatment plant at desired initial food microorganism ratio the mixture of wastewater and biomass was continuously aerated to provide the dissolved oxygen level above 5 mgo2 l in the tank respirometric experiments were carried out using an oxygen measurement probe that continuously measures dissolved oxygen concentration in the mixture our is collected until the reaction reaches the endogenous level as a result of the collected data our were calculated for wastewater 37 the dynamic method was used for the measurements of the our nf membrane concentrate treated with fenton process was aerated and added on an adequate volume of aerated activated sludge after the dissolved oxygen probe has been immersed into the mixture of biomass and wastewater contact with the air was blocked the measurement of dissolved oxygen was started after reading a constant value and was continued until the dissolved oxygen concentration decreased below 1 mg l the oxygen uptake rate was determined as the absolute value of the slope of the linear portion of the dissolved oxygen versus time curve 2 6 biological treatment fenton treated wastewater was entered to a 2 l reactor for the biological treatment the sbr was inoculated with activated sludge obtained from the aeration tank of a municipal wastewater treatment plant for acclimation of microorganisms mixture of fenton treated textile membrane concentrate with domestic wastewater at ratios of 50 50 was fed to sbr during 8 day period hydraulic retention time hrt was 12 h during the experiments schematic diagram of total system is demonstrated in fig 1 2 7 analytical methods tds conductivity salinity and ph were analyzed using a multi parameter cod bod chloride and sulfate were measured according to the standard methods 38 the color was analyzed with a uv visible spectrophotometer by determining the absorbances of the wavelengths 436 525 and 620 nm according to standards of european norm en iso 7887 3 results and discussion 3 1 fenton experiments two different molar ratios of fe2 h2o2 were performed to determine the optimal conditions for fenton process mostly at higher h2o2 concentrations more h2o2 molecules could arrive the surface of compound and afterwards react with fe2 which increase the dye degradation conversely an adequate amount of ho radicals cannot be formed when h2o2 concentration is lower which cause to low oxidation rate and afterwards decrease of removal efficiency as can be seen from fig 2 cod removal efficiencies of 4 1 and 14 7 were obtained respectively for h2o2 concentrations of 5 and 10 mm at 1 mm fe2 concentration further increase the h2o2 concentration at same fe2 concentration however the removal percentage was almost same so that the cod removal efficiencies of 47 5 and 46 5 were observed respectively for h2o2 concentrations of 25 and 50 mm at 5 mm fe2 concentration additional increase in concentration of h2o2 caused a decrease in cod removal which was obtained as 87 1 and 81 3 for h2o2 concentrations of 175 mm respectively at 35 and 17 5 mm fe2 concentration this was attributed that a higher h2o2 dosage causes a large excess of oxidant in the solution which act as radical scavengers increasing to inhibition of dye removal as reported in the literature 39 40 consequently fe2 h2o2 1 5 ratio was set the optimum condition for the further oxidation experiments fenton experiments were conducted at the optimal fe2 h2o2 1 5 ratio with different fe2 1 5 10 17 5 20 and 35 mm and h2o2 5 25 50 87 5 100 and 175 mm concentration the ph of membrane concentrate was adjusted to 2 95 0 5 which known as the optimum ph of fenton s reaction 34 36 the total removal efficiency of cod and toc increased with an increase in fe2 h2o2 ratio mm mm from 1 5 to 35 175 it can be seen from fig 3 that maximum cod and toc removal efficiency was found to be 87 1 and 80 8 respectively at molar concentrations of 35 mm fe2 and 175 mm h2o2 and ph 3 for 30 min whereas only 11 2 of toc and 4 1 of cod removal efficiency was obtained at molar concentrations of 1 mm fe2 and 5 mm h2o2 and ph 3 for 30 min similarly 99 of maximum color removal efficiency was observed at molar concentrations of 35 mm fe2 and 175 mm h2o2 and ph 3 after 30 min at all experiments performed in this study h2o2 was completely utilized after 30 min oxidation indicating that the chosen fe2 h2o2 ratio was proper xu et al studied the treatment of pre coagulated leachate membrane concentrates by fenton process it was reported that the maximum toc and cod reduction efficiencies reached 68 9 and 69 6 under the conditions of ph 2 h2o2 concentration 1 mol l and fe2 concentration 17 5 mmol l and the cod concentration was reduced from 1120 to 340 mg l 41 3 2 effect of fenton process on biodegradability of membrane concentrate most of the pollutants were oxidized into biodegradable matters after fenton process which was proved by the increased bod5 cod ratios bod5 cod ratios of membrane concentrate after fenton treatment were given in fig 4 while the bod5 cod ratio of raw membrane concentrate was 0 16 the ratios of bod5 cod had a sharp increase after fenton process with an increase in concentrations of fe2 and h2o2 from 5 25 to 20 100 fe2 h2o2 ratio mm mm and the ratio of bod5 cod was declined to 0 26 at molar concentrations of 35 mm fe2 and 175 mm h2o2 which meant the most part of organic matter was degraded and some refractory materials released into the solution because of cells metabolism 42 the ratio of bod5 cod was increased to 0 51 at molar concentrations of 20 mm fe2 and 100 mm h2o it is known that a wastewater with a 0 40 of bod5 cod ratio is considered biodegradable 43 44 the obtained results showed that the membrane concentrate can be treated by biologically after pre treatment with fenton process at ph 3 and molar concentrations of 20 mm fe2 and 100 mm h2o2 for 30 min 3 3 respirometric analysis the our is related to biological activity due to consuming oxygen while utilization substrate by microorganisms ours of the synthetically prepared glucose solution and fenton pre treated samples are shown in fig 5 the cod value of raw membrane

treated sample was also set at a cod value of 750 mg l our increased in the logarithmic growth phase which was attributed that easily biodegradable organic materials are rapidly degraded by microorganisms with a high substrate consumption after this phase a decrease in the substrate lead to a decrease in the metabolic activity of the cells which causes a decrease in the our as can be seen from fig 5 the ours for both synthetic glucose solution and pre treated fenton samples showed a similar profile according to obtained results it was stated that the oxidation intermediates formed during the treatment of membrane concentrate with fenton process had no inhibitory toxic effects on the hetetrophic biomass 3 4 cod particle size distribution the cod values analyzed at the samples collected after each filtration step can be called as cumulative values since each of them corresponds to the total cod below the selected filter size differential cod is also defined as the difference between two analyzed cod values which corresponds to cod content originating only from the two sequential filter size range particle size distribution based on cod fractionation of the raw and fenton pre treated membrane concentrate is given in table 2 as can be calculated from data in table 2 70 8 of the total cod of the raw membrane concentrate comes from the particulate portion while 29 2 originates from the soluble fraction this cod fingerprint is expectable since membrane concentrate are generally considered with high particulate matter and soluble organic content also 29 6 of the total cod of the raw membrane concentrate originates from the fraction at 16 220 nm range dulekgurgen et al 45 studied on size distribution of textile wastewater cod fractions and reported that

value of 2328 mg l which was reduced to 395 mg l after treatment with fenton process ph 3 ch2o2 100 mm fe 2 h2o2 1 5 30 min comparative demonstration of the cod profiles of the membrane concentrate before and after fenton treatment is also provided in table 2 which highlight the difference between raw and pre treated samples the obtained results showed that fenton treatment effectively reduced the particulate cod which was one of the significant fractions in the membrane concentrate results given in table 2 showed that 93 of the total effluent cod remaining after fenton treatment is in the soluble portion 3 5 fenton biological coupled process wide range of chemical dosages have been studied with the fenton process to achieve the discharge limits to receiving media for textile membrane

the toc in the untreated wastewater while fenton sbr combined process achieved more than 73 of the toc removal which was attributed to the imcreased biodegradability that was caused by fenton oxidation 42 similarly elmolla and chaudhuri 40 studied the effect of operational conditions on fenton pretreatment of an antibiotic wastewater the best operational conditions for combined fenton sbr process were determined h2o2 cod molar ratio 2 5 h2o2 fe2 molar ratio 150 fenton reaction time 120 min and hrt of 12 h under these conditions combined fenton sbr treatment efficiency was 89 for scod removal kakavandi et al 47 reported that the biodegradability trend of treated pcw sample has a sharper slope compared to raw petrochemical wastewater indicating that treated petrochemical wastewater is more biodegradable than raw pcw it was also reported that the biodegradability efficiencies of 64 and 23 were obtained for treated and raw samples 47 4 conclusion the obtained results have stated that fenton process and fenton coupled biological treatment are suitable treatments options to treatment the textile nf membrane concentrate according to turkish regulations maximum cod and toc removal efficiency was found to be 87 1 and 80 8 respectively at ph 3 and molar concentrations of 35 mm fe2 and 175 mm h2o2 for 30 min in the single fenton process as a second alternative sbr was operated to carry out biological treatment after fenton process at a lower chemical dosage ph 3 cfe 2 20 mm ch2o2 100 mm 30 min the ratio of bod5 cod was increased to 0 51 at molar concentrations of

concentrate fenton sequencing batch reactor biodegradability 1 introduction textile wastewaters comprise a wide range of dyes as biologic resistance and recalcitrant compounds which is hardly biodegraded with conventional biological treatment systems 1 2 moreover large amount of textile wastewater is produced and discharged to the water bodies annually which requires to efficient treatment methods before being discharged to water resources it has been assumed that over 50 of dyes used in textile industries are discharge into the wastewaters and make them resistant to biodegradation 1 3 toxicity skin irritation carcinogenic and mutagenic effects of dyes on aquatic environment have been demonstrated 4 additionally textile wastewaters are characterized with high cod large amount of suspended solids chlorinated aromatic hydrocarbons heavy metals and surfactants which cauese the difficulties of treatment strategies 1 5 generally different combinations of physical chemical and biological systems are employed for the treatment of textile wastewaters 6 7 it is well known that advanced oxidation processes aops can oxidized effectively recalcitrant constituents in wastewater high capital and operational cost addition to production of high amounts of chemical sludge limit the application of aops 8 many studies which are related to the recovery and treatment of textile industry wastewater using biological chemical and advanced treatment technologies have been published physico chemical methods have some disadvantages such as less efficient expensive limited application and sludge production 8 on the other side biological processes are well known and cost effective but most of the dyes used in textile industry are not biodegradable 7 unfortunately conventional treatment technologies cannot provide sufficient effluent standards and needed quality for water reuse non conventional treatment technologies which known advanced oxidation processes aops using various types of oxidants are effective to degrade recalcitrant and chemically complex contaminants 8 aops generate highly active oxidizing species which attack and decompose organic components and provide more efficient processes compared to other physically based techniques in this respect fenton and fenton like oxidation with using catalyst fe2 fe3 and h2o2 have been reported to be one of the most effective processes for degradation of organic pollutants in wastewater 9 to overcome some practical limitations such as production of high amount chemical sludge and secondary pollution toxicity operation ph 2 4 neutralization requirements and not allow to recovery or reuse the catalyst many researchers has also focused to produce and use of heterogeneous catalysts which provide high performance easy separation and recovery 10 membrane process is a promising technology for the treatment of textile wastewater due to allow recovery and reuse nf and reverse osmosis ro membrane are frequently performed to remove dyes salts and inorganic and organic constituents from textile wastewater besides membrane processes have still limitations such as membrane fouling and production of concentrate membrane concentrate is a key problem to operate membrane processes due to the higher pollution concentration compared to initial feed wastewater 11 15 treatment technologies and volume reduction of concentrate must be chosen according to the characteristics of the membrane concentrate as well as the operational conditions of membrane processes the composition of wastewater operational conditions of the membrane systems and other system elements such as pre treatment cleaning chemicals etc can affect both characteristics and volume of the produced membrane concentrate the membrane concentrate is considered with high concentrations of organic salts and inorganic matters due to the high concentration of refractory pollutants and salts textile membrane concentrates have low biodegradability moreover when the textile wastewater is treated with biological process before membrane systems the biodegradability of membrane concentrate is extremely low because of the removal of biodegradable substances during biological treatment 16 because of the characterization of membrane concentrate physicochemical treatments are usually first choice for their treatment recycle to feed stream coagulation adsorption evaporation electrodialysis and membrane distillation are the main processes used for treating membrane concentrates cost effective management strategies for concentrate have been already investigated while most of articles have focused on recent advances in traditional membrane technologies there are only a few studies addressing treatment options for textile membrane concentrate recycling concentrate to feed stream is not the only option and further research has been studied on integrated treatment systems combinations of membrane processes or hybrid processes would improve treatment efficiency and provide almost near zero discharge 17 however cost effective treatment technologies for membrane concentrate need to be investigated as a result of increased usage of membrane processes and the tighter regulations there are only a few papers focused on treatment of textile membrane concentrates yaman et al 18 focused on ozonation aerobic treatment of textile membran concentrate and reported that biodegradability of the membrane concentrate was improved by the ozonation ozonation of real nf membrane concentrate was studied by lopez et al 19 and obtained an increase in bod5 from 0 to 75 mg l coupled fenton and biological processes have increased attention for the treatment of refractory wastewater 20 22 fenton process is usually used as a pretreatment to improve biodegradability which indicate bod5 cod the sequencing batch reactor sbr process is usually applied with the combined process because of its advantages such as good removal efficiency easy and flexible operation simplicity and low space requirement 23 recently the combination of fenton and sbr process has been investigated to treat recalcitrant wastewaters such as antibiotic wastewater 24 landfill leachate 25 26 textile effluent 27 28 dyes 29 30 and other wastewater 31 32 membrane concentrate treatment with the combination of fenton and sbr process has not been studied yet first part of this study focused on the effect of operational conditions fe2 h2o2 molar ratio and optimum concentrations of h2o2 and fe2 of fenton pretreatment of textile nf membrane concentrate second part of the study focused on the combination of fenton and sbr processes for the treatment of the fenton pre treated textile nf membrane concentrate effect of fenton process on biodegradability of membrane concentrate cod particle size distribution and respirometric tests were also evaluated 2 materials and methods 2 1 textile

for ro of water recovery was achieved 2 3 fenton experiments all experiments were performed with nf membrane concentrate which was provided from pilot membrane system a sequence of fenton s experiments was performed at different fe2 and h2o2 concentrations in the wide range of 1 35 mm and 5 175 mm respectively fenton s oxidation of 500 ml membrane concentrate samples was conducted in a glass beaker at room temperature as follows firstly the ph of membrane concentrate was adjusted to 2 95 0 5 e g the optimal ph of fenton s reaction 34 36 with concentrated h2so4 solution 6 n

permeates obtained from 220 nm membrane filter were filtered through different molecular weight cut off mwco 150 30 10 and 5 kda ultrafiltration membranes 2 5 respirometric biodegradation test respirometric measurements are important on the monitoring and control of biological systems microorganisms in activated sludge deplete oxygen while they consume organic material the level of microbial activity level in activated sludge is an indication of the oxygen uptake rate our batch respirometric tests were performed with adapted biomass from activated sludge system of municipal wastewater treatment plant at desired initial food microorganism ratio the mixture of wastewater and biomass was continuously aerated to provide the dissolved oxygen level above 5 mgo2 l in the tank respirometric experiments were carried out using an oxygen measurement probe that continuously measures dissolved oxygen concentration in the mixture our is collected until the reaction reaches the endogenous level as a result of the collected data our were calculated for wastewater 37 the dynamic method was used for the measurements of the our nf membrane concentrate treated with fenton process was aerated and added on an adequate volume of aerated activated sludge after the dissolved oxygen probe has been immersed into the mixture of biomass and wastewater contact with the air was blocked the measurement of dissolved oxygen was started after reading a constant value and was continued until the dissolved oxygen concentration decreased below 1 mg l the oxygen uptake rate was determined as the absolute value of the slope of the linear portion of the dissolved oxygen versus time curve 2 6 biological treatment fenton treated wastewater was entered to a 2 l reactor for the biological

conditions at current densities of 10 12 14 and 16 ma cm 2 these tests were performed using the power supply described in the section 3 2 which directly records the cell potential the duration of the electrolysis within the ec reactor retention times τ were 55 9 27 8 18 5 and 13 9 s which correspond to mean linear flow rates in the ec reactor u of 1 16 2 33 3 5 and 4 7 cm s 1 respectively meanwhile the flocculation and sedimentation processes last 15 min and 3 h respectively for each test as described in section 3 3 4 results and discussion 4 1 removal of hydrated silica and coexisting ions by ec fig 3 shows the remaining concentration of silica c h s versus the mean linear flow velocity at current densities of 10 12 14 and 16 ma cm 2 the experimental c al iii and theoretical c al iii n aluminum doses are also shown at 10 ma cm 2 the c h s presents values from 3 8 to 33 mg l 1 as a function of mean linear flow rate the c h s increase is due to the decrease of c al iii from 84 5 to 21 1 mg l 1 the c al iii and c al iii n are similar at 1 16 u 2 33 cm s 1 at u of 3 5 and 4 67 cm s 1 c al iii n c a l i i i these values can be a consequence of oxygen evolution reaction oer eq 9 which typically occurs simultaneously with eq 1 and on the other hand the al2o3 precipitation on the anode the current efficiencies of the coagulant determined by the ratio c a l i i i c a l i i i n 100 were comprised between 73 8 100 the lower values are a result of the oer and al2o3 precipitation on the anode 9 h2o o2 2h 2e at 12 14 and 16 ma cm 2 c h s ranged between 2 3 27 5 mg l 1 1 7 14 5 mg l 1 and 1 16 8 4 mg l 1 respectively the increase of current density permits the best removal of hydrated silica due to the increase in the dose of coagulant produced as shown in fig 3 the c a l i i i c al iii n ratio show similar patterns at 12 14 and 16 ma cm 2 to those obtained at 10 ma cm 2 whereas the current efficiencies of the coagulant were 76 8 100 77 100 and 79 98 for j of 12 14 and 16 ma cm 2 respectively fig 4 shows remaining concentrations of arsenic c a s fluoride c f and sulphate c s o 4 2 versus u determined during the ec trials of fig 3 the remaining concentration of arsenic 0 56 3 37 μg l 1 shows a slightly decrease with current density at 10 j 16 ma cm 2 due to the higher aluminum dose produced the curves c a s u show similar patterns to those obtained from the removal of hydrated silica except for the tests obtained at j of 10 and 12 ma cm 2 for u of 3 5 and 4 67 cm s 1 the remaining concentration of f 0 7 3 72 mg l 1 did not exhibit a pattern with current density moreover c f tends to decrease with u contrary to what was obtained with silica and arsenic this trend shows that the best removal of silica and arsenic inhibits the substitution reaction between the fluoride and the hydroxyl group from flocs 1 2 but the slight removal of silica and arsenic favors the removal of fluoride this shows that there is a competition between fluoride silica and arsenic for active sites in flocs the residual concentration of sulfates c s o 4 2 did not vary with u and j approx 50 mg l 1 while the phosphates were completely removed after all ec tests data not plotted the partial and complete removal of sulfates and phosphates respectively is by adsorption on the flocs 1 2 25 at the end of all ec tests the ph was around of 8 9 from the initial value of 8 02 this increase corresponds to the substitution of a hydroxyl of the floc with a fluoride 25 the abatement of hydrated silica is attributed to the massive formation of aluminum silicates during the ec at the high current densities tested here 10 j 16 ma cm 2 resulting in high concentrations of coagulant up to 139 1 mg l 1 moreover the residual arsenic and fluoride concentrations met the who guidelines the elimination of hydrated silica achieved here contrasts with the poor removal of this pollutant found in previous papers 1 2 but coincides with the removal efficiency of arsenic and fluoride in these investigations we employed two different ec reactors filter press type cells closed at the top where hydrogen bubbles cathodically produced broke the flocs at j 6 ma cm 2 the novel ec reactor opened to the atmosphere employed here allowed the release of gas at j 10 ma cm 2 and avoided the breaking of the flocs which permitted the elimination of hydrated silica 4 2 flocs characterization fig 5 shows typical sem micrographs of the flocs attained from the ec at 12 and 14 ma cm 2 at u 2 33 cm s 1 both micrographs exhibit flocs with irregular forms and dimensions 10 μm no significant size differences were observed between the particles at 12 and 14 ma cm 2 the flocs are formed by very fine particles with dimensions less than 100 nm table 3 reports the elemental composition of flocs determined by xrf analyses in areas of 650 μm 490 μm the three samples show similar compositions arsenic was determined in the samples between 51 to 75 μg g 1 while fluor was not detected the existence of silicon confirms the formation of aluminosilicate complexes table 4 summarizes typical composition of flocs obtained by eds analyses the presence of si also confirms the formation of aluminosilicates arsenic and fluor were not detected by eds due to their low concentrations all the elements detected by eds in concentrations higher than 1 0 wt were also detected by xrf table 3 the differences in composition determined by these two techniques resulted from the large sampling area used in the xrf analysis 8 04 cm2 which is more representative than the reduced scanned area used in eds around 0 005 μ m 2 fig 6 a shows the xrd pattern of the flocs attained at 12 ma cm 2 and u 2 33 cm s 1 the wide peaks located at 10 2 θ 19 and 22 2 θ 42 are the result of the

the samples at 12 ma cm 2 and u 2 33 cm s 1 fig 6 b wide bands are distinguished at 587 854 999 1412 1524 1634 and 3440 cm 1 very probably attributed to the following bonds al f as o si o al o si al o na f and o h it is worth noting that the ftir spectrum is very similar to that reported in previous papers 1 2 this spectrum confirms that arsenic is adsorbed on flocs and fluoride substitutes a hydroxyl group from flocs the eds xrf xrd and ftir analyzes carried out on the flocs confirm that the coagulant reacts with silica to yield aluminosilicates on the other hand fluoride replaces a hydroxyl group from flocs whereas arsenates phosphates and sulfates are adsorbed on aggregates 4 3 performance and costs of ec table 5 shows the residual concentrations of hydrated silica arsenic and

electrolysis within the ec reactor retention times τ were 55 9 27 8 18 5 and 13 9 s which correspond to mean linear flow rates in the ec reactor u of 1 16 2 33 3 5 and 4 7 cm s 1 respectively meanwhile the flocculation and sedimentation processes last 15 min and 3 h respectively for each test as described in section 3 3 4 results and discussion 4 1 removal of hydrated silica and coexisting ions by ec fig 3 shows the remaining concentration of silica c h s versus the mean linear flow velocity at current densities of 10 12 14 and 16 ma cm 2 the experimental c al iii and theoretical c al iii n aluminum doses are also shown at 10 ma cm 2 the c h s presents values from 3 8 to 33 mg l 1 as a function of mean linear flow rate the c h s increase is due to the decrease of c al iii from 84 5 to 21 1 mg l 1 the c al iii and c al iii n are similar at 1 16 u 2 33 cm s 1 at u of 3 5 and 4 67 cm s 1 c al iii n c a l i i i these values can be a consequence of oxygen evolution reaction oer eq 9 which typically occurs simultaneously with eq 1 and on the other hand the al2o3 precipitation on the anode the current efficiencies of the coagulant determined by the ratio c a l i i i c a l i i i n 100 were comprised between 73 8 100 the lower values are a result of the oer and al2o3 precipitation on the anode 9 h2o o2 2h 2e at 12 14 and 16 ma cm 2 c h s ranged between 2 3 27 5 mg l 1 1 7 14 5 mg l 1 and 1 16 8 4 mg l 1 respectively the increase of current density permits the best removal of hydrated silica due to the increase in the dose of coagulant produced as shown in fig 3 the c a l i i i c al iii n ratio show similar patterns at 12 14 and 16 ma cm 2 to those obtained at 10 ma cm 2 whereas the current efficiencies of the coagulant were 76 8 100 77 100 and 79 98 for j of 12 14 and 16 ma cm 2 respectively fig 4 shows remaining concentrations of arsenic c a s fluoride c f and sulphate c s o 4 2 versus u determined during the ec trials of fig 3 the remaining concentration of arsenic 0 56 3 37 μg l 1 shows a slightly decrease with current density at 10 j 16 ma cm 2 due to the higher aluminum dose produced the curves c a s u show similar patterns to those obtained from the removal of hydrated silica except for the tests obtained at j of 10 and 12 ma cm 2 for u of 3 5 and 4 67 cm s 1 the remaining concentration of f 0 7 3 72 mg l 1 did not exhibit a pattern with current density moreover c f tends to decrease with u contrary to what was obtained with silica and arsenic this trend shows that the best removal of silica and arsenic inhibits the substitution reaction between the fluoride and the hydroxyl group from flocs 1 2 but the slight removal of silica and arsenic favors the removal of fluoride this shows that there is a competition between fluoride silica and arsenic for active sites in flocs the residual concentration of sulfates c s o 4 2 did not vary with u and j approx 50 mg l 1 while the phosphates were completely removed after all ec tests data not plotted the partial and complete removal of sulfates and phosphates respectively is by adsorption on the flocs 1 2 25 at the end of all ec tests the ph was around of 8 9 from the initial value of 8 02 this increase corresponds to the substitution of a hydroxyl of the floc with a fluoride 25 the abatement of hydrated silica is attributed to the massive formation of aluminum silicates during the ec at the high current densities tested here 10 j 16 ma cm 2 resulting in high concentrations of coagulant up to 139 1 mg l 1 moreover the residual arsenic and fluoride concentrations met the who guidelines the elimination of hydrated silica achieved here contrasts with the poor removal of this pollutant found in previous papers 1 2 but coincides with the removal efficiency of arsenic and fluoride in these investigations we employed two different ec reactors filter press type cells closed at the top where hydrogen bubbles cathodically produced broke the flocs at j 6 ma cm 2 the novel ec reactor opened to the atmosphere employed here allowed the release of gas at j 10 ma cm 2 and avoided the breaking of the flocs which permitted the elimination of hydrated silica 4 2 flocs characterization fig 5 shows typical sem micrographs of the flocs attained from the ec at 12 and 14 ma cm 2 at u 2 33 cm s 1 both micrographs exhibit flocs with irregular forms and dimensions 10 μm no significant size differences were observed between the particles at 12 and 14 ma cm 2 the flocs are formed by very fine particles with dimensions less than 100 nm table 3 reports the elemental composition of flocs determined by xrf analyses in areas of 650 μm 490 μm the three samples show similar compositions arsenic was determined in the samples between 51 to 75 μg g 1 while fluor was not detected the existence of silicon confirms the formation of aluminosilicate complexes table 4 summarizes typical composition of flocs obtained by eds analyses the presence of si also confirms the formation of aluminosilicates arsenic and fluor were not detected by eds due to their low concentrations all the elements detected by eds in concentrations higher than 1 0 wt were also detected by xrf table 3 the differences in composition determined by these two techniques resulted from the large sampling area used in the xrf analysis 8 04 cm2 which is more representative than the reduced scanned area used in eds around 0 005 μ m 2 fig 6 a shows the xrd pattern of the flocs attained at 12 ma cm 2 and u 2 33 cm s 1 the wide peaks located at 10 2 θ 19 and 22 2 θ 42 are the result of the

o 15 were identified these phases caused the removal of arsenic fluoride sulfates and phosphates the ftir spectrum of the flocs ranged between 4000 500 cm 1 was used to identify the chemical bonds in the samples at 12 ma cm 2 and u 2 33 cm s 1 fig 6 b wide bands are distinguished at 587 854 999 1412 1524 1634 and 3440 cm 1 very probably attributed to the following bonds al f as o si o al o si al o na f and o h it is worth noting that the ftir spectrum is very similar to that reported in previous papers 1 2 this spectrum confirms that arsenic is adsorbed on flocs and fluoride substitutes a hydroxyl group from flocs the eds xrf xrd and ftir analyzes carried out on the flocs confirm that the coagulant reacts with silica to yield aluminosilicates on the other hand fluoride replaces a hydroxyl group from flocs whereas arsenates phosphates and sulfates are adsorbed on aggregates 4 3 performance and costs of ec table 5 shows the residual concentrations of hydrated silica arsenic and

14238,nitroaromatics have been released into wastewater during its production and application thus contaminating the ecosystem the stringent discharge limits of industrial effluents have led to the development of sustainable technologies for removal of nitroaromatics from wastewater in the present investigation separation of nitroaromatic compounds such as tnt tnp and tetryl from model wastewater was investigated by using supported ionic liquid membrane silm process various aliquat 336 based ionic liquids ils were synthesised and characterized and immobilized in ptfe and pvdf supports for the preparation of silms the key parameters such as type of il and striping phase feed phase ph selectivity for silm extraction kinetics and reuse of silm were studied in detail the size of il anion plays an important role in removal process the silm was found to be selective for tnp over other nitroaromatics maximum separation of tnp 95 was achieved with il a336 scn within 12 h selectivity and reuse of the membrane indicate the potential of silm technology as a sustainable chemical process for the treatment of nitroaromatics contaminated wastewater keywords nitroaromatics wastewater separation membrane ionic liquid 1 introduction the rising attention given to sustainable development incorporates both reduction of hazardous materials as well as recovery of energy from waste nitroaromatics are a class of organic compounds having large amount of chemical energy stored which may be manipulated to release in a controlled manner enormous amount of nitroaromatics such as o p nitrotoluenes 2 4 6 trinitrotoluene tnt 1 3 5 nitrobenzene tnb 2 4 6 trinitrophenylmethylnitramine tetryl trinitrophenol tnp hexanitrobenzene hexanitrostilbene are widely used in defence and industrial applications 1 2 major applications of nitroaromatics involve rocket and gun propellants missiles explosives and pyrotechnics some of them are also found to be useful in various industrial activities viz mining underwater blasting dyestuff precursor in synthetic leather intermediates in manufacture of photographic materials pharmaceuticals textile industries electric batteries and disinfectants 3 the manufacturing of nitroaromatics results in generation of contaminated waste streams which may pollute groundwater and soil 4 presence of these toxic materials in groundwater and industrial wastewater is hazardous for human beings as well as environment some of these compounds are eco toxic and persistent in environment and some have been classified as class c possible human carcinogen by the usepa 5 their presence can lead to several harmful health effects such as nausea destruction of red blood cells kidney and liver damage they are also skin sensitizer resulting in allergic contact dermatitis 6 the usepa has ambient criteria for presence of nitroaromatics in water for ex tnt in aqueous stream and drinking water are of 0 06 mg l and 0 049 mg l respectively 7 the maximum tolerable limit for total phenols in wastewater is of 1 ppm and drinking water is of 0 5 ppb 8 10 therefore separation of nitroaromatics from wastewater is very important most frequently employed techniques for the separation of nitroaromatics involve solvent extraction 11 solid phase extraction 12 cloud point extraction 13 adsorption 14 15 biodegradation 16 17 and molecular impregnated polymer 18 however these methods are technically complex require more energy and bulk quantities of solvents in this scenario membrane science could play a vital role leading to new opportunities in the optimization and replacement of industrial production processing 19 in fact membrane separation is a clean and environmental friendly technology that offers unique opportunity to improve the conventional technologies which is due to low energy consumption excellent selectivity for precise compounds high flexibility and easy scale up 20 for instance supported liquid membrane slm technology has created a great impact in recent years as it offers low power consumption minimum waste generation simple upgradation and environment friendliness 20 25 in slm the polymeric support usually consists of microporous hydrophobic polymers and does not play an active role in separation however it provides structural support to membrane organic complexing agent phase 26 27 recently research has been focused on the use of ionic liquid immobilized polymeric support silm in separation process the ionic liquids ils are made up of organic cations and organic or inorganic anions having melting temperatures below 100 c 28 it is reported that the silm has several advantages over slm due to low vapour pressure and high thermal stability of il therefore it improves the membrane stability minimizes the rate of pollution and reduces the toxic effect 29 30 the silm method having n alkyl 3 methyl imidazolium as a cation and halides cl br i nitrate no3 tetrafluoroborate bf4 and hexafluorophosphate pf6 as anions offers an efficient separation of phenols aliphatic acids and metals from wastewater 25 26 31 32 however the cost of imidazolium ils can be a major concern to use silm in industrial application 24 the use of low cost cyphos and aliquat 336 based il in silm process could be a promising choice for treatment of industrial wastewater 25 33 in this investigation a series of n methyl n n n trioctylammonium cation a336 based il with various anions ch3coo ntf2 scn bf4 and no3 were synthesised and characterized consequently these ils were immobilized into the membrane phase for selective separation of nitroaromatics from wastewater the commercially available hydrophobic polymers polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf and polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe were used for the support of il the feed phase was prepared by dissolving nitroaromatics tnp or tnt or tetryl in deionised water scheme 1 represents the structures of nitroaromatic compounds and ils which are used in present study an attempt has been made to optimize all the process parameters of the silm technique in order to achieve maximum separation of nitroaromatics from wastewater 2 experimental design 2 1 methods the hydrophobic polymers ptfe and pvdf were obtained from pall india pvt ltd mumbai india and durapore membrane filters ireland respectively all the ils were synthesised in laboratory by using a336 sigma aldrich the ph of feed phase was measured using hanna hi 2211 1 m h2so4 and naoh were used to adjust the ph of feed phase the nitroaromatics such as tnp tnt and tetryl were obtained from ordnance factory khadaki pune india the model wastewater was prepared by dissolving nitromatics in deionized water tka smart two pure thermofisher scientific the wastewater containing nitroaromatics was analysed before and after the extraction by using the hplc 34 agilent technology 1200 infinite series uv detector the contact angle of membrane was measured by using holmarc ho iad cam 01a india all the other chemicals were used without further purification 2 2 synthesis and characterization of ionic liquids the ils n methyl n n n trioctylammonium acetate a336 ch3coo n methyl n n n trioctylammonium nitrate a336 no3 n methyl n n n trioctylammonium tetrafluoroborate a336 bf4 and n methyl n n n trioctylammonium bis trifluoromethane sulfonyl imide a336 ntf2 were synthesised using reported method 35 further same procedure was applied to synthesise a new il n methyl n n n trioctylammonium thiocyanate a336 scn the purification of il was performed by dissolution of organic layer into the dichloromethane finally washed with deionized water and dried over magnesium sulphate and then filtered the filtrate was evaporated by using rotary vacuum evaporator at 70 c for 24 h to obtain pure il further the ils were characterized by using ft ir brukar alpha fr ir spectrometer with zn se atr crystal and gold coated mirror and the 1h and 13c nmr spectra were recorded in solvent cdcl3 on bruker aviiihd400 nb mhz 400 mhz and 100 mhz spectrometers with tetramethylsilane tms as an internal standard the spectroscopic analyses are provided in supporting information fig s1 s2 in addition the physico chemical properties of ils such as cl content volhard method moisture content karl fisher titrator melting point bichi m 560 viscosity viscotech hispania s l ip 20 and density anton paar were measured all the physico chemical properties of developed ils are given in table 1 2 3 preparation and characterization of silm the hydrophobic ptfe and pvdf polymers having porosities 95 and 92 and thickness 139 and 127 μm respectively were selected for the support of il the polymer had 0 45 μm pore size and 47 mm diameter their contact angles were measured and observed that ptfe was more hydrophobic than pvdf initially to make the pores free each polymer was kept in glass desiccators for 2 h at 2 bar vacuum pressure further 2 ml of il was impregnated in it by applying vacuum on opposite side the pressure was released once a thin layer of il was left on the upper surface of membrane this procedure was repeated twice to ensure that pores were completely filled with il as the ils are quite viscous the polymer was left to drip overnight to remove excess of il from the surface the immobilized quantity of il was determined by weighing the polymer before and after immobilization the morphological study of the raw polymer polymer impregnated with il and the same after wastewater treatment were performed by using fe sem 36 scanning electron microscope sem and energy dispersive x ray edx were recorded using carl zeiss s field emission scanning electron microscope σigma 03 18 germany the sem images of ptfe and pvdf show a highly porous network of the hydrophobic polymers fig 1 a d fig 2 a b demonstrates that the edx spectrum of ptfe displayed characteristic peaks of carbon 28 23 and fluorine 71 77 while pvdf revealed similar peaks for carbon 45 73 and fluorine 54 27 a lighter element like hydrogen was not detected in edx 36 the impregnation of il a336 scn in both the polymers was confirmed by sem fig 1b e the edx analysis of silm membrane with il revealed that the original fluorine content of both the polymers was lowered due to the dilution however there was an emergence of peaks corresponding to sulphur and nitrogen due to the scn anion the amount of il loading was calculated gravimetrically which was observed to be 0 152 g and 0 136 g for ptfe and pvdf respectively the developed silms were employed for separation of tnp and after experiment the change in morphology of silm was again studied by using sem edx the sem micrographs showed a negligible loss of il through the pores which was gravimetrically computed the edx spectrum of treated membranes revealed the presence of oxygen peak along with increase in nitrogen content and reduction in fluorine concentration whereas rise in carbon content all these peaks indicate the existence of nitro groups of tnp inside the membrane it may be attributed to the strong complexation between the il a336 scn and tnp 2 4 separation and analysis of nitroarmatics the transport of nitroaromatics was performed using a glass diffusion cell with two independent compartments 250 ml each separated by the silm a schematic of the setup of silm is shown in supporting information fig s3 the initial concentration of nitroaromatic in the feed phase was 100 ppm and 0 2 m naoh was used as a strip solution the transport experiment was commenced by adding 250 ml of each feed phase and strip phase solution into their respective compartments both the compartments were stirred at 600 rpm to avoid concentration polarization at membrane interfaces the concentration of nitroaromatic was monitored at room temperature by sampling 1 ml of each compartment at regular time intervals during the course of run the feed and strip phase of nitroaromatic samples such as tnp tnt and tetryl were analysed by using hplc ailent model infinite 1200 37 the chromatographic reverse phase c18 column was used with a size 15 cm 4 6 mm 5 μ m at 25 c a uv vis detector was used at a wavelength of 248 nm the analytes were eluted isocratically at a flow rate of 0 5 ml min 1 using acetonitrile water mobile phase 70 30 v v 10 μ l of the sample was taken for analysis the retention time rt of tnp tetryl and tnt were obtained at 4 0 5 5 and 8 62 min respectively the calibration of nitroaromatics gave linear regression curve which was observed by plotting amplitude y mau against the concentration x ppm the curve exhibited good linearity fig s4 and the representative data graphs are given in supporting information fig s5 and s6 all the aqueous samples of nitroaromatics were analysed by using this method consequently the percentage of extraction e flux j selectivity α and percentage of stripping sr were determined by using eq 1 to 4 1 e n i t r o a r o m a t i c x f e e d 0 n i t r o a r o m a

objective of this investigation was to study the feasibility of silms for separation of nitroaromatics from wastewater the present investigation was primarily focused on the separation of tnp tetryl and tnt from wastewater as these nitroaromatics are extensively used in various applications consequently the study was undertaken for evaluating critical parameters of silm process such as effect of ils different polymeric support feed phase ph different stripping agents and their concentration mixture of nitroaromatics and repeated use of silm the feed phase was prepared by dissolving tnp tetryl and tnt in deionised water initially the silm parameters were optimized by selecting tnp the initial feed phase ph was found to be 4 5 pvdf and ptfe polymers were used to immobilize the developed ils the analysis of nitroaromatics was carried out in triplicate and the results were found to be reproducible with standard deviation of 3 4 3 1 selection of ionic liquids the choice of il is crucial for an efficient performance of silm the hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions of il with nitroaromatics play an important role in transport of nitroaromatics inside the silm various extraction studies have been reported in which aliquat 336 was employed as a carrier for transfer of solute across the phases 12 in the present study aliquat 336 based ils namely a336 cl a336 ntf2 a336 ch3coo a336 scn a336 bf4 and a336 no3 were utilised along with ptfe support these anions were selected due to their electron rich nature which could help in easy transport of nitroaromatics via intermolecular interactions initially 100 ppm of tnp and 0 2 m of naoh were used as feed and strip solutions respectively the permeation experiments were carried out for 24 h and samples were collected at every 3 h for the analysis of tnp as shown in fig 3 in each silm maximum permeation of the solute occurred within 12 h additionally experiments have been conducted in the absence of il with raw pvdf and ptfe polymers and extraction efficiency of only 12 observed fig 3 demonstrates that il a336 scn exhibited better performance with a maximum extraction efficiency of 95 62 whereas a336 ntf2 showed only 45 67 extraction of tnp it could be attributed to the size of anion in il 38 the size of anion decreases in the order ntf2 0 232 nm bf4 0 229 nm cl 0 184 nm no3 0 179 nm ch3coo 0 162 nm scn 0 142 nm the scn anion has the smallest size and thus helps in trouble free hydrogen bond interactions with tnp resulting in highest extraction efficiency moreover smaller size of ions attract more solvent molecules feed phase and have larger solvated radii which leads to higher interactions 39 40 on the contrary il with ntf2 anion has largest size and hence creates trouble in achieving hydrogen bond interactions with tnp therefore the il a336 ntf2 exhibited lowest extraction efficiency however the bf4 and ch3coo based ils resulted almost similar extraction efficiency which could be due to the stronger effective charge of the bf4 than the latter it indicates that the role of anion significantly affects the extraction performance of nitroaromatics therefore the il a336 scn was used for studying further parameters of silm process interestingly it is important to note that maximum extraction achieved by using a336 scn impregnated ptfe is quite appreciable than various other reported studies on silm 26 38 3 2 selection of a polymeric support the selection of a polymeric support could play a decisive role in the overall membrane stability and mass transport for the separation of nitroaromatics from wastewater a hydrophobic support is preferable as it reduces mass transfer resistance between the two phases and the il will sustain for longer duration within the pores due to the hydrophobic interactions with support 23 it is expected that the silms will remain stable for a longer duration than the classical slms in which organic solvents are used to study the effect of membrane support on the performance of silm hydrophobic polymers namely pvdf and ptfe having pore size of 0 45 μm were utilised 41 in the present case both the supports were impregnated with il a336 scn the ptfe showed better loading of il 0 152 g than the pvdf 0 136 g because the former has slightly more porosity 95 than the latter 92 further these silms were treated with 100 ppm of tnp feed phase and 0 2 m naoh strip phase and permeation experiments were conducted up to 18 h the performance of both the silms in terms of extraction efficiency was found to be comparable ptfe 95 68 pvdf 94 76 interestingly both the silms have achieved better extraction 95 than their raw polymers 12 it is because the il due to its electron rich nature has very high affinity for the nitroaromatics than the raw polymer however ptfe with higher il quantity demonstrated better stability in aqueous phase extraction 42 and hence it was selected as support material for further experiments 3 3 role of feed phase ph the effect of ph could be an important parameter of study since the ph of nitroaromatics bearing industrial effluent varies widely therefore the role of feed phase ph in silm process was investigated by varying the ph of wastewater from 2 to 9 the initial ph of wastewater containing tnp was about 4 5 pka 0 38 the effect of ph on the removal of tnp was studied by adjusting the feed ph with 1 m h2so4 or nh4oh during the experiments the influence of ph on flux across the membrane was also studied and the results are given in fig 4 the percentage extraction of tnp and the overall flux j were calculated by using eq 1 and 2 respectively 43 44 the figure indicates that the removal efficiency of tnp was noticeably reduced as the ph was increased from 4 5 to 9 it is because tnp in aqueous phase lose its molecular state and may exist as tri nitrophenolate ion at high alkaline conditions 45 scheme 2 due to this the il reduces hydrogen bonding interactions with phenolate ion and hence it becomes difficult to transport inside the membrane ultimately it lowers the extraction and membrane flux at high alkaline ph at ph 4 5 it was found that extraction efficiency nearly remains same as that of original ph it is because tnp remains in molecular form at acidic ph subsequently leading to enhanced extraction 45 46 the flux of tnp through silm behaves similarly within the given ph conditions hence in present study the original ph value of 4 5 was found to be optimum and maintained in other experiments 3 4 selection of stripping agents the receiving phase and its concentration play an important role in deciding final recovery of target solute by silm process however very few reports are available on the effect of stripping agent on the performance of silm process 19 in this study various stripping agents like naoh na2co3 and nacl were used as receiving phase to evaluate the performance of silm the reported literature indicates that 0 1 m of naoh is sufficient to strip all the phenol from feed phase 23 38 therefore in present study to achieve complete transport of tnp and to avoid its back transport we have selected 0 2 m concentration of each strippant the feed was kept constant at 100 ppm of tnp ph 4 5 ptfe polymer impregnated with il a336 scn was used as silm and the run time was allowed for 12 h it was observed that the stripant 0 2 m naoh exhibited better performance with 95 transport whereas 0 2 m of nacl and na2co3 showed transport of 82 and 87 respectively one of the reasons for the transport of tnp through silm may be the difference of ph occurring between the feed and receiving phases naoh ph 14 is a strong base with high dissociation constant as compared to the salts nacl ph 7 and na2co3 ph 11 it therefore results in effective complexation of tnp with naoh 47 the final stripping values were observed to be 55 22 and 15 for naoh na2co3 and nacl respectively fig 5 the reason for moderate stripping could be due to the formation of strong complex between a336 scn and tnp however the stripping may vary with type of nitroaromatics and nature of complexation within the membrane 3 5 selectivity of tnp tnt and tetryl for silm it is important to demonstrate the selectivity of silm for mixture of solutes because the chemical industries may release various types of effluent in this case the wastewater may contain various mixtures of nitroaromatics and their derivatives and hence selective separation is vital from environment and recovery point of view to find out the selectivity of silm a mixture of nitroaromatics containing tnp tnt and tetryl were utilised as feed phase for this purpose wastewater containing 100 ppm concentrations of tnp tnt and tetryl was treated with silm at optimized conditions for 12 h the extraction values of tnp tnt and tetryl were obtained as 81 67 12 45 and 0 respectively the selectivity of tnp with respect to tnt was calculated by using eq 3 48 49 and it was found to be 33 46 the results indicate that the membrane has maximum selectivity towards tnp and negligible towards tetryl though the silm exhibited certain selectivity for tnt but maximum extraction occurred for tnp it could be attributed to the presence of acidic oh group in tnp which allow easy complexation with il thereby permitting maximum transport of tnp inside the membrane therefore tnp undergoes both hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions van der waal with il and thus exhibits maximum of extraction on the contrary the hydrogen bonding interactions are absent in tnt and tetryl and hence less extraction with il observed the negligible extraction of tetryl in il was attributed to the steric hindrance of n no3 group ultimately the absence of a strong complexation site in tnt and tetryl could be the reason for their poor selectivity for silm 3 6 repeated use of silm to study the reusability of silm the il with ptfe and pvdf support was repeatedly used for three consecutive cycles experiments were carried out at optimized parameters such as feed phase concentration 100 ppm tnp ph 4 5 strip phase concentration 0 2 m naoh il a336 scn stirring speed 600 rpm and stirring time 12 h a fresh feed of 100 ppm tnp was taken in every cycle fig 6 demonstrates that the percentage extraction of tnp slowly decreases which could be attributed to the saturation of the membrane with tnp slow stripping and marginal leaching of il it was also observed that even though the extraction efficiency is comparable for both the membranes in first cycle it changes in the subsequent cycles pvdf shows slightly lower stability for repeated cycles the better stability of ptfe may be accredited to the more hydrophobic nature of ptfe contact angle 102 compared to pvdf contact angle of 93 4 it also demonstrates that the hydrophobic interactions along with capillary forces are key factors in holding the il within a porous support both the membranes showed good stability for runs of more than 24 h although the membranes were continuously employed for three cycles no structural wear and tear was observed nevertheless the stability of silm can be further improved by using membrane supports with smaller pore sizes and high hydrophobicity 38 42 3 7 extraction kinetics and transport mechanism silm transport studies were conducted by performing the extraction of tnp at optimized conditions viz feed phase concentration 100 ppm ph 4 5 strip phase concentration 0 2 m naoh il a336 scn stirring speed 600 rpm and time 12 h the extraction of tnp was carried out at ambient temperature and pressure feed phase samples were collected at every 3 h and analysed by using hplc evaluation of kinetics of tnp extraction under the optimum operational conditions was estimated by fitting the time course performance data with ﬁrst order linearized reaction as given in eq 5 12 50 5 ln c t c 0 k a t where ct is the feed phase concentration at time t co is the initial feed phase concentration and ka is the apparent rate constant a plot of ln ct co versus time shows a straight line having a slope of 0 258 fig 7 hence the extraction of tnp using silm follows first order kinetics with the apparent rate constant ka 0 258 h 1 the transport mechanism is crucial in evaluating the performance of silm it was found that the selectivity of il towards tnp is a major factor in governing its efficient extraction to understand the chemical interaction between il and tnp solvent extraction studies were performed by stirring a mixture of il and tnp in 1 1 mol ratio for 15 min the resultant organic phase was characterized by using ftir fig 8 shows that hydroxyl oh stretching frequency of tnp is reduced from 3413 to 3378 cm 1 in aliquat scn tnp complex it may be due to the intermolecular interaction of aliquat scn with oh of tnp which weakens the oh bond and hence require lower energy for vibration consequently the partial negative charge of oxygen enhances the delocalization charge in aromatic ring and therefore the cc and n o stretching band frequency of tnp get reduced from 1633 to 1629 cm 1 and 1343 to 1305 cm 1 respectively the changes observed after complexation indicate the hydrophobic and intermolecular interaction of il with the hydroxyl group of tnp the strong chemical interaction of il with tnp causes hindrance in final stripping of tnp from the membrane hence moderate stripping of tnp was observed as de complexation became difficult fig 9 presents the possible reaction mechanism for the separation of tnp using aliquat based ils in silm process 4 conclusions nitroaromatics have been successfully separated from wastewater by immobilizing il in supported membrane various aliquat based ils have been used to impregnate the hydrophobic polymers ptfe and pvdf with decrease in size of anion an improvement in extraction efficiency is observed and therefore the role of anion plays an influential role in extraction performance by using ptfe immobilized a336 scn an extraction efficiency of more than 95 was achieved for tnp and the membrane was observed to be stable up to 3 repeated cycles the ph of wastewater also played a decisive role in silm process as the extraction is higher at acidic than alkaline conditions the silms are found to be selective which may be helpful in recovery of nitroaromatics from the mixture of propellants the extraction kinetics and transport mechanism of nitroaromatics revealed its interaction with il thus ils have potential environmental friendly behaviour due to their non volatility which sets them apart from conventional solvents the use of il in silm for separation technology has shown to be a promising alternative offering higher extraction efficiency better selectivity durability and great stability this makes it an attractive technique which can be easily scalable has acceptable kinetics and can be repeatedly used thereby making it suitable for applications in industrial separations

14238,nitroaromatics have been released into wastewater during its production and application thus contaminating the ecosystem the stringent discharge limits of industrial effluents have led to the development of sustainable technologies for removal of nitroaromatics from wastewater in the present investigation separation of nitroaromatic compounds such as tnt tnp and tetryl from model wastewater was investigated by using supported ionic liquid membrane silm process various aliquat 336 based ionic liquids ils were synthesised and characterized and immobilized in ptfe and pvdf supports for the preparation of silms the key parameters such as type of il and striping phase feed phase ph selectivity for silm extraction kinetics and reuse of silm were studied in detail the size of il anion plays an important role in removal process the silm was found to be selective for tnp over other nitroaromatics maximum separation of tnp 95 was achieved with il a336 scn within 12 h selectivity and reuse of the membrane indicate the potential of silm technology as a sustainable chemical process for the treatment of nitroaromatics contaminated wastewater keywords nitroaromatics wastewater separation membrane ionic liquid 1 introduction the rising attention given to sustainable development incorporates both reduction of hazardous materials as well as recovery of energy from waste nitroaromatics are a class of organic compounds having large amount of chemical energy stored which may be manipulated to release in a controlled manner enormous amount of nitroaromatics such as o p nitrotoluenes 2 4 6 trinitrotoluene tnt 1 3 5 nitrobenzene tnb 2 4 6 trinitrophenylmethylnitramine tetryl trinitrophenol tnp hexanitrobenzene hexanitrostilbene are widely used in defence and industrial applications 1 2 major applications of nitroaromatics involve rocket and gun propellants missiles explosives and pyrotechnics some of them are also found to be useful in various industrial activities viz mining underwater blasting dyestuff precursor in synthetic leather intermediates in manufacture of photographic materials pharmaceuticals textile industries electric batteries and disinfectants 3 the manufacturing of nitroaromatics results in generation of contaminated waste streams which may pollute groundwater and soil 4 presence of these toxic materials in groundwater and industrial wastewater is hazardous for human beings as well as environment some of these compounds are eco toxic and persistent in environment and some have been classified as class c possible human carcinogen by the usepa 5 their presence can lead to several harmful health effects such as nausea destruction of red blood cells kidney and liver damage they are also skin sensitizer resulting in allergic contact dermatitis 6 the usepa has ambient criteria for presence of nitroaromatics in water for ex tnt in aqueous stream and drinking water are of 0 06 mg l and 0 049 mg l respectively 7 the maximum tolerable limit for total phenols in wastewater is of 1 ppm and drinking water is of 0 5 ppb 8 10 therefore separation of nitroaromatics from wastewater is very important most frequently employed techniques for the separation of nitroaromatics involve solvent extraction 11 solid phase extraction 12 cloud point extraction 13 adsorption 14 15 biodegradation 16 17 and molecular impregnated polymer 18 however these methods are technically complex require more energy and bulk quantities of solvents in this scenario membrane science could play a vital role leading to new opportunities in the optimization and replacement of industrial production processing 19 in fact membrane separation is a clean and environmental friendly technology that offers unique opportunity to improve the conventional technologies which is due to low energy consumption excellent selectivity for precise compounds high flexibility and easy scale up 20 for instance supported liquid membrane slm technology has created a great impact in recent years as it offers low power consumption minimum waste generation simple upgradation and environment friendliness 20 25 in slm the polymeric support usually consists of microporous hydrophobic polymers and does not play an active role in separation however it provides structural support to membrane organic complexing agent phase 26 27 recently research has been focused on the use of ionic liquid immobilized polymeric support silm in separation process the ionic liquids ils are made up of organic cations and organic or inorganic anions having melting temperatures below 100 c 28 it is reported that the silm has several advantages over slm due to low vapour pressure and high thermal stability of il therefore it improves the membrane stability minimizes the rate of pollution and reduces the toxic effect 29 30 the silm method having n alkyl 3 methyl imidazolium as a cation and halides cl br i nitrate no3 tetrafluoroborate bf4 and hexafluorophosphate pf6 as anions offers an efficient separation of phenols aliphatic acids and metals from wastewater 25 26 31 32 however the cost of imidazolium ils can be a major concern to use silm in industrial application 24 the use of low cost cyphos and aliquat 336 based il in silm process could be a promising choice for treatment of industrial wastewater 25 33 in this investigation a series of n methyl n n n trioctylammonium cation a336 based il with various anions ch3coo ntf2 scn bf4 and no3 were synthesised and characterized consequently these ils were immobilized into the membrane phase for selective separation of nitroaromatics from wastewater the commercially available hydrophobic polymers polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf and polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe were used for the support of il the feed phase was prepared by dissolving nitroaromatics tnp or tnt or tetryl in deionised water scheme 1 represents the structures of nitroaromatic compounds and ils which are used in present study an attempt has been made to optimize all the process parameters of the silm technique in order to achieve maximum separation of nitroaromatics from wastewater 2 experimental design 2 1 methods the hydrophobic polymers ptfe and pvdf were obtained from pall india pvt ltd mumbai india and durapore membrane filters ireland respectively all the ils were synthesised in laboratory by using a336 sigma aldrich the ph of feed phase was measured using hanna hi 2211 1 m h2so4 and naoh were used to adjust the ph of feed phase the nitroaromatics such as tnp tnt and tetryl were obtained from ordnance factory khadaki pune india the model wastewater was prepared by dissolving nitromatics in deionized water tka smart two pure thermofisher scientific the wastewater containing nitroaromatics was analysed before and after the extraction by using the hplc 34 agilent technology 1200 infinite series uv detector the contact angle of membrane was measured by using holmarc ho iad cam 01a india all the other chemicals were used without further purification 2 2 synthesis and characterization of ionic liquids the ils n methyl n n n trioctylammonium acetate a336 ch3coo n methyl n n n trioctylammonium nitrate a336 no3 n methyl n n n trioctylammonium tetrafluoroborate a336 bf4 and n methyl n n n trioctylammonium bis trifluoromethane sulfonyl imide a336 ntf2 were synthesised using reported method 35 further same procedure was applied to synthesise a new il n methyl n n n trioctylammonium thiocyanate a336 scn the purification of il was performed by dissolution of organic layer into the dichloromethane finally washed with deionized water and dried over magnesium sulphate and then filtered the filtrate was evaporated by using rotary vacuum evaporator at 70 c for 24 h to obtain pure il further the ils were characterized by using ft ir brukar alpha fr ir spectrometer with zn se atr crystal and gold coated mirror and the 1h and 13c nmr spectra were recorded in solvent cdcl3 on bruker aviiihd400 nb mhz 400 mhz and 100 mhz spectrometers with tetramethylsilane tms as an internal standard the spectroscopic analyses are provided in supporting information fig s1 s2 in addition the physico chemical properties of ils such as cl content volhard method moisture content karl fisher titrator melting point bichi m 560 viscosity viscotech hispania s l ip 20 and density anton paar were measured all the physico chemical properties of developed ils are given in table 1 2 3 preparation and characterization of silm the hydrophobic ptfe and pvdf polymers having porosities 95 and 92 and thickness 139 and 127 μm respectively were selected for the support of il the polymer had 0 45 μm pore size and 47 mm diameter their contact angles were measured and observed that ptfe was more hydrophobic than pvdf initially to make the pores free each polymer was kept in glass desiccators for 2 h at 2 bar vacuum pressure further 2 ml of il was impregnated in it by applying vacuum on opposite side the pressure was released once a thin layer of il was left on the upper surface of membrane this procedure was repeated twice to ensure that pores were completely filled with il as the ils are quite viscous the polymer was left to drip overnight to remove excess of il from the surface the immobilized quantity of il was determined by weighing the polymer before and after immobilization the morphological study of the raw polymer polymer impregnated with il and the same after wastewater treatment were performed by using fe sem 36 scanning electron microscope sem and energy dispersive x ray edx were recorded using carl zeiss s field emission scanning electron microscope σigma 03 18 germany the sem images of ptfe and pvdf show a highly porous network of the hydrophobic polymers fig 1 a d fig 2 a b demonstrates that the edx spectrum of ptfe displayed characteristic peaks of carbon 28 23 and fluorine 71 77 while pvdf revealed similar peaks for carbon 45 73 and fluorine 54 27 a lighter element like hydrogen was not detected in edx 36 the impregnation of il a336 scn in both the polymers was confirmed by sem fig 1b e the edx analysis of silm membrane with il revealed that the original fluorine content of both the polymers was lowered due to the dilution however there was an emergence of peaks corresponding to sulphur and nitrogen due to the scn anion the amount of il loading was calculated gravimetrically which was observed to be 0 152 g and 0 136 g for ptfe and pvdf respectively the developed silms were employed for separation of tnp and after experiment the change in morphology of silm was again studied by using sem edx the sem micrographs showed a negligible loss of il through the pores which was gravimetrically computed the edx spectrum of treated membranes revealed the presence of oxygen peak along with increase in nitrogen content and reduction in fluorine concentration whereas rise in carbon content all these peaks indicate the existence of nitro groups of tnp inside the membrane it may be attributed to the strong complexation between the il a336 scn and tnp 2 4 separation and analysis of nitroarmatics the transport of nitroaromatics was performed using a glass diffusion cell with two independent compartments 250 ml each separated by the silm a schematic of the setup of silm is shown in supporting information fig s3 the initial concentration of nitroaromatic in the feed phase was 100 ppm and 0 2 m naoh was used as a strip solution the transport experiment was commenced by adding 250 ml of each feed phase and strip phase solution into their respective compartments both the compartments were stirred at 600 rpm to avoid concentration polarization at membrane interfaces the concentration of nitroaromatic was monitored at room temperature by sampling 1 ml of each compartment at regular time intervals during the course of run the feed and strip phase of nitroaromatic samples such as tnp tnt and tetryl were analysed by using hplc ailent model infinite 1200 37 the chromatographic reverse phase c18 column was used with a size 15 cm 4 6 mm 5 μ m at 25 c a uv vis detector was used at a wavelength of 248 nm the analytes were eluted isocratically at a flow rate of 0 5 ml min 1 using acetonitrile water mobile phase 70 30 v v 10 μ l of the sample was taken for analysis the retention time rt of tnp tetryl and tnt were obtained at 4 0 5 5 and 8 62 min respectively the calibration of nitroaromatics gave linear regression curve which was observed by plotting amplitude y mau against the concentration x ppm the curve exhibited good linearity fig s4 and the representative data graphs are given in supporting information fig s5 and s6 all the aqueous samples of nitroaromatics were analysed by using this method consequently the percentage of extraction e flux j selectivity α and percentage of stripping sr were determined by using eq 1 to 4 1 e n i t r o a r o m a t i c x f e e d 0 n i t r o a r o m a

objective of this investigation was to study the feasibility of silms for separation of nitroaromatics from wastewater the present investigation was primarily focused on the separation of tnp tetryl and tnt from wastewater as these nitroaromatics are extensively used in various applications consequently the study was undertaken for evaluating critical parameters of silm process such as effect of ils different polymeric support feed phase ph different stripping agents and their concentration mixture of nitroaromatics and repeated use of silm the feed phase was prepared by dissolving tnp tetryl and tnt in deionised water initially the silm parameters were optimized by selecting tnp the initial feed phase ph was found to be 4 5 pvdf and ptfe polymers were used to immobilize the developed ils the analysis of nitroaromatics was carried out in triplicate and the results were found to be reproducible with standard deviation of 3 4 3 1 selection of ionic liquids the choice of il is crucial for an efficient performance of silm the hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions of il with nitroaromatics play an important role in transport of nitroaromatics inside the silm various extraction studies have been reported in which aliquat 336 was employed as a carrier for transfer of solute across the phases 12 in the present study aliquat 336 based ils namely a336 cl a336 ntf2 a336 ch3coo a336 scn a336 bf4 and a336 no3 were utilised along with ptfe support these anions were selected due to their electron rich nature which could help in easy transport of nitroaromatics via intermolecular interactions initially 100 ppm of tnp and 0 2 m of naoh were used as feed and strip solutions respectively the permeation experiments were carried out for 24 h and samples were collected at every 3 h for the analysis of tnp as shown in fig 3 in each silm maximum permeation of the solute occurred within 12 h additionally experiments have been conducted in the absence of il with raw pvdf and ptfe polymers and extraction efficiency of only 12 observed fig 3 demonstrates that il a336 scn exhibited better performance with a maximum extraction efficiency of 95 62 whereas a336 ntf2 showed only 45 67 extraction of tnp it could be attributed to the size of anion in il 38 the size of anion decreases in the order ntf2 0 232 nm bf4 0 229 nm cl 0 184 nm no3 0 179 nm ch3coo 0 162 nm scn 0 142 nm the scn anion has the smallest size and thus helps in trouble free hydrogen bond interactions with tnp resulting in highest extraction efficiency moreover smaller size of ions attract more solvent molecules feed phase and have larger solvated radii which leads to higher interactions 39 40 on the contrary il with ntf2 anion has largest size and hence creates trouble in achieving hydrogen bond interactions with tnp therefore the il a336 ntf2 exhibited lowest extraction efficiency however the bf4 and ch3coo based ils resulted almost similar extraction efficiency which could be due to the stronger effective charge of the bf4 than the latter it indicates that the role of anion significantly affects the extraction performance of nitroaromatics therefore the il a336 scn was used for studying further parameters of silm process interestingly it is important to note that maximum extraction achieved by using a336 scn impregnated ptfe is quite appreciable than various other reported studies on silm 26 38 3 2 selection of a polymeric support the selection of a polymeric support could play a decisive role in the overall membrane stability and mass transport for the separation of nitroaromatics from wastewater a hydrophobic support is preferable as it reduces mass transfer resistance between the two phases and the il will sustain for longer duration within the pores due to the hydrophobic interactions with support 23 it is expected that the silms will remain stable for a longer duration than the classical slms in which organic solvents are used to study the effect of membrane support on the performance of silm hydrophobic polymers namely pvdf and ptfe having pore size of 0 45 μm were utilised 41 in the present case both the supports were impregnated with il a336 scn the ptfe showed better loading of il 0 152 g than the pvdf 0 136 g because the former has slightly more porosity 95 than the latter 92 further these silms were treated with 100 ppm of tnp feed phase and 0 2 m naoh strip phase and permeation experiments were conducted up to 18 h the performance of both the silms in terms of extraction efficiency was found to be comparable ptfe 95 68 pvdf 94 76 interestingly both the silms have achieved better extraction 95 than their raw polymers 12 it is because the il due to its electron rich nature has very high affinity for the nitroaromatics than the raw polymer however ptfe with higher il quantity demonstrated better stability in aqueous phase extraction 42 and hence it was selected as support material for further experiments 3 3 role of feed phase ph the effect of ph could be an important parameter of study since the ph of nitroaromatics bearing industrial effluent varies widely therefore the role of feed phase ph in silm process was investigated by varying the ph of wastewater from 2 to 9 the initial ph of wastewater containing tnp was about 4 5 pka 0 38 the effect of ph on the removal of tnp was studied by adjusting the feed ph with 1 m h2so4 or nh4oh during the experiments the influence of ph on flux across the membrane was also studied and the results are given in fig 4 the percentage extraction of tnp and the overall flux j were calculated by using eq 1 and 2 respectively 43 44 the figure indicates that the removal efficiency of tnp was noticeably reduced as the ph was increased from 4 5 to 9 it is because tnp in aqueous phase lose its molecular state and may exist as tri nitrophenolate ion at high alkaline conditions 45 scheme 2 due to this the il reduces hydrogen bonding interactions with phenolate ion and hence it becomes difficult to transport inside the membrane ultimately it lowers the extraction and membrane flux at high alkaline ph at ph 4 5 it was found that extraction efficiency nearly remains same as that of original ph it is because tnp remains in molecular form at acidic ph subsequently leading to enhanced extraction 45 46 the flux of tnp through silm behaves similarly within the given ph conditions hence in present study the original ph value of 4 5 was found to be optimum and maintained in other experiments 3 4 selection of stripping agents the receiving phase and its concentration play an important role in deciding final recovery of target solute by silm process however very few reports are available on the effect of stripping agent on the performance of silm process 19 in this study various stripping agents like naoh na2co3 and nacl were used as receiving phase to evaluate the performance of silm the reported literature indicates that 0 1 m of naoh is sufficient to strip all the phenol from feed phase 23 38 therefore in present study to achieve complete transport of tnp and to avoid its back transport we have selected 0 2 m concentration of each strippant the feed was kept constant at 100 ppm of tnp ph 4 5 ptfe polymer impregnated with il a336 scn was used as silm and the run time was allowed for 12 h it was observed that the stripant 0 2 m naoh exhibited better performance with 95 transport whereas 0 2 m of nacl and na2co3 showed transport of 82 and 87 respectively one of the reasons for the transport of tnp through silm may be the difference of ph occurring between the feed and receiving phases naoh ph 14 is a strong base with high dissociation constant as compared to the salts nacl ph 7 and na2co3 ph 11 it therefore results in effective complexation of tnp with naoh 47 the final stripping values were observed to be 55 22 and 15 for naoh na2co3 and nacl respectively fig 5 the reason for moderate stripping could be due to the formation of strong complex between a336 scn and tnp however the stripping may vary with type of nitroaromatics and nature of complexation within the membrane 3 5 selectivity of tnp tnt and tetryl for silm it is important to demonstrate the selectivity of silm for mixture of solutes because the chemical industries may release various types of effluent in this case the wastewater may contain various mixtures of nitroaromatics and their derivatives and hence selective separation is vital from environment and recovery point of view to find out the selectivity of silm a mixture of nitroaromatics containing tnp tnt and tetryl were utilised as feed phase for this purpose wastewater containing 100 ppm concentrations of tnp tnt and tetryl was treated with silm at optimized conditions for 12 h the extraction values of tnp tnt and tetryl were obtained as 81 67 12 45 and 0 respectively the selectivity of tnp with respect to tnt was calculated by using eq 3 48 49 and it was found to be 33 46 the results indicate that the membrane has maximum selectivity towards tnp and negligible towards tetryl though the silm exhibited certain selectivity for tnt but maximum extraction occurred for tnp it could be attributed to the presence of acidic oh group in tnp which allow easy complexation with il thereby permitting maximum transport of tnp inside the membrane therefore tnp undergoes both hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions van der waal with il and thus exhibits maximum of extraction on the contrary the hydrogen bonding interactions are absent in tnt and tetryl and hence less extraction with il observed the negligible extraction of tetryl in il was attributed to the steric hindrance of n no3 group ultimately the absence of a strong complexation site in tnt and tetryl could be the reason for their poor selectivity for silm 3 6 repeated use of silm to study the reusability of silm the il with ptfe and pvdf support was repeatedly used for three consecutive cycles experiments were carried out at optimized parameters such as feed phase concentration 100 ppm tnp ph 4 5 strip phase concentration 0 2 m naoh il a336 scn stirring speed 600 rpm and stirring time 12 h a fresh feed of 100 ppm tnp was taken in every cycle fig 6 demonstrates that the percentage extraction of tnp slowly decreases which could be attributed to the saturation of the membrane with tnp slow stripping and marginal leaching of il it was also observed that even though the extraction efficiency is comparable for both the membranes in first cycle it changes in the subsequent cycles pvdf shows slightly lower stability for repeated cycles the better stability of ptfe may be accredited to the more hydrophobic nature of ptfe contact angle 102 compared to pvdf contact angle of 93 4 it also demonstrates that the hydrophobic interactions along with capillary forces are key factors in holding the il within a porous support both the membranes showed good stability for runs of more than 24 h although the membranes were continuously employed for three cycles no structural wear and tear was observed nevertheless the stability of silm can be further improved by using membrane supports with smaller pore sizes and high hydrophobicity 38 42 3 7 extraction kinetics and transport mechanism silm transport studies were conducted by performing the extraction of tnp at optimized conditions viz feed phase concentration 100 ppm ph 4 5 strip phase concentration 0 2 m naoh il a336 scn stirring speed 600 rpm and time 12 h the extraction of tnp was carried out at ambient temperature and pressure feed phase samples were collected at every 3 h and analysed by using hplc evaluation of kinetics of tnp extraction under the optimum operational conditions was estimated by fitting the time course performance data with ﬁrst order linearized reaction as given in eq 5 12 50 5 ln c t c 0 k a t where ct is the feed phase concentration at time t co is the initial feed phase concentration and ka is the apparent rate constant a plot of ln ct co versus time shows a straight line having a slope of 0 258 fig 7 hence the extraction of tnp using silm follows first order kinetics with the apparent rate constant ka 0 258 h 1 the transport mechanism is crucial in evaluating the performance of silm it was found that the selectivity of il towards tnp is a major factor in governing its efficient extraction to understand the chemical interaction between il and tnp solvent extraction studies were performed by stirring a mixture of il and tnp in 1 1 mol ratio for 15 min the resultant organic phase was characterized by using ftir fig 8 shows that hydroxyl oh stretching frequency of tnp is reduced from 3413 to 3378 cm 1 in aliquat scn tnp complex it may be due to the intermolecular interaction of aliquat scn with oh of tnp which weakens the oh bond and hence require lower energy for vibration consequently the partial negative charge of oxygen enhances the delocalization charge in aromatic ring and therefore the cc and n o stretching band frequency of tnp get reduced from 1633 to 1629 cm 1 and 1343 to 1305 cm 1 respectively the changes observed after complexation indicate the hydrophobic and intermolecular interaction of il with the hydroxyl group of tnp the strong chemical interaction of il with tnp causes hindrance in final stripping of tnp from the membrane hence moderate stripping of tnp was observed as de complexation became difficult fig 9 presents the possible reaction mechanism for the separation of tnp using aliquat based ils in silm process 4 conclusions nitroaromatics have been successfully separated from wastewater by immobilizing il in supported membrane various aliquat based ils have been used to impregnate the hydrophobic polymers ptfe and pvdf with decrease in size of anion an improvement in extraction efficiency is observed and therefore the role of anion plays an influential role in extraction performance by using ptfe immobilized a336 scn an extraction efficiency of more than 95 was achieved for tnp and the membrane was observed to be stable up to 3 repeated cycles the ph of wastewater also played a decisive role in silm process as the extraction is higher at acidic than alkaline conditions the silms are found to be selective which may be helpful in recovery of nitroaromatics from the mixture of propellants the extraction kinetics and transport mechanism of nitroaromatics revealed its interaction with il thus ils have potential environmental friendly behaviour due to their non volatility which sets them apart from conventional solvents the use of il in silm for separation technology has shown to be a promising alternative offering higher extraction efficiency better selectivity durability and great stability this makes it an attractive technique which can be easily scalable has acceptable kinetics and can be repeatedly used thereby making it suitable for applications in industrial separations

14239,an efficient pretreatment system forms the backbone of a sea water desalination unit using reverse osmosis process the pretreatment of sea water is done to bring down the turbidity microorganisms colloidal contaminants total dissolved solids and silt density index of the raw sea water to acceptable levels and make it suitable for the reverse osmosis membrane process the two kinds of pretreatment processes used are the conventional system and the membrane systems the present review paper makes an effort to understand the conventional process microfiltration ultrafiltration nanofiltration and integrated membrane systems for the seawater pretreatment their advantages and limitations and the effect of the pretreated water on the performance of reverse

ultrafiltration keywords conventional pretreatment desalination integrated pretreatment systems membrane pretreatment novel pretreatment processes 1 introduction desalination during the past 50 years has sprung from being one of the prospective technologies to the most sought after processes to satisfy the need for fresh water supplies the technology to separate salts from sea water and utilize the desalinated water for potable industrial and agricultural use has created more avenues in research and development for its cost effective and efficient operation fig 1 indicates the amount of research work being carried out in the field and the number of publications in scopus indexed journals on desalination the process of desalination is carried out either by the thermal process or by the membrane process 3 8 the various techniques used in thermal process are multi effect distillation med multi stage flash msf and in membrane process are the reverse osmosis ro electrodialysis ed in case of thermal process the plant economics is equally divided into capital costs which involve design and fabrication of huge distillation columns and into the operating costs which is consumed by heating the sea water to its boiling point and the water free of salts evaporates and the condensed water is remineralized and used in membrane process the capital costs involve investment on multiple membrane modules and the operating costs are spent on pressurizing the sea water and passing through a semi permeable membrane the membrane retains the salts and allows water to pass through which is then re mineralized and used 2 researchers over the years have found that the treatment of sea water by membrane processes is the cost effective technique in comparison with other processes 1 59 the most important of the membrane processes is the reverse osmosis in this the sea water is pressurized to a value greater than its osmotic pressure and passed through a semi permeable membrane only the water molecules pass through the membrane leaving behind the salts of sea water the advantages of using membrane process for desalination of sea water can be summarized as follows 64 82 the driving force required for the operation is the pressure which eliminates the need for heat required for phase change the case for thermal processes or the use of solvents or adsorbents the case for extraction or adsorption processes relatively simple to design and operate and can be run on continuous mode membrane processes can be combined with other separation processes to give an integrated system in literature depending upon the membrane pore size the filtration of contaminants can be given by the schematics of fig 2 in the ro process the important part is the membrane performance the pores of the membrane usually get blocked by a number of foulants present in the sea water 1 based on a detailed study the foulants can be categorized as scalants particulate foulants organic foulants and biological foulants 3 73 1 the ro membranes are fouled when the inorganic salts of calcium magnesium strontium precipitate on their surface the commonly found scaling species in seawater are caco3 mg oh 2 caso4 srso4 baso4 caf4 and sio2 2 the suspended and colloidal particles present in the seawater such as clay algae and bacteria accumulate on the membrane surface resulting in particulate fouling 3 the organic matter like humic and fulvic acids with total organic carbon concentrations above 3 mg l and oil and grease content that amounts to more than 0 1 0 5 ppm and the soluble organic matter adsorb on the membrane surface and foul them 4 the intensification of microbes and their byproducts on the membrane surface and presence of bacterial counts greater than 106 cfu ml create a slimy layer on the membrane and consequently result in bio fouling of the ro membranes the fouling of membranes result in decreased membrane productivity which increases the back washing frequency decreases membrane life and meanwhile increases the capital cost of replacing the membrane module 6 hence pretreatment step forms an indispensible step to consider before subjecting sea water to ro treatment 3 4 the pretreatment is done either by conventional methods or by the membrane based techniques the conventional method usually consists of ph adjustment coagulation flocculation sedimentation single multimedia granular filtration and cartridge filtration steps 4 5 in membrane based techniques the sea water may follow the same order of conventional treatment and use a membrane module instead of a multimedia filter 41 48 table 1 gives an insight into the sea water quality parameter and their limits for the feed water into ro system 4 when the quality of the pretreated water meets the acceptable levels of the feed required for the ro membrane process the desalination process becomes efficient cost effective and an environment friendly system 78 a well planned and executed pretreatment system contributes to decreased frequency of cleaning of ro membranes thereby reducing the cost incurred due to cleaning chemicals decreasing the pressure drop due to fouling of membranes thereby reducing the total energy costs increased ro membrane life resulting from the consistent improved pretreated water quality increased productivity in the ro membranes due to high quality pretreated water decreased environmental impact resulting from the reduced use and further disposal of chemicals required for membrane cleaning 3 86 in the present paper efforts are made to study the various pretreatment processes adopted in lab scale pilot plant scale as well as on industrial scale to understand the conditions for effective operation of the seawater reverse osmosis pretreatment systems 2 pretreatment methods 2 1 conventional pretreatment method the source of sea water for the desalination process is either from open intake or beach well intake the source water composition varies due to various factors like industrial discharge water depth and temperature ocean currents and algae content 80 the various foulants in the sea water are chemical foulants which are responsible for membrane scaling particulate matter which are responsible for particle deposition on membrane surface biological matter which are responsible for bio fouling of the membranes and dissolved organic matter which interact with the membrane 49 the conventional pretreatment process is categorized into two ways as physical and chemical pretreatment the physical process does the basic mechanical screening of particulate matter through the screens and filters and the chemical process involves the addition of scale inhibitors coagulants and disinfectants 5 fig 3 shows the conventional pretreatment process the key contaminants to be filtered in the pretreatment step are the particulate suspended matter microbial contaminants and dissolved organic matter 2 7 2 1 1 disinfection screening and ph adjustment disinfection by chlorination is a necessary step to prevent biological growth which is responsible for the fouling of filters and membranes and in turn reduces the treatment performance addition of chlorine to sea water is done in the form of sodium hypochlorite or chlorine gas 13 after reacting with the sea water the residual free chlorine required to mitigate bio fouling is present in the form of sodium hypochlorite chlorine gas hypochlorous acid and hypochlorite ions 74 it is necessary to have a dechlorination process because the presence of residual chlorine in the stream results in oxidation and hydrolysis reactions at the ro membrane surface 31 one of the prospective alternatives to chlorination is by uv radiation which is yet to be explored on a wide scale the screening process consists of a simple mesh kept at an inclination to the stream of sea water the plants and debris in the sea water are stopped at the grids which are removed by a mechanical rake attached with the screens 23 the ph of sea water is always on the alkaline side due to the presence of salts which cause extensive scaling of the membranes involved in the treatment process 34 the performance of ro membranes is better at lower ph values and also lesser reactions on the membrane surface the ph of the sea water is maintained by the addition of sulfuric acid 2 1 2 coagulation and flocculation the primary purpose of coagulation and flocculation process is the removal of turbidity 26 turbidity is the cloudy appearance of water due to the small particles suspended therein the sea water obtained from open intake usually has a turbidity of above 30 ntu nephelometric turbidity unit and contains particles and microorganisms which are slightly negatively charged a coagulant is added to the water to neutralize the negatively charged particles the amount of coagulant dosage is decided by conducting a jar test on the sample of sea water the coagulant is added to the sea water and mixed for a known amount of time in a mixing chamber for even distribution 72 the coagulant neutralizes the charged particles and allows them to come closer together and form large clumps the water then passes through the flocculation basin where the clumps come closer to form large flocs which eventually settle during the sedimentation process most commonly used coagulants are the ferric salts like ferric sulfate and ferric chloride 32 aluminum salts are rarely used as even a trace amount of aluminum in the treated water may cause fouling of membranes in the ro systems depending on the solubility of the coagulants in sea water sulphuric acid is added to maintain the ph at 5 5 6 to optimize floc formation 66 the coagulation and flocculation process removes colloidal impurities suspended particles and some bacteria from sea water 36 2 1 3 sedimentation sedimentation is a treatment process in which the water enters a sedimentation basin and passes through the vessel with a reduced velocity to cause the suspended particles to settle due to gravity the sedimentation process is usually placed after the flocculation chamber so that the flocs formed during the process are settled at the bottom of the sedimentation basin following an optimum detention time in case of high turbidity sea waters the conventional sedimentation basins are coupled with lamella plates to produce water with desired turbidity levels 38 the lamella plate settlers consists of slanted plates over which the flocs settle and drift down to the lower portion of the sedimentation basin and clarified water passes upward through the plates and flows out of the basin 2 1 4 flotation flotation process is used to remove particulate impurities algal cells oil and grease which cannot be removed by sedimentation and thereby cause a threat to the downstream processes the most efficient technology is the dissolved air flotation daf 7 where fine air bubbles are made to pass from the bottom of the vessel 40 the air bubbles carry along with them the light particles and organic substances to the water surface which is then skimmed off the floating matter at the surface in the tank is skimmed off for disposal and the low turbidity water is collected from the bottom of the tank 2 1 5 filtration filtration is the process of removal of suspended particles in water when it passes through a filter medium when the water passes through the filter medium the flocs and impurities in water are held by the medium and the clear water passes through the filter 32 the filtration step is the final step and is usually preceded by coagulation flocculation and sedimentation processes for efficient removal of suspended solids certain chemicals called polymer aids are added prior to the filtration step to strengthen the floc and aid in filtering the flocs thereby improving the effluent water quality polymer aids are used in rare situations since due to their slippery nature any spillages have to be immediately cleaned to avoid mishaps and their extended usage may pose pore blockage problem in the filters 40 the types of filters used depending upon the driving force for filtration are gravity filters and pressure filters 4 the huge construction costs involved in the fabrication of large pressure filters limits their usage to small and medium size capacity plants gravity filters are used for both large and medium size capacity filtration plants depending upon the filter medium filters are classified as single dual and multimedia filters the single medium filters are sand filters dual media filters use sand and anthracite and in case of multimedia sand anthracite and garnet are used as filter media the media in case of multimedia filters are arranged in such a way that the water passes through the media with progressively small pores the media in the multimedia filters are chosen in such a way as to having varying density and varying pore size to aid in proper rearrangement of the media after filter backwash conventional filtration units used in pretreatment of sea water are single stage dual media filters using sand and anthracite 43 a two stage filtration units are used when the sea water contains high levels of organic matter algal content and suspended matter in two stage units the first stage is designed to remove coarser solids and organics and the second stage retain fine solids silt and soluble organics are removed by bio filtration 2 1 6 antiscalant addition the precipitation of salts and minerals of sea water on the membrane surface caused by super saturation is scaling the effect of scaling on membranes is reduced performance and decreased water recovery 40 the sulfuric acid added to adjust the ph of sea water controls the scaling by calcium carbonate in the earlier treatment processes sodium hexa meta phosphate was commonly used but has been rejected because of its disposal problems as well as its eutrophicating properties 81 in the recent times on a wide scale certain polymeric compounds are used as anti scaling agents 2 1 7 dechlorination the residual chlorine present in the feed water to ro system has the potential to cause damage to the membrane by oxidation and hence the process of de chlorination is a necessary step before the ro process 82 the damage to the membrane by the amount of chlorine in water depends on various factors like membrane material ph of sea water and also its temperature the deterioration of membrane is faster at alkaline ph values than in neutral or acidic sea waters and also at higher temperatures the most common agent used for de chlorination process is sodium bi sulfite alternatively activated carbon is also used to reduce the residual chlorine levels 2 2 plants using conventional pretreatment systems 2 2 1 case of an ro desalination plant of saudi aramco nicos p isaias of consulting services department from saudi arabia studied the conventional pretreatment systems and recorded observations with respect to the working of dual media anthracite sand filter in the process 23 in one of the reverse osmosis desalination plants of saudi aramco a conventional pretreatment system was employed consisting of screening chlorination coagulation rapid mixing flocculation gentle mixing dual media filtration anti scalant addition cartridge filtration dechlorination using sodium bi sulphite the system also incorporates sdi measurement and oxidation reduction potential sensors to ensure complete dechlorination in a conventional pretreatment process the deep bed dual media filters are considered as the heart of the pretreatment before the ro membrane process 51 52 the proper and efficient working of these filtration units becomes utmost important for reducing the sdi values of the filtrate to the levels acceptable as the ro feed water the working of the dual media filter is considered and according to the four challenges faced by the filtration operation the possible solution is suggested in table 2 discussions in plants utilizing the conventional pretreatment emphasis should be laid on proper selection of the medium in the multimedia filtration the design of multimedia in the filter bed needs to be designed by taking into account the nature and compatibility of the materials to be used in the medium the density of the material played a very crucial role in backwashing of the filter bed and also in calculating the height of each layer another factor that mattered was the uniform particle size distribution of sand in the medium the obtained sand with uneven particle size resulted in loss of fine sand during backwash cycles the particle shape and size in the multimedia filter bed needs to be configured in such a way as to prevent the percolation of finer sized particles through the inter particle distance in the above layer the filter backwash velocity should also be calculated by taking into consideration the nature of material in the filter medium the height of the filter medium and the minimum fluidization velocity of the entire filter bed sufficient backwash velocity and the frequency ensure proper functioning of the filter runs 2 2 2 case of a demonstration plant at carboneras spain noelia quevedo et al conducted a performance study on the ro pretreatment on an open intake desalination plant in carboneras spain 6 the objective was to study and test various combination of conventional treatment processes and understands the reliability and limitations of each process based on the sdi values obtained after every process in the pretreatment system the objectives were laid down to i get minimum sdi value of 5 ii get stable sdi value of 4 and iii get sdi value lower than 3 with a reliability of 90 in a confidence interval of 95 the raw seawater was collected form an open intake point located at a distance 150 m offshore and at a depth of about 15 m below the sea level the plant consisted of pumping seawater to the pretreatment line from the inlet chamber acid or alkali addition to maintain the ph of seawater an actiflo system consisting of coagulation polymer and microsand injection maturation and settling of microsand ballasted flocs a multimedia filter operating under atmospheric pressure two multimedia filters operating under applied pressure arranged in series and a reverse osmosis system other intermediate tanks and pumps are also installed in the plant to try various combinations of pretreatment the various reagents used in the pretreatment are hydrochloric acid is used for ph adjustment ferric chloride 40 fecl3 and a commercial coagulant hydrex 3240 17 5 al2o3 are used as coagulants commercial organic coagulant polidadmac pd340 and pd420 and commercial flocculants hydrex6111 and hydrex3551 are used and to produce the ballasted flocs in the actiflo process microsand of effective size of 80 μm and uniformity coefficient of 1 5 was used the whole pretreatment process was monitored and controlled by a scada system consisting of on line equipment like flow meters and ph meters and pressure and level sensors the performance was evaluated based on the main statistical parameters of the selected data distributions such as mean standard deviation number of samples the adjusted anderson darling statistic and the pearson correlation coefficient for the various combinations the various combinations tested and the result based on the sdi effluent values achieved is presented in the table 3 discussions the above results indicate that the combinations 2 and 4 work best to achieve the objectives of the study since the required objectives based on sdi values required for the feed to the ro system is achieved in the above conventional treatment combinations the study is a proof that membrane pretreatment is not always justified over conventional pretreatment and quite a few times ro systems work better with conventional pretreatment systems 2 3 merits and demerits of conventional pretreatment the most important advantage of the conventional treatment process is that it is practiced since a long time and hence is proven and is a familiar technology to employ 25 the process does not require a strainer since all the particulate matter is removed before the stream reaches the membranes the system eliminates organic matter along with the suspended material from the stream 74 the disadvantages of the conventional treatment process are that it is sensitive to changes in source water characteristics and hence requires different dosages of treatment chemicals 38 it requires large space for the various process steps involved and also large amount of process chemicals the resultant stream from the pretreatment process has high turbidity and sdi values when compared with the acceptable levels for the ro process 62 63 87 the research in the field of conventional pretreatment in the recent times has focused on making the process more competent with other available options by considering the following reforms 16 alterations in seawater intake points introducing daf in the conventional pretreatment system dynamic filter backwashing cleaning processes and modified chemical dosages to the system alternative technologies to reduce consumption of chemicals with solutions at hand for the above mentioned problems conventional and integrated systems should be equally accepted for pretreatment processes 3 membrane pretreatment systems 3 1 microfiltration microfiltration and ultrafiltration processes are the most widely used pretreatment systems for desalination using sea water reverse osmosis technology 14 18 in the microfiltration process the filters ranging from pore size 10 μm to 0 1 μm facilitate removal of colloidal particles suspended matter and to some extent bacterial matter 24 47 from the past 15 years extensive research has been carried out to establish microfiltration process as the pretreatment in place of conventional pretreatment methods 29 30 studies indicate the increase of water flux through membranes and lowering of sdi15 sdi15 is the measure of fouling capacity of water in ro systems the test measures the rate at which 0 45 micro m filter is plugged when subjected to a constant water pressure of 206 8 kpa 30 psi the sdi15 gives the percentage drop per minute in the flow rate of water through the filter averaged over a period of time such as 15 min sd i 15 1 t 1 t 2 100 t 15 where t1 filtration time for volume 1 ml t2 filtration time for volume 2 ml t15 time for testing min the sdi15 of the pretreated water is required to be less than 3 when it is to be used in ro systems 37 the efficiency of microfiltration process is based on the measurement of water flux through the membrane turbidity and the sdi15 values 67 69 microfiltration units are designed based on the driving filtration force as pressure filters and vacuum driven filters mf pressure units consist of membrane elements arranged in a rack and placed in pressure vessels 50 vacuum driven units consist of membranes modules submerged in an open tank of source water pressure filters operate in the pressure range of 1 0 2 5 bars and the vacuum driven filters operate in the range of 0 1 0 8 bars 4 3 1 1 case of laboratory pilot scale of submerged mf membranes various studies have been conducted on using microfiltration process for efficient pretreatment one such study conducted by masse et al shows the use of submerged microfiltration membrane unit for the removal of undesirable micro algae 57 the toxic micro algae found worldwide in the coasts of many countries behave like harmful algal blooms which pose serious a threat to the downstream ro membranes the configuration consists of a submerged mf unit with the pore size of 0 2 μm used for the total retention of micro algae the parameters measured for the evaluation of the membrane involve the mfi turbidity micro algae retention suspended solid matter and toc by knowing the permeate flux trans membrane pressure permeate dynamic viscosity membrane resistance fouling resistance membrane surface area specific resistance of deposited cake above parameters are calculated and found that the 0 2 micro m membrane provides 99 99 87 and 66 retention rate for micro algae turbidity suspended solid matter and total organic carbon respectively discussions the study gives an insight into the retention of algae by a 0 2 μm membrane and considerable rejection in terms of turbidity suspended solids and total organic carbon but it leaves the fouling studies incomplete as can be seen from the fouling studies of all three membranes the irreversible fouling due to the presence of dissolved solids and the salts present in the seawater preferentially decreases the membrane life the authors suggest that the microfiltration membranes are the better performing ones due to their flux and algae retention but from the filtration studies it is evident that the resistance due to fouling of membranes is maximum in case of microfiltration membranes further work on membrane cleaning and evaluating the fouling tendencies will give better prospects for the membranes to be used for the toxic algae retention with appreciable membrane life cycle another experimental study conducted by kim et al analyses the effect of coagulation on the source water prior to micro filtration process 46 the research is based on the parameters like increased water flux through mf membranes increased turbidity removal and a reduction in sdi levels the membranes are hollow fiber type made of polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf material with pore size of 0 1 micro m the source water considered in the research is synthetically prepared sea water to which ferric chloride is added as the coagulant the effect of coagulation is studied by varying the amount of coagulant addition and also the ph of the synthetic sea water from the results it was concluded that there was a sharp decline in the flux but the permeate quantity was superior when compared with the process carried out without coagulation pore blocking was found to be the phenomenon responsible for membrane fouling and hence the decline in flux the sdi values required for the swro membranes was less than 3 but the sdi values after mf pretreatment was found to be slightly greater at 3 17 the turbidity was also reduced from a value of 10 ntu of source water to 0 055 ntu after mf process discussions the examination of the membranes using sem and test conducted on flux turbidity and sdi all indicate that the membrane performance in terms of permeate quantity and quality were enhanced by the use of coagulation process with an optimum coagulant dosage at optimum ph value of the source water the research deals with testing the commercial membranes by using synthetically prepared seawater the feed water to the module is made up of various reagents and chemicals to cause turbidity the study does not take into account the interference of biological matter which claims equal priority as the suspended and dissolved salts in the feed water in a conventional or a hybrid pretreatment system the coagulation step is followed with a sedimentation step for the removal of heavier flocs and a filtration step to get rid of the flocs which have a tendency for pore blockage in membranes in the current study no such filtration step is involved before the feed enters the membrane module to avoid pore blocking in membranes the solution to pore blockage has not been addressed 3 2 ultra filtration in the recent years of experimental research uf pretreatment process is considered the most promising technology for treating the source water for swro the pore size in case of uf membranes range from 0 01 0 1 μm and aid in the removal of suspended or colloidal matter silt bacterial matter and also viruses from source water 27 28 uf process is the most widely used method for the sea water pretreatment system 19 21 the pore size of uf membranes is smaller than that of mf membranes thus facilitating effective removal of particulates colloidal solids bacterial matter and virus 10 42 44 45 the pore size of uf membranes being larger than that of nf membranes allow higher water flux than nf membranes and hence prove to be most suitable pretreatment method for swro process 11 12 15 a typical membrane pretreatment unit consists of coarse or fine screens to remove larger objects and plants a micro screen to remove fine particles followed by an uf system 54 56 the uf membranes do not remove dissolved organic matter and marine microbes which are the main cause for bio fouling of downstream ro membranes their fouling effect can be reduced considerably by designing the system as membrane bio reactors 70 71 in general membrane pretreatment processes are classified based on the driving force for filtration as pressure filters and vacuum driven filters voutchkov sheds light on the importance of operating pressures in uf systems 4 the operating pressures in uf systems is higher than the threshold pressure at which the algal cells break and release easily bio degradable organic matter into the filtered sea water during algal bloom it is required that the algae are removed prior to membrane treatment by either dissolved air flotation or granular media filtration to mitigate the bio fouling effect on the membranes above theory is confirmed by conducting tests at the desalination plant at carlsbad during heavy algal bloom conditions the sea water was subjected to daf followed by granular media filtration and then passed through the vacuum driven uf pretreatment system tests conducted on the uf pretreatment filtrate preceded by granular media filtration show to have considerably decreased bio fouling effect on the swro membranes 65 3 2 1 case of lab scale submerged ultrafiltration plant operating with seawater from tyrrhenian coast southern italy hawlader et al 14 conducted experimental studies to compare mf and uf pretreatment for sea water prior to ro membranes the membranes for the uf systems were of hollow fiber type made of poly ether sulfone having a nominal pore size of 0 01 μm operated in cross flow mode of filtration the chemical analyses conducted on the filtrate produced from the uf pretreatment indicated a significant percentage removal of colloidal silica and coliform group of bacteria and a small percentage removal of toc the sdi test conducted on the filtrate indicated that the sdi values varied between 0 7 3 which are within the range prescribed for the source water to be used for ro membranes when the uf system was operated using sea water directly a decrease in filtrate flux and a gradual increasing trend in the transmembrane pressure during the test was observed the uf system was maintained by periodic backwashing at every 30 90 min interval along with disinfection using sodium hypochlorite to prevent bio fouling of the uf membranes the studies concluded that uf pretreatment system produced better quality and quantity of filtrate when compared with mf systems it also emphasized the ease of using membrane pretreatment systems which would considerably reduce the fouling propensity of the ro membranes discussions the authors have results that show a 50 removal of suspended solids though the membranes have an average pore size much lesser than that of the suspended and colloidal matter in the feed water and the justification for the same is not furnished the chemical analysis of permeate indicated that the removal of organic material and bacteria from the feed stream do not show a decisive results and the reason for the passage through the membranes remains unknown it would have been beneficial to have a multimedia filtration unit before the uf to avoid the buildup of solids on the membrane surface which increases the transmembrane pressure and also the frequency and duration of the filter backwashing process 3 2 2 case of industrial scale pilot plant at barcelona spain in another study a r guastalli et al compared the performance of dual media filters dmf and uf pretreatment in the removal of particulates and dissolved organic matter 43 initially a dissolved air flotation system daf equipped with coagulation and flocculation chamber is employed for the removal of particulates algae and heavy hydrocarbons this stream forms the feed stream for both the dmf and uf systems to compare their performance on the removal efficiencies the dmf system consists of a layer of sand and anthracite the uf membranes are made of poly vinylidene difluoride with a pore size of 0 02 μm operating in pressurized outside in mode the filtrate analyses of both the dmf and the uf systems show an appreciable decrease in turbidity sdi15 values and algae removal the turbidity of the filtrate were found to be 0 1 and 0 06 ntu for dmf and uf systems respectively and total suspended solids was undetectable for both streams sdi15 values were found to be 2 and 1 respectively for dmf and uf systems the comparison between the performances of the two membranes was done by carrying out biological analyses of the filtrate stream the uf system exhibited 100 algal content removal whereas the dmf system showed just 60 removal the uf pretreatment presented a better removal percentage for the bacterial concentration than the dmf systems among the dissolved organic contaminants both the systems were observed to be better in the removal of bio polymers the dmf system shows a lower removal percentage of around 18 and the uf systems present bio polymer removal of around 41 the studies concluded that both the dmf and uf systems proved to be equally competitive for the pretreatment of sea water when preceded by a daf process the dmf system proved to be on par with uf process to produce a filtrate with the sdi15 values turbidity and total suspended solids within the prescribed limit the uf system proved to be better in 100 removal of algal content and bio polymers to a considerable range both the systems were found to be inefficient in removal of natural organic matter the uf system was adjudged as the better pretreatment system due to its capability of removal of bio polymers to a greater extent since they are responsible largely for the bio fouling of downstream ro membranes discussions the study proves through analyses of various results that the uf system comparatively works with higher efficiency than the dmf system the study does not consider the raw seawater quality with respect to the presence of the concentration of algal matter it is known that the duration between the months of march and july creates a rise in temperature of seawater and consequently results in a high and stable algal concentration during the months from august to february it is observed that there is a low algal activity the research does not highlight an alternative change in the conventional pretreatment or in the daf system to address this issue the removal of natural organic matter needs to be addressed with an improved methodology before dmf and uf to effect removal 3 3 nano filtration nanofiltration nf is a comparatively recent membrane filtration process used most commonly with waters having a low concentration of total dissolved solids 35 the pore size in case of nf membranes range from 1 to 10 nm and they lie between ultrafiltration and reverse osmosis membranes these membranes remove most organic molecules viruses natural organic matter and a range of salts 53 58 nanofiltration removes the divalent ions and hence commonly used for water softening applications 60 61 nf membranes are found to retain 60 70 of monovalent ions when used as a pretreatment for seawater which reduces the tds content of the seawater thereby decreasing the osmotic pressure 76 this reduction in osmotic pressure ensures increased recovery and efficient operation of ro system for desalination of seawater 9 53 3 3 1 case of nf swro demonstration unit at saudi arabia hassan et al from the saline water conversion corporation conducted studies on using nf membrane for pretreatment before the ro membranes for desalination of gulf seawater 77 the study was conducted on a pilot plant of capacity 20 m3 day the system comprises of nano filtration unit for pretreatment of seawater and a reverse osmosis unit for desalination purpose the pilot plant includes a seawater intake system dual media filter a fine sand filter a 5 μm cartridge filter a feed tank the nf pretreatment unit and the swro unit the nf pretreatment unit consists of a high pressure pump five nf modules each containing two commercial nf membrane elements of size 4 x40 the nf modules are connected in series and parallel combination the swro unit includes a high pressure pump and six swro modules each containing a commercial spiral wound element of size 2 5 x40 connected in series the pretreatment unit was operated without coagulation and without the addition of acid occasionally acid is added to maintain ph at 7 the nf unit was maintained at 18 bar operating pressure and the swro unit was operated at 56 bar pressure the results of the studies are presented in table 4 from the studies conducted it is concluded that the nf pretreatment reduces the turbidity bacteria scale forming hardness and the tds content of the gulf seawater feed to impressible levels the nf pretreatment process not only eliminates the use of chemicals but also increases the permeate flux reduces the energy consumed during the swro process thereby decreasing the total water cost and hence proves that the operation of seawater desalination plants when combined with nf pretreatment is superior in performance when compared with other pretreatment processes 79 discussions the studies were conducted on a pilot plant and by the encouraging results obtained the same combination of nf pretreatment for swro was conducted in a demonstration unit and the results were reiterated this system was to be applied to a nf swro plant at umm lujj saudi arabia the bacteriological analyses of the nf permeate stream revealed a very small count of bacteria present the pore size of the nf membranes being much finer than the bacteria size the possibility of bacteria appearing in the permeate in itself is bleak the issue is of serious concern since the bacteria will be a threat to swro membranes in terms of bio fouling 4 novel processes for pretreatment some of the pretreatment processes carried out on a pilot plant basis concentrate on providing the same effect as the already established pretreatment processes and also cause less harm to the environment by utilizing nature friendly approaches 4 1 case of an electrochemical reactor the research work conducted by s yi et al and a few other researchers focuses on a one step electrochemical method for pretreatment of seawater 22 84 85 the electrochemical process for removal of pollutants involves either the electro oxidation with insoluble anodes or by electro coagulation using consumable materials in the electro oxidation method the pollutant is destroyed in the bulk solution by virtue of the action of strong oxidants which are released in the electrochemical reactions in the electro coagulation method a coagulant is generated on site by dissolution of a metal from the anode and also hydroxyl ions and hydrogen gas is generated at the cathode the gas generated makes the flocculated particles to float on the water surface in the studies conducted so far concentration is on optimization of removal of a specific pollutant by altering the experimental conditions such as the ph conductivity current density and electrode materials and applicability of the electrochemical methods for seawater pretreatment 4 2 case of mineral carbonation the research work by junsheng yuan et al uses the mineral carbonation method as a single solution for two problems first as a method for carbon dioxide sequestration and seawater decalcification 33 the brine pretreatment waste of soda ash plant is a suspension of magnesium hydroxide and calcium carbonate which if left untreated becomes a potentially harmful contaminant to the environment this source of magnesium hydroxide is used as the alkali source and seawater decalcification is carried out using carbon dioxide gas in this method the decalcification is done for seawater which removes the calcium salts present in seawater thereby reducing the scaling potential of sea water and hence the desalination performance is increased the use of magnesium hydroxide and also carbon sequestration proves to be an added advantage since the harm to the environment is controlled 4 3 case of an integrated system consisting of granular activated carbon and ultrafiltration system the research work by dr stephanie laborie et al focused on the removal of bacteria dissolved organic carbon doc and transparent exopolymer particles tep present in natural seawater which are difficult to handle in a conventional pretreatment system 83 a combination of granular activated carbon gac adsorption and ultrafiltration in the pretreatment step was proposed and tried before the ro process in a community scale desalination plant with a capacity to produce 5 m3 day of desalinated water the studies conducted on the plant for a 2 month duration showed that the gac bed could reduce the doc level by 20 80 concentration and the ultrafiltration membrane could retain most of the tep and bacteria present ahead of the ro module the stable operating parameters indicated that there was no biofouling and as a result of this no extensive use of chemicals was required for the pretreatment and the ro recovery rate also increased thereby decreasing the energy consumption required for the ro unit operation the decreased energy requirement has made to opt for alternate renewable energy sources such as installation of photovoltaic power in order to be energy sufficient the installation and studies on the same is being carried out at present 4 4 case of a pilot plant using photovoltaic system using solar energy the research work by jamal khan et al tries to integrate desalination technology with renewable energy sources for in land brackish water 34 a pilot plant study was conducted in the pretreatment process with a combination of forward osmosis fo ultrafiltration uf and cartridge filtration cf prior to ro membranes studies were made on the fo ro uf ro and cf ro systems to analyze the salt rejection capabilities of the three configurations with synthetic brackish water of known tds values the uf and the fo processes were successful in bringing down the salt concentration in the synthetic brackish water resulting in lesser frequencies of ro membrane cleaning procedures the energy to the plant was provided by a 2 kw h photovoltaic system pv installed in the plant area 5 case studies 5 1 case of an economic evaluation of a membrane pretreatment system for a sea water ro plant at texas a pilot plant study was carried out to compare between the membrane and the conventional pretreatment processes by lisa henthrone of aqua resources international denver colorado the study was supported by the u s department of interior bureau of reclamation water treatment engineering and research group denver colorado the study comprised of evaluation of various membrane pretreatment and conventional pretreatment processes 3 the sea water was collected from corpus christi bay in the gulf of mexico the pilot plant study was carried out utilizing four ultrafiltration membranes from various manufacturers and conventional pretreatment consisting of coagulation and multimedia filtration sand anthracite and garnet in the first phase optimization of both the membrane and conventional pretreatment processes were done and in the second phase the pretreated water was fed to two separate ro trains and the performance was studied the objectives of the work included a quality comparison between conventional and membrane processes based on values of total suspended solids turbidity silt density indices total organic carbon and heterotrophic plate counts and conduct a comparison of the effectiveness of the pretreatment methods evaluate impact of conventional and membrane pretreatment on the overall operation of ro by measuring the cleaning and maintenance requirements pressure drops permeate water quality evaluate biofouling in the ro system evaluate cost comparison between conventional and membrane pretreatment by assessing the overall life cycle economics the raw feed water had turbidity spikes of over 100 ntu and an average turbidity of 9 9 ntu over a 15 month period it was evaluated that the membrane pretreatment produced high quality pretreated water by maintaining filtrate turbidities less than 0 1 ntu the sdi values were maintained consistently below 3 of the filtrate from the membrane pretreatment systems the conventional system resulted in turbidity values of an average of 1 9 ntu and produced a range of sdi values of 3 to 6 and occasionally above 6 microbiological removal evaluation was conducted for membrane pretreatment process and it was found that though the pore size of the membranes used were of the order of 0 01 0 1 μm in size the marine bacteria were extremely small in their size and hence the membrane filtration system could not act as an effective disinfection barrier for marine bacteria the economic analysis of the pretreatment systems based on total water cost indicates that the membrane pretreatment system is 3 4 less expensive than the conventional pretreatment system the total water cost for the facility using membrane systems is 0 55 m3 and for facility using conventional system is 0 59 m3 based on the capital cost consideration membrane systems prove to be 2 more expensive than conventional systems based on operation costs the ro system cleaning becomes one of the important things to be considered the membrane systems require two cleanings per year whereas the conventional systems require nine cleanings per year and this contributes significantly to the operating costs of the plant 3 5 2 case of various pretreatment methods in a pilot plant study at singapore hawlader et al studied the pretreatment processes by conducting pilot trials in the coastal areas in sinagapore the comparison study was made between a conventional system two ultrafiltration systems and a microfiltration system 14 the conventional pretreatment system comprised of coarse screens before the seawater supply pumps gravity driven single medium sand filter and a three stage 10 5 1 μm polishing cartridge system the coarse screens were effective in removal of large pieces of rocks and barnacles the sand filters removed the smaller particles and colloids and to prevent any leakage of suspended particles from the sand filters a micron cartridge filter was provided as a final stage polishing operation prior to the sand filters the seawater stream is fed with a coagulant dosage to aid removal of colloidal and suspended particles to measure the performance of the conventional pretreatment system sdi readings were noted down along with the total suspended solids oil and grease content and particle size distribution the chemical analyses data of the pretreated water indicated that the system partially removed particles in the sub micron range occasional spikes in turbidity of feed water resulted in the values of sdi between 3 and 6 indicating the inconsistency of the sand filters and cartridge filters to produce pretreated water of below 3 sdi values the presence of suspended solids in the 2 5 μm range indicates the misconception of cartridge filtration as a polishing operation the conventional system also poses a threat in terms of possible foulants in the pretreated waters due to the reaction between the coagulant chemicals and the organics present in the sea water which enter the ro system uf pretreatment system 1 in this system modules having maximum 0 75 m3 h capacity were tested with both seawater and filtrate of sand filters as feed water the membrane operations included normal filtration maintenance backwashing and cleaning are fully automated and controlled by a plc the hollow fibre uf membrane had a nominal pore size of 0 01 μm and a membrane surface area of 16 m2 the filtration was carried out by outside to inside mode and a direct flow filtration for the filtration operation when filtrate of sand filters are used as feed the results of chemical analyses indicate moderate removal of suspended solids 80 but nominal removal of organics colloidal silica and total coliform rejections due to low initial concentrations sdi values of 0 9 2 7 were maintained during the operation for the filtration using seawater as feed the results of the chemical analyses indicate a suspended solids rejection of 50 good rejection of colloidal silica but little rejection of oil and grease the membrane needs to act as a barrier to suspended and colloidal solids since the nominal pore size is smaller than the size of these solids but a 50 rejection indicates a possible damage or cantamination of the membrane the sdi of the system using seawater as feed was always above 3 which affected the ro plant performance the plugging of membrane and formation of cake layer on the membrane surface is taken care by air scouring coupled with filtrate backwashing to increase the effectiveness of the backwash cycle sodium hypochlorite is used occasionally uf pretreatment system 2 a uf module having maximum production capacity of 1 2 m3 h with a hollow fibre configuration with a membrane surface area of 15 m2 the membrane is manufactured from polyethersulfone having a nominal pore size of 0 01 μm and is operated in cross flow process mode of filtration with seawater without prior pretreatment as feed the sdi values with the sea water feed were found to vary 0 7 to 3 and only a small percentage of removal was observed for organics 16 and no rejection in case of oil and grease with the seawater feed without pretreatment for the uf system high recovery low flux 80 57 6 l m2h principle should be adopted because a high recovery high flux principle 80 80 l m2h would result in extensive plugging and fouling of membrane leading to an increased transmembrane pressure trend mf pretreatment system the mf pretreatment system having a production capacity of 5 2 m3 h consisting of four hollow fibre modules of polyvinylidene fluoride with a nominal pore size of 0 1 μm operating in direct flow outside to inside mode of filtration to prevent buildup of transmembrane pressure air scouring and chemical cleaning involving sodium hypochlorite and citric acid is employed based on the results of the chemical analyses it was found that a moderate removal of colloidal silica and suspended solids was possible through mf pretreatment 40 rejection of organics and no rejection of reactive silica was achieved the turbidity of seawater varied from 1 5 to 3 0 ntu and the sdi of pretreated water fluctuated from 2 3 performance comparison of the different systems according to the pilot studies conducted with both conventional and membrane pretreatment systems the ease of operation of membrane systems are realized from the overall operation and maintenance results of the pretreatment plant it is observed that uf system 1 with filtrate from sand filters needs extra space requirement and also exerts pressure on maintenance costs the uf system 1 is found to be inferior in operation when compared with uf system 2 and mf system the uf system 1 operates at a flux lower than that of uf system 2 and mf system and produces filtrate with sdi lesser than uf system 2 and equal to that from mf due to higher system maintenance and chemical consumption the uf system 1 incurs the highest cost of the three systems between uf system 2 and mf system both exhibit equal competitiveness in maintaining the operating flux and the quality of the filtrate produced in both the cases the sdi values are well within the range specified for the feed water for ro system hence further studies need to be performed on both the units by installing a ro pilot unit downstream to either of these systems 5 3 case of industrial pretreatment systems in jeddah saudi arabia abdul hadi hasan al sheikh of saline water conversion corporation studied the operation of pretreatment systems at the jeddah desalination plant saudi arabia the seawater reverse osmosis systems have been added to the already existing multi stage flash units at the jeddah plant 74 the pretreatment systems are studied by considering the quality of the pretreated water that needs to be fed to the ro systems the raw seawater is taken from 9 m below the red sea surface the raw seawater is fed with sodium hypochlorite as a disinfectant and fecl3 as the coagulant before pumping it to the dual media filter the dual media filter is composed of anthracite and sand sulphuric acid is injected to the filtered stream to control the ph and prevent scale formation the treated filtered water passes through the micro cartridge filter to remove particles larger than 10 μms to prevent device blockage the stream is injected with sodium meta bi sulphite downstream of cartridge filters to eliminate residual chlorine the filtered stream is then pumped to the ro modules with the use of high pressure pumps during plant operation it was found that the ro systems faced problems in the pretreatment systems oxidation caused by the chlorine reaction degraded the membrane uncontrolled sdi limit during seasonal variation of raw seawater sdi the ro membranes used were composed of cellulose tri acetate cta material which according to the manufacturer was supposed to be chlorine tolerant material after 18 months of operation the reduction in membrane performance was indicated by the abnormal rise of permeate conductivity indicating increase of salt passage through the membranes the tests carried out proved that the oxidation by chlorine was the reason behind the membrane degradation it was suggested to have a dechlorination step just before the high pressure pump to prevent the system from oxidation tests were conducted to formulate an intermittent chlorine injection ici and continuous chlorine injection cci for the stream in the ici mode sodium meta bisulphite was injected for seven hours in every eight hours cycle and the chlorinated water was allowed for one hour to disinfect after the high pressure pumps by carrying out studies and obtaining the values of the conductivity of permeate μs cm and the bacterial colony count colony forming units ml it was proved that the ici mode prevented the membrane degradation and bio fouling the raw seawater sdi is subjected to seasonal variation and reaches to a high value of around 6 with the above said pretreatment system it was possible to maintain the sdi values of the pretreated feed within 4 most of the time as imposed by the ro membranes manufacturer but the sdi variation of the seawater feed made it impossible for just the filtration system to bring down the sdi levels and this problem on several occasions led to partial or complete plant shutdown limited success was found by dosing the stream with sulphuric acid to reduce the ph prior to the dual media filtration step and also the ferric chloride dosing rate was increased to improve coagulation effect a proper solution was found in the form of a coagulant aid tests were carried out with a cationic an anionic and a non ionic polyelectrolyte in the small scale setup of a dual media filter unit based on the results obtained it was proved that dosing cationic poly electrolyte at a rate of 0 1 ppm with 0 3 ppm of ferric chloride helps to improve the feed sdi values 5 4 case of pretreatment plant operation and maintenance at addur desalination plant kingdom of bahrain ali redah hussain et al studied the operation of the addur desalination plant at kingdom of bahrain the plant encountered a number of hurdles and reached its lowest production capacities 75 the experts of the field were drawn to the problems faced by the plant such as the drastic production loss heavy chemical cleaning programs fouling of ro membranes and the replacement of the ro membranes within a short period of commissioning various trials and experiments were conducted to identify the problems faced and to devise ways to rectify them the trials were conducted on a pilot plant scale and the successful results encouraged implementing the steps at plant scale level the rehabilitation program was planned with major changes in the infrastructure of the pretreatment systems utilize uf systems for pretreatment and use of cellulose acetate membranes for ro membranes the addur desalination plant is based on ro process technology and is designed to produce 10 migd of product water the seawater is transported from the intake point located at the gulf of addur to the plant through a 1 2 km long pipeline and it undergoes pretreatment steps like chlorination ph adjustment coagulation multimedia filtration microfiltration and dechlorination the pretreated water is pressurized and enters the ro section which contains permasep dupont membranes arranged as ro trains 448 per train the product water enters the second pass from first pass for further improvement and is partially decarbonated and post treated with lime and chlorine and stored in storage tanks the deficiencies found in the process plant were indicated by fast flux decline noticeable decline in product water flow rapid increase in differential pressure across membrane and increased salt passage the factors that contributed to the poor performance of the plant were the inadequacy in the design of the process plant location of the plant insufficient pretreatment processes location of the ro unit and inefficient membrane cleaning systems improper structural design inadequate operational experience description for poor performance of process plant the seawater intake was from gulf of addur which at certain times had shown a value of 47 000 ppm of tds values whereas the plant was designed for a feed water of tds value of 45 000 ppm it was noticed that the water surrounding the gulf of addur had a high organic content and bioactive with moderately high temperatures creating ideal environment for microorganisms to grow and nourish during certain times of the year the theoretical time requirement for floc formation was found to be 10 20 minutes whereas in the pretreatment step the total time taken for the whole coagulation process is 2 3 min as the time given for the floc formation is very short it resulted in increased suspended solids in the feed water to the ro unit and in turn increasing the silt density index of the ro feed water the placement of ro unit at a distance of about 30 m away after the dechlorination step has resulted in growth and deposition of organics in the filters as well as in the piping system downstream them many of the equipment designed in the plant failed to satisfy the specific requirements of the process plant the design posed several problems like some of the equipment were overrated some were of lower capacity some required modification or replacement or re assembly the failure to gain experience to operate a plant of such huge capacity and non inclusion of ro unit in the pilot studies proved to be an expensive mistake from the operational standpoint actions taken for rehabilitation of plant changes in the pretreatment process for a seawater feed with varied sdi values from season to season a comprehensive case to case pretreatment process is suggested which included extensive chlorination and backwashing of dual media filters moving the antiscalant dosing point just prior to the high pressure pump before the ro module sterilization of pipelines by using a strong oxidizing agent and variation of chemical dosage ph adjustment chemicals chlorination and dechlorination chemicals coagulant and coagulant aid chemical cleaning of membranes the number of chemical cleaning cycles were increased form 1 in the first year to 21 times in the second year and in the subsequent year the cleaning cycles were 46 times the permeate flusing of ro membranes was done to better the pressure difference across the ro membranes membrane performance and replacement depending on the fouling problems encountered in the membranes most of the ro membranes were replaced after the implementation of the prescribed changes the plant was expected to run at a capacity of 5 million gallons per day of improved water quality 6 future work the pretreatment process requires a lot of modification in order to enhance the productivity of the ro plant there is a need for design of new technology in which the steps of pretreatment can be carried out in parallel paths and the whole pretreatment process can be optimized with respect to time some of the areas which require further research are 1 the chlorination step can be replaced by uv irradiation process for effective disinfection the uv process can be combined with effective oxidation process in the presence of a photo catalyst many uv active nanoparticles are reported in literature which can oxidize the organic foulants in presence of uv light and further studies regarding the same are expected in process optimization 2 flocculation and coagulation processes can be combined with oxidation process by purging oxygen gas the purging process creates the foam of the inorganic salts which can be easily removed by skimming operation the oxygen also helps to precipitate many salts and hence can create a lot of difference in the efficiency of the pretreatment process 3 a detailed research is required in the discovery of novel anti foulants buffer solutions acids and bases are generally used as anti foulants but have a limited use in case of membrane process due to their potential harm to the membrane surface studies need to be conducted for the commercial use of the numerous nanoparticles reported in literature which could be used as anti foulants 7 conclusion the success of any membrane desalination process to a major extent depends upon the pretreatment processes involved the acceptable values of silt density index particulate foulants organic matter and biological matter present in the seawater feed to the ro system reduces the load and aids in efficient performance of the desalination plant conventional pretreatment system membrane pretreatment system and the combination of both the types in integrated systems provide the most suitable feed to the ro membranes the conventional system includes physical and chemical methods and the membrane system uses physical separation methods followed by either an ultrafiltration or a microfiltration process for the pretreatment in the integrated system the combination of physical chemical methods and membranes are used to achieve the stringent and consistent sdi values required for the seawater feed based on the various lab scale and pilot plant studies conducted world over it is found that based on the seasonal variation of the raw seawater feed and the required conditions for the ro feed a combination of conventional and membrane pretreatment which could work with the energy provided by renewable sources can provide a cost effective solution for the demand for fresh water by seawater desalination processes acknowledgements the authors sincerely acknowledge the department of science and

14239,an efficient pretreatment system forms the backbone of a sea water desalination unit using reverse osmosis process the pretreatment of sea water is done to bring down the turbidity microorganisms colloidal contaminants total dissolved solids and silt density index of the raw sea water to acceptable levels and make it suitable for the reverse osmosis membrane process the two kinds of pretreatment processes used are the conventional system and the membrane systems the present review paper makes an effort to understand the conventional process microfiltration ultrafiltration nanofiltration and integrated membrane systems for the seawater pretreatment their advantages and limitations and the effect of the pretreated water on the performance of reverse

ultrafiltration keywords conventional pretreatment desalination integrated pretreatment systems membrane pretreatment novel pretreatment processes 1 introduction desalination during the past 50 years has sprung from being one of the prospective technologies to the most sought after processes to satisfy the need for fresh water supplies the technology to separate salts from sea water and utilize the desalinated water for potable industrial and agricultural use has created more avenues in research and development for its cost effective and efficient operation fig 1 indicates the amount of research work being carried out in the field and the number of publications in scopus indexed journals on desalination the process of desalination is carried out either by the thermal process or by the membrane process 3 8 the various techniques used in thermal process are multi effect distillation med multi stage flash msf and in membrane process are the reverse osmosis ro electrodialysis ed in case of thermal process the plant economics is equally divided into capital costs which involve design and fabrication of huge distillation columns and into the operating costs which is consumed by heating the sea water to its boiling point and the water free of salts evaporates and the condensed water is remineralized and used in membrane process the capital costs involve investment on multiple membrane modules and the operating costs are spent on pressurizing the sea water and passing through a semi permeable membrane the membrane retains the salts and allows water to pass through which is then re mineralized and used 2 researchers over the years have found that the treatment of sea water by membrane processes is the cost effective technique in comparison with other processes 1 59 the most important of the membrane processes is the reverse osmosis in this the sea water is pressurized to a value greater than its osmotic pressure and passed through a semi permeable membrane only the water molecules pass through the membrane leaving behind the salts of sea water the advantages of using membrane process for desalination of sea water can be summarized as follows 64 82 the driving force required for the operation is the pressure which eliminates the need for heat required for phase change the case for thermal processes or the use of solvents or adsorbents the case for extraction or adsorption processes relatively simple to design and operate and can be run on continuous mode membrane processes can be combined with other separation processes to give an integrated system in literature depending upon the membrane pore size the filtration of contaminants can be given by the schematics of fig 2 in the ro process the important part is the membrane performance the pores of the membrane usually get blocked by a number of foulants present in the sea water 1 based on a detailed study the foulants can be categorized as scalants particulate foulants organic foulants and biological foulants 3 73 1 the ro membranes are fouled when the inorganic salts of calcium magnesium strontium precipitate on their surface the commonly found scaling species in seawater are caco3 mg oh 2 caso4 srso4 baso4 caf4 and sio2 2 the suspended and colloidal particles present in the seawater such as clay algae and bacteria accumulate on the membrane surface resulting in particulate fouling 3 the organic matter like humic and fulvic acids with total organic carbon concentrations above 3 mg l and oil and grease content that amounts to more than 0 1 0 5 ppm and the soluble organic matter adsorb on the membrane surface and foul them 4 the intensification of microbes and their byproducts on the membrane surface and presence of bacterial counts greater than 106 cfu ml create a slimy layer on the membrane and consequently result in bio fouling of the ro membranes the fouling of membranes result in decreased membrane productivity which increases the back washing frequency decreases membrane life and meanwhile increases the capital cost of replacing the membrane module 6 hence pretreatment step forms an indispensible step to consider before subjecting sea water to ro treatment 3 4 the pretreatment is done either by conventional methods or by the membrane based techniques the conventional method usually consists of ph adjustment coagulation flocculation sedimentation single multimedia granular filtration and cartridge filtration steps 4 5 in membrane based techniques the sea water may follow the same order of conventional treatment and use a membrane module instead of a multimedia filter 41 48 table 1 gives an insight into the sea water quality parameter and their limits for the feed water into ro system 4 when the quality of the pretreated water meets the acceptable levels of the feed required for the ro membrane process the desalination process becomes efficient cost effective and an environment friendly system 78 a well planned and executed pretreatment system contributes to decreased frequency of cleaning of ro membranes thereby reducing the cost incurred due to cleaning chemicals decreasing the pressure drop due to fouling of membranes thereby reducing the total energy costs increased ro membrane life resulting from the consistent improved pretreated water quality increased productivity in the ro membranes due to high quality pretreated water decreased environmental impact resulting from the reduced use and further disposal of chemicals required for membrane cleaning 3 86 in the present paper efforts are made to study the various pretreatment processes adopted in lab scale pilot plant scale as well as on industrial scale to understand the conditions for effective operation of the seawater reverse osmosis pretreatment systems 2 pretreatment methods 2 1 conventional pretreatment method the source of sea water for the desalination process is either from open intake or beach well intake the source water composition varies due to various factors like industrial discharge water depth and temperature ocean currents and algae content 80 the various foulants in the sea water are chemical foulants which are responsible for membrane scaling particulate matter which are responsible for particle deposition on membrane surface biological matter which are responsible for bio fouling of the membranes and dissolved organic matter which interact with the membrane 49 the conventional pretreatment process is categorized into two ways as physical and chemical pretreatment the physical process does the basic mechanical screening of particulate matter through the screens and filters and the chemical process involves the addition of scale inhibitors coagulants and disinfectants 5 fig 3 shows the conventional pretreatment process the key contaminants to be filtered in the pretreatment step are the particulate suspended matter microbial contaminants and dissolved organic matter 2 7 2 1 1 disinfection screening and ph adjustment disinfection by chlorination is a necessary step to prevent biological growth which is responsible for the fouling of filters and membranes and in turn reduces the treatment performance addition of chlorine to sea water is done in the form of sodium hypochlorite or chlorine gas 13 after reacting with the sea water the residual free chlorine required to mitigate bio fouling is present in the form of sodium hypochlorite chlorine gas hypochlorous acid and hypochlorite ions 74 it is necessary to have a dechlorination process because the presence of residual chlorine in the stream results in oxidation and hydrolysis reactions at the ro membrane surface 31 one of the prospective alternatives to chlorination is by uv radiation which is yet to be explored on a wide scale the screening process consists of a simple mesh kept at an inclination to the stream of sea water the plants and debris in the sea water are stopped at the grids which are removed by a mechanical rake attached with the screens 23 the ph of sea water is always on the alkaline side due to the presence of salts which cause extensive scaling of the membranes involved in the treatment process 34 the performance of ro membranes is better at lower ph values and also lesser reactions on the membrane surface the ph of the sea water is maintained by the addition of sulfuric acid 2 1 2 coagulation and flocculation the primary purpose of coagulation and flocculation process is the removal of turbidity 26 turbidity is the cloudy appearance of water due to the small particles suspended therein the sea water obtained from open intake usually has a turbidity of above 30 ntu nephelometric turbidity unit and contains particles and microorganisms which are slightly negatively charged a coagulant is added to the water to neutralize the negatively charged particles the amount of coagulant dosage is decided by conducting a jar test on the sample of sea water the coagulant is added to the sea water and mixed for a known amount of time in a mixing chamber for even distribution 72 the coagulant neutralizes the charged particles and allows them to come closer together and form large clumps the water then passes through the flocculation basin where the clumps come closer to form large flocs which eventually settle during the sedimentation process most commonly used coagulants are the ferric salts like ferric sulfate and ferric chloride 32 aluminum salts are rarely used as even a trace amount of aluminum in the treated water may cause fouling of membranes in the ro systems depending on the solubility of the coagulants in sea water sulphuric acid is added to maintain the ph at 5 5 6 to optimize floc formation 66 the coagulation and flocculation process removes colloidal impurities suspended particles and some bacteria from sea water 36 2 1 3 sedimentation sedimentation is a treatment process in which the water enters a sedimentation basin and passes through the vessel with a reduced velocity to cause the suspended particles to settle due to gravity the sedimentation process is usually placed after the flocculation chamber so that the flocs formed during the process are settled at the bottom of the sedimentation basin following an optimum detention time in case of high turbidity sea waters the conventional sedimentation basins are coupled with lamella plates to produce water with desired turbidity levels 38 the lamella plate settlers consists of slanted plates over which the flocs settle and drift down to the lower portion of the sedimentation basin and clarified water passes upward through the plates and flows out of the basin 2 1 4 flotation flotation process is used to remove particulate impurities algal cells oil and grease which cannot be removed by sedimentation and thereby cause a threat to the downstream processes the most efficient technology is the dissolved air flotation daf 7 where fine air bubbles are made to pass from the bottom of the vessel 40 the air bubbles carry along with them the light particles and organic substances to the water surface which is then skimmed off the floating matter at the surface in the tank is skimmed off for disposal and the low turbidity water is collected from the bottom of the tank 2 1 5 filtration filtration is the process of removal of suspended particles in water when it passes through a filter medium when the water passes through the filter medium the flocs and impurities in water are held by the medium and the clear water passes through the filter 32 the filtration step is the final step and is usually preceded by coagulation flocculation and sedimentation processes for efficient removal of suspended solids certain chemicals called polymer aids are added prior to the filtration step to strengthen the floc and aid in filtering the flocs thereby improving the effluent water quality polymer aids are used in rare situations since due to their slippery nature any spillages have to be immediately cleaned to avoid mishaps and their extended usage may pose pore blockage problem in the filters 40 the types of filters used depending upon the driving force for filtration are gravity filters and pressure filters 4 the huge construction costs involved in the fabrication of large pressure filters limits their usage to small and medium size capacity plants gravity filters are used for both large and medium size capacity filtration plants depending upon the filter medium filters are classified as single dual and multimedia filters the single medium filters are sand filters dual media filters use sand and anthracite and in case of multimedia sand anthracite and garnet are used as filter media the media in case of multimedia filters are arranged in such a way that the water passes through the media with progressively small pores the media in the multimedia filters are chosen in such a way as to having varying density and varying pore size to aid in proper rearrangement of the media after filter backwash conventional filtration units used in pretreatment of sea water are single stage dual media filters using sand and anthracite 43 a two stage filtration units are used when the sea water contains high levels of organic matter algal content and suspended matter in two stage units the first stage is designed to remove coarser solids and organics and the second stage retain fine solids silt and soluble organics are removed by bio filtration 2 1 6 antiscalant addition the precipitation of salts and minerals of sea water on the membrane surface caused by super saturation is scaling the effect of scaling on membranes is reduced performance and decreased water recovery 40 the sulfuric acid added to adjust the ph of sea water controls the scaling by calcium carbonate in the earlier treatment processes sodium hexa meta phosphate was commonly used but has been rejected because of its disposal problems as well as its eutrophicating properties 81 in the recent times on a wide scale certain polymeric compounds are used as anti scaling agents 2 1 7 dechlorination the residual chlorine present in the feed water to ro system has the potential to cause damage to the membrane by oxidation and hence the process of de chlorination is a necessary step before the ro process 82 the damage to the membrane by the amount of chlorine in water depends on various factors like membrane material ph of sea water and also its temperature the deterioration of membrane is faster at alkaline ph values than in neutral or acidic sea waters and also at higher temperatures the most common agent used for de chlorination process is sodium bi sulfite alternatively activated carbon is also used to reduce the residual chlorine levels 2 2 plants using conventional pretreatment systems 2 2 1 case of an ro desalination plant of saudi aramco nicos p isaias of consulting services department from saudi arabia studied the conventional pretreatment systems and recorded observations with respect to the working of dual media anthracite sand filter in the process 23 in one of the reverse osmosis desalination plants of saudi aramco a conventional pretreatment system was employed consisting of screening chlorination coagulation rapid mixing flocculation gentle mixing dual media filtration anti scalant addition cartridge filtration dechlorination using sodium bi sulphite the system also incorporates sdi measurement and oxidation reduction potential sensors to ensure complete dechlorination in a conventional pretreatment process the deep bed dual media filters are considered as the heart of the pretreatment before the ro membrane process 51 52 the proper and efficient working of these filtration units becomes utmost important for reducing the sdi values of the filtrate to the levels acceptable as the ro feed water the working of the dual media filter is considered and according to the four challenges faced by the filtration operation the possible solution is suggested in table 2 discussions in plants utilizing the conventional pretreatment emphasis should be laid on proper selection of the medium in the multimedia filtration the design of multimedia in the filter bed needs to be designed by taking into account the nature and compatibility of the materials to be used in the medium the density of the material played a very crucial role in backwashing of the filter bed and also in calculating the height of each layer another factor that mattered was the uniform particle size distribution of sand in the medium the obtained sand with uneven particle size resulted in loss of fine sand during backwash cycles the particle shape and size in the multimedia filter bed needs to be configured in such a way as to prevent the percolation of finer sized particles through the inter particle distance in the above layer the filter backwash velocity should also be calculated by taking into consideration the nature of material in the filter medium the height of the filter medium and the minimum fluidization velocity of the entire filter bed sufficient backwash velocity and the frequency ensure proper functioning of the filter runs 2 2 2 case of a demonstration plant at carboneras spain noelia quevedo et al conducted a performance study on the ro pretreatment on an open intake desalination plant in carboneras spain 6 the objective was to study and test various combination of conventional treatment processes and understands the reliability and limitations of each process based on the sdi values obtained after every process in the pretreatment system the objectives were laid down to i get minimum sdi value of 5 ii get stable sdi value of 4 and iii get sdi value lower than 3 with a reliability of 90 in a confidence interval of 95 the raw seawater was collected form an open intake point located at a distance 150 m offshore and at a depth of about 15 m below the sea level the plant consisted of pumping seawater to the pretreatment line from the inlet chamber acid or alkali addition to maintain the ph of seawater an actiflo system consisting of coagulation polymer and microsand injection maturation and settling of microsand ballasted flocs a multimedia filter operating under atmospheric pressure two multimedia filters operating under applied pressure arranged in series and a reverse osmosis system other intermediate tanks and pumps are also installed in the plant to try various combinations of pretreatment the various reagents used in the pretreatment are hydrochloric acid is used for ph adjustment ferric chloride 40 fecl3 and a commercial coagulant hydrex 3240 17 5 al2o3 are used as coagulants commercial organic coagulant polidadmac pd340 and pd420 and commercial flocculants hydrex6111 and hydrex3551 are used and to produce the ballasted flocs in the actiflo process microsand of effective size of 80 μm and uniformity coefficient of 1 5 was used the whole pretreatment process was monitored and controlled by a scada system consisting of on line equipment like flow meters and ph meters and pressure and level sensors the performance was evaluated based on the main statistical parameters of the selected data distributions such as mean standard deviation number of samples the adjusted anderson darling statistic and the pearson correlation coefficient for the various combinations the various combinations tested and the result based on the sdi effluent values achieved is presented in the table 3 discussions the above results indicate that the combinations 2 and 4 work best to achieve the objectives of the study since the required objectives based on sdi values required for the feed to the ro system is achieved in the above conventional treatment combinations the study is a proof that membrane pretreatment is not always justified over conventional pretreatment and quite a few times ro systems work better with conventional pretreatment systems 2 3 merits and demerits of conventional pretreatment the most important advantage of the conventional treatment process is that it is practiced since a long time and hence is proven and is a familiar technology to employ 25 the process does not require a strainer since all the particulate matter is removed before the stream reaches the membranes the system eliminates organic matter along with the suspended material from the stream 74 the disadvantages of the conventional treatment process are that it is sensitive to changes in source water characteristics and hence requires different dosages of treatment chemicals 38 it requires large space for the various process steps involved and also large amount of process chemicals the resultant stream from the pretreatment process has high turbidity and sdi values when compared with the acceptable levels for the ro process 62 63 87 the research in the field of conventional pretreatment in the recent times has focused on making the process more competent with other available options by considering the following reforms 16 alterations in seawater intake points introducing daf in the conventional pretreatment system dynamic filter backwashing cleaning processes and modified chemical dosages to the system alternative technologies to reduce consumption of chemicals with solutions at hand for the above mentioned problems conventional and integrated systems should be equally accepted for pretreatment processes 3 membrane pretreatment systems 3 1 microfiltration microfiltration and ultrafiltration processes are the most widely used pretreatment systems for desalination using sea water reverse osmosis technology 14 18 in the microfiltration process the filters ranging from pore size 10 μm to 0 1 μm facilitate removal of colloidal particles suspended matter and to some extent bacterial matter 24 47 from the past 15 years extensive research has been carried out to establish microfiltration process as the pretreatment in place of conventional pretreatment methods 29 30 studies indicate the increase of water flux through membranes and lowering of sdi15 sdi15 is the measure of fouling capacity of water in ro systems the test measures the rate at which 0 45 micro m filter is plugged when subjected to a constant water pressure of 206 8 kpa 30 psi the sdi15 gives the percentage drop per minute in the flow rate of water through the filter averaged over a period of time such as 15 min sd i 15 1 t 1 t 2 100 t 15 where t1 filtration time for volume 1 ml t2 filtration time for volume 2 ml t15 time for testing min the sdi15 of the pretreated water is required to be less than 3 when it is to be used in ro systems 37 the efficiency of microfiltration process is based on the measurement of water flux through the membrane turbidity and the sdi15 values 67 69 microfiltration units are designed based on the driving filtration force as pressure filters and vacuum driven filters mf pressure units consist of membrane elements arranged in a rack and placed in pressure vessels 50 vacuum driven units consist of membranes modules submerged in an open tank of source water pressure filters operate in the pressure range of 1 0 2 5 bars and the vacuum driven filters operate in the range of 0 1 0 8 bars 4 3 1 1 case of laboratory pilot scale of submerged mf membranes various studies have been conducted on using microfiltration process for efficient pretreatment one such study conducted by masse et al shows the use of submerged microfiltration membrane unit for the removal of undesirable micro algae 57 the toxic micro algae found worldwide in the coasts of many countries behave like harmful algal blooms which pose serious a threat to the downstream ro membranes the configuration consists of a submerged mf unit with the pore size of 0 2 μm used for the total retention of micro algae the parameters measured for the evaluation of the membrane involve the mfi turbidity micro algae retention suspended solid matter and toc by knowing the permeate flux trans membrane pressure permeate dynamic viscosity membrane resistance fouling resistance membrane surface area specific resistance of deposited cake above parameters are calculated and found that the 0 2 micro m membrane provides 99 99 87 and 66 retention rate for micro algae turbidity suspended solid matter and total organic carbon respectively discussions the study gives an insight into the retention of algae by a 0 2 μm membrane and considerable rejection in terms of turbidity suspended solids and total organic carbon but it leaves the fouling studies incomplete as can be seen from the fouling studies of all three membranes the irreversible fouling due to the presence of dissolved solids and the salts present in the seawater preferentially decreases the membrane life the authors suggest that the microfiltration membranes are the better performing ones due to their flux and algae retention but from the filtration studies it is evident that the resistance due to fouling of membranes is maximum in case of microfiltration membranes further work on membrane cleaning and evaluating the fouling tendencies will give better prospects for the membranes to be used for the toxic algae retention with appreciable membrane life cycle another experimental study conducted by kim et al analyses the effect of coagulation on the source water prior to micro filtration process 46 the research is based on the parameters like increased water flux through mf membranes increased turbidity removal and a reduction in sdi levels the membranes are hollow fiber type made of polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf material with pore size of 0 1 micro m the source water considered in the research is synthetically prepared sea water to which ferric chloride is added as the coagulant the effect of coagulation is studied by varying the amount of coagulant addition and also the ph of the synthetic sea water from the results it was concluded that there was a sharp decline in the flux but the permeate quantity was superior when compared with the process carried out without coagulation pore blocking was found to be the phenomenon responsible for membrane fouling and hence the decline in flux the sdi values required for the swro membranes was less than 3 but the sdi values after mf pretreatment was found to be slightly greater at 3 17 the turbidity was also reduced from a value of 10 ntu of source water to 0 055 ntu after mf process discussions the examination of the membranes using sem and test conducted on flux turbidity and sdi all indicate that the membrane performance in terms of permeate quantity and quality were enhanced by the use of coagulation process with an optimum coagulant dosage at optimum ph value of the source water the research deals with testing the commercial membranes by using synthetically prepared seawater the feed water to the module is made up of various reagents and chemicals to cause turbidity the study does not take into account the interference of biological matter which claims equal priority as the suspended and dissolved salts in the feed water in a conventional or a hybrid pretreatment system the coagulation step is followed with a sedimentation step for the removal of heavier flocs and a filtration step to get rid of the flocs which have a tendency for pore blockage in membranes in the current study no such filtration step is involved before the feed enters the membrane module to avoid pore blocking in membranes the solution to pore blockage has not been addressed 3 2 ultra filtration in the recent years of experimental research uf pretreatment process is considered the most promising technology for treating the source water for swro the pore size in case of uf membranes range from 0 01 0 1 μm and aid in the removal of suspended or colloidal matter silt bacterial matter and also viruses from source water 27 28 uf process is the most widely used method for the sea water pretreatment system 19 21 the pore size of uf membranes is smaller than that of mf membranes thus facilitating effective removal of particulates colloidal solids bacterial matter and virus 10 42 44 45 the pore size of uf membranes being larger than that of nf membranes allow higher water flux than nf membranes and hence prove to be most suitable pretreatment method for swro process 11 12 15 a typical membrane pretreatment unit consists of coarse or fine screens to remove larger objects and plants a micro screen to remove fine particles followed by an uf system 54 56 the uf membranes do not remove dissolved organic matter and marine microbes which are the main cause for bio fouling of downstream ro membranes their fouling effect can be reduced considerably by designing the system as membrane bio reactors 70 71 in general membrane pretreatment processes are classified based on the driving force for filtration as pressure filters and vacuum driven filters voutchkov sheds light on the importance of operating pressures in uf systems 4 the operating pressures in uf systems is higher than the threshold pressure at which the algal cells break and release easily bio degradable organic matter into the filtered sea water during algal bloom it is required that the algae are removed prior to membrane treatment by either dissolved air flotation or granular media filtration to mitigate the bio fouling effect on the membranes above theory is confirmed by conducting tests at the desalination plant at carlsbad during heavy algal bloom conditions the sea water was subjected to daf followed by granular media filtration and then passed through the vacuum driven uf pretreatment system tests conducted on the uf pretreatment filtrate preceded by granular media filtration show to have considerably decreased bio fouling effect on the swro membranes 65 3 2 1 case of lab scale submerged ultrafiltration plant operating with seawater from tyrrhenian coast southern italy hawlader et al 14 conducted experimental studies to compare mf and uf pretreatment for sea water prior to ro membranes the membranes for the uf systems were of hollow fiber type made of poly ether sulfone having a nominal pore size of 0 01 μm operated in cross flow mode of filtration the chemical analyses conducted on the filtrate produced from the uf pretreatment indicated a significant percentage removal of colloidal silica and coliform group of bacteria and a small percentage removal of toc the sdi test conducted on the filtrate indicated that the sdi values varied between 0 7 3 which are within the range prescribed for the source water to be used for ro membranes when the uf system was operated using sea water directly a decrease in filtrate flux and a gradual increasing trend in the transmembrane pressure during the test was observed the uf system was maintained by periodic backwashing at every 30 90 min interval along with disinfection using sodium hypochlorite to prevent bio fouling of the uf membranes the studies concluded that uf pretreatment system produced better quality and quantity of filtrate when compared with mf systems it also emphasized the ease of using membrane pretreatment systems which would considerably reduce the fouling propensity of the ro membranes discussions the authors have results that show a 50 removal of suspended solids though the membranes have an average pore size much lesser than that of the suspended and colloidal matter in the feed water and the justification for the same is not furnished the chemical analysis of permeate indicated that the removal of organic material and bacteria from the feed stream do not show a decisive results and the reason for the passage through the membranes remains unknown it would have been beneficial to have a multimedia filtration unit before the uf to avoid the buildup of solids on the membrane surface which increases the transmembrane pressure and also the frequency and duration of the filter backwashing process 3 2 2 case of industrial scale pilot plant at barcelona spain in another study a r guastalli et al compared the performance of dual media filters dmf and uf pretreatment in the removal of particulates and dissolved organic matter 43 initially a dissolved air flotation system daf equipped with coagulation and flocculation chamber is employed for the removal of particulates algae and heavy hydrocarbons this stream forms the feed stream for both the dmf and uf systems to compare their performance on the removal efficiencies the dmf system consists of a layer of sand and anthracite the uf membranes are made of poly vinylidene difluoride with a pore size of 0 02 μm operating in pressurized outside in mode the filtrate analyses of both the dmf and the uf systems show an appreciable decrease in turbidity sdi15 values and algae removal the turbidity of the filtrate were found to be 0 1 and 0 06 ntu for dmf and uf systems respectively and total suspended solids was undetectable for both streams sdi15 values were found to be 2 and 1 respectively for dmf and uf systems the comparison between the performances of the two membranes was done by carrying out biological analyses of the filtrate stream the uf system exhibited 100 algal content removal whereas the dmf system showed just 60 removal the uf pretreatment presented a better removal percentage for the bacterial concentration than the dmf systems among the dissolved organic contaminants both the systems were observed to be better in the removal of bio polymers the dmf system shows a lower removal percentage of around 18 and the uf systems present bio polymer removal of around 41 the studies concluded that both the dmf and uf systems proved to be equally competitive for the pretreatment of sea water when preceded by a daf process the dmf system proved to be on par with uf process to produce a filtrate with the sdi15 values turbidity and total suspended solids within the prescribed limit the uf system proved to be better in 100 removal of algal content and bio polymers to a considerable range both the systems were found to be inefficient in removal of natural organic matter the uf system was adjudged as the better pretreatment system due to its capability of removal of bio polymers to a greater extent since they are responsible largely for the bio fouling of downstream ro membranes discussions the study proves through analyses of various results that the uf system comparatively works with higher efficiency than the dmf system the study does not consider the raw seawater quality with respect to the presence of the concentration of algal matter it is known that the duration between the months of march and july creates a rise in temperature of seawater and consequently results in a high and stable algal concentration during the months from august to february it is observed that there is a low algal activity the research does not highlight an alternative change in the conventional pretreatment or in the daf system to address this issue the removal of natural organic matter needs to be addressed with an improved methodology before dmf and uf to effect removal 3 3 nano filtration nanofiltration nf is a comparatively recent membrane filtration process used most commonly with waters having a low concentration of total dissolved solids 35 the pore size in case of nf membranes range from 1 to 10 nm and they lie between ultrafiltration and reverse osmosis membranes these membranes remove most organic molecules viruses natural organic matter and a range of salts 53 58 nanofiltration removes the divalent ions and hence commonly used for water softening applications 60 61 nf membranes are found to retain 60 70 of monovalent ions when used as a pretreatment for seawater which reduces the tds content of the seawater thereby decreasing the osmotic pressure 76 this reduction in osmotic pressure ensures increased recovery and efficient operation of ro system for desalination of seawater 9 53 3 3 1 case of nf swro demonstration unit at saudi arabia hassan et al from the saline water conversion corporation conducted studies on using nf membrane for pretreatment before the ro membranes for desalination of gulf seawater 77 the study was conducted on a pilot plant of capacity 20 m3 day the system comprises of nano filtration unit for pretreatment of seawater and a reverse osmosis unit for desalination purpose the pilot plant includes a seawater intake system dual media filter a fine sand filter a 5 μm cartridge filter a feed tank the nf pretreatment unit and the swro unit the nf pretreatment unit consists of a high pressure pump five nf modules each containing two commercial nf membrane elements of size 4 x40 the nf modules are connected in series and parallel combination the swro unit includes a high pressure pump and six swro modules each containing a commercial spiral wound element of size 2 5 x40 connected in series the pretreatment unit was operated without coagulation and without the addition of acid occasionally acid is added to maintain ph at 7 the nf unit was maintained at 18 bar operating pressure and the swro unit was operated at 56 bar pressure the results of the studies are presented in table 4 from the studies conducted it is concluded that the nf pretreatment reduces the turbidity bacteria scale forming hardness and the tds content of the gulf seawater feed to impressible levels the nf pretreatment process not only eliminates the use of chemicals but also increases the permeate flux reduces the energy consumed during the swro process thereby decreasing the total water cost and hence proves that the operation of seawater desalination plants when combined with nf pretreatment is superior in performance when compared with other pretreatment processes 79 discussions the studies were conducted on a pilot plant and by the encouraging results obtained the same combination of nf pretreatment for swro was conducted in a demonstration unit and the results were reiterated this system was to be applied to a nf swro plant at umm lujj saudi arabia the bacteriological analyses of the nf permeate stream revealed a very small count of bacteria present the pore size of the nf membranes being much finer than the bacteria size the possibility of bacteria appearing in the permeate in itself is bleak the issue is of serious concern since the bacteria will be a threat to swro membranes in terms of bio fouling 4 novel processes for pretreatment some of the pretreatment processes carried out on a pilot plant basis concentrate on providing the same effect as the already established pretreatment processes and also cause less harm to the environment by utilizing nature friendly approaches 4 1 case of an electrochemical reactor the research work conducted by s yi et al and a few other researchers focuses on a one step electrochemical method for pretreatment of seawater 22 84 85 the electrochemical process for removal of pollutants involves either the electro oxidation with insoluble anodes or by electro coagulation using consumable materials in the electro oxidation method the pollutant is destroyed in the bulk solution by virtue of the action of strong oxidants which are released in the electrochemical reactions in the electro coagulation method a coagulant is generated on site by dissolution of a metal from the anode and also hydroxyl ions and hydrogen gas is generated at the cathode the gas generated makes the flocculated particles to float on the water surface in the studies conducted so far concentration is on optimization of removal of a specific pollutant by altering the experimental conditions such as the ph conductivity current density and electrode materials and applicability of the electrochemical methods for seawater pretreatment 4 2 case of mineral carbonation the research work by junsheng yuan et al uses the mineral carbonation method as a single solution for two problems first as a method for carbon dioxide sequestration and seawater decalcification 33 the brine pretreatment waste of soda ash plant is a suspension of magnesium hydroxide and calcium carbonate which if left untreated becomes a potentially harmful contaminant to the environment this source of magnesium hydroxide is used as the alkali source and seawater decalcification is carried out using carbon dioxide gas in this method the decalcification is done for seawater which removes the calcium salts present in seawater thereby reducing the scaling potential of sea water and hence the desalination performance is increased the use of magnesium hydroxide and also carbon sequestration proves to be an added advantage since the harm to the environment is controlled 4 3 case of an integrated system consisting of granular activated carbon and ultrafiltration system the research work by dr stephanie laborie et al focused on the removal of bacteria dissolved organic carbon doc and transparent exopolymer particles tep present in natural seawater which are difficult to handle in a conventional pretreatment system 83 a combination of granular activated carbon gac adsorption and ultrafiltration in the pretreatment step was proposed and tried before the ro process in a community scale desalination plant with a capacity to produce 5 m3 day of desalinated water the studies conducted on the plant for a 2 month duration showed that the gac bed could reduce the doc level by 20 80 concentration and the ultrafiltration membrane could retain most of the tep and bacteria present ahead of the ro module the stable operating parameters indicated that there was no biofouling and as a result of this no extensive use of chemicals was required for the pretreatment and the ro recovery rate also increased thereby decreasing the energy consumption required for the ro unit operation the decreased energy requirement has made to opt for alternate renewable energy sources such as installation of photovoltaic power in order to be energy sufficient the installation and studies on the same is being carried out at present 4 4 case of a pilot plant using photovoltaic system using solar energy the research work by jamal khan et al tries to integrate desalination technology with renewable energy sources for in land brackish water 34 a pilot plant study was conducted in the pretreatment process with a combination of forward osmosis fo ultrafiltration uf and cartridge filtration cf prior to ro membranes studies were made on the fo ro uf ro and cf ro systems to analyze the salt rejection capabilities of the three configurations with synthetic brackish water of known tds values the uf and the fo processes were successful in bringing down the salt concentration in the synthetic brackish water resulting in lesser frequencies of ro membrane cleaning procedures the energy to the plant was provided by a 2 kw h photovoltaic system pv installed in the plant area 5 case studies 5 1 case of an economic evaluation of a membrane pretreatment system for a sea water ro plant at texas a pilot plant study was carried out to compare between the membrane and the conventional pretreatment processes by lisa henthrone of aqua resources international denver colorado the study was supported by the u s department of interior bureau of reclamation water treatment engineering and research group denver colorado the study comprised of evaluation of various membrane pretreatment and conventional pretreatment processes 3 the sea water was collected from corpus christi bay in the gulf of mexico the pilot plant study was carried out utilizing four ultrafiltration membranes from various manufacturers and conventional pretreatment consisting of coagulation and multimedia filtration sand anthracite and garnet in the first phase optimization of both the membrane and conventional pretreatment processes were done and in the second phase the pretreated water was fed to two separate ro trains and the performance was studied the objectives of the work included a quality comparison between conventional and membrane processes based on values of total suspended solids turbidity silt density indices total organic carbon and heterotrophic plate counts and conduct a comparison of the effectiveness of the pretreatment methods evaluate impact of conventional and membrane pretreatment on the overall operation of ro by measuring the cleaning and maintenance requirements pressure drops permeate water quality evaluate biofouling in the ro system evaluate cost comparison between conventional and membrane pretreatment by assessing the overall life cycle economics the raw feed water had turbidity spikes of over 100 ntu and an average turbidity of 9 9 ntu over a 15 month period it was evaluated that the membrane pretreatment produced high quality pretreated water by maintaining filtrate turbidities less than 0 1 ntu the sdi values were maintained consistently below 3 of the filtrate from the membrane pretreatment systems the conventional system resulted in turbidity values of an average of 1 9 ntu and produced a range of sdi values of 3 to 6 and occasionally above 6 microbiological removal evaluation was conducted for membrane pretreatment process and it was found that though the pore size of the membranes used were of the order of 0 01 0 1 μm in size the marine bacteria were extremely small in their size and hence the membrane filtration system could not act as an effective disinfection barrier for marine bacteria the economic analysis of the pretreatment systems based on total water cost indicates that the membrane pretreatment system is 3 4 less expensive than the conventional pretreatment system the total water cost for the facility using membrane systems is 0 55 m3 and for facility using conventional system is 0 59 m3 based on the capital cost consideration membrane systems prove to be 2 more expensive than conventional systems based on operation costs the ro system cleaning becomes one of the important things to be considered the membrane systems require two cleanings per year whereas the conventional systems require nine cleanings per year and this contributes significantly to the operating costs of the plant 3 5 2 case of various pretreatment methods in a pilot plant study at singapore hawlader et al studied the pretreatment processes by conducting pilot trials in the coastal areas in sinagapore the comparison study was made between a conventional system two ultrafiltration systems and a microfiltration system 14 the conventional pretreatment system comprised of coarse screens before the seawater supply pumps gravity driven single medium sand filter and a three stage 10 5 1 μm polishing cartridge system the coarse screens were effective in removal of large pieces of rocks and barnacles the sand filters removed the smaller particles and colloids and to prevent any leakage of suspended particles from the sand filters a micron cartridge filter was provided as a final stage polishing operation prior to the sand filters the seawater stream is fed with a coagulant dosage to aid removal of colloidal and suspended particles to measure the performance of the conventional pretreatment system sdi readings were noted down along with the total suspended solids oil and grease content and particle size distribution the chemical analyses data of the pretreated water indicated that the system partially removed particles in the sub micron range occasional spikes in turbidity of feed water resulted in the values of sdi between 3 and 6 indicating the inconsistency of the sand filters and cartridge filters to produce pretreated water of below 3 sdi values the presence of suspended solids in the 2 5 μm range indicates the misconception of cartridge filtration as a polishing operation the conventional system also poses a threat in terms of possible foulants in the pretreated waters due to the reaction between the coagulant chemicals and the organics present in the sea water which enter the ro system uf pretreatment system 1 in this system modules having maximum 0 75 m3 h capacity were tested with both seawater and filtrate of sand filters as feed water the membrane operations included normal filtration maintenance backwashing and cleaning are fully automated and controlled by a plc the hollow fibre uf membrane had a nominal pore size of 0 01 μm and a membrane surface area of 16 m2 the filtration was carried out by outside to inside mode and a direct flow filtration for the filtration operation when filtrate of sand filters are used as feed the results of chemical analyses indicate moderate removal of suspended solids 80 but nominal removal of organics colloidal silica and total coliform rejections due to low initial concentrations sdi values of 0 9 2 7 were maintained during the operation for the filtration using seawater as feed the results of the chemical analyses indicate a suspended solids rejection of 50 good rejection of colloidal silica but little rejection of oil and grease the membrane needs to act as a barrier to suspended and colloidal solids since the nominal pore size is smaller than the size of these solids but a 50 rejection indicates a possible damage or cantamination of the membrane the sdi of the system using seawater as feed was always above 3 which affected the ro plant performance the plugging of membrane and formation of cake layer on the membrane surface is taken care by air scouring coupled with filtrate backwashing to increase the effectiveness of the backwash cycle sodium hypochlorite is used occasionally uf pretreatment system 2 a uf module having maximum production capacity of 1 2 m3 h with a hollow fibre configuration with a membrane surface area of 15 m2 the membrane is manufactured from polyethersulfone having a nominal pore size of 0 01 μm and is operated in cross flow process mode of filtration with seawater without prior pretreatment as feed the sdi values with the sea water feed were found to vary 0 7 to 3 and only a small percentage of removal was observed for organics 16 and no rejection in case of oil and grease with the seawater feed without pretreatment for the uf system high recovery low flux 80 57 6 l m2h principle should be adopted because a high recovery high flux principle 80 80 l m2h would result in extensive plugging and fouling of membrane leading to an increased transmembrane pressure trend mf pretreatment system the mf pretreatment system having a production capacity of 5 2 m3 h consisting of four hollow fibre modules of polyvinylidene fluoride with a nominal pore size of 0 1 μm operating in direct flow outside to inside mode of filtration to prevent buildup of transmembrane pressure air scouring and chemical cleaning involving sodium hypochlorite and citric acid is employed based on the results of the chemical analyses it was found that a moderate removal of colloidal silica and suspended solids was possible through mf pretreatment 40 rejection of organics and no rejection of reactive silica was achieved the turbidity of seawater varied from 1 5 to 3 0 ntu and the sdi of pretreated water fluctuated from 2 3 performance comparison of the different systems according to the pilot studies conducted with both conventional and membrane pretreatment systems the ease of operation of membrane systems are realized from the overall operation and maintenance results of the pretreatment plant it is observed that uf system 1 with filtrate from sand filters needs extra space requirement and also exerts pressure on maintenance costs the uf system 1 is found to be inferior in operation when compared with uf system 2 and mf system the uf system 1 operates at a flux lower than that of uf system 2 and mf system and produces filtrate with sdi lesser than uf system 2 and equal to that from mf due to higher system maintenance and chemical consumption the uf system 1 incurs the highest cost of the three systems between uf system 2 and mf system both exhibit equal competitiveness in maintaining the operating flux and the quality of the filtrate produced in both the cases the sdi values are well within the range specified for the feed water for ro system hence further studies need to be performed on both the units by installing a ro pilot unit downstream to either of these systems 5 3 case of industrial pretreatment systems in jeddah saudi arabia abdul hadi hasan al sheikh of saline water conversion corporation studied the operation of pretreatment systems at the jeddah desalination plant saudi arabia the seawater reverse osmosis systems have been added to the already existing multi stage flash units at the jeddah plant 74 the pretreatment systems are studied by considering the quality of the pretreated water that needs to be fed to the ro systems the raw seawater is taken from 9 m below the red sea surface the raw seawater is fed with sodium hypochlorite as a disinfectant and fecl3 as the coagulant before pumping it to the dual media filter the dual media filter is composed of anthracite and sand sulphuric acid is injected to the filtered stream to control the ph and prevent scale formation the treated filtered water passes through the micro cartridge filter to remove particles larger than 10 μms to prevent device blockage the stream is injected with sodium meta bi sulphite downstream of cartridge filters to eliminate residual chlorine the filtered stream is then pumped to the ro modules with the use of high pressure pumps during plant operation it was found that the ro systems faced problems in the pretreatment systems oxidation caused by the chlorine reaction degraded the membrane uncontrolled sdi limit during seasonal variation of raw seawater sdi the ro membranes used were composed of cellulose tri acetate cta material which according to the manufacturer was supposed to be chlorine tolerant material after 18 months of operation the reduction in membrane performance was indicated by the abnormal rise of permeate conductivity indicating increase of salt passage through the membranes the tests carried out proved that the oxidation by chlorine was the reason behind the membrane degradation it was suggested to have a dechlorination step just before the high pressure pump to prevent the system from oxidation tests were conducted to formulate an intermittent chlorine injection ici and continuous chlorine injection cci for the stream in the ici mode sodium meta bisulphite was injected for seven hours in every eight hours cycle and the chlorinated water was allowed for one hour to disinfect after the high pressure pumps by carrying out studies and obtaining the values of the conductivity of permeate μs cm and the bacterial colony count colony forming units ml it was proved that the ici mode prevented the membrane degradation and bio fouling the raw seawater sdi is subjected to seasonal variation and reaches to a high value of around 6 with the above said pretreatment system it was possible to maintain the sdi values of the pretreated feed within 4 most of the time as imposed by the ro membranes manufacturer but the sdi variation of the seawater feed made it impossible for just the filtration system to bring down the sdi levels and this problem on several occasions led to partial or complete plant shutdown limited success was found by dosing the stream with sulphuric acid to reduce the ph prior to the dual media filtration step and also the ferric chloride dosing rate was increased to improve coagulation effect a proper solution was found in the form of a coagulant aid tests were carried out with a cationic an anionic and a non ionic polyelectrolyte in the small scale setup of a dual media filter unit based on the results obtained it was proved that dosing cationic poly electrolyte at a rate of 0 1 ppm with 0 3 ppm of ferric chloride helps to improve the feed sdi values 5 4 case of pretreatment plant operation and maintenance at addur desalination plant kingdom of bahrain ali redah hussain et al studied the operation of the addur desalination plant at kingdom of bahrain the plant encountered a number of hurdles and reached its lowest production capacities 75 the experts of the field were drawn to the problems faced by the plant such as the drastic production loss heavy chemical cleaning programs fouling of ro membranes and the replacement of the ro membranes within a short period of commissioning various trials and experiments were conducted to identify the problems faced and to devise ways to rectify them the trials were conducted on a pilot plant scale and the successful results encouraged implementing the steps at plant scale level the rehabilitation program was planned with major changes in the infrastructure of the pretreatment systems utilize uf systems for pretreatment and use of cellulose acetate membranes for ro membranes the addur desalination plant is based on ro process technology and is designed to produce 10 migd of product water the seawater is transported from the intake point located at the gulf of addur to the plant through a 1 2 km long pipeline and it undergoes pretreatment steps like chlorination ph adjustment coagulation multimedia filtration microfiltration and dechlorination the pretreated water is pressurized and enters the ro section which contains permasep dupont membranes arranged as ro trains 448 per train the product water enters the second pass from first pass for further improvement and is partially decarbonated and post treated with lime and chlorine and stored in storage tanks the deficiencies found in the process plant were indicated by fast flux decline noticeable decline in product water flow rapid increase in differential pressure across membrane and increased salt passage the factors that contributed to the poor performance of the plant were the inadequacy in the design of the process plant location of the plant insufficient pretreatment processes location of the ro unit and inefficient membrane cleaning systems improper structural design inadequate operational experience description for poor performance of process plant the seawater intake was from gulf of addur which at certain times had shown a value of 47 000 ppm of tds values whereas the plant was designed for a feed water of tds value of 45 000 ppm it was noticed that the water surrounding the gulf of addur had a high organic content and bioactive with moderately high temperatures creating ideal environment for microorganisms to grow and nourish during certain times of the year the theoretical time requirement for floc formation was found to be 10 20 minutes whereas in the pretreatment step the total time taken for the whole coagulation process is 2 3 min as the time given for the floc formation is very short it resulted in increased suspended solids in the feed water to the ro unit and in turn increasing the silt density index of the ro feed water the placement of ro unit at a distance of about 30 m away after the dechlorination step has resulted in growth and deposition of organics in the filters as well as in the piping system downstream them many of the equipment designed in the plant failed to satisfy the specific requirements of the process plant the design posed several problems like some of the equipment were overrated some were of lower capacity some required modification or replacement or re assembly the failure to gain experience to operate a plant of such huge capacity and non inclusion of ro unit in the pilot studies proved to be an expensive mistake from the operational standpoint actions taken for rehabilitation of plant changes in the pretreatment process for a seawater feed with varied sdi values from season to season a comprehensive case to case pretreatment process is suggested which included extensive chlorination and backwashing of dual media filters moving the antiscalant dosing point just prior to the high pressure pump before the ro module sterilization of pipelines by using a strong oxidizing agent and variation of chemical dosage ph adjustment chemicals chlorination and dechlorination chemicals coagulant and coagulant aid chemical cleaning of membranes the number of chemical cleaning cycles were increased form 1 in the first year to 21 times in the second year and in the subsequent year the cleaning cycles were 46 times the permeate flusing of ro membranes was done to better the pressure difference across the ro membranes membrane performance and replacement depending on the fouling problems encountered in the membranes most of the ro membranes were replaced after the implementation of the prescribed changes the plant was expected to run at a capacity of 5 million gallons per day of improved water quality 6 future work the pretreatment process requires a lot of modification in order to enhance the productivity of the ro plant there is a need for design of new technology in which the steps of pretreatment can be carried out in parallel paths and the whole pretreatment process can be optimized with respect to time some of the areas which require further research are 1 the chlorination step can be replaced by uv irradiation process for effective disinfection the uv process can be combined with effective oxidation process in the presence of a photo catalyst many uv active nanoparticles are reported in literature which can oxidize the organic foulants in presence of uv light and further studies regarding the same are expected in process optimization 2 flocculation and coagulation processes can be combined with oxidation process by purging oxygen gas the purging process creates the foam of the inorganic salts which can be easily removed by skimming operation the oxygen also helps to precipitate many salts and hence can create a lot of difference in the efficiency of the pretreatment process 3 a detailed research is required in the discovery of novel anti foulants buffer solutions acids and bases are generally used as anti foulants but have a limited use in case of membrane process due to their potential harm to the membrane surface studies need to be conducted for the commercial use of the numerous nanoparticles reported in literature which could be used as anti foulants 7 conclusion the success of any membrane desalination process to a major extent depends upon the pretreatment processes involved the acceptable values of silt density index particulate foulants organic matter and biological matter present in the seawater feed to the ro system reduces the load and aids in efficient performance of the desalination plant conventional pretreatment system membrane pretreatment system and the combination of both the types in integrated systems provide the most suitable feed to the ro membranes the conventional system includes physical and chemical methods and the membrane system uses physical separation methods followed by either an ultrafiltration or a microfiltration process for the pretreatment in the integrated system the combination of physical chemical methods and membranes are used to achieve the stringent and consistent sdi values required for the seawater feed based on the various lab scale and pilot plant studies conducted world over it is found that based on the seasonal variation of the raw seawater feed and the required conditions for the ro feed a combination of conventional and membrane pretreatment which could work with the energy provided by renewable sources can provide a cost effective solution for the demand for fresh water by seawater desalination processes acknowledgements the authors sincerely acknowledge the department of science and
