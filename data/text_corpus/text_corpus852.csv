basin china to explore the effect of om on as and iron fe mobilization and transformation in the unsaturated and saturated zones during irrigation soil water groundwater and sediments sampled at

demonstrate as mobilization under irrigation conditions and contribute to a better understanding of the role of om under high as groundwater irrigation this study has implications for controlling and managing om or as contaminated water for irrigation in high as groundwater regions keywords arsenic irrigation organic matter ternary complexation 1 introduction arsenic as contamination of groundwater and sediments is considered an important environmental issue worldwide more than 100 million people face health problems such as skin and internal cancers respiratory ailments and cardiovascular diseases due to exposure to high as as 10 μg l who 2011 in as contaminated areas fendorf et al 2010 wang et al 2019 anthropogenic activities such as irrigation livestock farming and other activities utilizing high as groundwater lead to as accumulation in topsoil and enhances its bioavailability the studies on as soil plant systems indicate irrigation with as contaminated water leads to significant as accumulation in grains and topsoil kumarathilaka et al 2018a kumarathilaka et al 2018b saifullah et al 2018 with subsequent effects on human health furthermore hydrological and biogeochemical reactions can result in as release from topsoil into deeper areas and affect as mobilization in groundwater xie et al 2015 recent studies indicate that iron fe is dominant for as im mobilization in groundwater and sediments with as mobilization controlled by microbially mediated reductive dissolution of as bearing fe minerals bose and sharma 2002 harvey et al 2002 xie et al 2009 moreover dissolved organic matter dom plays an important role in the transformation of as and fe bearing minerals on the one hand under relatively reducing conditions dom serves as the electron donor to catalyze the reductive dissolution of as bearing iron minerals and the reduction of as v guo et al 2019 guo et al 2011 jia et al 2018 further humic substances can form as dom binary or as metal organic matter om ternary complexes that affect as mobilization bauer and blodau 2009 buschmann et al 2006 fakour et al 2016 ritter et al 2006 the studies on the geogenic high as groundwater system of the datong basin have been conducted to determine the mechanism of as transport in groundwater and suggest the remediation of as contaminated groundwater pi et al 2020 wang et al 2019 a recent work has highlighted the importance of anthropogenic activities on as mobilization in the subsurface xie et al 2015 research focusing on the effect of natural dom on as mobilization suggests that the reductive dissolution of fe iii oxides hydroxides coupled with microbial oxidation of natural dom may serve as the primary geochemical process controlling as mobilization in groundwater systems pi et al 2015 the further study characterized fluorescence features and hydrochemical properties of om in sediments and groundwater has indicated that as fe om ternary complexation in sediments and microbial reduction have a potentially strong impact on as enrichment in groundwater liu et al 2020 our previous studies focus on the mechanism of as im mobilization in the groundwater saturated zone in situ or under some specific scenarios a recent study has emphasized the fate of as and fe in the unsaturated zone during irrigation and pointed out that irrigation induced water table fluctuations influence the redox conditions of the subsurface thus affecting the im mobilization of as in the unsaturated zone xiao et al 2018 however irrigation activities using high as groundwater also lead to the input of om yet how om controls as mobilization in the unsaturated and saturated zone has not been studied under irrigation conditions thus studies exploring the om components and characterizing the biogeochemical processes controlling as mobilization and transformation during irrigation and consequent water table fluctuations in the unsaturated and saturated zone are urgently needed in the present study a field plot experiment was conducted to investigate the mechanism of as mobilization under high as groundwater irrigation at the dy study site in the datong basin hydrogeochemical sedimentary and fluorescence analyses were combined to identify water extractable organic matter weom features and the biogeochemical processes that control as mobilization during irrigation 2 materials and methods 2 1 field trial and sampling the field experiment was carried out on barren land located within an area in the datong basin affected by high as and known as the dy site fig 1 the experimental site was 7 7 m2 in size and surrounded by a 40 cm soil ridge to prevent irrigation water from seeping out the field experiment was conducted in three stages pre irrigation before august 13 irrigation from august 13 to 20 and post irrigation from august 21 to 28 2017 during the experimental period the weather was sunny or cloudy with light rain showers august 22 to 23 and august 26 to 28 five multi level monitoring wells with seven ports each at depths of 0 2 to 3 0 m were made from porous ceramic tubes and pvc pipes and installed at the field site to collect soil water groundwater

ascorbate extractant and as bound to om the as content bound to om in the sediments was characterized using naclo liu et al 2020 samples for toc analysis were mixed with 1 m hcl to remove inorganic carbon then cleaned several times using ultrapure water until the ph of the suspension rose to 7 and finally air dried before analysis toc content was measured using a vario toc analyzer elementar

modeling three dimensional excitation and emission ex em fluorescence spectroscopy was conducted using a hitachi f 4500 fluorescence spectrophotometer japan and quartz cuvettes excitation emission matrices eems were created by scanning at excitation wavelengths varying from 200 to 500 nm with 5 cm intervals and emission wavelengths varying from 300 to 600 nm with 2 nm intervals with the scanning speed at 12 000 nm min 1 and the silt width 10 nm milli q water was used as blank to correct for raman scattering effects huguet et al 2009 fluorescence indices were used to investigate the source and humification degree of om including the fluorescence index fi and biological index bix the fi value used to characterize the dom source is the ratio of fluorescence intensities at emission wavelengths of 450 and 500 nm and an excitation wavelength of 370 nm mcarthur et al 2001 fi values of 1 3 and 1 7 are assigned as the boundaries of terrestrial and microbial sources respectively cory and mcknight 2005 mcarthur et al 2001 the bix value used to estimate autochthonous biological activity is the ratio of the fluorescence intensities at emission wavelengths of 380 and 430 nm and an excitation wavelength of 310 nm huguet et al 2009 a parallel factor analysis parafac model was established for the sample datasets a total of 56 eems from the weom of the sediment samples using the domflour toolbox stedmon and bro 2008 eems were normalized to the raman peak area of a wavelength corrected raman scan murphy et al 2010 a three component model was verified by split half analysis and

component outputs from domflour were represented by the fmax in raman units r u and relative abundance the relative abundance of each component was calculated as the percentage of fluorescence intensity divided by the sum of the fluorescence intensities of all derived components 3 results 3 1 water table fluctuations and general water chemistry before the field experiment the phreatic water level of well 3 was 1 51 m below ground level august 12 during irrigation the measured phreatic levels were 0 99 m august 14 1 09 m august 16 0 95 m august 18 and 0 99 m august 20 below ground level after irrigation the monitored phreatic levels were 1 01 m august 22 0 96 m august 27 and 0 94 m august 31 below ground level overall the water table level fluctuated from 0 56 to 1 51 m during the experiment period a total of 26 groundwater samples 2 preirri 4 irri1 3 irri2 4 irri3 4 irri4 3 postirri1 3 postirri2 3 postirri3 were collected from well 3 according to the monitoring water table all water samples collected were measured for major ions as isotope components and doc the irrigation groundwater from the pumping well drawn from a depth of 24 m was of na hco3 type with a ph 7 95 eh 171 8 mv and doc concentration 7 3 mg c l the total as concentration was 384 μg l far exceeding the who 2011 recommended drinking water standard of 10 μg l as iii was the main as species in this groundwater accounting for 79 of the total as cl so4 2 and na were the dominant ions of soil water groundwater samples from the monitoring wells fig s1a for the soil water samples the percent composition of ca2 and mg2 increased during irrigation but decreased in the post irrigation period while that of hco3 changed little during irrigation but increased in the post irrigation period for the groundwater samples the percent composition of ca2 and mg2 gradually decreased during the experiment and that of hco3 changed minimally significant evaporation exacerbates the salinization of subsurface soils resulting in the accumulation of high concentrations of salts in topsoil soil water and shallow groundwater the irrigation process led to the gradual dissolution of soil evaporites and as the irrigation water infiltrated the salts gradually infiltrated downward and accumulated at depths from 2 to 3 m fig s1b the ph of water samples ranged from 7 33 to 8 79 with a mean value of 8 04 indicating a neutral weakly alkaline environment persistent throughout the irrigation experiment eh values of the soil water groundwater samples ranged from 63 2 to 217 mv throughout the field experiment with a notable decrease during irrigation but a gradual increase in the post irrigation period arsenic concentrations in the monitoring soil water groundwater samples varied from 0 75 to 228 μg l with all water samples with high as concentrations collected from a depth of 3 0 m table 1 the mean value of as iii total as ast in the soil water groundwater gradually increased during irrigation and started to decrease at the end of irrigation related to the change of redox environment due to the irrigation process the δ18o values of soil water groundwater samples ranged from 11 8 to 9 1 with acute increases in cl concentration indicating fast vertical recharge promotes salt dissolution and content mobilization xiao et al 2018 doc concentrations ranged from 10 9 to 45 0 mg c l with a mean value of 23 22 mg c l 3 2 sediment analysis chemical extractions and toc analyses were conducted to understand the potential effects of irrigation on as fe minerals and om the total as content in sediment samples ranged from 5 81 to 7 72 mg kg pre irrigation and 5 36 to 7 86 mg kg post irrigation while the fe content ranged from 20 85 to 26 88 g kg pre irrigation and 20 70 to 27 13 g kg post irrigation the toc in sediment samples ranged from 0 04 to 2 82 mg kg pre irrigation and 0 19 to 3 13 mg kg post irrigation the as content from 0 to 1 20 m below ground level and toc from 0 to 0 25 m below ground level increased after irrigation the fe content from 0 to 1 20 m below ground level and toc from 0 30 to 1 40 m below ground level showed minor variation after irrigation however as and fe content from 1 25 to 1 40 m decreased after irrigation fig 2 a c the as content associated with better crystalline iron oxides significantly increased after irrigation fig 2d while the fe content varied within a smaller range fig 2e the as content bound to om demonstrated the same trend as the total as content fig 2f 3 3 fluorescence characteristics of weom the changes in fluorescence spectra are related to om sources and microbial activity in groundwater and sediment fluorescence features are shown in fig 3 the main type of weom was deciphered as humic acid om based on peaks located at ex em 400 500 300 350 nm chen et al 2003 the fmax suggests that the irrigation infiltration resulted in om accumulation in the topsoil and increased the om content in sediment at different depths to various degrees after irrigation the fi and bix values for weom are shown in table s3 the terrestrial sources of om were attributed to the release of sedimentary om while microbial sources of om were derived from microbial degradation products liu et al 2020 fi values ranged from 1 14 to 1 59 suggesting that the weom of the sediments has terrestrial sources or a mixture of terrestrial and microbial sources bix values ranged from 0 44 to 0 72 indicating an autochthonous component in the sediments three components c1 c2 and c3 from the parafac model were identified from eem fluorescence spectra for the weom samples of the sediments fig 4 a b c1 exhibits an ex em maximum at 330 424 nm and is considered to be a terrestrial humic like component with low molecular weight li et al 2019 stedmon and markager 2005 c2 shows an ex em maximum at 370 484 nm and is considered to be a terrestrial humic like component with high molecular weight fellman et al 2010 yang et al 2020 the humic like c1 is probably less structurally condensed and more labile than c2 the higher molecular weight component has higher aromaticity and more complicated structure identified by longer wavelengths due to the relation to conjugated fluorescent molecules structural condensation and polymerization of organic compounds murphy et al 2010 c3 presents an ex em maximum at 250 338 nm and is considered to be a protein like component tryptophan like component fellman et al 2010 williams et al 2010 the relative abundance of c1 and c3 changed throughout the irrigation process in contrast c2 had a small range of variation due to its larger molecular size and relatively more refractory characteristics fig 3c the relative abundance of c3 is negatively correlated with c1 fig s2b e indicating the tryptophan like component may not be a degradation product of c1 chen et al 2010 before irrigation the relative abundance of c3 was negatively associated with c2 but these components had nearly no correlation after irrigation fig s2c f interestingly the relative abundance of c1 was positively correlated with c2 before irrigation fig s2a but negatively correlated with c2 after irrigation fig s2d this indicates the irrigation process introduces om from the aquifer to the intrinsic om resulting in the re distribution of om in the soil 4 discussion 4 1 effect of irrigation on hydrochemical factors fluctuations in the water table result in changes in redox conditions ph and ec during irrigation the overall changes of the values of as iii astotal table s2 increased from preirri to inirri and decreased from inirri to postirri which matched the overall changes with eh decreased from preirri to inirri and increased from inirri to postirri and as v is easily immobilized under relatively oxidizing conditions during the formation of fe iii oxides while as iii has greater mobility the infiltration of irrigation water provides an input of co2 and changes the ph the values of which are positively correlated with aqueous as concentrations fig s3a with increasing ph the adsorption capacity of positively charged minerals and clay minerals for as is reduced resulting in a rise in as concentrations in the pore water however ec values demonstrate the opposite trend to ph fig s3b ionic strength effects can impact particle aggregation by influencing electrostatic interactions at the higher ionic strengths reduced electrostatic repulsions can increase opportunities for particle contacts and subsequent aggregation with more effective solid liquid separation mercer and tobiason 2008 thus affecting the adsorption of as the saturation indices of various ions in the samples collected from the monitoring wells during the irrigation process calculated by phreeqc show that the soil water groundwater is supersaturated in fe iii minerals viz ferrihydrite fe oh 3 goethite feooh and hematite fe2o3 but unsaturated in fe ii minerals viz siderite feco3 and green rust fe3 oh 8 table s4 a large amount of new as is introduced into the soil with irrigation infiltration but the existing iron oxides and newly formed iron oxides are already at absorption saturation resulting in free aqueous as mobilization to greater depths irrigation increased the groundwater ph and ec and reduced the eh compared to pre irrigation values during irrigation the input source of organic carbon stimulated soil biogeochemical processes reduced the oxygen content and promoted reducing conditions resulting in the release of adsorbed as and rise in aqueous as concentrations as the irrigation water infiltrated the soil aqueous as that was not re immobilized migrated deeper down thus the concentrations of aqueous as from 0 to 2 m below the ground surface show little variation during irrigation the soil water groundwater ph and ec continued to increase from irrigation to post irrigation at which point the eh also increased due to air and oxygen again entering the system from the surface in the post irrigation period the irrigation water was strongly reductive but its influence gradually weakened due to the flooding irrigation approach the intermittent irrigation protocol meant this irrigation water was in contact with oxygen for much longer than would have been the case for continuous irrigation after irrigation ended water infiltration slowed the input irrigation water migrated downward to around 2 5 m and reached the shallow groundwater table after which its vertical movement is retarded fig s1b as a result the concentrations of as sampled from 3 m underground in the post irrigation period were much higher than those sampled pre irrigation table 1 in addition the om introduced by the irrigation water was involved in several hydrochemical processes such as degradation complexation and adsorption which in turn changed the redox conditions and likely promoted the transformation of as 4 2 changes in as fe minerals and om during irrigation sedimentary as is closely associated with fe oxides through adsorption and complexation at the start of irrigation the input of the relatively reducing irrigation water mixed with the soil water resulted in the precipitation of fe iii oxides and the adsorption and co precipitation of as fluctuations in redox conditions and complex geochemical processes during irrigation led to the release mobilization transport and re distribution of as total as and fe contents in the sediment show a weak positive correlation before irrigation that strengthens after irrigation fig s4a in contrast as and fe contents from the extraction of better crystalline fe oxides show a poor correlation after irrigation fig s4b however the poor correlations between as and fe contents in the unsaturated zone from 0 05 to 0 55 m sampled post irrigation were found fig s4c d the precipitation of amorphous fe iii minerals and the dissolution of fe iii oxides occurred with variations in redox conditions during irrigation resulting in the weak association between fe oxides and as thus the fast vertical infiltration leads to the transport of as from the topsoil to greater depths where aqueous as finally accumulates in the saturated zone irrigation activities also introduced om to the subsurface toc content is somewhat positively correlated with as and fe before irrigation with this correlation improving after irrigation fig 5 a c this indicates that om strongly affects as and fe complexation moreover om bound as and toc demonstrate the same trend as as and toc fig 5b these results suggest that sedimentary as fe and om are strongly related and support the association between as fe minerals and om as as fe om ternary complexes mikutta and kretzschmar 2011 4 3 as fe om complexation the ftir spectra of sediments from 0 05 and 1 4 m below ground sampled both pre and post irrigation also indicate the importance of as fe om complexation fig 6 adsorption peaks at 3446 and 3421 cm 1 are attributed to as o bonding xie et al 2016 compared to pre irrigation spectra the as o bond peaks shift from 3446 to 3421 cm 1 and the absorbance considerably increases which can be attributed to the formation of as om complexes and is consistent with the trend of as and toc being more strongly correlated after irrigation the adsorption peaks at 1630 cm 1 provide evidence of the presence of as fe om complexation sharma et al 2010 the intensities of peaks at 1630 cm 1 change at a depth of 1 4 m after irrigation suggesting the disassociation of as fe om peaks at 1435 cm 1 are attributed to c h bonds and the increased intensities indicate ch3 deformation and ch2 scissoring of om fritzsche et al 2015 implying different variations of organic functional groups under irrigation activities in addition the peak at 1032 cm 1 is attributed to the fe oh bond which is implicated in the formation of inner sphere surface complexes wang and mulligan 2008 wen et al 2014 after irrigation the height of the peak at 1032 cm 1 at a depth of 1 4 m significantly increased indicating as is replaced by hydroxyl groups on the surface of sediments and migrates with irrigation water infiltration some studies attribute the peaks at 1032 cm 1 to the presence of polysaccharides c o c and c o h stretching fritzsche et al 2015 wang et al 2013 but their presence is not presumed in this research the peaks at 467 and 777 cm 1 are attributed to the complexation of as and iron hydro oxides xie et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 and changes in their intensity may due to the species and content of as and iron hydro oxides the peak at 689 cm 1 is attributed to fe oh bonding wen et al 2014 zhang et al 2005 thus the data overall support the conclusion that the complexation of as fe om influences as transformation and mobilization during irrigation om affects the mobilization and enrichment of as in groundwater and as fe om complexation changes the activity of as in both groundwater and sediment mcarthur et al 2011 pi et al 2015 wang et al 2019 humic like om components could promote as fe om complexation mladenov et al 2015 before irrigation the relative abundances of the three components identified in the parafac analysis show nearly no correlations with either as or fe but this is not the case after irrigation when positive correlations are evident fig s5 significant positive correlations between c2 and as and c2 and fe are also found after irrigation fig s5b e this suggests a terrestrial humic like component with higher molecular weight dominates in as fe om complexation yang et al 2020 the relative abundance of c2 increases after irrigation in the unsaturated zone from 0 3 to 0 55 m but decreases in the saturated zone from 0 95 to 1 40 m the positive correlation between sedimentary as and toc but nearly no correlation between as and fe from the soil of the unsaturated zone are probably due to ternary complexes of as with other metal om complexes involving ca2 mn2 4 mg2 or al3 sharma et al 2010 bauer and blodau 2009 buschmann et al 2006 ritter et al 2006 labile dissolved om could act as an electron donor to enhance microbial respiration in a relatively reducing environment resulting in both the microbial oxidation of om and the reduction of fe iii oxides to fe ii oxides and as v to as iii leading to the increase in aqueous as fendorf et al 2010 vega et al 2017 the c3 component in this study identified as protein like substances is typically an environmentally labile compound reflecting the production of amino acids that are easily and rapidly utilized by microorganisms coble 2007 after irrigation the c3 component declined to 0 around the saturated zone obviously indicating microbial reactions in the relatively reducing environment because c3 may not be the degradation product of c1 the increase in c3 after irrigation suggests new om introduced with the irrigation water resulted in microbial degradation during irrigation although the irrigation process affected redox conditions in the subsurface labile om contributed to the redox reactions due to its involvement in microbial degradation where it acted as an electron donor thus the results from this study suggest om plays an important role during high as groundwater irrigation on the one hand terrestrial humic like substances with high molecular weight promote as mobilization by complexation reactions on the other hand biodegradation of labile om affects fe iii oxides and leads to the mobilization of as 4 4 mechanism of as mobilization induced by irrigation based on the above comprehensive analysis the irrigation process can be generalized as shown in fig 7 before irrigation as v is the dominant as species and as in sediments co exists with both fe minerals and om the unsaturated zone is characterized by oxidizing conditions and the phreatic water table is 1 51 m below ground level when irrigation activity begins as dom some fe ii and co2 in the irrigation water are transported to the subsurface the oxidation of fe ii happens suddenly with as in the irrigation water then being adsorbed by fe iii minerals with continued irrigation as iii gradually becomes the main as species in the relatively reducing conditions and demonstrates greater mobility as demonstrated through hydrochemical parameters that change with irrigation infiltration the input of labile om from the irrigation water could affect the redox conditions and mediate fe iii bearing minerals undergoing reductive dissolution and disassociation with as thus contributing increasing amounts of aqueous as that is transported to greater depths the dissolution and recrystallization of salts in the unsaturated zone caused by irrigation activities lead to the mobility of cations which further results in the disassociation of as fe om ternary complexes and the formation of as metal om complexes when irrigation ends the residual irrigation water on the land continues to infiltrate after prolonged contact with air due to the stronger oxidizing conditions as v concentrations increase and more as can be immobilized onto fe minerals as reflected in the increasing as content in sediments in the unsaturated zone the frequent oxic anoxic fluctuations introduced by the irrigation activity enhance the mobility of as and increase concentrations in the topsoil furthermore the saturated zone is characterized by relatively reducing conditions the intermittent irrigation contributes to the variation in the saturated zone on the one hand the input of dom that accompanies irrigation accelerates the dissolution of fe iii minerals and contributes to a sudden change in aqueous as concentrations in the saturated zone from irri2 to irri3 on the other hand the variations of dom components such as the reduction in the c2 component with fewer fe iii minerals together lead to the dissociation of as fe om as confirmed by the ftir results in general irrigation activities affect the sources of these components in the unsaturated and saturated zone and promotes as transformation and mobilization 5 conclusions irrigation activities have a significant effect on as mobilization and migration in the unsaturated and saturated zones irrigation infiltration affects the concentrations of major ions which accumulate around 2 5 m below ground level after irrigation the flood irrigation practice also affects redox conditions reducing oxidizing and the water table rising falling leading to the transformation of fe ii and fe iii minerals and resulting in variations in the content of as and fe minerals and ultimately in an increase of as content in the topsoil and aqueous as in the groundwater with the input of labile om from high as groundwater the toc content in the topsoil increases and fe iii bearing minerals undergo reductive dissolution and disassociate with as leading to an increase in aqueous as that infiltrates to greater depths moreover the disassociation of as fe om ternary complexes is attributed to as other metal om complexation these results are conducive and imperative for better understanding as mobilization and the role of om under high as

4260,organic matter om plays an important role in the biogeochemical transformation of arsenic as in groundwater and sediments high as groundwater used for irrigation introduces dissolved as into the

reductive dissolution of fe iii oxides hydroxides coupled with microbial oxidation of natural dom may serve as the primary geochemical process controlling as mobilization in groundwater systems pi et al 2015 the further study characterized fluorescence features and hydrochemical properties of om in sediments and groundwater has indicated that as fe om ternary complexation in sediments and microbial reduction have a potentially strong impact on as enrichment in groundwater liu et al 2020 our previous studies focus on the mechanism of as im mobilization in the groundwater saturated zone in situ or under some specific scenarios a recent study has emphasized the fate of as and fe in the unsaturated zone during irrigation and pointed out that irrigation induced water table fluctuations influence the redox conditions of the subsurface thus affecting the im mobilization of as in the unsaturated zone xiao et al 2018 however irrigation activities using high as groundwater also lead to the input of om yet how om controls as mobilization in the unsaturated and saturated zone has not been studied under irrigation conditions thus studies exploring the om components and characterizing the biogeochemical processes controlling as mobilization and transformation during irrigation and consequent water table fluctuations in the unsaturated and saturated zone are urgently needed in the present study a field plot experiment was conducted to investigate the mechanism of as mobilization under high as groundwater irrigation at the dy study site in the datong basin hydrogeochemical sedimentary and fluorescence analyses were combined to identify water extractable organic matter weom features and the biogeochemical processes that control as mobilization during irrigation 2 materials and methods 2 1 field trial and sampling the field experiment was carried out on barren land located within an area in the datong basin affected by high as and known as the dy site fig 1 the experimental site was 7 7 m2 in size and surrounded by a 40 cm soil ridge to prevent irrigation water from seeping out the field experiment was conducted in three stages pre irrigation before august 13 irrigation from august 13 to 20 and post irrigation from august 21 to 28 2017 during the experimental period the weather was sunny or cloudy with light rain showers august 22 to 23 and august 26 to 28 five multi level monitoring wells with seven ports each at depths of 0 2 to 3 0 m were made from porous ceramic tubes and pvc pipes and installed at the field site to collect soil water groundwater samples fig 1 sediment samples were excavated at intervals of 0 05 m from depths ranging from 0 05 to 1 4 m on august 12 pre irrigation and august 28 post irrigation soil water groundwater samples

august 27 postirri2 august 31 postirri3 a semi confined aquifer located about 20 to 24 m below the land surface was selected as the source aquifer for irrigation fig 1 the experimental plot was out of the radius of influence of the pumping well the irrigation was intermittent 16 times about 40 mins each total 14 5 h from august 13 to 20 at a rate of 1 30 l s to ensure that the whole irrigation

ascorbate extractant and as bound to om the as content bound to om in the sediments was characterized using naclo liu et al 2020 samples for toc analysis were mixed with 1 m hcl to remove inorganic carbon then cleaned several times using ultrapure water until the ph of the suspension rose to 7 and finally air dried before analysis toc content was measured using a vario toc analyzer elementar germany with a standard deviation of 5 samples for weom were measured using 2 g of sediment extracted using 20 ml of deionized water after shaking for 24 h at 130 rpm the suspension was centrifuged at

modeling three dimensional excitation and emission ex em fluorescence spectroscopy was conducted using a hitachi f 4500 fluorescence spectrophotometer japan and quartz cuvettes excitation emission matrices eems were created by scanning at excitation wavelengths varying from 200 to 500 nm with 5 cm intervals and emission wavelengths varying from 300 to 600 nm with 2 nm intervals with the scanning speed at 12 000 nm min 1 and the silt width 10 nm milli q water was used as blank to correct for raman scattering effects huguet et al 2009 fluorescence indices were used to investigate the source and humification degree of om including the fluorescence index fi and biological index bix the fi value used to characterize the dom source is the ratio of fluorescence intensities at emission wavelengths of 450 and 500 nm and an excitation wavelength of 370 nm mcarthur et al 2001 fi values of 1 3 and 1 7 are assigned as the boundaries of terrestrial and microbial sources respectively cory and mcknight 2005 mcarthur et al 2001 the bix value used to estimate autochthonous biological activity is the ratio of the fluorescence intensities at emission wavelengths of 380 and 430 nm and an excitation wavelength of 310 nm huguet et al 2009 a parallel factor analysis parafac model was established for the sample datasets a total of 56 eems from the weom of the sediment samples using the domflour toolbox stedmon and bro 2008 eems were normalized to the raman peak area of a wavelength corrected raman scan murphy et al 2010 a three component model was verified by split half analysis and residual analysis stedmon et al 2003 residual intensities derived by subtracting the parafac modeled eem from the measured eem were within 10 of measured eem intensities for all samples the parafac component outputs from domflour were represented by the fmax in raman units r u and relative abundance the relative abundance of each component was calculated as the percentage of fluorescence intensity divided by the sum of the fluorescence intensities of all derived components 3 results 3 1 water table fluctuations and general water chemistry before the field experiment the phreatic water level of well 3 was 1 51 m below ground level august 12 during irrigation the measured phreatic levels were 0 99 m august 14 1 09 m august 16 0 95 m august 18 and 0 99 m august 20 below ground level after irrigation the monitored phreatic levels were 1 01 m august 22 0 96 m august 27 and 0 94 m august 31 below ground level overall the water table level fluctuated from 0 56 to 1 51 m during the experiment period a total of 26 groundwater samples 2 preirri 4 irri1 3 irri2 4 irri3 4 irri4 3 postirri1 3 postirri2 3 postirri3 were collected from well 3 according to the monitoring water table all water samples collected were measured for major ions as isotope components and doc the irrigation groundwater from the pumping well drawn from a depth of 24 m was of na hco3 type with a ph 7 95 eh 171 8 mv and doc concentration 7 3 mg c l the total as concentration was 384 μg l far exceeding the who 2011 recommended drinking water standard of 10 μg l as iii was the main as species in this groundwater accounting for 79 of the total as cl so4 2 and na were the dominant ions of soil water groundwater samples from the monitoring wells fig s1a for the soil water samples the percent composition of ca2 and mg2 increased during irrigation but decreased in the post irrigation period while that of hco3 changed little during irrigation but increased in the post irrigation period for the groundwater samples the percent composition of ca2 and mg2 gradually decreased during the experiment and that of hco3 changed minimally significant evaporation exacerbates the salinization of subsurface soils resulting in the accumulation of high concentrations of salts in topsoil soil water and shallow groundwater the irrigation process led to the gradual dissolution of soil evaporites and as the irrigation water infiltrated the salts gradually infiltrated downward and accumulated at depths from 2 to 3 m fig s1b the ph of water samples ranged from 7 33 to 8 79 with a mean value of 8 04 indicating a neutral weakly alkaline environment persistent throughout the irrigation experiment eh values of the soil water groundwater samples ranged from 63 2 to 217 mv throughout the field experiment with a notable decrease during irrigation but a gradual increase in the post irrigation period arsenic concentrations in the monitoring soil water groundwater samples varied from 0 75 to 228 μg l with all water samples with high as concentrations collected from a depth of 3 0 m table 1 the mean value of as iii total as ast in the soil water groundwater gradually increased during irrigation and started to decrease at the end of irrigation related to the change of redox environment due to the irrigation process the δ18o values of soil water groundwater samples ranged from 11 8 to 9 1 with acute increases in cl concentration indicating fast vertical recharge promotes salt dissolution and content mobilization xiao et al 2018 doc concentrations ranged from 10 9 to 45 0 mg c l with a mean value of 23 22 mg c l 3 2 sediment analysis chemical extractions and toc analyses were conducted to understand the potential effects of irrigation on as fe minerals and om the total as content in sediment samples ranged from 5 81 to 7 72 mg kg pre irrigation and 5 36 to 7 86 mg kg post irrigation while the fe content ranged from 20 85 to 26 88 g kg pre irrigation and 20 70 to 27 13 g kg post irrigation the toc in sediment samples ranged from 0 04 to 2 82 mg kg pre irrigation and 0 19 to 3 13 mg kg post irrigation the as content from 0 to 1 20 m below ground level and toc from 0 to 0 25 m below ground level increased after irrigation the fe content from 0 to 1 20 m below ground level and toc from 0 30 to 1 40 m below ground level showed minor variation after irrigation however as and fe content from 1 25 to 1 40 m decreased after irrigation fig 2 a c the as content associated with better crystalline iron oxides significantly increased after irrigation fig 2d while the fe content varied within a smaller range fig 2e the as content bound to om demonstrated the same trend as the total as content fig 2f 3 3 fluorescence characteristics of weom the changes in fluorescence spectra are related to om sources and microbial activity in groundwater and sediment fluorescence features are shown in fig 3 the main type of weom was deciphered as humic acid om based on peaks located at ex em 400 500 300 350 nm chen et al 2003 the fmax suggests that the irrigation infiltration resulted in om accumulation in the topsoil and increased the om content in sediment at different depths to various degrees after irrigation the fi and bix values for weom are shown in table s3 the terrestrial sources of om were attributed to the release of sedimentary om while microbial sources of om were derived from microbial degradation products liu et al 2020 fi values ranged from 1 14 to 1 59 suggesting that the weom of the sediments has terrestrial sources or a mixture of terrestrial and microbial sources bix values ranged from 0 44 to 0 72 indicating an autochthonous component in the sediments three components c1 c2 and c3 from the parafac model were identified from eem fluorescence spectra for the weom samples of the sediments fig 4 a b c1 exhibits an ex em maximum at 330 424 nm and is considered to be a terrestrial humic like component with low molecular weight li et al 2019 stedmon and markager 2005 c2 shows an ex em maximum at 370 484 nm and is considered to be a terrestrial humic like component with high molecular weight fellman et al 2010 yang et al 2020 the humic like c1 is probably less structurally condensed and more labile than c2 the higher molecular weight component has higher aromaticity and more complicated structure identified by longer wavelengths due to the relation to conjugated fluorescent molecules structural condensation and polymerization of organic compounds murphy et al 2010 c3 presents an ex em maximum at 250 338 nm and is considered to be a protein like component tryptophan like component fellman et al 2010 williams et al 2010 the relative abundance of c1 and c3 changed throughout the irrigation process in contrast c2 had a small range of variation due to its larger molecular size and relatively more refractory characteristics fig 3c the relative abundance of c3 is negatively correlated with c1 fig s2b e indicating the tryptophan like component may not be a degradation product of c1 chen et al 2010 before irrigation the relative abundance of c3 was negatively associated with c2 but these components had nearly no correlation after irrigation fig s2c f interestingly the relative abundance of c1 was positively correlated with c2 before irrigation fig s2a but negatively correlated with c2 after irrigation fig s2d this indicates the irrigation process introduces om from the aquifer to the intrinsic om resulting in the re distribution of om in the soil 4 discussion 4 1 effect of irrigation on hydrochemical factors fluctuations in the water table result in changes in redox conditions ph and ec during irrigation the overall changes of the values of as iii astotal table s2 increased from preirri to inirri and decreased from inirri to postirri which matched the overall changes with eh decreased from preirri to inirri and increased from inirri to postirri and as v is easily immobilized under relatively oxidizing conditions during the formation of fe iii oxides while as iii has greater mobility the infiltration of irrigation water provides an input of co2 and changes the ph the values of which are positively correlated with aqueous as concentrations fig s3a with increasing ph the adsorption capacity of positively charged minerals and clay minerals for as is reduced resulting in a rise in as concentrations in the pore water however ec values demonstrate the opposite trend to ph fig s3b ionic strength effects can impact particle aggregation by influencing electrostatic interactions at the higher ionic strengths reduced electrostatic repulsions can increase opportunities for particle contacts and subsequent aggregation with more effective solid liquid separation mercer and tobiason 2008 thus affecting the adsorption of as the saturation indices of various ions in the samples collected from the monitoring wells during the irrigation process calculated by phreeqc show that the soil water groundwater is supersaturated in fe iii minerals viz ferrihydrite fe oh 3 goethite feooh and hematite fe2o3 but unsaturated in fe ii minerals viz siderite feco3 and green rust fe3 oh 8 table s4 a large amount of new as is introduced into the soil with irrigation infiltration but the existing iron oxides and newly formed iron oxides are already at absorption saturation resulting in free aqueous as mobilization to greater depths irrigation increased the groundwater ph and ec and reduced the eh compared to pre irrigation values during irrigation the input source of organic carbon stimulated soil biogeochemical processes reduced the oxygen content and promoted reducing conditions resulting in the release of adsorbed as and rise in aqueous as concentrations as the irrigation water infiltrated the soil aqueous as that was not re immobilized migrated deeper down thus the concentrations of aqueous as from 0 to 2 m below the ground surface show little variation during irrigation the soil water groundwater ph and ec continued to increase from irrigation to post irrigation at which point the eh also increased due to air and oxygen again entering the system from the surface in the post irrigation period the irrigation water was strongly reductive but its influence gradually weakened due to the flooding irrigation approach the intermittent irrigation protocol meant this irrigation water was in contact with oxygen for much longer than would have been the case for continuous irrigation after irrigation ended water infiltration slowed the input irrigation water migrated downward to around 2 5 m and reached the shallow groundwater table after which its vertical movement is retarded fig s1b as a result the concentrations of as sampled from 3 m underground in the post irrigation period were much higher than those sampled pre irrigation table 1 in addition the om introduced by the irrigation water was involved in several hydrochemical processes such as degradation complexation and adsorption which in turn changed the redox conditions and likely promoted the transformation of as 4 2 changes in as fe minerals and om during irrigation sedimentary as is closely associated with fe oxides through adsorption and complexation at the start of irrigation the input of the relatively reducing irrigation water mixed with the soil water resulted in the precipitation of fe iii oxides and the adsorption and co precipitation of as fluctuations in redox conditions and complex geochemical processes during irrigation led to the release mobilization transport and re distribution of as total as and fe contents in the sediment show a weak positive correlation before irrigation that strengthens after irrigation fig s4a in contrast as and fe contents from the extraction of better crystalline fe oxides show a poor correlation after irrigation fig s4b however the poor correlations between as and fe contents in the unsaturated zone from 0 05 to 0 55 m sampled post irrigation were found fig s4c d the precipitation of amorphous fe iii minerals and the dissolution of fe iii oxides occurred with variations in redox conditions during irrigation resulting in the weak association between fe oxides and as thus the fast vertical infiltration leads to the transport of as from the topsoil to greater depths where aqueous as finally accumulates in the saturated zone irrigation activities also introduced om to the subsurface toc content is somewhat positively correlated with as and fe before irrigation with this correlation improving after irrigation fig 5 a c this indicates that om strongly affects as and fe complexation moreover om bound as and toc demonstrate the same trend as as and toc fig 5b these results suggest that sedimentary as fe and om are strongly related and support the association between as fe minerals and om as as fe om ternary complexes mikutta and kretzschmar 2011 4 3 as fe om complexation the ftir spectra of sediments from 0 05 and 1 4 m below ground sampled both pre and post irrigation also indicate the importance of as fe om complexation fig 6 adsorption peaks at 3446 and 3421 cm 1 are attributed to as o bonding xie et al 2016 compared to pre irrigation spectra the as o bond peaks shift from 3446 to 3421 cm 1 and the absorbance considerably increases which can be attributed to the formation of as om complexes and is consistent with the trend of as and toc being more strongly correlated after irrigation the adsorption peaks at 1630 cm 1 provide evidence of the presence of as fe om complexation sharma et al 2010 the intensities of peaks at 1630 cm 1 change at a depth of 1 4 m after irrigation suggesting the disassociation of as fe om peaks at 1435 cm 1 are attributed to c h bonds and the increased intensities indicate ch3 deformation and ch2 scissoring of om fritzsche et al 2015 implying different variations of organic functional groups under irrigation activities in addition the peak at 1032 cm 1 is attributed to the fe oh bond which is implicated in the formation of inner sphere surface complexes wang and mulligan 2008 wen et al 2014 after irrigation the height of the peak at 1032 cm 1 at a depth of 1 4 m significantly increased indicating as is replaced by hydroxyl groups on the surface of sediments and migrates with irrigation water infiltration some studies attribute the peaks at 1032 cm 1 to the presence of polysaccharides c o c and c o h stretching fritzsche et al 2015 wang et al 2013 but their presence is not presumed in this research the peaks at 467 and 777 cm 1 are attributed to the complexation of as and iron hydro oxides xie et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 and changes in their intensity may due to the species and content of as and iron hydro oxides the peak at 689 cm 1 is attributed to fe oh bonding wen et al 2014 zhang et al 2005 thus the data overall support the conclusion that the complexation of as fe om influences as transformation and mobilization during irrigation om affects the mobilization and enrichment of as in groundwater and as fe om complexation changes the activity of as in both groundwater and sediment mcarthur et al 2011 pi et al 2015 wang et al 2019 humic like om components could promote as fe om complexation mladenov et al 2015 before irrigation the relative abundances of the three components identified in the parafac analysis show nearly no correlations with either as or fe but this is not the case after irrigation when positive correlations are evident fig s5 significant positive correlations between c2 and as and c2 and fe are also found after irrigation fig s5b e this suggests a terrestrial humic like component with higher molecular weight dominates in as fe om complexation yang et al 2020 the relative abundance of c2 increases after irrigation in the unsaturated zone from 0 3 to 0 55 m but decreases in the saturated zone from 0 95 to 1 40 m the positive correlation between sedimentary as and toc but nearly no correlation between as and fe from the soil of the unsaturated zone are probably due to ternary complexes of as with other metal om complexes involving ca2 mn2 4 mg2 or al3 sharma et al 2010 bauer and blodau 2009 buschmann et al 2006 ritter et al 2006 labile dissolved om could act as an electron donor to enhance microbial respiration in a relatively reducing environment resulting in both the microbial oxidation of om and the reduction of fe iii oxides to fe ii oxides and as v to as iii leading to the increase in aqueous as fendorf et al 2010 vega et al 2017 the c3 component in this study identified as protein like substances is typically an environmentally labile compound reflecting the production of amino acids that are easily and rapidly utilized by microorganisms coble 2007 after irrigation the c3 component declined to 0 around the saturated zone obviously indicating microbial reactions in the relatively reducing environment because c3 may not be the degradation product of c1 the increase in c3 after irrigation suggests new om introduced with the irrigation water resulted in microbial degradation during irrigation although the irrigation process affected redox conditions in the subsurface labile om contributed to the redox reactions due to its involvement in microbial degradation where it acted as an electron donor thus the results from this study suggest om plays an important role during high as groundwater irrigation on the one hand terrestrial humic like substances with high molecular weight promote as mobilization by complexation reactions on the other hand biodegradation of labile om affects fe iii oxides and leads to the mobilization of as 4 4 mechanism of as mobilization induced by irrigation based on the above comprehensive analysis the irrigation process can be generalized as shown in fig 7 before irrigation as v is the dominant as species and as in sediments co exists with both fe minerals and om the unsaturated zone is characterized by oxidizing conditions and the phreatic water table is 1 51 m below ground level when irrigation activity begins as dom some fe ii and co2 in the irrigation water are transported to the subsurface the oxidation of fe ii happens suddenly with as in the irrigation water then being adsorbed by fe iii minerals with continued irrigation as iii gradually becomes the main as species in the relatively reducing conditions and demonstrates greater mobility as demonstrated through hydrochemical parameters that change with irrigation infiltration the input of labile om from the irrigation water could affect the redox conditions and mediate fe iii bearing minerals undergoing reductive dissolution and disassociation with as thus contributing increasing amounts of aqueous as that is transported to greater depths the dissolution and recrystallization of salts in the unsaturated zone caused by irrigation activities lead to the mobility of cations which further results in the disassociation of as fe om ternary complexes and the formation of as metal om complexes when irrigation ends the residual irrigation water on the land continues to infiltrate after prolonged contact with air due to the stronger oxidizing conditions as v concentrations increase and more as can be immobilized onto fe minerals as reflected in the increasing as content in sediments in the unsaturated zone the frequent oxic anoxic fluctuations introduced by the irrigation activity enhance the mobility of as and increase concentrations in the topsoil furthermore the saturated zone is characterized by relatively reducing conditions the intermittent irrigation contributes to the variation in the saturated zone on the one hand the input of dom that accompanies irrigation accelerates the dissolution of fe iii minerals and contributes to a sudden change in aqueous as concentrations in the saturated zone from irri2 to irri3 on the other hand the variations of dom components such as the reduction in the c2 component with fewer fe iii minerals together lead to the dissociation of as fe om as confirmed by the ftir results in general irrigation activities affect the sources of these components in the unsaturated and saturated zone and promotes as transformation and mobilization 5 conclusions irrigation activities have a significant effect on as mobilization and migration in the unsaturated and saturated zones irrigation infiltration affects the concentrations of major ions which accumulate around 2 5 m below ground level after irrigation the flood irrigation practice also affects redox conditions reducing oxidizing and the water table rising falling leading to the transformation of fe ii and fe iii minerals and resulting in variations in the content of as and fe minerals and ultimately in an increase of as content in the topsoil and aqueous as in the groundwater with the input of labile om from high as groundwater the toc content in the topsoil increases and fe iii bearing minerals undergo reductive dissolution and disassociate with as leading to an increase in aqueous as that infiltrates to greater depths moreover the disassociation of as fe om ternary complexes is attributed to as other metal om complexation these results are conducive and imperative for better understanding as mobilization and the role of om under high as

4261,the performance of water quality models depends on both data from the external inputs and the internal processes of a water body limited field data can often be the major cause of errors in water quality prediction when modeling especially in large environments the aim of this study was to improve the prediction accuracy of water quality in a large lake using the combined application of an artificial neural network ann method and a numerical model multilayer perceptron mlp method was used as an ann method to generate temporal input data by learning complex relationships of water quality variables from two types of water quality monitoring systems at major boundaries a regular monitoring system analyzes 13 water quality variables in 3 layers monthly or weekly while the automatic monitoring system analyzes 8 surface water quality variables daily the environmental fluid dynamics code efdc 3 d hydrodynamics and water quality model was calibrated with 55 588 grids to simulate the water quality of the 46 5 km section of daecheong lake the accuracy of the efdc models was assessed at four locations in the lake for the application of daily data generated by mlp models against that of interpolated data from a regular monitoring system as input of efdc boundary conditions according to the averaged index of agreement ia the performance of mlp efdc showed more accurate results than the efdc using interpolated data for most variables in particular the maximum increase in the average ia was 14 4 for total phosphorus however the performances of mlp efdc were not significantly improved in the downstream section of the study area where the input effects were mixed with the internal processes of the lake this study shows that 1 unmonitored temporal input data can be developed using ann techniques if data for learning processes are available and 2 the linkage between the ann technique and the numerical model can improve the prediction accuracy of the water quality in a

tributary wwtp wastewater treatment plant s surface layer m middle layer b bottom layer 1 introduction surface water quality modeling provides a quantitative basis for in depth interpretation and decision making by simulating the interactions among various water quality variables in a complex and large water environment reichert et al 2001 a process based model can be used to simulate various water quality problems such as eutrophication algal blooms toxic material transport and pollutant diffusion in rivers lakes estuaries and coastal waters although modeling can provide predictions for these water quality scenarios ensuring accurate simulation is challenging model performance is determined by various factors such as selection of an appropriate model development of an optimal grid input data parameter estimation and judgment of the modeler chapra 2008 ji 2017 loucks and van beek 2017 however even if a model perfectly reflects the study area without sufficient input data the result may be unreliable ahmed et al 2019 or considered garbage in and garbage out field data are essential for models to predict assumed scenarios or future events the main purpose of the water quality monitoring system in the environmental field is to generate sufficient and timely information to establish water quality management plans and make environmental policies telci et al 2009 water quality information is analyzed using physical chemical and biological methods köster et al 2003 and sampling locations must be optimally managed to minimize time and cost behmel et al 2016 kovacs et al 2016 however except for well maintained locations such as a wastewater treatment plant environmental field data are insufficient because environmental fields are so great an automatic water quality monitoring system is implemented to overcome the limitations of manpower based sampling or analysis however the system is costly and sensors are only available for a limited number of variables cloete et al 2016 by contrast while an automatic monitoring system can provide high frequency data for a limited number of variables a regular monitoring system can test many types of variables in the laboratory albeit with low frequency the results of water quality modeling with insufficient data can result in misleading interpretations and increase uncertainty zadeh et al 2019 for instance phytoplankton growth in water is predominantly affected by hourly changes in water temperature and solar radiation thomann and mueller 1987 if meteorological input data are not provided in time a diurnal variation simulation of phytoplankton dynamics is impossible an alternative is to supplement the missing data between the measured data using interpolation linear interpolation is frequently used for simplicity however because the linear interpolation method simply connects with a line between adjacent measurements the important variability between those points may be ignored statistical models can supplement missing data based on causality in particular regression based models such as multiple linear regression mlr have been developed and used in many studies he and takase 2006 effectively predicted daily rainfall discharge and groundwater elevation using mlr hirsch et al 2010 estimated daily nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations using mlr and daily discharge katin et al 2021 showed that the prediction accuracy of chlorophyll a chl a concentration using a bayesian piecewise regression model was superior to that of the process based model mlr is powerful for predicting the average trend while it may lack explanatory power for estimating extreme values and only focuses on a single predictor another alternative method to supplement time series for a surface water quality model is to use outputs of a watershed model such as the soil and water assessment tool swat neitsch et al 2011 hydrological simulation program fortran hspf bicknell et al 1997 and stormwater management model swmm rossman 2010 watershed models can predict flow rates and water quality concentrations at the outlet of subbasins based on water balance and water quality interactions due to rainfall however watershed models also require an intensive amount of input data including basin information such as topography land use or soil type as well as rainfall information for each station or subbasin in addition the uncertainties of watershed models in the conceptualization of hydrological processes empirical equations and estimation of various model parameters also greatly affect the accuracy of their outcomes daniel et al 2011 the artificial neural network ann approach can be used as an alternative to supplement input data by learning complex relationships among water quality variables and integrating non linearities the advantage of ann is that it can be easily extended to multivariate cases and modified by changing the network architecture which can expand the flexibility of the model maier and dandy 2000 several water quality studies using anns have been conducted owing to their wide applicability in particular most studies have attempted to predict dissolved oxygen do in various environments such as rivers lakes reservoirs ponds and coastal waters chen et al 2020 recent studies have been conducted to predict algal blooms caused by eutrophication choi et al 2019 guallar et al 2016 lee and lee 2018 wang et al 2020 moreover paliwal and kumar 2009 reported that the performance of ann in many studies has shown a better outcome compared to other statistical techniques including regression however some studies have shown that the regression model and other statistical models perform better than ann depending on the predictors and circumstances he and takase 2006 paliwal and kumar 2009 zain et al 2012 in addition as the theory is ignored in the learning process ann cannot explain any mechanism by which predicted values are derived therefore it is called a black box model lazer et al 2014 peters et al 2014 nevertheless the use of ann methods has increased rapidly to predict water quality in the environment it is often the case that only limited field data are available for many lakes and rivers despite accurate prediction being desirable in modeling the aim of this study was to generate various supplemental boundary conditions of a numerical water quality model using the ann method and to improve the prediction accuracy of water quality in a large lake namely daecheong lake in korea where regular and automatic monitoring systems operate at the inlet of the lake and at its major tributary to achieve the purpose of this study the following steps were performed 1 the field data of the regular monitoring system with relatively longer measurement intervals were learned by the ann method 2 33 unmonitored variables were generated daily by the learned model and the field data of the automatic monitoring system with short measurement intervals 3 the process based numerical model predicted water quality in a large lake using intensive input data generated by the ann 4 the benefit of using the ann method to supplement boundary conditions and the improvement of the prediction accuracy for water quality in the lake by a numerical model were evaluated 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and water quality monitoring systems daecheong lake the study area was created by a dam constructed in the geum river of south korea the surface area and storage capacity of the lake are 72 8 km2 and 1 5 109 m3 respectively daecheong lake has supplied 1 6 billion m3 year of domestic industrial and agricultural water in the vicinity and provided 2 4 108 kw year of electricity via hydropower generators this study focused on a 46 5 km section of the lake between janggye bridge wq1 and daecheong dam wq4 which are the major inflow and outflow locations of the lake respectively fig 1 the largest tributary in the lake is seohwa cheon tr1 which includes the discharge of a municipal wastewater treatment plant wwtp1 for urban areas in the vicinity in the study area two automatic monitoring stations aqs five mainstream stations wqs and four tributary stations trs are operated by the korean government as shown in fig 1 regular monitoring systems in wqs and trs measure up to 52 water quality variables including toxic materials for samples on a monthly or weekly basis samples are taken and analyzed for the surface middle and bottom layers of a deep lake in korea and only surface layer samples are analyzed for tributaries in contrast the automatic water quality monitoring station measures 7 8 water quality variables daily using sensor probes and in field automatic analysis devices for samples collected from the surface layer in this study 13 and 8 variables 7 for aq2 were collected from regular monitoring systems and automatic monitoring systems respectively as shown in table 1 wq1 and tr1 of the study area have independent automatic water quality monitoring systems aq1 and aq2 respectively in the vicinity of each location water quality trends of automatic and regular monitoring systems in the vicinity were similar to each other however the two stations sometimes showed different patterns especially for chl a after 2018 or do in 2019 as shown in fig 2 left in seohwa cheon the largest tributary of the study area the trends of temperature temp do and total phosphorus tp between tr1 and aq2 were similar however there were large differences in total organic carbon toc and total nitrogen tn as shown in fig 2 right this seemed to be caused by the effluent of wwtp1 entering between tr1 and aq2 2 2 hydrodynamic and water quality model 2 2 1 numerical model environmental fluid dynamics code efdc the efdc a three dimensional hydrodynamic and water quality model hamrick 1992 was used to simulate the water quality of daecheong lake the efdc includes various modules such as hydrodynamics temperature salinity dye water quality sediment transport and toxic this model can consider the wet and dry conditions of a domain owing to the fluctuation of the water level and can simulate hydraulic structures such as dams weirs orifices and sluice gates to reflect stratification due to water temperature or salinity in a simulation the efdc supports the sigma zed sgz coordinate craig et al 2014 a vertical layering approach sgz reduces the horizontal pressure gradient associated with the standard sigma stretch grid method mellor et al 1994 thus this method is suitable for the current study site with steep varying bathymetry based on these advantages the efdc can be a useful tool in various water systems such as rivers lakes reservoirs coasts and oceans the water quality module of the efdc park et al 1995 can simulate 22 water quality variables such as algae carbon nitrogen phosphorus silica and do supplemental fig 1 hereafter s figure 2 2 2 development of grid system for efdc daecheong lake is the third largest artificial lake in korea and has complicated winding shapes in the 46 5 km long study site the maximum depth is approximately 50 m near the dam wq4 and the minimum depth at wq1 is approximately 20 m to reflect the complex topography and curvature of the river 3 828 horizontal grids were carefully determined using the curvilinear orthogonal coordinate method the number of vertical grids varied between 3 and 30 using the sgz coordinate system and the total number of grids for this study was 55 588 as shown in s fig 2 the representativeness of the developed grid system was evaluated by the courant friedrichs lewy condition courant et al 1928 and orthogonal deviation od in the case of od the closer to 0 the squarer the grid is formed the od was distributed from 53 8 to 37 9 and the average od was estimated to be 3 9 the courant number should be set to 1 0 to minimize numerical error in this study this condition was satisfied by a dynamic time step method that varied depending on the flow condition 2 3 estimation and generation of time series for water quality prediction in the entire domain inflows considered in the study site occur through four tributaries tr and one wastewater treatment plant wwtp2 and outflows occur through three water intake stations and the discharge of daecheong dam boundary conditions were developed for river inflows including flow rates water temperature and water quality concentrations sixteen water quality variables including organic material nutrients and algal concentrations were simulated in this study all the information for boundary conditions were obtained from the national database systems of the republic of korea daily flow wamis go kr water intake waternow go kr wwtp discharge hasudoinfo or kr hourly meteorological data data kma go kr and water quality data including water temperature wq and tr water nier go kr aq koreawqi go kr because the depth of the inlet point wq1 of the study area is 20 m it was necessary to provide input data for different vertical layers the surface middle and bottom layers finally to prevent an incorrect simulation by the input data it was verified that there were no significant errors or extremely high values among the field data for all boundary conditions 2 3 1 temporal interpolation of water quality data water quality data from various sources may not have the same monitoring intervals in this section the data with monthly or weekly intervals for wq1 and tr1 tr4 were interpolated to fit daily time series inputs for the efdc for longer monitoring intervals of the mainstream and tributaries the data were interpolated using the following methods 1 step 2 linear and 3 piecewise cubic hermite interpolating polynomial pchip fritsch and carlson 1980 the stepwise interpolated value at a query point can be the value at the previous next or nearest grid point assuming that the value of the next time is unknown the previous step interpolation is suitable linear interpolation is simple to use and is widely used with a straight line between the previous and next time values the pchip method interpolates values based on a shape preserving piecewise cubic interpolation of the values at neighboring grid points this method displays less unrealistic overshoot and undershoot than the cubic spline method rabbath and corriveau 2019 2 3 2 daily time series generation using ann models in this study the ann method was applied to complement daily water quality information by generating unmonitored data this method was also applied to complement data for the surface middle and bottom layers in the vertical direction as shown in table 1 automatic stations monitor a limited number of water quality variables daily on the other hand regular monitoring stations wq and tr measure 13 variables with longer monitoring intervals given that aq1 and aq2 are near wq1 and tr1 respectively it is assumed that complex relationships among water quality variables can be learned and generate unmonitored daily and vertical boundary condition data using anns fig 3 shows the conceptual design of the learning process using an ann in this study in learning step1 the monthly field data of the surface layer at wq1 were used for learning using the learned model and the daily field data of aq1 unmonitored data of aq1 dtn nh3 no3 dtp and po4 were generated assuming the same relative relationships among water quality variables the same process was performed for tr1 and aq2 in learning step2 the field data of the three layers at wq1 were used for learning to generate daily data of the middle and bottom layers learning step2 used the learned model of this step daily field data of aq1 and generated data of learning step1 in wq1 and tr1 the field data between april 2004 and july 2020 were used as input and target variables in all learning processes including training and verification further 70 of all data were selected randomly for training and 30 of all data were used for verification the daily field data of aq1 and aq2 between january 2016 and july 2020 were used as inputs for the learned models to generate daily data of unmonitored variables in this study a multilayer perceptron mlp method minsky and papert 1969 was used as an ann method mlp method is a class of feedforward architecture and is composed of an input layer either a single layer or multiple hidden layers and an output layer s fig 3 each layer can have numerous nodes the activation function of the hidden and output layers was the hyperbolic tangent sigmoid transfer function bayesian regularization backpropagation foresee and hagan 1997 mackay 1992 was used as the backpropagation training algorithm benvenuto and piazza 1992 the learning rate and epoch were set to 0 01 and 5 000 respectively the performance during learning was calculated using the mean squared error mse which represents the average squared difference between the target and output values table 2 shows the mlp composition used in this study variables that were not measured in the aqs were selected as targets table 1 the numbers of hidden layers and nodes of each hidden layer were mainly determined by manual search although various optimization methodologies such as grid search montgomery 2017 random search bergstra and bengio 2012 and bayesian optimization brochu et al 2010 mockus et al 1978 can be used to find the parameters of the mlp method the manual search in this study allowed the simultaneous evaluation of the learning performance of mlp method and accuracy of generated time series by the learned mlp models for instance during the learning process using optimization methods some learning performances were higher than the value presented in this study however the accuracies of the generated time series were often lower in this case some outliers in field observations were excluded by judgment however if a hidden layer has too many layers or nodes it may result in an overfitting or non progress state to prevent these problems the methodologies of previous studies were also referenced 1 the number of layers or nodes used in similar research areas was referred to tomić et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 and 2 a decision method using the number of inputs and training samples was implemented tian et al 2017 in addition during learning if the mse decrease slope rapidly increased after the mse converged to a certain value this state was deemed overfitted and the corresponding learned model was excluded 2 4 efdc calibration and development of simulation scenarios the efdc model was calibrated using input data prepared by the linear interpolation method the water quality parameters for calibration were initially selected from previous research reports bae and seo 2018 bae and seo 2021 bowie et al 1985 kim et al 2021 kim et al 2017 shin et al 2008 and further adjusted to improve the calibration accuracy table 3 water quality calibrations were performed at the surface middle and bottom layers of four different water quality monitoring stations wq2 wq5 for temp tn tp toc chl a nh3 no3 po4 and do then efdc simulations with other interpolations and the mlp model were also performed with the calibrated parameters each efdc simulation is named as follows 1 step efdc 2 linear efdc 3 pchip efdc and 4 mlp efdc 2 5 evaluation of model performance to evaluate the performance of the efdc simulation results using interpolations and the mlp method the root mean squared error rmse and index of agreement ia willmott 1981 were used rmse is the square root of the mse and is representative of the size of a typical error ia represents the ratio between the mse and potential error willmott 1984 ia reflects the degree to which the observed variate is accurately estimated by the simulated variate and is a standardized measure to make cross comparisons of its magnitudes for a variety of models regardless of units ia detects additive and proportional differences in the observed and simulated means and variances willmott 1981 in addition ia can be used as a substitute for the coefficient of determination legates and mccabe jr 1999 the detailed formula for each index is as follows rmse i 1 n s i o i 2 n ia 1 i 1 n o i s i 2 i 1 n s i o avg o i o avg 2 where n is the number of observations s is the simulated value o is the observed value and oavg is the average of the observed values the range of the rmse is from 0 the ideal value to ia which is calculated from 0 to 1 becomes 1 when the simulation is perfect 3 results and discussion 3 1 water quality calibration using efdc with interpolated time series 3 1 1 interpolation results fig 4 compares the water quality boundary conditions prepared by step linear and pchip interpolations at the major inflow location wq1 the results of the linear and pchip interpolations were similar because step interpolation uses a constant value between the measured points relatively large differences were observed compared to other interpolation methods the pchip showed smoother trend lines than the other interpolation methods however if extreme values such as high or zero concentrations are included among the grid points the interpolated value can be overestimated or underestimated e g chl a or po4 in fig 4 these uncertainties are difficult to analyze without reference values lepot et al 2017 musial et al 2011 stated that a trend and noise should be distinguished for interpolation applications however because water quality dynamics are affected by internal processes and external influences such as rainfall and environmental pollution events it is not possible to distinguish between a trend and noise hirsch et al 2015 therefore all data including peak values were be included in the analysis though this may lead to misunderstanding 3 1 2 efdc calibration results efdc model calibration was performed using linear interpolated input data against field data from january 2019 to july 2020 water level calibration was performed at daecheong dam wq4 the simulated water level showed good agreement with field observation average rmse and ia of water level calibration for field observations were 0 03 el m and 0 99 respectively as shown in s fig 4 the results of water quality and temperature simulations using different boundary conditions for the four locations are shown in figs 5 7 for the surface middle and bottom layers respectively the overall calibration accuracy is summarized in table 4 and the detailed results for the surface middle and bottom layers are summarized in supplementary table 1 hereafter s table 1 s table 2 and s table 3 respectively in the study area field samples for water quality analysis were taken from the surface middle and bottom layers though efdc results were extracted for the corresponding grids for model calibrations there can be differences in vertical locations as the water level in the lake continuously varies which may affect errors in the subsequent analysis the overall average ia of the temperature for linear efdc was 0 89 indicating a successful calibration for the variable while the maximum ia was 0 93 in the middle layer of wq4 hereafter wq4 m as shown in s table 2 and the minimum ia was 0 44 at wq4 b as shown in s table 3 although the accuracy at wq4 b was the poorest according to ia the rmse value was 1 69 c which was significantly lower than the maximum rmse 5 85 c at wq3 m in general temperature simulations tend to overestimate field measurements especially in the early 2020 s at almost all the surface and middle layers in contrast the predicted temperature at wq4 b the deepest location in the study area reflected low observations with good agreement this result indicates that the heat exchange with the sediment layer was significant and must be considered seriously because the surface water temperature is affected by surface heat exchange with the atmosphere and vertical mixing edinger et al 1968 the overestimation in this study was likely due to limited field atmospheric information or underestimated vertical mixing of the model seo et al 2010 the average ias of all water quality variables were ranged from 0 28 to 0 84 as shown in table 4 the maximum ia of do was 0 93 at wq2 b rmse 2 19 mg l s table 3 whereas the minimum ia of chl a was 0 07 at wq5 s rmse 1 69 mg m3 s table 1 although the simulated values of water quality did not sensitively respond to the observed peak values they followed the average trend of field observations figs 5 7 the result of nh3 was overestimated but the degree of concentration was significantly lower than that of tn on the other hand the toc results were underestimated and the extent of error increased in the downstream direction wq2 s to wq5 s rmse 0 63 to 0 94 mg l ia 0 44 to 0 23 respectively although the study area is a large lake with several small tributaries only four streams were considered as inputs in the model because of limited available data insufficient information on boundary conditions from small tributaries around the lake could be a major cause of error in the underestimation of toc in this study in addition errors can be caused by the difference in vertical locations between field monitoring and model calculation as discussed above moreover during rainfall events input loading can increase rapidly however sporadic field observations through regular sampling may not reflect this situation bartram and ballance 1996 as shown in figs 5 7 the calibration accuracy among the efdc results with different interpolation methods was similar at all locations however for step efdc the prediction accuracy of the water quality calibration was poorer than that of the linear efdc according to table 4 and s table 4 the percentage differences of the average rmse and ia for step efdc were 0 9 7 0 and 14 6 0 9 relative to linear efdc respectively for pchip efdc the percentage differences of average rmse and ia for water quality variables were 1 5 3 3 and 0 5 1 5 relative to linear efdc respectively except tn pchip efdc showed slightly improved tn predictions rmse 3 1 and ia 4 7 consequently the difference in the simulation results between the linear efdc and pchip efdc was insignificant however the efdc model simulation using linear or pchip interpolations was more accurate than when using the step interpolation method for boundary conditions mlp efdc cases were included in these figures to save spaces and will be discussed in the 3 2 3 section 3 2 water quality simulation using efdc with daily time series generated by mlp models 3 2 1 model learning using mlp method and regular monitoring data as shown in table 2 the relationships among water quality variables in regular monitoring data of wq1 and tr1 were learned by the mlp method as a part of the preparation to generate daily data table 5 shows the accuracy of learned results by the mlp method for variables that were not monitored in automatic monitoring systems against field measurement of regular monitoring systems the overall ia varied from 0 88 to 1 00 indicating that the learning using the mlp method was successful as shown in table 5 chl a at wq1 b showed the poorest ia of learning performance and tn at wq1 b showed the best ia 3 2 2 generation of daily time series using mlp models after successful learning using monthly data in table 5 daily data were generated in this process daily data of automatic monitoring systems aq1 and aq2 from january 2016 to july 2020 were used as input for the developed mlp models however since the learned mlp model is not based on the law of mass conservation the generated results of the mlp models can become negative during mathematical operations in this study if the generated value of the mlp model was negative it was regarded as zero the proportion of predicted negative values was approximately 4 9 which was 2 703 out of 55 176 1 672 days and 33 variables the accuracy of generated daily data was evaluated by comparing data sets corresponding to the same date with available field measurements as shown in table 6 the average ia for all variables at all locations was 0 68 the average ias for the surface middle and bottom layers at wq1 were 0 71 0 74 and 0 71 respectively while it was 0 47 for tr1 in general wq1 m showed the best performance and tr1 showed the poorest agreement the final generated daily time series using the mlp models are shown in fig 8 along with field measurements at wq1 and tr1 the results of the mlp models showed several characteristic behaviors 1 the prediction results showed large daily fluctuations especially for the no3 and chl a at tr1 this phenomenon reflects the daily variability of field data including external hydrological effects such as wash off due to rainfall and effluent from wwtps in the watershed 2 in some periods however the prediction did not reflect high or peak concentrations properly for example the mlp model underestimated the dtn and tn of all layers and the dtp of the surface layer for some period in addition some peak concentrations of dtp and po4 in tr1 were not reflected accurately 3 chl a concentrations were overestimated for most of the period the possible causes of the errors can be explained as follows in the learning step the number of input data wq1 or tr1 required for learning may be insufficient therefore few outliers may have significantly influenced the overall performance of the learning process another reason seems to be the difference in sampling location and time for the regular and automatic monitoring systems even if the data were measured on the same day the exact sampling time may be different this condition can show differences in concentrations over time even with the same variables e g phytoplankton and do bartram and ballance 1996 thomann and mueller 1987 in addition while wq1 takes samples in the middle of the river the sampling point of aq1 is located at the riverside of 700 m downstream of wq1 in the case of chl a there were significant differences between aq1 and wq1 as shown in fig 2 left in general phytoplankton proliferates in stable water bodies reynolds 2006 the flow velocity at the center of a river can be higher than that of a riverside area which may proliferate chl a concentrations more at aq1 than at wq1 in the case of seohwa cheon there is a continuous discharge of the effluent of wwtp1 between tr1 and aq2 this fact may significantly affect accuracy in generating daily data for the major tributary of the study area 3 2 3 simulation results of efdc with daily time series generated by mlp models the efdc simulation results with daily time series generated by the mlp model were compared to step efdc linear efdc and pchip efdc at 12 locations in daecheong lake overall mlp efdc showed a clear improvement over the simulation results with the interpolation methods as shown in figs 5 7 the average ia values for all variables of the efdc simulations with boundary conditions using the step linear pchip and mlp boundary conditions were 0 49 0 52 0 53 and 0 55 respectively table 4 the maximum increase in the average ia was 14 4 for tp when mlp efdc was compared to linear efdc s table 4 fig 9 compares the ia values for the nine variables of linear efdc and mlp efdc for different vertical layers of four different locations namely wq2 wq5 fig 9 a shows the absolute ia values and fig 9 b shows the relative ia values of mlp efdc over linear efdc most of the ia values of mlp efdc in fig 9 a were greater than those of linear efdc especially at the surface and bottom layers wq2 showed a distinct improvement in the tn and tp predictions this result indicates that the reliability of the mlp model is higher than that of the interpolation result in other words it indirectly proves that it is reasonable to have moderate or large daily fluctuations rather than stable changes in water quality concentrations however mlp efdc showed lower accuracy for temp and do table 4 in addition mlp efdc showed the greatest error in chl a prediction especially at wq2 s and wq3 s as shown in figs 5 7 chl a at wq2 and wq3 were clearly overestimated and this was distinct for mlp efdc the overestimation of chl a in wq2 was due to the high chl a values of aq1 which were used as input data in the mlp model furthermore because do is affected by water temperature and photosynthesis of phytoplankton chapra 2008 the error of do prediction could result from lower accuracy for temp and chl a the accuracy improvement of mlp efdc from linear efdc was pronounced in upstream areas and was relatively smaller in the downstream direction the average improvement percentages in wq2 and wq3 were 25 4 and 24 5 respectively whereas it was 15 4 and 14 7 in wq4 and wq5 respectively the mlp models were learned at the headwater location wq1 and the largest tributary tr1 where automatic monitoring data were available on the other hand the time series of the remaining boundary conditions was the same owing to data limitations therefore the influence of the boundary conditions supplemented by the mlp model decreased downstream in addition toc concentrations at wq4 and wq5 were still significantly underestimated and this did not improve significantly with mlp efdc these results indicate that the mlp method or any ann method cannot cover all regions and improve boundary conditions unless appropriate learning data are available 4 conclusion the aim of this study was to improve the accuracy of the numerical model efdc in the calibration of water quality in daecheong lake by improving boundary conditions using the mlp method an ann method two different data sets from the regular monitoring system and the automatic monitoring system which have different monitoring intervals and different numbers of water quality variables were used to learn water quality interactions using the mlp method daily water quality data were generated for the headwater and major tributary of the study site using successfully learned mlp models in addition the water quality variables of the middle and bottom layers were generated in this process for the headwater the mlp model generated large fluctuations in daily data by considering external influences such as rainfall and environmental pollution events compared to interpolation methods mlp efdc showed the most accurate performance compared to the efdc simulations using the interpolated input the average ia of mlp efdc for all variables was 0 55 which was a 4 2 increase compared to that of linear efdc the maximum increase in the average ia was 14 4 for tp however the chl a prediction accuracy of mlp efdc at wq2 s decreased significantly due to the high chl a data of the automatic monitoring system from the results of this study future research should consider not only a temporal scale but also a spatial scale for water quality this study suggests that the ann technique can be applied to generate daily time series for boundary conditions of the numerical model and can improve the prediction accuracy of the water quality of a large lake the performance of mlp efdc would be further improved as more field data becomes available in the future in addition this study can be applied to verify performance levels and develop improvement plans for either regular or automatic monitoring systems if it is also possible to extend the spatiotemporal scale of modeling by linking with watershed models or climate change scenarios various ann techniques can be applied to improve field measurement and

4261,the performance of water quality models depends on both data from the external inputs and the internal processes of a water body limited field data can often be the major cause of errors in water quality prediction when modeling especially in large environments the aim of this study was to improve the prediction accuracy of water quality in a large lake using the combined application of an artificial neural network ann method and a numerical model multilayer perceptron mlp method was used as an ann method to generate temporal input data by learning complex relationships of water quality variables from two types of water quality monitoring systems at major boundaries a regular monitoring system analyzes 13 water quality variables in 3 layers monthly or weekly while the automatic monitoring system analyzes 8 surface water quality variables daily the environmental fluid dynamics code efdc 3 d hydrodynamics and water quality model was calibrated with 55 588 grids to simulate the water quality of the 46 5 km section of daecheong lake the accuracy of the efdc models was assessed at four locations in the lake for the application of daily data generated by mlp models against that of interpolated data from a regular monitoring system as input of efdc boundary conditions according to the averaged index of agreement ia the performance of mlp efdc showed more accurate results than the efdc using interpolated data for most variables in particular the maximum increase in the average ia was 14 4 for total phosphorus however the performances of mlp efdc were not significantly improved in the downstream section of the study area where the input effects were mixed with the internal processes of the lake this study shows that 1 unmonitored temporal input data can be developed using ann techniques if data for learning processes are available and 2 the linkage between the ann technique and the numerical model can improve the prediction accuracy of the water quality in a

tributary wwtp wastewater treatment plant s surface layer m middle layer b bottom layer 1 introduction surface water quality modeling provides a quantitative basis for in depth interpretation and decision making by simulating the interactions among various water quality variables in a complex and large water environment reichert et al 2001 a process based model can be used to simulate various water quality problems such as eutrophication algal blooms toxic material transport and pollutant diffusion in rivers lakes estuaries and coastal waters although modeling can provide predictions for these water quality scenarios ensuring accurate simulation is challenging model performance is determined by various factors such as selection of an appropriate model development of an optimal grid input data parameter estimation and judgment of the modeler chapra 2008 ji 2017 loucks and van beek 2017 however even if a model perfectly reflects the study area without sufficient input data the result may be unreliable ahmed et al 2019 or considered garbage in and garbage out field data are essential for models to predict assumed scenarios or future events the main purpose of the water quality monitoring system in the environmental field is to generate sufficient and timely information to establish water quality management plans and make environmental policies telci et al 2009 water quality information is analyzed using physical chemical and biological methods köster et al 2003 and sampling locations must be optimally managed to minimize time and cost behmel et al 2016 kovacs et al 2016 however except for well maintained locations such as a wastewater treatment plant environmental field data are insufficient because environmental fields are so great an automatic water quality monitoring system is implemented to overcome the limitations of manpower based sampling or analysis however the system is costly and sensors are only available for a limited number of variables cloete et al 2016 by contrast while an automatic monitoring system can provide high frequency data for a limited number of variables a regular monitoring system can test many types of variables in the laboratory albeit with low frequency the results of water quality modeling with insufficient data can result in misleading interpretations and increase uncertainty zadeh et al 2019 for instance phytoplankton growth in water is predominantly affected by hourly changes in water temperature and solar radiation thomann and mueller 1987 if meteorological input data are not provided in time a diurnal variation simulation of phytoplankton dynamics is impossible an alternative is to supplement the missing data between the measured data using interpolation linear interpolation is frequently used for simplicity however because the linear interpolation method simply connects with a line between adjacent measurements the important variability between those points may be ignored statistical models can supplement missing data based on causality in particular regression based models such as multiple linear regression mlr have been developed and used in many studies he and takase 2006 effectively predicted daily rainfall discharge and groundwater elevation using mlr hirsch et al 2010 estimated daily nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations using mlr and daily discharge katin et al 2021 showed that the prediction accuracy of chlorophyll a chl a concentration using a bayesian piecewise regression model was superior to that of the process based model mlr is powerful for predicting the average trend while it may lack explanatory power for estimating extreme values and only focuses on a single predictor another alternative method to supplement time series for a surface water quality model is to use outputs of a watershed model such as the soil and water assessment tool swat neitsch et al 2011 hydrological simulation program fortran hspf bicknell et al 1997 and stormwater management model swmm rossman 2010 watershed models can predict flow rates and water quality concentrations at the outlet of subbasins based on water balance and water quality interactions due to rainfall however watershed models also require an intensive amount of input data including basin information such as topography land use or soil type as well as rainfall information for each station or subbasin in addition the uncertainties of watershed models in the conceptualization of hydrological processes empirical equations and estimation of various model parameters also greatly affect the accuracy of their outcomes daniel et al 2011 the artificial neural network ann approach can be used as an alternative to supplement input data by learning complex relationships among water quality variables and integrating non linearities the advantage of ann is that it can be easily extended to multivariate cases and modified by changing the network architecture which can expand the flexibility of the model maier and dandy 2000 several water quality studies using anns have been conducted owing to their wide applicability in particular most studies have attempted to predict dissolved oxygen do in various environments such as rivers lakes reservoirs ponds and coastal waters chen et al 2020 recent studies have been conducted to predict algal blooms caused by eutrophication choi et al 2019 guallar et al 2016 lee and lee 2018 wang et al 2020 moreover paliwal and kumar 2009 reported that the performance of ann in many studies has shown a better outcome compared to other statistical techniques including regression however some studies have shown that the regression model and other statistical models perform better than ann depending on the predictors and circumstances he and takase 2006 paliwal and kumar 2009 zain et al 2012 in addition as the theory is ignored in the learning process ann cannot explain any mechanism by which predicted values are derived therefore it is called a black box model lazer et al 2014 peters et al 2014 nevertheless the use of ann methods has increased rapidly to predict water quality in the environment it is often the case that only limited field data are available for many lakes and rivers despite accurate prediction being desirable in modeling the aim of this study was to generate various supplemental boundary conditions of a numerical water quality model using the ann method and to improve the prediction accuracy of water quality in a large lake namely daecheong lake in korea where regular and automatic monitoring systems operate at the inlet of the lake and at its major tributary to achieve the purpose of this study the following steps were performed 1 the field data of the regular monitoring system with relatively longer measurement intervals were learned by the ann method 2 33 unmonitored variables were generated daily by the learned model and the field data of the automatic monitoring system with short measurement intervals 3 the process based numerical model predicted water quality in a large lake using intensive input data generated by the ann 4 the benefit of using the ann method to supplement boundary conditions and the improvement of the prediction accuracy for water quality in the lake by a numerical model were evaluated 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and water quality monitoring systems daecheong lake the study area was created by a dam constructed in the geum river of south korea the surface area and storage capacity of the lake are 72 8 km2 and 1 5 109 m3 respectively daecheong lake has supplied 1 6 billion m3 year of domestic industrial and agricultural water in the vicinity and provided 2 4 108 kw year of electricity via hydropower generators this study focused on a 46 5 km section of the lake between janggye bridge wq1 and daecheong dam wq4 which are the major inflow and outflow locations of the lake respectively fig 1 the largest tributary in the lake is seohwa cheon tr1 which includes the discharge of a municipal wastewater treatment plant wwtp1 for urban areas in the vicinity in the study area two automatic monitoring stations aqs five mainstream stations wqs and four tributary stations trs are operated by the korean government as shown in fig 1 regular monitoring systems in wqs and trs measure up to 52 water quality variables including toxic materials for samples on a monthly or weekly basis samples are taken and analyzed for the surface middle and bottom layers of a deep lake in korea and only surface layer samples are analyzed for tributaries in contrast the automatic water quality monitoring station measures 7 8 water quality variables daily using sensor probes and in field automatic analysis devices for samples collected from the surface layer in this study 13 and 8 variables 7 for aq2 were collected from regular monitoring systems and automatic monitoring systems respectively as shown in table 1 wq1 and tr1 of the study area have independent automatic water quality monitoring systems aq1 and aq2 respectively in the vicinity of each location water quality trends of automatic and regular monitoring systems in the vicinity were similar to each other however the two stations sometimes showed different patterns especially for chl a after 2018 or do in 2019 as shown in fig 2 left in seohwa cheon the largest tributary of the study area the trends of temperature temp do and total phosphorus tp between tr1 and aq2 were similar however there were large differences in total organic carbon toc and total nitrogen tn as shown in fig 2 right this seemed to be caused by the effluent of wwtp1 entering between tr1 and aq2 2 2 hydrodynamic and water quality model 2 2 1 numerical model environmental fluid dynamics code efdc the efdc a three dimensional hydrodynamic and water quality model hamrick 1992 was used to simulate the water quality of daecheong lake the efdc includes various modules such as hydrodynamics temperature salinity dye water quality sediment transport and toxic this model can consider the wet and dry conditions of a domain owing to the fluctuation of the water level and can simulate hydraulic structures such as dams weirs orifices and sluice gates to reflect stratification due to water temperature or salinity in a simulation the efdc supports the sigma zed sgz coordinate craig et al 2014 a vertical layering approach sgz reduces the horizontal pressure gradient associated with the standard sigma stretch grid method mellor et al 1994 thus this method is suitable for the current study site with steep varying bathymetry based on these advantages the efdc can be a useful tool in various water systems such as rivers lakes reservoirs coasts and oceans the water quality module of the efdc park et al 1995 can simulate 22 water quality variables such as algae carbon nitrogen phosphorus silica and do supplemental fig 1 hereafter s figure 2 2 2 development of grid system for efdc daecheong lake is the third largest artificial lake in korea and has complicated winding shapes in the 46 5 km long study site the maximum depth is approximately 50 m near the dam wq4 and the minimum depth at wq1 is approximately 20 m to reflect the complex topography and curvature of the river 3 828 horizontal grids were carefully determined using the curvilinear orthogonal coordinate method the number of vertical grids varied between 3 and 30 using the sgz coordinate system and the total number of grids for this study was 55 588 as shown in s fig 2 the representativeness of the developed grid system was evaluated by the courant friedrichs lewy condition courant et al 1928 and orthogonal deviation od in the case of od the closer to 0 the squarer the grid is formed the od was distributed from 53 8 to 37 9 and the average od was estimated to be 3 9 the courant number should be set to 1 0 to minimize numerical error in this study this condition was satisfied by a dynamic time step method that varied depending on the flow condition 2 3 estimation and generation of time series for water quality prediction in the entire domain inflows considered in the study site occur through four tributaries tr and one wastewater treatment plant wwtp2 and outflows occur through three water intake stations and the discharge of daecheong dam boundary conditions were developed for river inflows including flow rates water temperature and water quality concentrations sixteen water quality variables including organic material nutrients and algal concentrations were simulated in this study all the information for boundary conditions were obtained from the national database systems of the republic of korea daily flow wamis go kr water intake waternow go kr wwtp discharge hasudoinfo or kr hourly meteorological data data kma go kr and water quality data including water temperature wq and tr water nier go kr aq koreawqi go kr because the depth of the inlet point wq1 of the study area is 20 m it was necessary to provide input data for different vertical layers the surface middle and bottom layers finally to prevent an incorrect simulation by the input data it was verified that there were no significant errors or extremely high values among the field data for all boundary conditions 2 3 1 temporal interpolation of water quality data water quality data from various sources may not have the same monitoring intervals in this section the data with monthly or weekly intervals for wq1 and tr1 tr4 were interpolated to fit daily time series inputs for the efdc for longer monitoring intervals of the mainstream and tributaries the data were interpolated using the following methods 1 step 2 linear and 3 piecewise cubic hermite interpolating polynomial pchip fritsch and carlson 1980 the stepwise interpolated value at a query point can be the value at the previous next or nearest grid point assuming that the value of the next time is unknown the previous step interpolation is suitable linear interpolation is simple to use and is widely used with a straight line between the previous and next time values the pchip method interpolates values based on a shape preserving piecewise cubic interpolation of the values at neighboring grid points this method displays less unrealistic overshoot and undershoot than the cubic spline method rabbath and corriveau 2019 2 3 2 daily time series generation using ann models in this study the ann method was applied to complement daily water quality information by generating unmonitored data this method was also applied to complement data for the surface middle and bottom layers in the vertical direction as shown in table 1 automatic stations monitor a limited number of water quality variables daily on the other hand regular monitoring stations wq and tr measure 13 variables with longer monitoring intervals given that aq1 and aq2 are near wq1 and tr1 respectively it is assumed that complex relationships among water quality variables can be learned and generate unmonitored daily and vertical boundary condition data using anns fig 3 shows the conceptual design of the learning process using an ann in this study in learning step1 the monthly field data of the surface layer at wq1 were used for learning using the learned model and the daily field data of aq1 unmonitored data of aq1 dtn nh3 no3 dtp and po4 were generated assuming the same relative relationships among water quality variables the same process was performed for tr1 and aq2 in learning step2 the field data of the three layers at wq1 were used for learning to generate daily data of the middle and bottom layers learning step2 used the learned model of this step daily field data of aq1 and generated data of learning step1 in wq1 and tr1 the field data between april 2004 and july 2020 were used as input and target variables in all learning processes including training and verification further 70 of all data were selected randomly for training and 30 of all data were used for verification the daily field data of aq1 and aq2 between january 2016 and july 2020 were used as inputs for the learned models to generate daily data of unmonitored variables in this study a multilayer perceptron mlp method minsky and papert 1969 was used as an ann method mlp method is a class of feedforward architecture and is composed of an input layer either a single layer or multiple hidden layers and an output layer s fig 3 each layer can have numerous nodes the activation function of the hidden and output layers was the hyperbolic tangent sigmoid transfer function bayesian regularization backpropagation foresee and hagan 1997 mackay 1992 was used as the backpropagation training algorithm benvenuto and piazza 1992 the learning rate and epoch were set to 0 01 and 5 000 respectively the performance during learning was calculated using the mean squared error mse which represents the average squared difference between the target and output values table 2 shows the mlp composition used in this study variables that were not measured in the aqs were selected as targets table 1 the numbers of hidden layers and nodes of each hidden layer were mainly determined by manual search although various optimization methodologies such as grid search montgomery 2017 random search bergstra and bengio 2012 and bayesian optimization brochu et al 2010 mockus et al 1978 can be used to find the parameters of the mlp method the manual search in this study allowed the simultaneous evaluation of the learning performance of mlp method and accuracy of generated time series by the learned mlp models for instance during the learning process using optimization methods some learning performances were higher than the value presented in this study however the accuracies of the generated time series were often lower in this case some outliers in field observations were excluded by judgment however if a hidden layer has too many layers or nodes it may result in an overfitting or non progress state to prevent these problems the methodologies of previous studies were also referenced 1 the number of layers or nodes used in similar research areas was referred to tomić et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 and 2 a decision method using the number of inputs and training samples was implemented tian et al 2017 in addition during learning if the mse decrease slope rapidly increased after the mse converged to a certain value this state was deemed overfitted and the corresponding learned model was excluded 2 4 efdc calibration and development of simulation scenarios the efdc model was calibrated using input data prepared by the linear interpolation method the water quality parameters for calibration were initially selected from previous research reports bae and seo 2018 bae and seo 2021 bowie et al 1985 kim et al 2021 kim et al 2017 shin et al 2008 and further adjusted to improve the calibration accuracy table 3 water quality calibrations were performed at the surface middle and bottom layers of four different water quality monitoring stations wq2 wq5 for temp tn tp toc chl a nh3 no3 po4 and do then efdc simulations with other interpolations and the mlp model were also performed with the calibrated parameters each efdc simulation is named as follows 1 step efdc 2 linear efdc 3 pchip efdc and 4 mlp efdc 2 5 evaluation of model performance to evaluate the performance of the efdc simulation results using interpolations and the mlp method the root mean squared error rmse and index of agreement ia willmott 1981 were used rmse is the square root of the mse and is representative of the size of a typical error ia represents the ratio between the mse and potential error willmott 1984 ia reflects the degree to which the observed variate is accurately estimated by the simulated variate and is a standardized measure to make cross comparisons of its magnitudes for a variety of models regardless of units ia detects additive and proportional differences in the observed and simulated means and variances willmott 1981 in addition ia can be used as a substitute for the coefficient of determination legates and mccabe jr 1999 the detailed formula for each index is as follows rmse i 1 n s i o i 2 n ia 1 i 1 n o i s i 2 i 1 n s i o avg o i o avg 2 where n is the number of observations s is the simulated value o is the observed value and oavg is the average of the observed values the range of the rmse is from 0 the ideal value to ia which is calculated from 0 to 1 becomes 1 when the simulation is perfect 3 results and discussion 3 1 water quality calibration using efdc with interpolated time series 3 1 1 interpolation results fig 4 compares the water quality boundary conditions prepared by step linear and pchip interpolations at the major inflow location wq1 the results of the linear and pchip interpolations were similar because step interpolation uses a constant value between the measured points relatively large differences were observed compared to other interpolation methods the pchip showed smoother trend lines than the other interpolation methods however if extreme values such as high or zero concentrations are included among the grid points the interpolated value can be overestimated or underestimated e g chl a or po4 in fig 4 these uncertainties are difficult to analyze without reference values lepot et al 2017 musial et al 2011 stated that a trend and noise should be distinguished for interpolation applications however because water quality dynamics are affected by internal processes and external influences such as rainfall and environmental pollution events it is not possible to distinguish between a trend and noise hirsch et al 2015 therefore all data including peak values were be included in the analysis though this may lead to misunderstanding 3 1 2 efdc calibration results efdc model calibration was performed using linear interpolated input data against field data from january 2019 to july 2020 water level calibration was performed at daecheong dam wq4 the simulated water level showed good agreement with field observation average rmse and ia of water level calibration for field observations were 0 03 el m and 0 99 respectively as shown in s fig 4 the results of water quality and temperature simulations using different boundary conditions for the four locations are shown in figs 5 7 for the surface middle and bottom layers respectively the overall calibration accuracy is summarized in table 4 and the detailed results for the surface middle and bottom layers are summarized in supplementary table 1 hereafter s table 1 s table 2 and s table 3 respectively in the study area field samples for water quality analysis were taken from the surface middle and bottom layers though efdc results were extracted for the corresponding grids for model calibrations there can be differences in vertical locations as the water level in the lake continuously varies which may affect errors in the subsequent analysis the overall average ia of the temperature for linear efdc was 0 89 indicating a successful calibration for the variable while the maximum ia was 0 93 in the middle layer of wq4 hereafter wq4 m as shown in s table 2 and the minimum ia was 0 44 at wq4 b as shown in s table 3 although the accuracy at wq4 b was the poorest according to ia the rmse value was 1 69 c which was significantly lower than the maximum rmse 5 85 c at wq3 m in general temperature simulations tend to overestimate field measurements especially in the early 2020 s at almost all the surface and middle layers in contrast the predicted temperature at wq4 b the deepest location in the study area reflected low observations with good agreement this result indicates that the heat exchange with the sediment layer was significant and must be considered seriously because the surface water temperature is affected by surface heat exchange with the atmosphere and vertical mixing edinger et al 1968 the overestimation in this study was likely due to limited field atmospheric information or underestimated vertical mixing of the model seo et al 2010 the average ias of all water quality variables were ranged from 0 28 to 0 84 as shown in table 4 the maximum ia of do was 0 93 at wq2 b rmse 2 19 mg l s table 3 whereas the minimum ia of chl a was 0 07 at wq5 s rmse 1 69 mg m3 s table 1 although the simulated values of water quality did not sensitively respond to the observed peak values they followed the average trend of field observations figs 5 7 the result of nh3 was overestimated but the degree of concentration was significantly lower than that of tn on the other hand the toc results were underestimated and the extent of error increased in the downstream direction wq2 s to wq5 s rmse 0 63 to 0 94 mg l ia 0 44 to 0 23 respectively although the study area is a large lake with several small tributaries only four streams were considered as inputs in the model because of limited available data insufficient information on boundary conditions from small tributaries around the lake could be a major cause of error in the underestimation of toc in this study in addition errors can be caused by the difference in vertical locations between field monitoring and model calculation as discussed above moreover during rainfall events input loading can increase rapidly however sporadic field observations through regular sampling may not reflect this situation bartram and ballance 1996 as shown in figs 5 7 the calibration accuracy among the efdc results with different interpolation methods was similar at all locations however for step efdc the prediction accuracy of the water quality calibration was poorer than that of the linear efdc according to table 4 and s table 4 the percentage differences of the average rmse and ia for step efdc were 0 9 7 0 and 14 6 0 9 relative to linear efdc respectively for pchip efdc the percentage differences of average rmse and ia for water quality variables were 1 5 3 3 and 0 5 1 5 relative to linear efdc respectively except tn pchip efdc showed slightly improved tn predictions rmse 3 1 and ia 4 7 consequently the difference in the simulation results between the linear efdc and pchip efdc was insignificant however the efdc model simulation using linear or pchip interpolations was more accurate than when using the step interpolation method for boundary conditions mlp efdc cases were included in these figures to save spaces and will be discussed in the 3 2 3 section 3 2 water quality simulation using efdc with daily time series generated by mlp models 3 2 1 model learning using mlp method and regular monitoring data as shown in table 2 the relationships among water quality variables in regular monitoring data of wq1 and tr1 were learned by the mlp method as a part of the preparation to generate daily data table 5 shows the accuracy of learned results by the mlp method for variables that were not monitored in automatic monitoring systems against field measurement of regular monitoring systems the overall ia varied from 0 88 to 1 00 indicating that the learning using the mlp method was successful as shown in table 5 chl a at wq1 b showed the poorest ia of learning performance and tn at wq1 b showed the best ia 3 2 2 generation of daily time series using mlp models after successful learning using monthly data in table 5 daily data were generated in this process daily data of automatic monitoring systems aq1 and aq2 from january 2016 to july 2020 were used as input for the developed mlp models however since the learned mlp model is not based on the law of mass conservation the generated results of the mlp models can become negative during mathematical operations in this study if the generated value of the mlp model was negative it was regarded as zero the proportion of predicted negative values was approximately 4 9 which was 2 703 out of 55 176 1 672 days and 33 variables the accuracy of generated daily data was evaluated by comparing data sets corresponding to the same date with available field measurements as shown in table 6 the average ia for all variables at all locations was 0 68 the average ias for the surface middle and bottom layers at wq1 were 0 71 0 74 and 0 71 respectively while it was 0 47 for tr1 in general wq1 m showed the best performance and tr1 showed the poorest agreement the final generated daily time series using the mlp models are shown in fig 8 along with field measurements at wq1 and tr1 the results of the mlp models showed several characteristic behaviors 1 the prediction results showed large daily fluctuations especially for the no3 and chl a at tr1 this phenomenon reflects the daily variability of field data including external hydrological effects such as wash off due to rainfall and effluent from wwtps in the watershed 2 in some periods however the prediction did not reflect high or peak concentrations properly for example the mlp model underestimated the dtn and tn of all layers and the dtp of the surface layer for some period in addition some peak concentrations of dtp and po4 in tr1 were not reflected accurately 3 chl a concentrations were overestimated for most of the period the possible causes of the errors can be explained as follows in the learning step the number of input data wq1 or tr1 required for learning may be insufficient therefore few outliers may have significantly influenced the overall performance of the learning process another reason seems to be the difference in sampling location and time for the regular and automatic monitoring systems even if the data were measured on the same day the exact sampling time may be different this condition can show differences in concentrations over time even with the same variables e g phytoplankton and do bartram and ballance 1996 thomann and mueller 1987 in addition while wq1 takes samples in the middle of the river the sampling point of aq1 is located at the riverside of 700 m downstream of wq1 in the case of chl a there were significant differences between aq1 and wq1 as shown in fig 2 left in general phytoplankton proliferates in stable water bodies reynolds 2006 the flow velocity at the center of a river can be higher than that of a riverside area which may proliferate chl a concentrations more at aq1 than at wq1 in the case of seohwa cheon there is a continuous discharge of the effluent of wwtp1 between tr1 and aq2 this fact may significantly affect accuracy in generating daily data for the major tributary of the study area 3 2 3 simulation results of efdc with daily time series generated by mlp models the efdc simulation results with daily time series generated by the mlp model were compared to step efdc linear efdc and pchip efdc at 12 locations in daecheong lake overall mlp efdc showed a clear improvement over the simulation results with the interpolation methods as shown in figs 5 7 the average ia values for all variables of the efdc simulations with boundary conditions using the step linear pchip and mlp boundary conditions were 0 49 0 52 0 53 and 0 55 respectively table 4 the maximum increase in the average ia was 14 4 for tp when mlp efdc was compared to linear efdc s table 4 fig 9 compares the ia values for the nine variables of linear efdc and mlp efdc for different vertical layers of four different locations namely wq2 wq5 fig 9 a shows the absolute ia values and fig 9 b shows the relative ia values of mlp efdc over linear efdc most of the ia values of mlp efdc in fig 9 a were greater than those of linear efdc especially at the surface and bottom layers wq2 showed a distinct improvement in the tn and tp predictions this result indicates that the reliability of the mlp model is higher than that of the interpolation result in other words it indirectly proves that it is reasonable to have moderate or large daily fluctuations rather than stable changes in water quality concentrations however mlp efdc showed lower accuracy for temp and do table 4 in addition mlp efdc showed the greatest error in chl a prediction especially at wq2 s and wq3 s as shown in figs 5 7 chl a at wq2 and wq3 were clearly overestimated and this was distinct for mlp efdc the overestimation of chl a in wq2 was due to the high chl a values of aq1 which were used as input data in the mlp model furthermore because do is affected by water temperature and photosynthesis of phytoplankton chapra 2008 the error of do prediction could result from lower accuracy for temp and chl a the accuracy improvement of mlp efdc from linear efdc was pronounced in upstream areas and was relatively smaller in the downstream direction the average improvement percentages in wq2 and wq3 were 25 4 and 24 5 respectively whereas it was 15 4 and 14 7 in wq4 and wq5 respectively the mlp models were learned at the headwater location wq1 and the largest tributary tr1 where automatic monitoring data were available on the other hand the time series of the remaining boundary conditions was the same owing to data limitations therefore the influence of the boundary conditions supplemented by the mlp model decreased downstream in addition toc concentrations at wq4 and wq5 were still significantly underestimated and this did not improve significantly with mlp efdc these results indicate that the mlp method or any ann method cannot cover all regions and improve boundary conditions unless appropriate learning data are available 4 conclusion the aim of this study was to improve the accuracy of the numerical model efdc in the calibration of water quality in daecheong lake by improving boundary conditions using the mlp method an ann method two different data sets from the regular monitoring system and the automatic monitoring system which have different monitoring intervals and different numbers of water quality variables were used to learn water quality interactions using the mlp method daily water quality data were generated for the headwater and major tributary of the study site using successfully learned mlp models in addition the water quality variables of the middle and bottom layers were generated in this process for the headwater the mlp model generated large fluctuations in daily data by considering external influences such as rainfall and environmental pollution events compared to interpolation methods mlp efdc showed the most accurate performance compared to the efdc simulations using the interpolated input the average ia of mlp efdc for all variables was 0 55 which was a 4 2 increase compared to that of linear efdc the maximum increase in the average ia was 14 4 for tp however the chl a prediction accuracy of mlp efdc at wq2 s decreased significantly due to the high chl a data of the automatic monitoring system from the results of this study future research should consider not only a temporal scale but also a spatial scale for water quality this study suggests that the ann technique can be applied to generate daily time series for boundary conditions of the numerical model and can improve the prediction accuracy of the water quality of a large lake the performance of mlp efdc would be further improved as more field data becomes available in the future in addition this study can be applied to verify performance levels and develop improvement plans for either regular or automatic monitoring systems if it is also possible to extend the spatiotemporal scale of modeling by linking with watershed models or climate change scenarios various ann techniques can be applied to improve field measurement and

4262,water inrush is a major hidden danger that decreases coal mining safety thus preferential flowpaths of water inrush in mining areas must be investigated to prevent water disasters and guide grouting engineering in this study pumping and observation data of five boreholes were input into a 2d groundwater flow model established using vsaft2 software for inversion to obtain the heterogeneous distribution information of the site then the wide field electromagnetic method was used to obtain the distribution of resistivity values at different depths in the local area finally we compared and analyzed the relevant geological information of the site such as the fault zones and karst collapse columns obtained using the above two methods to determine the preferential flowpaths of water the results show that 1 the hydraulic conductivity distribution estimated by hydraulic tomography is consistent with the location distribution of high resistivity and low resistivity areas identified by the wide field electromagnetic method 2 the high hydraulic conductivity zones obtained by hydraulic tomography are consistent with the known distribution of geological fault zones which is important because water inrush accidents often occur in areas where fault zones exist and 3 based on the comprehensive analysis of the above results a preferential flowpaths of water inrush was identified the flowpaths starts from the f35 fault zone passes through kcc2 converges with the water from the middle part of fault zones f11 and f12 and finally supplies dongfeng well d1 this paper compares ht results to resistivity estimates from independently conducted geophysical surveys the identification of the groundwater flow pathway through ht can help to minimize future water in rush accidents keywords hydraulic tomography preferential flowpaths wide field electromagnetic method geological information 1 introduction coal mining water inrush events have occurred in many regions of the world bogardi et al 1980 bukowski et al 2011 dumpleton et al 2001 wu et al 2017 there are many events occurred in aquifers near coal seams zhang et al 2004 the main cause of this phenomenon is the connection between the working area and the lower aquifer which easily results in groundwater influx xu et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 as the largest producer and consumer of coal worldwide china is also one of the countries most affected by water inrush from coal mines lu et al 2017 yin et al 2018 water inrush disasters represent an important factor influencing the safe production of coal mines in china for instance five water inrush accidents occurred during the construction of the dongfeng borehole in xieqiao anhui province with a stable water volume was 420 m3 h the huainan mining group has carried out a series of grouting project although none of the measures have achieved good results due to the implicit water inrush conditions after grouting the dongfeng borehole stable volumetric flow rate was still 344 5 m3 h therefore it is of great significance to determine the preferential flowpaths of water inrush in coal mines to guide grouting engineering and ensure mining safety the key to detecting the preferential flowpaths of groundwater in a mining area is information about the spatial distribution of the hydraulic properties of the aquifer in such areas most aquifers in coal mining areas are highly heterogeneous moreover because of the complexity of fracture systems zou et al 2017 and the non darcy phenomenon of water flow qian et al 2011 wang et al 2015 wang et al 2017 wen et al 2013 characterizing the heterogeneity of aquifers at different locations has always been a challenging issue illman et al 2005 scanlon et al 2003 in traditional studies martínez pagán et al 2013 detected the water bearing structures of mined aquifers via electrical resistivity tomography ert li et al 2015 used the dc resistivity method to study underground water bearing structures to prevent water inrush and pointed out that the key to analyzing the preferential flowpaths of water inrush is to determine the locations of adverse geological bodies in coal mines such as faults karst caves karst collapse columns kccs and goafs however all aforementioned geophysical prospecting methods have high operating costs thus studies have applied low budget numerical simulations for relevant research for instance jones et al 2005 connected the monte carlo stochastic approach with modflow to achieve stochastic simulations estimate the bulk hydraulic conductivity and assess the heterogeneity of the field site yao et al 2012 utilized numerical tools rfpa2d and comsol to simulate the fracture evolution and seepage rule in coal seam mining and sun et al 2015 assessed the flow field of karst water by modflow and analyzed the potential water inrush risk mohammadi et al 2018 simulate water flow and solute transport at a karst aquifer by coupling of cfpv2 and ostrich although these traditional numerical simulation methods satisfy the requirement of low cost they lack accuracy in identifying fractured channels therefore a new method that is both low cost and accurate is needed recently yeh and liu 2000 developed a new method i e hydraulic tomography ht to characterize the heterogeneity of aquifers with high precision this method mainly conducts multiple sets of pumping experiments or water injection experiments to collect water level fluctuation data in the aquifer and then analyzes the data obtained by a highly parameterized inverse model to estimate the detailed spatial distribution of hydraulic parameters in the aquifer daranond et al 2020 since this method was proposed it has been continuously optimized over the last 20 years sun et al 2013 and zhu and yeh 2005 proposed a data acquisition strategy by analyzing redundant and nonredundant information in aquifer parameters from different perspectives which decreased the computational complexity of ht mao et al 2013a optimized the previous algorithm and extended the simultaneous successive linear estimator simsle program on variable saturation unconfined aquifers to further expand the application of ht mao et al 2013b also analyzed the necessary conditions for establishing the inversion model to ensure the existence and uniqueness of the solution which reduces the uncertainty of the inversion model results and improves the inversion accuracy due to the continuous improvement and maturity of ht its application for diverse aspects such as synthetic aquifers hao et al 2008 laboratory aquifers liu et al 2002 sharmeen et al 2012 zhao et al 2015 and field aquifers bohling et al 2007 berg et al 2011 yeh et al 2009 has quickly spread and achieved desirable results in particular ht shows good rationality and applicability in identifying the heterogeneity of some large scales in fractured rocks for example illman et al 2009 described the large scale heterogeneity in a construction site of 1 km2 by using two cross hole pumping tests as a stimulus source mao et al 2018 utilized drainage events in the mining area as a stimulus source to explore the distribution of hydraulic conductivity in the region of 10 km2 liu et al 2020 investigated the potential of ht to identify boundary conditions in groundwater basins to the best of our knowledge previous studies have not specifically researched the potential of ht in identifying the preferential flowpaths of water flow nonetheless to characterize the heterogeneity of aquifers especially in the analysis of the preferential flowpaths of coal mine water inrush if only the ht method is used then the result is not sufficiently accurate as mentioned by berg et al 2011 ht results should be compared with other heterogeneous characterization and modeling methods based on field data to further improve the accuracy of site heterogeneity characterization yeh et al 2002 proposed a stochastic information fusion technology that assimilated information from both electrical resistivity tomography and ht to characterize the heterogeneity of the vadose zone soueid ahmed et al 2015 combined ht and image information obtained from seismic and ground penetrating radar sections to improve the identification accuracy of field heterogeneity zhao and illman 2017 applied a prior geologic information to improve ht result but the large mining area and complex underground space in coal mining areas accurately identifying the preferential flowpaths of water inrush in coal mines has always been a challenge therefore ht alone cannot be used as a method to solve this problem and a comprehensive analysis of the results of ht and other technical approaches should be performed to improve the accuracy of recognition results ht can determine only the distribution of high hydraulic conductivity areas and low hydraulic conductivity areas of the field nevertheless it is not accurate to define the preferential flowpaths only by the high or low hydraulic conductivity if other methods can be included to verify the ht result it will make the ht result more reasonable electromagnetic method is also widely used for aquifer characterization gondwe et al 2012 determine groundwater flow in karst aquifers by airborne electromagnetic meyer et al 2019 used electromagnetic investigation to saltwater intrusion path in a regional aquifer rejiba et al 2018 applied the dipolar source electromagnetic induction to characterizing the paleochannel john et al 2020 investigated the diverse hydrogeology underlying rivers by transient electromagnetic methodology the wide field electromagnetic method is a new frequency domain electromagnetic technology he 2010 which has been used in coal mine hydrological hazards identification he 2018 the essence of the wfem is used the distribution of resistivity to infer the formation information in underground but this method has more accurate and effective than the traditional method yuan et al 2017 therefore we can use this feature to identify the distribution of high and low resistivity areas of a site by a wide field electromagnetic method to further verify the preferential flow paths obtained by ht to the best of our knowledge it is the first time that compare the results of hydraulic tomography and wide field electromagnetic method to analysis the preferential flowpaths in coal area the objective of this paper is to 1 explore the distribution of heterogeneity in the study area by comparing the results of ht and wide field electromagnetic methods 2 analyze the area where water inrush may occur by comparing relevant geological information such as fault zones and karst collapse columns with the ht results and 3 determine the preferential flowpaths of coal mine water inrush in the study area by analyzing the results of the abovementioned multimethods 2 material and methodology 2 1 site location description the xieqiao coal mine is located 20 km away from northeastern yinshang county anhui province china fig 1 with a rough total area of 50 km2 operations began in april 1997 and the mine has an annual capacity of approximately 9 million tons the overall scope of the study area is approximately 16 km2 the area mainly contains five normal faults shown as f10 f11 f12 f34 and f35 in fig 1 in addition the two karst collapse columns kcc1 and kcc2 developed in the southeastern part of the study area 2 2 site geology background the main geologic stratum in the study area include quaternary permian carboniferous ordovician cambrian formation from top to bottom in general the formation shows an approximately east west strike and incline slightly to the south with an angle of 10 15 to further explore the development of each aquifer in the study area exploration boreholes are set up in the location shown as the two blue dotted section lines 1 and 2 in fig 1 the stratigraphic section in fig 2 shows that the permian formation has an average thickness of nearly 390 m and the carboniferous formation has an average thickness of nearly 200 m moreover the average thickness of the ordovician formation withprobably 100 m is the research target of this study an obvious developed karst collapse column is shown in the profile of 2 according to the results of 3 d seismic technique exploration zuo et al 2009 the lengths of kcc1 and kcc2 in the permian coal measures layer coal seam 1 are 337 m and 1117 m and the widths are 387 m and 159 m respectively both kccs pass through the permian carboniferous and ordovician systems and their diameters increase from top to bottom in the area where the karst collapse column exists obvious dislocations and subsidence are observed and represent interconnections between the formations of different eras 2 3 description of boreholes at the site the boreholes selected in this study are mainly 7 boreholes as shown in fig 1 pumping tests were carried out in 5 boreholes xlz2 xlz3 xlz4 xlz5 xlz6 while the rest 2 boreholes xlz1 and xlz7 only used as observation boreholes during pumping tests of xlz3 and xlz5 to obtain as much heterogeneous information about the whole study area as possible the drilling positions are distributed on the boundary of the study area in addition considering that ordovician formation may have the main recharge aquifers for water inrush all seven boreholes were drilled into the ordovician formation the depth of each pumping well and the information of each formation are shown in table 1 which indicates that all boreholes above the ordovician formation has been cased and the ordovician stratum is open 3 methodology 3 1 hydraulic tomography 3 1 1 groundwater flow model hydraulic tomography is a new inversion method developed in recent years to characterize the heterogeneity of aquifers yeh and liu 2000 this study mainly uses vsaft2 variably saturated flow and transport 2 d software to develop a heterogeneous saturated aquifer 2 d model for simulating groundwater flow models in heterogeneous media the software can be downloaded from the website of professor yeh http tian hwr arizona edu downloads the main governing equations of the model are displayed as follows 1 t x h q x p s s x h t the corresponding boundary conditions and initial conditions are as follows 2 h γ 1 h 1 t x h n γ 2 q h t 0 h 0 where h is the total head l x is the spatial coordinate l q xp is the pumping rate l3 t l2 at xp t x is the saturated hydraulic conductivity l2 t ss x is the specific storage l 1 h1 is the prescribed total boundary dirichlet boundary q is the prescribed flux boundary neumann boundary γ 2 n is the unit vector orthogonal to γ 1 and γ 2 and h0 represents the initial total head 3 1 2 inverse modeling approach we briefly describe the simsle algorithm used by the model the algorithm is a parameter estimation method based on geostatistics yeh and liu 2000 the logarithm of the hydraulic conductivity k and the specific storage ss is treated as a random spatial variable 3 h x i h h x i 4 ln k x i k f k x i 5 ln s x i s f k x i the parameter f has a nonlinear relationship with the head h of the observation well taking the hydraulic conductivity as an example and using the cokriging method xiang et al 2009 the initial estimation results are as follows 6 f 1 x 0 i 1 n f λ 0 i f x i k 1 n p j 1 n h k i 1 n t k j μ 0 k j l h k x j t l h e k x j t l where h k and s are the mean values of the observation head hydraulic conductivity and water specific storage respectively h x i is the value of the observation head f 1 x 0 is the value of k or s estimated for the first time by the cokriging algorithm at location x 0 k is the times of pumping test h k x j t l is the observation head at time tl h e k x j t l is the estimated head at time tl np is the total number of pumping tests nh k is the number of observation wells nt k j is the total water head of the j th observation well λ 0 i is the weight of the parameter value f to the parameter estimated value at x0 and μ 0 k j l is the weighting coefficient for observation head h k x j t l to the parameter estimated value the result of the first parameter estimation is brought into the groundwater flow model for the next iteration eq 1 shows that there is a nonlinear relationship between the observation head value and k or s the cokriging algorithm is a linear estimation algorithm and requires multiple iterations to satisfy the nonlinear relationship its iterative formula is as follows 7 f r 1 x 0 f r x 0 k 1 n p j 1 n h k i 1 n t k j ω 0 k j l r h k x j t l h r k x j t l where ω 0 k j l r is the weighting coefficient for the parameter estimate at location x0 of the difference between the observation head value and estimated head value and r is the iteration index the above calculation process will continue until the specified accuracy is achieved the specified accuracy refers to reaching the maximum iteration step size or the difference between the observation head value and estimated head value is less than the given critical value and the change of the parameter is less than the given critical value during the iteration process to verify the estimates from simsle we apply the mean absolute error l1 the mean square error l2 and the coefficient of determination r2 to evaluate the fitting effect of the estimated head drawdown value and the observed head drawdown value it is defined as follows 8 l 1 1 n i 1 n h 1 h 2 9 l 2 1 n i 1 n h 1 h 2 2 10 r 2 1 n i 1 n h 1 h 1 h 2 h 2 1 n i 1 n h 1 h 1 2 1 n i 1 n h 2 h 2 2 where n represents the total amount of input observation data i represents the specified number of input data h1 and h2 represent the simulation value and the observed value respectively and h 1 and h 2 represent the mean value of the simulation value and the observed value respectively if the resulting l1 is small then the average value of the estimated field is close to the average value of the observation field if the resulting l2 is small then the total deviation between the estimated value and the observed value is small and if the resulting r2 is larger then the estimated value and the observed value are closer 3 1 3 pumping test description and drawdown data selection the ordovician limestone aquifer is the target of this pumping test layer five pumping wells were selected namely xlz2 xlz3 xlz4 xlz5 and xlz6 and the pumping rate was from 58 to 74 m3 h are shown in table 1 we selected a total of 165 points of head drawdown data 11 groups of observation data with each group consisting of 15 pieces of head drawdown data while the sampling frequency was controlled once every 2 h all of 165 data were used for inverse modeling the specific changes in the water level are shown in fig 3 it shows that collected the drawdown data in three observation wells during a single pumping test at xlz2 and remaining eight sets of drawdown data during four times pumping test from xlz3 to xlz6 as shown in fig 3 during the pumping test of xlz5 large fluctuations were observed in observation well xlz3 which is primarily because the other aquifer near the xlz3 borehole was opened up and a large amount of water supply cause the rise of the water level for a short period of time nonetheless the continuous pumping ultimately led to a downward trend in the water level of xlz3 3 1 4 numerical model parameter setup we established a heterogeneous saturated aquifer 2 d model of 10 000 12 000 m in this paper and divided the aquifer into 100 120 cells sun et al 2013 studied the relationship between drawdown and aquifer characteristics and suggested using constant head boundaries for unknown boundaries during ht analysis therefore all the sides of the 2 d model are set as a constant head boundary of 100 m and the initial head value of the entire simulation field is also set to 100 m in this paper the domain size is relatively large therefore 4000 m is set as the correlation scales of x and y in this paper according to previous scholars studies when sufficient data are available the impact of the uncertainty of the correlation scale on the results of hydraulic tomography is basically negligible mao et al 2018 illman et al 2009 the variance of lnk and lnss is set as 2 and the mean value of the initial k was set as 0 1 m h according to the actual measured values of several boreholes ss is based on the empirical value of the water storage coefficient in the karst area and has an initial mean value of 0 005 m 1 3 2 wide field electromagnetic method the wide field electromagnetic method is a new method based on controlled source audio magnetotellurics csamt he 2010 he 2018 the underground resistivity information is mainly contained in the electric field component ex this method directly measures the electric field component ex to achieve large depth and high precision exploration of underground resistivity conditions the expression of ex as follows 11 e x i d l ρ 2 π r 3 1 3 sin 2 ϕ e i k r 1 i k r where i is the current value dl represent the electric dipole source length i is the imaginary symbol and the ϕ is the angle between the vector diameter from transmitter to receiver and the electric dipole r and k represent the distance between transmitter to receiver and the wave number respectively ρ is the resistivity value ex can be obtained by the estimate electric potential difference between electrodes m and n the expression of electric potential difference δ v mn as follows 12 δ v mn e x m n i d l ρ 2 π r 3 f e e x i k r m n where f e e x i k r 1 3 sin 2 ϕ e i k r 1 i k r use the geometrical coefficient k e e x which represent the wide field electromagnetic method configuration coefficient just depend on the electrode geometry 13 k e e x 2 π r 3 dl m n the wide field apparent resistivity formula can be obtained it is defined as follows 14 ρ a k e e x δ v mn i 1 f e e x i k r the detection range is shown by the red dotted line in fig 1 and fig 4 shows that the specific field layout of survey line in this study the area surveyed by the wide field electromagnetic method is 3 4 km2 and 31 prospecting lines have been laid out with a total 33 kilometer exploration distance according to the electrical characteristics of various rock ores the working frequency was selected from 0 016 hz to 8192 hz and the emission current was about 100 a the transmission cable was between 6 km and 9 km which contains 39 emission frequencies and the exploration depth was estimated to be 0 1 3 0 km 4 results 4 1 hydraulic tomography inversion results fig 5 and fig 6 show the inversion results of hydraulic conductivity k and specific storage ss after successively superposing the head information the red borehole is the water inrush point and the black boreholes are the pumping wells and observation wells of this research fig 5 a and 6 a show the joint inversion results of boreholes xlz2 and xlz3 fig 5 b and 6 b show the results added to the head drawdown data of xlz3 and xlz5 during the pumping process of the xlz4 borehole into the above inversion fig 5 c and 6 c added the head drawdown data of xlz3 and xlz7 during the pumping period of the xlz5 borehole and fig 5 d and 6 d are based on the previous inversion result and add the head drawdown data of xlz3 and xlz4 during the pumping of xlz6 all the above results only reflect part of the inversion situation in the study area because the values of the estimated parameters of the rest of the area are basically consistent with the initial values the inversion results of fig 5 and fig 6 show that in the beginning the heterogeneous information of the site gradually increases with the continuous increase in the head drawdown data nevertheless when the final set of data was added there was no significant change from the previous inversion result which is consistent with the regulation observed in the inversion results of previous scholars hao et al 2008 yeh and liu 2000 that is the inversion result does not improve further as more data are added with the given configuration of pumping tests and observation wells fig 5 shows that several high k zones are connected in general in other words a high k phenomenon is shown in the lower region of xlz5 as well as between xlz3 and xlz1 in these two high k zones there exists a certain connectivity phenomenon the regions around xlz4 and xlz7 have neither a high k zone nor connectivity phenomena with other high k zones here the high k zone is defined as the area where the hydraulic conductivity k is over 1 m h the results of the ht inversion are compared with the variation in the water head below the high k zone phenomenon that appeared south of xlz5 and northwest of xlz3 is consistent with the large water head response of xlz3 and xzl4 during the pumping process of xlz2 analogously xlz1 has a large water head response during the pumping process of xlz3 while xlz3 has a large water head response during the pumping process of xlz6 high storage specific regions exist east of xlz2 and north of xlz7 this finding is consistent with the phenomenon that the xzl3 and xlz5 water level changes do not exceed 0 1 m during xlz4 pumping and that xlz4 and xlz7 have no large water head response during the pumping process of the other boreholes to further illustrate the reliability of the inversion results fig 7 displays the fitting result between the observed and simulated values of 165 pieces of head drawdown data and the error analysis of the data is carried out by using formulas 6 7 and 8 collectively the results of l1 and l2 are small and the result of r2 is close to 1 indicating that there is a better fitting effect between the observed value and the simulated value namely the inversion result can authentically reflect the general situation of the study area 4 2 wide field electromagnetic method results to further explore the preferential flowpaths of water inrush and verify the results of ht we used the wide field electromagnetic method to conduct further steps at the local scale the main purpose is to explore the surroundings of the two karst collapse columns and the nearby areas of two normal faults next to water inrush point t1 fig 8 shows the resistivity distribution at 830 m it can be seen from fig 2 that near the xlz3 borehole the depth of ordovician formation is approximately 830 m fig 8 show that the area between f11 and f12 fault zones is relatively low resistivity and there is also a relatively low resistivity area between xlz2 and xlz3 in addition the kcc1 on the east side of xlz2 borehole shows relatively high resistivity with logarithm is around 2 2 moreover the kcc2 shows relatively high resistivity except for the kcc2 middle part and the logarithm of kcc2 middle part is about 1 8 5 discussion 5 1 comparative analysis results of ht and the wide field electromagnetic method through the analysis of the groundwater hydrogeochemical characteristics in the xieqiao area zhang et al 2020 believed that the water in the permian carboniferous and ordovician aquifers in the xieqiao area is interconnected according to the ht results in this paper fig 5 shows that two high k zones appear on the south side of xlz5 and the west side of xlz3 and the high k zone on the south side of xlz5 extends to the south side and it is connected to the high k zone on the west side of xlz3 therefore there may be a strong water conducting belt on the xlz5 xlz2 xlz3 line compared with the conclusions of zhang et al it is considered that the karsts on the west side of xlz3 and the south side of xlz5 are relatively developed and there may be connectivity between various aquifers d1 is the water inrush point where the water inrush event occurred therefore it is inferred that d1 may be supplied by two high k areas at the same time the inferred preferential flowpaths of water flow are shown in fig 9 a to verify the reliability of the preferential flowpaths of the water source a wide field electromagnetic method for further verification and analysis was applied on a local scale we chose the wide field electromagnetic result of 830 m because the ordovician formations are occurred around this depth fig 9 b shows the flowpaths determined by the resistivity distribution obtained by the wide field electromagnetic method the results obtained by the wide field electromagnetic method are consistent with the corresponding part of the ht results in fig 9 a therefore we believe that the preferential flowpaths inferred in fig 9 a have a certain reliability the ht method can inverse the high k zone and the low k zone on the regional scale although a definite method of verifying whether the areas with high hydraulic conductivity are preferential flowpaths is not available in this paper the high resistivity and low resistivity zones obtained by the wide field electromagnetic method are used to identify the preferential flowpaths in the study area and the results are compared with the ht results to improve the reliability of the preferential flowpaths estimated by ht in general the combination of the two methods represents a successful attempt nevertheless there are still some shortcomings this paper can only comprehensively compare the results obtained by these two methods although the conversion of wide field electromagnetic information and the data conversion of ht have not yet been realized 5 2 comparative analysis results of ht and fault zone distribution this section mainly compares the ht results with the known fault information collected in the study area further analyzes the preferential flowpaths of water inrush and verifies the reliability of the ht results illman et al 2009 and zha et al 2016 mentioned that ht can be used as supporting evidence for the existence of faults and fault zones the fault zone information is integrated with the ht results as shown in fig 10 fig 10 a shows that the ht results can well identify normal faults f35 f11 and f12 at the locations of these three fault zones the ht results are all presented by the high k zone however the ht results cannot identify the positions of f10 and f34 which may be related to the insufficient number of observation wells to cover the west side of the f10 fault zone therefore the hydraulic parameter information in this part cannot be well inverted a similar situation has been encountered in previous studies by mao et al 2018 another possibility is that some faults are filled with clay or mud and can appear as low k zones illman et al 2009 meanwhile the fault information is also reflected in the results of the wide field electromagnetic method in fig 8 a low resistivity zone appears between f12 and f11 its existence may be due to the occurrence of fault zones on both sides which leads to the connectivity of different aquifers additionally karst is relatively developed in this area thus preferential flowpaths are formed here and water recharges the dongfeng d1 well the formation near the fault zone is prone to dislocation and water in different formations may converge here therefore water inrush accidents are more likely to occur near the fault zone the results of ht and the wide field electromagnetic method in section 5 1 are combined to perform a comprehensive analysis we speculate that the preferential flowpaths of water in the study area start from the f35 fault zone pass through kcc2 converge with the water from the middle part of fault zones f11 and f12 and finally supply dongfeng well d1 the effect of the karst collapse column on the hydraulic conductivity of the site is not obvious kcc1 shows a high storage area while kcc2 shows a high hydraulic conductivity area which is not completely consistent with the results of zhang et al 2020 who analyzed the water chemistry characteristics of the area and claimed that the existence of the two kccs may cause the connectivity of aquifers in different formations and finally form karst conduit however through the research of this paper the kcc1 area shows a high resistivity value and high storage specific region and it is unlikely to be the water inrush source of the dongfeng well the middle area of kcc2 is characterized by a low resistivity value and high hydraulic conductivity where karst conduit may exist to connect the two high k areas that appear on the south side of xlz5 and the f11 fig 11 a and b show the variance distribution of lnk and lnss respectively the variance can give some evidence about whether the estimated k and ss are reliable or not a low value area implies that high confidence about the estimated k and ss in these areas we can see that the variance value is relatively low in the study area near the pumped and observation boreholes which means that the estimated parameter from this inversion has high reliability 6 conclusions in this study the results obtained by the ht and the wide field electromagnetic methods are comprehensively analyzed and compared with relevant geological information to explore the preferential flowpaths of water inrush in the whole study area the main conclusions are stated as follows 1 the distribution of the high k zone identified by ht is consistent with the distribution of the low resistivity zone identified by the wide field electromagnetic method meanwhile the distribution of the low k zone identified by ht is also consistent with that of the high resistivity zone identified by the wide field electromagnetic method low resistivity zones are usually filled with water while high k zones are areas where water can easily pass and flow the areas that both show high hydraulic conductivity and low resistivity may present preferential flowpaths of water 2 ht can accurately identify the location of fault zone development this finding illustrates that ht can be used as a supporting method to determine the existence of fault zones at the field scale however ht cannot be the main method of determining the existence of fault zones because some information about fault zones cannot be interpreted uninterpreted fault information may be related to an insufficient number of observation wells or faults filled with mud 3 in this paper the distribution of the high k zone identified by ht is consistent with that of the fault zone where the fault zone exists the formation will be dislocated and subsidence will appear at the same time the ht results show that the hydraulic conductivity is higher in areas where fault zones exist indicating that water inrush accidents are likely to occur in this area based on the identification results of site heterogeneity information in conclusion 1 we speculated on the preferential flowpaths of water inrush in the study area the path starts from the f35 fault zone passes through kcc2 converges with the water from the middle part of fault zones f11 and f12 and finally supplies dongfeng well d1 the results of this paper verify the feasibility of using ht to identify preferential flowpaths and this finding has certain reference value for the future application of ht at the site scale nevertheless this paper only comprehensively analyzes the ht and wide field electromagnetic method results and known geological information without assimilating and fusing the data in the future we will also try to further fuse the data obtained by the new geophysical method with the data obtained by ht to achieve a more comprehensive and accurate description of the heterogeneity of the site credit authorship contribution statement wei wang data curation methodology writing original

4262,water inrush is a major hidden danger that decreases coal mining safety thus preferential flowpaths of water inrush in mining areas must be investigated to prevent water disasters and guide grouting engineering in this study pumping and observation data of five boreholes were input into a 2d groundwater flow model established using vsaft2 software for inversion to obtain the heterogeneous distribution information of the site then the wide field electromagnetic method was used to obtain the distribution of resistivity values at different depths in the local area finally we compared and analyzed the relevant geological information of the site such as the fault zones and karst collapse columns obtained using the above two methods to determine the preferential flowpaths of water the results show that 1 the hydraulic conductivity distribution estimated by hydraulic tomography is consistent with the location distribution of high resistivity and low resistivity areas identified by the wide field electromagnetic method 2 the high hydraulic conductivity zones obtained by hydraulic tomography are consistent with the known distribution of geological fault zones which is important because water inrush accidents often occur in areas where fault zones exist and 3 based on the comprehensive analysis of the above results a preferential flowpaths of water inrush was identified the flowpaths starts from the f35 fault zone passes through kcc2 converges with the water from the middle part of fault zones f11 and f12 and finally supplies dongfeng well d1 this paper compares ht results to resistivity estimates from independently conducted geophysical surveys the identification of the groundwater flow pathway through ht can help to minimize future water in rush accidents keywords hydraulic tomography preferential flowpaths wide field electromagnetic method geological information 1 introduction coal mining water inrush events have occurred in many regions of the world bogardi et al 1980 bukowski et al 2011 dumpleton et al 2001 wu et al 2017 there are many events occurred in aquifers near coal seams zhang et al 2004 the main cause of this phenomenon is the connection between the working area and the lower aquifer which easily results in groundwater influx xu et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 as the largest producer and consumer of coal worldwide china is also one of the countries most affected by water inrush from coal mines lu et al 2017 yin et al 2018 water inrush disasters represent an important factor influencing the safe production of coal mines in china for instance five water inrush accidents occurred during the construction of the dongfeng borehole in xieqiao anhui province with a stable water volume was 420 m3 h the huainan mining group has carried out a series of grouting project although none of the measures have achieved good results due to the implicit water inrush conditions after grouting the dongfeng borehole stable volumetric flow rate was still 344 5 m3 h therefore it is of great significance to determine the preferential flowpaths of water inrush in coal mines to guide grouting engineering and ensure mining safety the key to detecting the preferential flowpaths of groundwater in a mining area is information about the spatial distribution of the hydraulic properties of the aquifer in such areas most aquifers in coal mining areas are highly heterogeneous moreover because of the complexity of fracture systems zou et al 2017 and the non darcy phenomenon of water flow qian et al 2011 wang et al 2015 wang et al 2017 wen et al 2013 characterizing the heterogeneity of aquifers at different locations has always been a challenging issue illman et al 2005 scanlon et al 2003 in traditional studies martínez pagán et al 2013 detected the water bearing structures of mined aquifers via electrical resistivity tomography ert li et al 2015 used the dc resistivity method to study underground water bearing structures to prevent water inrush and pointed out that the key to analyzing the preferential flowpaths of water inrush is to determine the locations of adverse geological bodies in coal mines such as faults karst caves karst collapse columns kccs and goafs however all aforementioned geophysical prospecting methods have high operating costs thus studies have applied low budget numerical simulations for relevant research for instance jones et al 2005 connected the monte carlo stochastic approach with modflow to achieve stochastic simulations estimate the bulk hydraulic conductivity and assess the heterogeneity of the field site yao et al 2012 utilized numerical tools rfpa2d and comsol to simulate the fracture evolution and seepage rule in coal seam mining and sun et al 2015 assessed the flow field of karst water by modflow and analyzed the potential water inrush risk mohammadi et al 2018 simulate water flow and solute transport at a karst aquifer by coupling of cfpv2 and ostrich although these traditional numerical simulation methods satisfy the requirement of low cost they lack accuracy in identifying fractured channels therefore a new method that is both low cost and accurate is needed recently yeh and liu 2000 developed a new method i e hydraulic tomography ht to characterize the heterogeneity of aquifers with high precision this method mainly conducts multiple sets of pumping experiments or water injection experiments to collect water level fluctuation data in the aquifer and then analyzes the data obtained by a highly parameterized inverse model to estimate the detailed spatial distribution of hydraulic parameters in the aquifer daranond et al 2020 since this method was proposed it has been continuously optimized over the last 20 years sun et al 2013 and zhu and yeh 2005 proposed a data acquisition strategy by analyzing redundant and nonredundant information in aquifer parameters from different perspectives which decreased the computational complexity of ht mao et al 2013a optimized the previous algorithm and extended the simultaneous successive linear estimator simsle program on variable saturation unconfined aquifers to further expand the application of ht mao et al 2013b also analyzed the necessary conditions for establishing the inversion model to ensure the existence and uniqueness of the solution which reduces the uncertainty of the inversion model results and improves the inversion accuracy due to the continuous improvement and maturity of ht its application for diverse aspects such as synthetic aquifers hao et al 2008 laboratory aquifers liu et al 2002 sharmeen et al 2012 zhao et al 2015 and field aquifers bohling et al 2007 berg et al 2011 yeh et al 2009 has quickly spread and achieved desirable results in particular ht shows good rationality and applicability in identifying the heterogeneity of some large scales in fractured rocks for example illman et al 2009 described the large scale heterogeneity in a construction site of 1 km2 by using two cross hole pumping tests as a stimulus source mao et al 2018 utilized drainage events in the mining area as a stimulus source to explore the distribution of hydraulic conductivity in the region of 10 km2 liu et al 2020 investigated the potential of ht to identify boundary conditions in groundwater basins to the best of our knowledge previous studies have not specifically researched the potential of ht in identifying the preferential flowpaths of water flow nonetheless to characterize the heterogeneity of aquifers especially in the analysis of the preferential flowpaths of coal mine water inrush if only the ht method is used then the result is not sufficiently accurate as mentioned by berg et al 2011 ht results should be compared with other heterogeneous characterization and modeling methods based on field data to further improve the accuracy of site heterogeneity characterization yeh et al 2002 proposed a stochastic information fusion technology that assimilated information from both electrical resistivity tomography and ht to characterize the heterogeneity of the vadose zone soueid ahmed et al 2015 combined ht and image information obtained from seismic and ground penetrating radar sections to improve the identification accuracy of field heterogeneity zhao and illman 2017 applied a prior geologic information to improve ht result but the large mining area and complex underground space in coal mining areas accurately identifying the preferential flowpaths of water inrush in coal mines has always been a challenge therefore ht alone cannot be used as a method to solve this problem and a comprehensive analysis of the results of ht and other technical approaches should be performed to improve the accuracy of recognition results ht can determine only the distribution of high hydraulic conductivity areas and low hydraulic conductivity areas of the field nevertheless it is not accurate to define the preferential flowpaths only by the high or low hydraulic conductivity if other methods can be included to verify the ht result it will make the ht result more reasonable electromagnetic method is also widely used for aquifer characterization gondwe et al 2012 determine groundwater flow in karst aquifers by airborne electromagnetic meyer et al 2019 used electromagnetic investigation to saltwater intrusion path in a regional aquifer rejiba et al 2018 applied the dipolar source electromagnetic induction to characterizing the paleochannel john et al 2020 investigated the diverse hydrogeology underlying rivers by transient electromagnetic methodology the wide field electromagnetic method is a new frequency domain electromagnetic technology he 2010 which has been used in coal mine hydrological hazards identification he 2018 the essence of the wfem is used the distribution of resistivity to infer the formation information in underground but this method has more accurate and effective than the traditional method yuan et al 2017 therefore we can use this feature to identify the distribution of high and low resistivity areas of a site by a wide field electromagnetic method to further verify the preferential flow paths obtained by ht to the best of our knowledge it is the first time that compare the results of hydraulic tomography and wide field electromagnetic method to analysis the preferential flowpaths in coal area the objective of this paper is to 1 explore the distribution of heterogeneity in the study area by comparing the results of ht and wide field electromagnetic methods 2 analyze the area where water inrush may occur by comparing relevant geological information such as fault zones and karst collapse columns with the ht results and 3 determine the preferential flowpaths of coal mine water inrush in the study area by analyzing the results of the abovementioned multimethods 2 material and methodology 2 1 site location description the xieqiao coal mine is located 20 km away from northeastern yinshang county anhui province china fig 1 with a rough total area of 50 km2 operations began in april 1997 and the mine has an annual capacity of approximately 9 million tons the overall scope of the study area is approximately 16 km2 the area mainly contains five normal faults shown as f10 f11 f12 f34 and f35 in fig 1 in addition the two karst collapse columns kcc1 and kcc2 developed in the southeastern part of the study area 2 2 site geology background the main geologic stratum in the study area include quaternary permian carboniferous ordovician cambrian formation from top to bottom in general the formation shows an approximately east west strike and incline slightly to the south with an angle of 10 15 to further explore the development of each aquifer in the study area exploration boreholes are set up in the location shown as the two blue dotted section lines 1 and 2 in fig 1 the stratigraphic section in fig 2 shows that the permian formation has an average thickness of nearly 390 m and the carboniferous formation has an average thickness of nearly 200 m moreover the average thickness of the ordovician formation withprobably 100 m is the research target of this study an obvious developed karst collapse column is shown in the profile of 2 according to the results of 3 d seismic technique exploration zuo et al 2009 the lengths of kcc1 and kcc2 in the permian coal measures layer coal seam 1 are 337 m and 1117 m and the widths are 387 m and 159 m respectively both kccs pass through the permian carboniferous and ordovician systems and their diameters increase from top to bottom in the area where the karst collapse column exists obvious dislocations and subsidence are observed and represent interconnections between the formations of different eras 2 3 description of boreholes at the site the boreholes selected in this study are mainly 7 boreholes as shown in fig 1 pumping tests were carried out in 5 boreholes xlz2 xlz3 xlz4 xlz5 xlz6 while the rest 2 boreholes xlz1 and xlz7 only used as observation boreholes during pumping tests of xlz3 and xlz5 to obtain as much heterogeneous information about the whole study area as possible the drilling positions are distributed on the boundary of the study area in addition considering that ordovician formation may have the main recharge aquifers for water inrush all seven boreholes were drilled into the ordovician formation the depth of each pumping well and the information of each formation are shown in table 1 which indicates that all boreholes above the ordovician formation has been cased and the ordovician stratum is open 3 methodology 3 1 hydraulic tomography 3 1 1 groundwater flow model hydraulic tomography is a new inversion method developed in recent years to characterize the heterogeneity of aquifers yeh and liu 2000 this study mainly uses vsaft2 variably saturated flow and transport 2 d software to develop a heterogeneous saturated aquifer 2 d model for simulating groundwater flow models in heterogeneous media the software can be downloaded from the website of professor yeh http tian hwr arizona edu downloads the main governing equations of the model are displayed as follows 1 t x h q x p s s x h t the corresponding boundary conditions and initial conditions are as follows 2 h γ 1 h 1 t x h n γ 2 q h t 0 h 0 where h is the total head l x is the spatial coordinate l q xp is the pumping rate l3 t l2 at xp t x is the saturated hydraulic conductivity l2 t ss x is the specific storage l 1 h1 is the prescribed total boundary dirichlet boundary q is the prescribed flux boundary neumann boundary γ 2 n is the unit vector orthogonal to γ 1 and γ 2 and h0 represents the initial total head 3 1 2 inverse modeling approach we briefly describe the simsle algorithm used by the model the algorithm is a parameter estimation method based on geostatistics yeh and liu 2000 the logarithm of the hydraulic conductivity k and the specific storage ss is treated as a random spatial variable 3 h x i h h x i 4 ln k x i k f k x i 5 ln s x i s f k x i the parameter f has a nonlinear relationship with the head h of the observation well taking the hydraulic conductivity as an example and using the cokriging method xiang et al 2009 the initial estimation results are as follows 6 f 1 x 0 i 1 n f λ 0 i f x i k 1 n p j 1 n h k i 1 n t k j μ 0 k j l h k x j t l h e k x j t l where h k and s are the mean values of the observation head hydraulic conductivity and water specific storage respectively h x i is the value of the observation head f 1 x 0 is the value of k or s estimated for the first time by the cokriging algorithm at location x 0 k is the times of pumping test h k x j t l is the observation head at time tl h e k x j t l is the estimated head at time tl np is the total number of pumping tests nh k is the number of observation wells nt k j is the total water head of the j th observation well λ 0 i is the weight of the parameter value f to the parameter estimated value at x0 and μ 0 k j l is the weighting coefficient for observation head h k x j t l to the parameter estimated value the result of the first parameter estimation is brought into the groundwater flow model for the next iteration eq 1 shows that there is a nonlinear relationship between the observation head value and k or s the cokriging algorithm is a linear estimation algorithm and requires multiple iterations to satisfy the nonlinear relationship its iterative formula is as follows 7 f r 1 x 0 f r x 0 k 1 n p j 1 n h k i 1 n t k j ω 0 k j l r h k x j t l h r k x j t l where ω 0 k j l r is the weighting coefficient for the parameter estimate at location x0 of the difference between the observation head value and estimated head value and r is the iteration index the above calculation process will continue until the specified accuracy is achieved the specified accuracy refers to reaching the maximum iteration step size or the difference between the observation head value and estimated head value is less than the given critical value and the change of the parameter is less than the given critical value during the iteration process to verify the estimates from simsle we apply the mean absolute error l1 the mean square error l2 and the coefficient of determination r2 to evaluate the fitting effect of the estimated head drawdown value and the observed head drawdown value it is defined as follows 8 l 1 1 n i 1 n h 1 h 2 9 l 2 1 n i 1 n h 1 h 2 2 10 r 2 1 n i 1 n h 1 h 1 h 2 h 2 1 n i 1 n h 1 h 1 2 1 n i 1 n h 2 h 2 2 where n represents the total amount of input observation data i represents the specified number of input data h1 and h2 represent the simulation value and the observed value respectively and h 1 and h 2 represent the mean value of the simulation value and the observed value respectively if the resulting l1 is small then the average value of the estimated field is close to the average value of the observation field if the resulting l2 is small then the total deviation between the estimated value and the observed value is small and if the resulting r2 is larger then the estimated value and the observed value are closer 3 1 3 pumping test description and drawdown data selection the ordovician limestone aquifer is the target of this pumping test layer five pumping wells were selected namely xlz2 xlz3 xlz4 xlz5 and xlz6 and the pumping rate was from 58 to 74 m3 h are shown in table 1 we selected a total of 165 points of head drawdown data 11 groups of observation data with each group consisting of 15 pieces of head drawdown data while the sampling frequency was controlled once every 2 h all of 165 data were used for inverse modeling the specific changes in the water level are shown in fig 3 it shows that collected the drawdown data in three observation wells during a single pumping test at xlz2 and remaining eight sets of drawdown data during four times pumping test from xlz3 to xlz6 as shown in fig 3 during the pumping test of xlz5 large fluctuations were observed in observation well xlz3 which is primarily because the other aquifer near the xlz3 borehole was opened up and a large amount of water supply cause the rise of the water level for a short period of time nonetheless the continuous pumping ultimately led to a downward trend in the water level of xlz3 3 1 4 numerical model parameter setup we established a heterogeneous saturated aquifer 2 d model of 10 000 12 000 m in this paper and divided the aquifer into 100 120 cells sun et al 2013 studied the relationship between drawdown and aquifer characteristics and suggested using constant head boundaries for unknown boundaries during ht analysis therefore all the sides of the 2 d model are set as a constant head boundary of 100 m and the initial head value of the entire simulation field is also set to 100 m in this paper the domain size is relatively large therefore 4000 m is set as the correlation scales of x and y in this paper according to previous scholars studies when sufficient data are available the impact of the uncertainty of the correlation scale on the results of hydraulic tomography is basically negligible mao et al 2018 illman et al 2009 the variance of lnk and lnss is set as 2 and the mean value of the initial k was set as 0 1 m h according to the actual measured values of several boreholes ss is based on the empirical value of the water storage coefficient in the karst area and has an initial mean value of 0 005 m 1 3 2 wide field electromagnetic method the wide field electromagnetic method is a new method based on controlled source audio magnetotellurics csamt he 2010 he 2018 the underground resistivity information is mainly contained in the electric field component ex this method directly measures the electric field component ex to achieve large depth and high precision exploration of underground resistivity conditions the expression of ex as follows 11 e x i d l ρ 2 π r 3 1 3 sin 2 ϕ e i k r 1 i k r where i is the current value dl represent the electric dipole source length i is the imaginary symbol and the ϕ is the angle between the vector diameter from transmitter to receiver and the electric dipole r and k represent the distance between transmitter to receiver and the wave number respectively ρ is the resistivity value ex can be obtained by the estimate electric potential difference between electrodes m and n the expression of electric potential difference δ v mn as follows 12 δ v mn e x m n i d l ρ 2 π r 3 f e e x i k r m n where f e e x i k r 1 3 sin 2 ϕ e i k r 1 i k r use the geometrical coefficient k e e x which represent the wide field electromagnetic method configuration coefficient just depend on the electrode geometry 13 k e e x 2 π r 3 dl m n the wide field apparent resistivity formula can be obtained it is defined as follows 14 ρ a k e e x δ v mn i 1 f e e x i k r the detection range is shown by the red dotted line in fig 1 and fig 4 shows that the specific field layout of survey line in this study the area surveyed by the wide field electromagnetic method is 3 4 km2 and 31 prospecting lines have been laid out with a total 33 kilometer exploration distance according to the electrical characteristics of various rock ores the working frequency was selected from 0 016 hz to 8192 hz and the emission current was about 100 a the transmission cable was between 6 km and 9 km which contains 39 emission frequencies and the exploration depth was estimated to be 0 1 3 0 km 4 results 4 1 hydraulic tomography inversion results fig 5 and fig 6 show the inversion results of hydraulic conductivity k and specific storage ss after successively superposing the head information the red borehole is the water inrush point and the black boreholes are the pumping wells and observation wells of this research fig 5 a and 6 a show the joint inversion results of boreholes xlz2 and xlz3 fig 5 b and 6 b show the results added to the head drawdown data of xlz3 and xlz5 during the pumping process of the xlz4 borehole into the above inversion fig 5 c and 6 c added the head drawdown data of xlz3 and xlz7 during the pumping period of the xlz5 borehole and fig 5 d and 6 d are based on the previous inversion result and add the head drawdown data of xlz3 and xlz4 during the pumping of xlz6 all the above results only reflect part of the inversion situation in the study area because the values of the estimated parameters of the rest of the area are basically consistent with the initial values the inversion results of fig 5 and fig 6 show that in the beginning the heterogeneous information of the site gradually increases with the continuous increase in the head drawdown data nevertheless when the final set of data was added there was no significant change from the previous inversion result which is consistent with the regulation observed in the inversion results of previous scholars hao et al 2008 yeh and liu 2000 that is the inversion result does not improve further as more data are added with the given configuration of pumping tests and observation wells fig 5 shows that several high k zones are connected in general in other words a high k phenomenon is shown in the lower region of xlz5 as well as between xlz3 and xlz1 in these two high k zones there exists a certain connectivity phenomenon the regions around xlz4 and xlz7 have neither a high k zone nor connectivity phenomena with other high k zones here the high k zone is defined as the area where the hydraulic conductivity k is over 1 m h the results of the ht inversion are compared with the variation in the water head below the high k zone phenomenon that appeared south of xlz5 and northwest of xlz3 is consistent with the large water head response of xlz3 and xzl4 during the pumping process of xlz2 analogously xlz1 has a large water head response during the pumping process of xlz3 while xlz3 has a large water head response during the pumping process of xlz6 high storage specific regions exist east of xlz2 and north of xlz7 this finding is consistent with the phenomenon that the xzl3 and xlz5 water level changes do not exceed 0 1 m during xlz4 pumping and that xlz4 and xlz7 have no large water head response during the pumping process of the other boreholes to further illustrate the reliability of the inversion results fig 7 displays the fitting result between the observed and simulated values of 165 pieces of head drawdown data and the error analysis of the data is carried out by using formulas 6 7 and 8 collectively the results of l1 and l2 are small and the result of r2 is close to 1 indicating that there is a better fitting effect between the observed value and the simulated value namely the inversion result can authentically reflect the general situation of the study area 4 2 wide field electromagnetic method results to further explore the preferential flowpaths of water inrush and verify the results of ht we used the wide field electromagnetic method to conduct further steps at the local scale the main purpose is to explore the surroundings of the two karst collapse columns and the nearby areas of two normal faults next to water inrush point t1 fig 8 shows the resistivity distribution at 830 m it can be seen from fig 2 that near the xlz3 borehole the depth of ordovician formation is approximately 830 m fig 8 show that the area between f11 and f12 fault zones is relatively low resistivity and there is also a relatively low resistivity area between xlz2 and xlz3 in addition the kcc1 on the east side of xlz2 borehole shows relatively high resistivity with logarithm is around 2 2 moreover the kcc2 shows relatively high resistivity except for the kcc2 middle part and the logarithm of kcc2 middle part is about 1 8 5 discussion 5 1 comparative analysis results of ht and the wide field electromagnetic method through the analysis of the groundwater hydrogeochemical characteristics in the xieqiao area zhang et al 2020 believed that the water in the permian carboniferous and ordovician aquifers in the xieqiao area is interconnected according to the ht results in this paper fig 5 shows that two high k zones appear on the south side of xlz5 and the west side of xlz3 and the high k zone on the south side of xlz5 extends to the south side and it is connected to the high k zone on the west side of xlz3 therefore there may be a strong water conducting belt on the xlz5 xlz2 xlz3 line compared with the conclusions of zhang et al it is considered that the karsts on the west side of xlz3 and the south side of xlz5 are relatively developed and there may be connectivity between various aquifers d1 is the water inrush point where the water inrush event occurred therefore it is inferred that d1 may be supplied by two high k areas at the same time the inferred preferential flowpaths of water flow are shown in fig 9 a to verify the reliability of the preferential flowpaths of the water source a wide field electromagnetic method for further verification and analysis was applied on a local scale we chose the wide field electromagnetic result of 830 m because the ordovician formations are occurred around this depth fig 9 b shows the flowpaths determined by the resistivity distribution obtained by the wide field electromagnetic method the results obtained by the wide field electromagnetic method are consistent with the corresponding part of the ht results in fig 9 a therefore we believe that the preferential flowpaths inferred in fig 9 a have a certain reliability the ht method can inverse the high k zone and the low k zone on the regional scale although a definite method of verifying whether the areas with high hydraulic conductivity are preferential flowpaths is not available in this paper the high resistivity and low resistivity zones obtained by the wide field electromagnetic method are used to identify the preferential flowpaths in the study area and the results are compared with the ht results to improve the reliability of the preferential flowpaths estimated by ht in general the combination of the two methods represents a successful attempt nevertheless there are still some shortcomings this paper can only comprehensively compare the results obtained by these two methods although the conversion of wide field electromagnetic information and the data conversion of ht have not yet been realized 5 2 comparative analysis results of ht and fault zone distribution this section mainly compares the ht results with the known fault information collected in the study area further analyzes the preferential flowpaths of water inrush and verifies the reliability of the ht results illman et al 2009 and zha et al 2016 mentioned that ht can be used as supporting evidence for the existence of faults and fault zones the fault zone information is integrated with the ht results as shown in fig 10 fig 10 a shows that the ht results can well identify normal faults f35 f11 and f12 at the locations of these three fault zones the ht results are all presented by the high k zone however the ht results cannot identify the positions of f10 and f34 which may be related to the insufficient number of observation wells to cover the west side of the f10 fault zone therefore the hydraulic parameter information in this part cannot be well inverted a similar situation has been encountered in previous studies by mao et al 2018 another possibility is that some faults are filled with clay or mud and can appear as low k zones illman et al 2009 meanwhile the fault information is also reflected in the results of the wide field electromagnetic method in fig 8 a low resistivity zone appears between f12 and f11 its existence may be due to the occurrence of fault zones on both sides which leads to the connectivity of different aquifers additionally karst is relatively developed in this area thus preferential flowpaths are formed here and water recharges the dongfeng d1 well the formation near the fault zone is prone to dislocation and water in different formations may converge here therefore water inrush accidents are more likely to occur near the fault zone the results of ht and the wide field electromagnetic method in section 5 1 are combined to perform a comprehensive analysis we speculate that the preferential flowpaths of water in the study area start from the f35 fault zone pass through kcc2 converge with the water from the middle part of fault zones f11 and f12 and finally supply dongfeng well d1 the effect of the karst collapse column on the hydraulic conductivity of the site is not obvious kcc1 shows a high storage area while kcc2 shows a high hydraulic conductivity area which is not completely consistent with the results of zhang et al 2020 who analyzed the water chemistry characteristics of the area and claimed that the existence of the two kccs may cause the connectivity of aquifers in different formations and finally form karst conduit however through the research of this paper the kcc1 area shows a high resistivity value and high storage specific region and it is unlikely to be the water inrush source of the dongfeng well the middle area of kcc2 is characterized by a low resistivity value and high hydraulic conductivity where karst conduit may exist to connect the two high k areas that appear on the south side of xlz5 and the f11 fig 11 a and b show the variance distribution of lnk and lnss respectively the variance can give some evidence about whether the estimated k and ss are reliable or not a low value area implies that high confidence about the estimated k and ss in these areas we can see that the variance value is relatively low in the study area near the pumped and observation boreholes which means that the estimated parameter from this inversion has high reliability 6 conclusions in this study the results obtained by the ht and the wide field electromagnetic methods are comprehensively analyzed and compared with relevant geological information to explore the preferential flowpaths of water inrush in the whole study area the main conclusions are stated as follows 1 the distribution of the high k zone identified by ht is consistent with the distribution of the low resistivity zone identified by the wide field electromagnetic method meanwhile the distribution of the low k zone identified by ht is also consistent with that of the high resistivity zone identified by the wide field electromagnetic method low resistivity zones are usually filled with water while high k zones are areas where water can easily pass and flow the areas that both show high hydraulic conductivity and low resistivity may present preferential flowpaths of water 2 ht can accurately identify the location of fault zone development this finding illustrates that ht can be used as a supporting method to determine the existence of fault zones at the field scale however ht cannot be the main method of determining the existence of fault zones because some information about fault zones cannot be interpreted uninterpreted fault information may be related to an insufficient number of observation wells or faults filled with mud 3 in this paper the distribution of the high k zone identified by ht is consistent with that of the fault zone where the fault zone exists the formation will be dislocated and subsidence will appear at the same time the ht results show that the hydraulic conductivity is higher in areas where fault zones exist indicating that water inrush accidents are likely to occur in this area based on the identification results of site heterogeneity information in conclusion 1 we speculated on the preferential flowpaths of water inrush in the study area the path starts from the f35 fault zone passes through kcc2 converges with the water from the middle part of fault zones f11 and f12 and finally supplies dongfeng well d1 the results of this paper verify the feasibility of using ht to identify preferential flowpaths and this finding has certain reference value for the future application of ht at the site scale nevertheless this paper only comprehensively analyzes the ht and wide field electromagnetic method results and known geological information without assimilating and fusing the data in the future we will also try to further fuse the data obtained by the new geophysical method with the data obtained by ht to achieve a more comprehensive and accurate description of the heterogeneity of the site credit authorship contribution statement wei wang data curation methodology writing original

4263,due to their large computational burden spatially distributed hydrological models are unsuitable for iterative spatial optimization analyses which need to take into account location specific runoff water accumulation and re infiltration processes therefore a computationally efficient raster based and spatially explicit rr model was conceptualized for this purpose the scs cn approach was implemented in a spatially distributed manner adjusting cn values to antecedent soil moisture conditions amc and routing runoff to the catchment outlet to take into account spatial interaction along the overland flow paths the scs cn approach was extended with a re infiltration algorithm several model configurations were evaluated based on combinations of two amc correction methods and three re infiltration algorithms these model configurations were applied in three catchments in flanders belgium the results indicate a poor performance of the default scs cn method which was however considerably improved by the implementation of amc correction and re infiltration though calibration of the rr model configurations was limited several model configurations achieved model performances adequate for use in spatial optimization analyses the most performant rr model configuration nse of 0 57 0 56 and 0 64 for the three catchments implements a λ of 0 05 the amc correction method proposed by neitsch et al 2011 and the re infiltration method of van loo 2018 calculating overland flow velocity with manning s n adjusted to seasonal vegetation cover variations as this model allows for spatial interaction through re infiltration but with limited computation times it is well applicable for iterative spatial optimization analyses although a more extensive calibration and validation exercise on catchments with a wider range of characteristics is required to provide a general assessment of its applicability and accuracy keywords rainfall runoff distributed hydrological model re infiltration spatial interaction computational efficiency scs cn method 1 introduction the relationship between rainfall and runoff is an important driver of hydrological processes at the watershed scale this relationship is influenced by meteorological and watershed variables such as slope soil soil cover characteristics and surface roughness mccuen 1998 human activities can significantly alter both types of variables rainfall in many regions is becoming more erratic under anthropogenic climate change going along with an increasing occurrence of extreme precipitation events ipcc 2014 while land use land cover lulc changes such as urbanization affect infiltration capacity vegetation cover and surface roughness braud et al 2013 united nations 2019 yan et al 2013 consequently adequate rainfall runoff rr models able to assess the table 4 impact of land use changes on hydrological processes and water resources are increasingly needed to support sustainable spatial planning policy breuer et al 2009 yan et al 2013 given the spatial variability of watershed characteristics and lulc changes rr models assessing the hydrological impacts of land use changes are typically process based spatially semi distributed models e g the topography based hydrological model mike she dhi software 2008 soil and water assessment tool swat neitsch et al 2011 and topmodel beven and kirkby 1979 gao et al 2015 however given their high computational times jakeman and hornberger 1993 perrin et al 2001 sivakumar 2008 applications of distributed hydrological models assessing the hydrological impact of land use changes have mostly been limited to analyses of predefined scenarios assessing what if problems requiring a limited number of model simulations fang et al 2013 gao et al 2015 kalantari et al 2014 wu et al 2015 yu et al 2018 however spatial optimization analyses are required to assess the more practical where should issues identifying the optimal land use change scenario based on a specific objective e g flood hazard consequently the integration of hydrological models in spatial optimization analyses allows the identification of land use patterns optimizing hydrological functions in catchment areas such hydrological optimization analyses can thereby provide additional information to policy makers river basin managers and spatial planners however given their bigger search space these optimization analyses require a large number of model simulations and have a high computational burden volk et al 2010 to reduce the computational requirements optimization analyses often rely on heuristic algorithms e g genetic algorithms to limit the search space thereby rather approximating the global optimal solution lin et al 2009 seppelt and voinov 2003 yeo and guldmann 2010 alternatively to allow for a more complete assessment of the search space the computational requirements of the model integrated in the optimization analysis can be lowered for instance by reducing its complexity while maintaining enough accuracy to compare and evaluate land use interventions volk et al 2010 this paper therefore focuses on the conceptualization of a computationally efficient rr model which can be integrated in further research in spatial optimization applications for example with the aim to identify spatial land use patterns minimizing flood hazard in a catchment for this purpose the rr model should be able to assess the hydrological response of rainfall events at a downstream point of interest while taking into account the spatial variability in rainfall land use interactions the event based empirical soil conservation service curve number scs cn method provides a suitable basis for a computationally efficient rr model as it is widely used conceptually straightforward and easy to implement with the curve number cn model parameter accessible through look up tables describing the impact of land use on surface runoff and the total rainfall of the storm event as model input variable hawkins et al 2009 usda natural resource conservation service 1986 in order for the cn based rr model to be able to assess the impact of spatial distribution of land use changes the default scs cn method was implemented in a distributed raster based approach the tabulated cn values for average soil moisture conditions were adjusted in the rr model to the initial soil moisture conditions prior to the specific rainfall event referred to as the antecedent moisture conditions amc several methods have been proposed in literature to adjust cn values to soil moisture conditions hawkins et al 2009 mishra et al 2008 the scs cn method was also combined with an overland flow routing algorithm describing the lateral movement of overland flow to the outlet since it is critical to take into account spatial interactions between runoff generation propagation and re infiltration along the flow paths gao et al 2015 the scs cn method was extended with a re infiltration algorithm allowing runoff to infiltrate along its flow path few hydrological models have been developed explicitly taking into account re infiltration corradini et al 2000 gao et al 2015 niu et al 2014 and only a limited number of re infiltration algorithms have been developed based on the scs cn method her and heatwole 2016 van loo 2018 consequently additional evaluations are required of the model performance of scs cn based re infiltration algorithms in the conceptualization of the most performant rr model several amc correction and re infiltration algorithms were implemented and their different combinations were evaluated in configurations of the rr model two amc correction methods were tested in the rr model the method proposed by chow et al 1988 as implemented by raes et al 2006 and the method proposed by neitsch et al 2011 as implemented in swat the performance of the scs cn method extended with the re infiltration algorithm proposed by van loo van loo 2018 was also evaluated since only few scs cn based re infiltration algorithms have been developed two other re infiltration algorithms were proposed and tested in order to investigate and compare their performance in addition a limited calibration exercise was performed implementing and evaluating several values for model parameters the different model configurations were applied in three catchments in the region of flanders belgium for a number of storm events occurring between 2000 and 2012 2 material and methods 2 1 default scs cn method the scs

the scs cn method was extended with different alternative model configurations these extended configurations were evaluated to construct a computationally efficient raster based rr model able to propagate runoff through the catchment while taking into account initial soil moisture conditions and re infiltration along the flow paths table 1 provides an overview of the different algorithms with which the default scs cn method was extended each of the tested computationally efficient rr model configurations implemented a combination of one of two amc correction methods one of two λ parameter values and one of three re infiltration algorithms in order to find the most accurate model configuration these parameter values and algorithms are further elaborated on in the following sections 2 2 1 λ parameter in the scs cn method initial abstraction ia is expressed as a fraction λ of the retention s the reference value for λ is 0 2 such that ia 0 2 s however several authors have shown that this assumption leads to an overestimation of ia and that an implementation of a lower alternative λ of 0 05 is more appropriate hawkins et al 2009 woodward et al 2003 the tabulated cn values for a λ

to a dem to calculate re infiltration along these flow paths three re infiltration algorithms were tested in the rr model configurations fig 1 in the first re infiltration method under consideration each pixel s infiltration capacity is based on its initial abstraction ia when rainfall p is lower than ia no runoff is generated on the pixel and its infiltration capacity is assumed as the difference between p and ia if p is higher than ia runoff is generated under the assumption that the pixel s infiltration capacity is saturated and thus 0 this method was tested as it is straightforward estimating infiltration based solely on total rainfall and the basic scs cn parameter ia which inherently contains information on the soil and land use types the performance of the re infiltration method of van loo 2018 schematically depicted in fig 1 was also assessed this method combines the scs cn method with manning s equation to assess runoff and infiltration in each pixel incoming runoff is added to the rainfall in eq 3 to calculate runoff the resulting infiltration is subsequently interpreted as an infiltration rate per hour and is multiplied with the travel time of the overland flow over the pixel the travel time is derived from the flow velocity v m s calculated by manning s equation with rh m the hydraulic radius s m m the slope of the pixel and n s m1 3 the manning s roughness coefficient v m s r h 2 3 s 1 2 n the manning s coefficient n is an index of surface roughness while the hydraulic radius rh is approximated by the flow depth for overland flow mccuen 1998 any excess infiltration is added to runoff to obtain the accumulated runoff flowing to the downstream pixel the re infiltration method of van loo 2018 derives the infiltration from a combination of rainfall and incoming runoff values of incoming flow can thus exceed the range of rainfall amounts used in the derivation of this empirical equation an adaptation of the van loo method was therefore also tested assessing infiltration from rainfall and re infiltration from incoming runoff separately fig 1 runoff from rainfall is calculated with the scs cn method eq 3 re infiltration is calculated by combining the travel time over the pixel eq 9 with the physical soil characteristic of saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat as infiltration rate excess infiltration is added to the runoff from the pixel resulting in the accumulated runoff flowing downstream 2 3 study areas in this study the rr model configurations were implemented with a spatial resolution of 50 m x 50 m the rr model configurations were tested for three catchments in flanders the maarkebeek catchment bellebeek catchment and one of its subcatchments i c the hunselbeek fig 2 the boundaries of these catchmentes were determined based on the location of the flow gauging stations at the outlets of the catchments and the dems of the basins the maarkebeek watershed situated in the upper scheldt river basin has an area of 48 km2 and based on land use data from 2012 agentschap informatie vlaanderen 2016 its land use is predominantly agricultural with arable land and grasslands covering respectively over 40 and 35 of the watershed table 2 forest and urban areas cover approximately one tenth of the maarkebeek catchment the bellebeek catchment with an area of 88 km2 is the more urbanized watershed with urban land use types constituting one fifth of its area the bellebeek watershed is also more afforested 16 than the maarkebeek watershed its agricultural area is dominated by grasslands 40 rather than arable land 25 to assess the performance of the hydrological model over different spatial scales the model performance was also assessed for the hunselbeek catchment a nested subcatchment of the bellebeek amatya et al 2016 the hunselbeek subcatchment has an area of 21 5 km2 thereby comprising nearly a quarter of the larger bellebeek catchment as in the bellebeek catchment 40 of the hunselbeek watershed is covered by grassland while approximately a third of this subcatchment consists of arable land urban areas and forests cover respectively 16 and 13 of the area agentschap informatie vlaanderen 2016 top soil textures in the maarkebeek and bellebeek catchments are silt and silt loam dondeyne et al 2013 the slopes in the study areas applied in manning s equation eq 9 were derived from the filled dem fig 3 vlaanderen and milieumaatschappij 2006 to avoid a flow velocity of zero a minimum slope of 0 001 m m was implemented the maarkebeek catchment has a more accidented terrain than the bellebeek catchment with an average slope of 6 versus 4 in resp the maarkebeek and bellebeek catchment and a maximum slope of approx 24 in both catchments 2 3 1 implementation of model configurations the cn values for a λ of 0 2 were derived from the 2012 land use dataset with 5 m resolution agentschap informatie vlaanderen 2016 and soil information on texture and drainage using look up tables usda natural resource conservation service 1986 fig 4 an overview of the implemented cn values can be found in table 3 the resulting cn dataset was then resampled to a resolution of 50 m using bilinear interpolation fig 4 consequently these cn values were conjugated for a λ of 0 05 according to eq 4 the relevant soil characteristics for the amc correction methods namely soil moisture content at wilting point field capacity and saturation were derived by means of pedotransfer functions from a legacy soil profile database beckers et al 2011 ottoy et al 2015 weynants et al 2009 antecedent moisture content in the top 30 cm of soil was simulated by the distributed hydrological model of arcnemo from 2000 to 2012 for the three study areas raes et al 2009 van opstal et al 2013 manning s equation eq 9 applied in the re infiltration methods of van loo 2018 and its variant ksat derives the travel time over pixels requires values for slope fig 3 the hydraulic radius rh and manning s roughness coefficient n for overland flow rh is approximated by overland flow depth for simplicity a constant and uniform value for flow depth was assumed whereby three rh values were assessed 1 mm 2 mm and 3 mm an increase in rh increases overland flow velocity thereby lowering the travel time over pixels and thus reducing infiltration and increasing runoff volumes the sensitivity of the van loo and ksat re infiltration methods to the rh values was assessed using the sensitivity index s with m the model response variable under consideration pianosi et al 2016 s a b s m x 1 r h δ x m m x 1 r h x m δ r h values for manning s n table 4 were determined based on the 2012 land use dataset agentschap informatie vlaanderen 2016 using look up tables engman and asce 1986 kalyanapu et al 2009 morgan et al 1998 vieux 2016 since seasonality may affect soil roughness for vegetated land cover classes the performance of a manning s n adjusted to the meteorological seasons was also assessed the tabulated manning s n values in table 4 were taken as the base value nb in fall and these were seasonally adjusted depending on the vegetation type nb increased to account for increasing vegetation cover in spring and summer and lowered to account for sparser vegetation in winter arcement and schneider 1989 resulting in higher infiltration and lower runoff in spring and summer than in winter and fall table 4 the saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat mm hr fig 4 implemented in the ksat re infiltration was derived using pedotransfer functions weynants et al 2009 based on the database aardewerk stat beckers et al 2011 ottoy et al 2015 2 3 2 evaluation of model configurations validation data were collected in the form of rainfall events resulting in peak discharges at least 1 5 times higher than the baseflow prior to the event accordingly daily rainfall data were acquired from the rain gauge networks of the royal meteorological institute rmi and the flanders environment agency vmm van opstal et al 2014 discharge data were derived from flow gauging stations at the watershed outlets vlaamse milieumaatschappij et al 2020 based on these data respectively 165 164 and 124 rainfall events were selected for the maarkebeek bellebeek and hunselbeek watersheds table 5 the runoff volumes corresponding to each rainfall event were derived from the hydrographs by separating direct runoff from baseflow using the constant slope method this method separates direct runoff and baseflow using the line between the lowest discharge before the rising limb of the hydrograph and the inflection point on its recession limb mccuen 1998 based on this rainfall event information the rr models modeled the runoff volumes at the outlets the model accuracy was then assessed with the rmse relative to the mean of the observed runoff volumes rrmse i 1 m y obs i y pred i 2 m y obs with m the number of validation events yobs and y obs the runoff volumes derived from the discharge data

maarkebeek bellebeek and hunselbeek catchments based on arcnemo s performance and thresholds reported by ladson and weinmann 2008 the rr model performance was deemed adequate if nse values 0 3 and good if nse 0 5 moriasi et al 2007 3 results the simulations were run on a dell latitude laptop computer with an intel core i7 processor with 4 cores 2 7 ghz cpu and 16 gb ram the average run time of the assessed models was approximately 1 s and 3 s for respectively the maarkebeek 48 km2 and bellebeek 88 km2 catchments the nse and rrmse of the different rr models in the three study areas are provided in resp tables 6 and 7 more models reached the adequate nse threshold of 0 3 for the catchments of the hunselbeek and bellebeek than for the maarkebeek catchment the models performed best in the hunselbeek catchment with higher nse values than the larger bellebeek catchment the results show that the performance of the default scs cn method was inadequate for all three catchments with a relative rmse exceeding the mean of observed runoff volumes and with negative nse values in the maarkebeek and bellebeek catchments and a nse of only 0 14 in the hunselbeek catchment model performance was highly influenced by the different amc correction methods of the two amc correction methods tested the amc correction method of neitsch et al 2011 performed best it generally performed better than equivalent models without amc correction and outperformed the amc correction of chow et al 1988 in the bellebeek and hunselbeek catchments the method of chow et al 1988 did not reach nse of 0 3 in any model configuration and resulted in the highest rmse values in the bellebeek and hunselbeek catchments these findings are not congruent with the results of mishra et al 2008 who found that in estimating amc dependent cn values the method of neitsch et al 2011 performed poorer than the method proposed by chow et al 1988 however mishra et al 2008 did not assess the performance of these methods in modelling runoff volumes of two tested values for λ the original 0 2 usda natural resource conservation service 1986 and the alternative value 0 05 hawkins et al 2001 the λ of 0 05 overall increased model performance thereby underpinning the results of woodward et al 2003 that assigning λ a value of 0 05 provides a more appropriate estimation of the initial abstraction ia in the scs cn method the performance of the different re infiltration methods were influenced by the choice in amc correction method and λ value though overall the van loo re infiltration method outperformed the other methods with more models having adequate to good nse values it is the only re infiltration method to obtain good performance in all three study catchments the p ia re infiltration method deriving infiltration from rainfall and the scs cn variable ia did not improve the model performance of the default scs cn this method only produced adequate to good results for the hunselbeek catchment when combined with the amc correction of neitsch et al 2011 although straightforward with the least model parameters of the three infiltration methods the proposed p ia method is also limited in its ability to adjust to specific conditions e g overland flow velocity seasonal variations overall the van loo method outperformed the ksat method leading to higher nse and lower rrmse values by incorporating the seasonality of vegetation cover in manning s n coefficients model performance increased with the increase in nse higher for models implementing the van loo method the relative variation in nse and rrmse values resp tables 6 and 7 indicate that the van loo re infiltration method is more sensitive to changes in manning s n than the proposed ksat alternative a similar observation can be made for changes in hydraulic radius rh which is confirmed by the average sensitivity index s eq 10 provided in table 8 s is consistently higher for models implementing the van loo re infiltration method than corresponding models implementing its ksat variant the van loo and ksat re infiltration methods derive infiltration by multiplying the infiltration rate with the travel time over pixels the infiltration rate in the van loo re infiltration method is approximated by the infiltration derived from the scs cn method while the infiltration rate in the ksat method is determined by ksat whereas ksat values reach maxima of respectively 20 2 and 7 mm hr in the maarkebeek and bellebeek catchments the infiltration rate in the van loo method can reach much higher values depending on cn parameters rainfall amount and the incoming runoff an equal perturbation in rh and thus travel time will therefore result in higher runoff volume fluctuation in the van loo method in fig 5 the influence of the amc correction methods and λ value in combination with the re infiltration method using scs cn parameters p ia is visualized through log log scatterplots for the bellebeek catchment this figure illustrates that the amc correction of chow et al 1988 overestimates runoff volumes while a more conservative and accurate correction is implemented by the amc correction method of neitsch et al 2011 fig 5 shows an overestimation of runoff volume in two summer events characterized by an average rainfall per pixel exceeding 70 mm this overestimation is reduced by the amc correction of neitsch et al 2011 the 0 05 λ value resulted in an increase in runoff volumes as can be seen in fig 5 the combination of a λ of 0 05 and the correction of chow et al 1988 thus leads to a higher overestimation of runoff volumes reflected in a decrease in nse and increase in rrmse as reflected in tables 6 and 7 the rr models implementing the van loo and ksat re infiltration methods are visualized for the bellebeek catchment in resp figs 6 and 7 the results in tables 6 and 7 show a better model performance of rr model configurations implementing van loo re infiltration fig 6 reflected by less scattering in the plots compared to the p ia fig 5 and ksat methods fig 7 both re infiltration methods were tested with hydraulic radius rh values of 1 mm fig 6a c fig 7a c 2 mm and 3 mm fig 6 d fig 7b d and a seasonally adjusted manning s n fig 6c d fig 7c d the higher sensitivity to variations in rh of the van loo method table 8 is exemplified by comparing the increase in runoff volume from fig 6a c to fig 6b d and from fig 7a c to fig 7b d the increase is higher for the van loo method consequently the only model configurations reaching a good performance with nse values of at least 0 5 in all three study areas were combinations of the amc correction of neitsch et al 2011 and van loo re infiltration method with rh equaling 3 mm and a seasonally adjusted manning s n these configurations reached good model performance for both λ values however the λ of 0 05 resulted in higher nse values in the bellebeek and hunselbeek catchments namely nse values of resp 0 57 0 56 and 0 66 and rrmse values of resp 68 73 and 66 the scatterplots of this model configuration with a λ of 0 05 are provided for the three study catchments in fig 8 these plots mainly show scattering and errors at lower runoff volumes 4 discussion an event based rr model was conceptualized based on the scs cn method with the objective to integrate this model in an iterative optimization procedure evaluating the hydrological impact of land use changes in a downstream area of interest gabriels et al submitted for this purpose eighteen rr model configurations were evaluated in three study areas these model configurations simulate the relationship between rainfall and runoff in a spatially explicit way with a spatial resolution of 50 m this spatial resolution is appropriate for assessing land use changes with sufficient detail while maintaining the high computational efficiency of the model the rr model configurations are each computationally efficient thereby allowing a large number of model simulations to be performed in the context of the optimization framework higher spatial resolutions would negatively impact the computational efficiency of the rr model and limit its application potential in spatial optimization analyses additionally the rr model takes into account spatial interaction along the flow path using re infiltration schemes model performance was evaluated using the nse rrmse and sensitivity index a nse value of 0 5 was set as a threshold to indicate a sufficiently good model performance however a higher threshold value e g of 0 8 ritter and muñoz carpena 2013 is typically applied to indicate good model performance however given its specific application purpose in an iterative optimization approach the emphasis is on a relative comparison of land use changes in alternative locations rather than an absolute representation of runoff volume a lower nse threshold was tolerated volk et al 2010 yeo and guldmann 2010 by incorporating the seasonality of vegetation cover in manning s n coefficients model performance increased for both re infiltration methods using manning s equation with the increase in nse higher for the van loo method despite the lack of calibration of model parameters as only three uniformly distributed values for rh were tested this model configuration was considered sufficiently accurate to be implemented in an iterative optimization framework comparing the impact of land use changes at different locations in catchments the limited sensitivity analysis presented in table 8 shows that the van loo re infiltration method is sensitive to variations in the hydraulic radius rh to limit the rr model complexity and maintain its efficiency the hydraulic radius rh was assumed constant and uniform across the catchments three values for rh were assessed in the conceptualization of the rr model which ranged between 1 mm and 3 mm these values were assumed to represent an average overland flow depth over the catchment by assuming constant values for rh the runoff rate determined in the manning s equation is solely dependent on a pixel s soil roughness as represented by manning s n and its slope increasing the value for rh in the rr models will thus increase the runoff rate and correspondingly the simulated runoff volumes fig 7 indicates that rr models implementing a value of rh of 1 mm underestimate the hydraulic radius this is also reflected by field data measurements collected by knapen et al 2009 of the hydraulic radius in agricultural fields in flanders which ranged between 4 and 15 mm for conventionally tilled field plots without vegetation residue as the sensitivity analysis of rh indicates that the rr model implementing the re infiltration scheme of van loo 2018 is sensitive to variations in rh table 8 a more extensive calibration and validation is required for this model parameter evaluating a wider range of higher values for rh on an independent set of observations alternatively the approach proposed by liu et al 2003 using a power relationship to relate the hydraulic radius and the upstream area of a pixel could also be evaluated as this approach would make the values of rh less arbitrary however this alternative approach would require additional calibration and adds complexity to the rr model thereby limiting its applicability in spatial optimization analyses the van loo re infiltration method is also more sensitive to variations in manning s roughness coefficient n as reflected in tables 6 and 7 the seasonal adjustments to manning s n table 5 increase runoff volume in winter and decrease it in spring and summer improving as reflected in the nse values though this is congruent with the findings of fu et al 2019 that manning s n is affected by vegetation cover these overall seasonal variations in runoff volume may not necessarily reflect solely variations in vegetation cover soil structure also influences manning s n and thus seasonal agricultural practices impacting soil structure such as tillage will also influence runoff generation overland flow and re infiltration processes gabriel et al 2019 maetens et al 2012 for instance variations in soil structure and tillage practices can lead to preferential flow paths appels et al 2011 the effect of which are not considered in the rr model configurations moreover vegetation cover in arable fields also depends on the crop type e g maize stalks provide minimal cover to the soil and will contribute minimally to an increase in manning s n correspondingly an increase in manning s n in summer in forests reflects an increase in undergrowth however an increase in the litter layer in fall can also justify the implementation of a higher manning s n in this season consequently the seasonal variations in manning s n implemented in this study are too coarse to take into consideration these spatial variations a more extensive literature review including data from field trials and a sensitivity analysis should be carried out to further refine these adjustments in manning s n to incorporate seasonal variations in vegetation cover and soil structure the rr model configurations leading to the highest nse values combines the amc method of neitsch et al 2011 a λ value of 0 05 and the re infiltration method of van loo 2018 with a seasonally adjusted manning s roughness coefficient n this model configuration results in nse values of resp 0 57 0 56 and 0 66 in the maarkebeek bellebeek and hunselbeek however the developed rr model is highly empirical not accounting for the physical soil and hydrological processes but rather approximating these processes with model parameters cn2 and manning s n derived from look up tables consequently the implementation of an alternative amc or re infiltration method may compensate or exacerbate inadequate representation of these parameters this is an indication of the issue of equifinality where the same output can be obtained with different combinations of multiple parameter values beven 2006 this issue is exacerbated by the lack of full calibration and validation of the rr model consequently it is important to note that no absolute conclusion can be drawn from this study regarding the performance of the assessed methods rather the van loo neitsch configuration with λ equaling 0 05 is found to perform best in the maarkebeek bellebeek and hunselbeek catchments given the initial choice of parameters to draw more general conclusions a more extensive calibration validation and sensitivity analysis is required based on more catchments however given its computational efficiency while being spatial explicit the model is applicable for spatial optimization analyses that require a large number of model simulations 5 conclusion the aim of this study was to conceptualize and implement a computationally efficient spatially distributed rr model taking into account overland flow routing and re infiltration along the flow paths for use in applications requiring iterative optimization e g for determining spatially explicit land use distributions that minimize flood hazard several configurations of the widely used scs cn model were tested whereby the configurations differed in amc correction method re infiltration algorithm and values for λ rh and manning s n since few re infiltration algorithms based on the scs cn method have been reported on two alternative approaches were proposed and tested in addition to the method implemented by van loo van loo 2018 the model configurations were used to simulate event based runoff volumes in three catchments in flanders belgium the maarkebeek catchment 48 km2 bellebeek catchment 88 km2 and its subcatchment of the hunselbeek 21 5 km2 to evaluate model performance nse values were calculated for respectively 165 164 and 124 rainfall events in these catchments the results clearly indicated higher nse values for a λ value of 0 05 woodward et al 2003 the amc correction method implemented in the swat model neitsch et al 2011 and the re infiltration method proposed by van loo 2018 taking into account overland flow velocity with a hydraulic radius rh of 3 mm and manning s roughness coefficients n adjusted to seasonal variations in vegetation cover this scs cn model configuration achieved nse values of 0 57 0 56 and 0 66 in the three studied catchments which was deemed sufficiently accurate to assess and compare the hydrological impacts of land use alternatives however since a full calibration and validation of the rr model is lacking a high level of uncertainty is connected to the parameters implemented in the rr model as such the conclusion that the rr model configuration of van loo neitsch with a λ value of 0 05 outperforms all other tested configurations is not an absolute finding nevertheless the conceptualized rr model is able to assess hydrological impacts in a computationally efficient and spatially explicit way allowing for spatial interaction through re infiltration this allows us to apply the model for spatial optimization analyses given the current implementation of parameter values it is deemed sufficiently accurate in its application in the maarkebeek bellebeek and hunselbeek catchments for integration in future iterative spatial optimization analyses in these catchments credit

4263,due to their large computational burden spatially distributed hydrological models are unsuitable for iterative spatial optimization analyses which need to take into account location specific runoff water accumulation and re infiltration processes therefore a computationally efficient raster based and spatially explicit rr model was conceptualized for this purpose the scs cn approach was implemented in a spatially distributed manner adjusting cn values to antecedent soil moisture conditions amc and routing runoff to the catchment outlet to take into account spatial interaction along the overland flow paths the scs cn approach was extended with a re infiltration algorithm several model configurations were evaluated based on combinations of two amc correction methods and three re infiltration algorithms these model configurations were applied in three catchments in flanders belgium the results indicate a poor performance of the default scs cn method which was however considerably improved by the implementation of amc correction and re infiltration though calibration of the rr model configurations was limited several model configurations achieved model performances adequate for use in spatial optimization analyses the most performant rr model configuration nse of 0 57 0 56 and 0 64 for the three catchments implements a λ of 0 05 the amc correction method proposed by neitsch et al 2011 and the re infiltration method of van loo 2018 calculating overland flow velocity with manning s n adjusted to seasonal vegetation cover variations as this model allows for spatial interaction through re infiltration but with limited computation times it is well applicable for iterative spatial optimization analyses although a more extensive calibration and validation exercise on catchments with a wider range of characteristics is required to provide a general assessment of its applicability and accuracy keywords rainfall runoff distributed hydrological model re infiltration spatial interaction computational efficiency scs cn method 1 introduction the relationship between rainfall and runoff is an important driver of hydrological processes at the watershed scale this relationship is influenced by meteorological and watershed variables such as slope soil soil cover characteristics and surface roughness mccuen 1998 human activities can significantly alter both types of variables rainfall in many regions is becoming more erratic under anthropogenic climate change going along with an increasing occurrence of extreme precipitation events ipcc 2014 while land use land cover lulc changes such as urbanization affect infiltration capacity vegetation cover and surface roughness braud et al 2013 united nations 2019 yan et al 2013 consequently adequate rainfall runoff rr models able to assess the table 4 impact of land use changes on hydrological processes and water resources are increasingly needed to support sustainable spatial planning policy breuer et al 2009 yan et al 2013 given the spatial variability of watershed characteristics and lulc changes rr models assessing the hydrological impacts of land use changes are typically process based spatially semi distributed models e g the topography based hydrological model mike she dhi software 2008 soil and water assessment tool swat neitsch et al 2011 and topmodel beven and kirkby 1979 gao et al 2015 however given their high computational times jakeman and hornberger 1993 perrin et al 2001 sivakumar 2008 applications of distributed hydrological models assessing the hydrological impact of land use changes have mostly been limited to analyses of predefined scenarios assessing what if problems requiring a limited number of model simulations fang et al 2013 gao et al 2015 kalantari et al 2014 wu et al 2015 yu et al 2018 however spatial optimization analyses are required to assess the more practical where should issues identifying the optimal land use change scenario based on a specific objective e g flood hazard consequently the integration of hydrological models in spatial optimization analyses allows the identification of land use patterns optimizing hydrological functions in catchment areas such hydrological optimization analyses can thereby provide additional information to policy makers river basin managers and spatial planners however given their bigger search space these optimization analyses require a large number of model simulations and have a high computational burden volk et al 2010 to reduce the computational requirements optimization analyses often rely on heuristic algorithms e g genetic algorithms to limit the search space thereby rather approximating the global optimal solution lin et al 2009 seppelt and voinov 2003 yeo and guldmann 2010 alternatively to allow for a more complete assessment of the search space the computational requirements of the model integrated in the optimization analysis can be lowered for instance by reducing its complexity while maintaining enough accuracy to compare and evaluate land use interventions volk et al 2010 this paper therefore focuses on the conceptualization of a computationally efficient rr model which can be integrated in further research in spatial optimization applications for example with the aim to identify spatial land use patterns minimizing flood hazard in a catchment for this purpose the rr model should be able to assess the hydrological response of rainfall events at a downstream point of interest while taking into account the spatial variability in rainfall land use interactions the event based empirical soil conservation service curve number scs cn method provides a suitable basis for a computationally efficient rr model as it is widely used conceptually straightforward and easy to implement with the curve number cn model parameter accessible through look up tables describing the impact of land use on surface runoff and the total rainfall of the storm event as model input variable hawkins et al 2009 usda natural resource conservation service 1986 in order for the cn based rr model to be able to assess the impact of spatial distribution of land use changes the default scs cn method was implemented in a distributed raster based approach the tabulated cn values for average soil moisture conditions were adjusted in the rr model to the initial soil moisture conditions prior to the specific rainfall event referred to as the antecedent moisture conditions amc several methods have been proposed in literature to adjust cn values to soil moisture conditions hawkins et al 2009 mishra et al 2008 the scs cn method was also combined with an overland flow routing algorithm describing the lateral movement of overland flow to the outlet since it is critical to take into account spatial interactions between runoff generation propagation and re infiltration along the flow paths gao et al 2015 the scs cn method was extended with a re infiltration algorithm allowing runoff to infiltrate along its flow path few hydrological models have been developed explicitly taking into account re infiltration corradini et al 2000 gao et al 2015 niu et al 2014 and only a limited number of re infiltration algorithms have been developed based on the scs cn method her and heatwole 2016 van loo 2018 consequently additional evaluations are required of the model performance of scs cn based re infiltration algorithms in the conceptualization of the most performant rr model several amc correction and re infiltration algorithms were implemented and their different combinations were evaluated in configurations of the rr model two amc correction methods were tested in the rr model the method proposed by chow et al 1988 as implemented by raes et al 2006 and the method proposed by neitsch et al 2011 as implemented in swat the performance of the scs cn method extended with the re infiltration algorithm proposed by van loo van loo 2018 was also evaluated since only few scs cn based re infiltration algorithms have been developed two other re infiltration algorithms were proposed and tested in order to investigate and compare their performance in addition a limited calibration exercise was performed implementing and evaluating several values for model parameters the different model configurations were applied in three catchments in the region of flanders belgium for a number of storm events occurring between 2000 and 2012 2 material and methods 2 1 default scs cn method the scs

implements the reference tabulated cn values without taking into account overland flow routing or corresponding re infiltration 2 2 extended scs cn model configurations the default implementation of the scs cn method was extended with different alternative model configurations these extended configurations were evaluated to construct a computationally efficient raster based rr model able to propagate runoff through the catchment while taking into account initial soil moisture conditions and re infiltration along the flow paths table 1 provides an overview of the different algorithms with which the default scs cn method was extended each of the tested computationally efficient rr model configurations implemented a combination of one of two amc correction methods one of two λ parameter values and one of three re infiltration algorithms in order to find the most accurate model configuration these parameter values and algorithms are further elaborated on in the following sections 2 2 1 λ parameter in the scs cn method initial abstraction ia is expressed as a fraction λ of the retention s the reference value for λ is 0 2 such that ia 0 2 s however several authors have shown that this assumption leads to an overestimation of ia and that an implementation of a lower alternative λ of 0 05 is more appropriate hawkins et al 2009 woodward et al 2003 the tabulated cn values for a λ of 0 2 need to be conjugated to fit a λ of 0 05 according to eq 4 hawkins et al 2009 cn λ 0 05 100 1 879 100 cn λ 0 2 1 1 15 1 the performance of both λ values in the rr model configurations were

wet conditions corresponding to field capacity amc iii cn3 usda natural resource conservation service 1986 two amc correction methods based on chow et al 1988 and neitsch et al 2011 were tested in the rr model configurations next to implementing the tabulated cn2 values without amc correction the amc correction method of chow et al 1988 was implemented in the budget model of raes et al 2006 combining them with relationships derived from smedema and rycroft 1983 chow et al 1988 determined cn1 and cn3 corresponding to amc i and amc iii from cn2 according to resp eqs 5 and 6 based on the

to a dem to calculate re infiltration along these flow paths three re infiltration algorithms were tested in the rr model configurations fig 1 in the first re infiltration method under consideration each pixel s infiltration capacity is based on its initial abstraction ia when rainfall p is lower than ia no runoff is generated on the pixel and its infiltration capacity is assumed as the difference between p and ia if p is higher than ia runoff is generated under the assumption that the pixel s infiltration capacity is saturated and thus 0 this method was tested as it is straightforward estimating infiltration based solely on total rainfall and the basic scs cn parameter ia which inherently contains information on the soil and land use types the performance of the re infiltration method of van loo 2018 schematically depicted in fig 1 was also assessed this method combines the scs cn method with manning s equation to assess runoff and infiltration in each pixel incoming runoff is added to the rainfall in eq 3 to calculate runoff the resulting infiltration is subsequently interpreted as an infiltration rate per hour and is multiplied with the travel time of the overland flow over the pixel the travel time is derived from the flow velocity v m s calculated by manning s equation with rh m the hydraulic radius s m m the slope of the pixel and n s m1 3 the manning s roughness coefficient v m s r h 2 3 s 1 2 n the manning s coefficient n is an index of surface roughness while the hydraulic radius rh is approximated by the flow depth for overland flow mccuen 1998 any excess infiltration is added to runoff to obtain the accumulated runoff flowing to the downstream pixel the re infiltration method of van loo 2018 derives the infiltration from a combination of rainfall and incoming runoff values of incoming flow can thus exceed the range of rainfall amounts used in the derivation of this empirical equation an adaptation of the van loo method was therefore also tested assessing infiltration from rainfall and re infiltration from incoming runoff separately fig 1 runoff from rainfall is calculated with the scs cn method eq 3 re infiltration is calculated by combining the travel time over the pixel eq 9 with the physical soil characteristic of saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat as infiltration rate excess infiltration is added to the runoff from the pixel resulting in the accumulated runoff flowing downstream 2 3 study areas in this study the rr model configurations were implemented with a spatial resolution of 50 m x 50 m the rr model configurations were tested for three catchments in flanders the maarkebeek catchment bellebeek catchment and one of its subcatchments i c the hunselbeek fig 2 the boundaries of these catchmentes were determined based on the location of the flow gauging stations at the outlets of the catchments and the dems of the basins the maarkebeek watershed situated in the upper scheldt river basin has an area of 48 km2 and based on land use data from 2012 agentschap informatie vlaanderen 2016 its land use is predominantly agricultural with arable land and grasslands covering respectively over 40 and 35 of the watershed table 2 forest and urban areas cover approximately one tenth of the maarkebeek catchment the bellebeek catchment with an area of 88 km2 is the more urbanized watershed with urban land use types constituting one fifth of its area the bellebeek watershed is also more afforested 16 than the maarkebeek watershed its agricultural area is dominated by grasslands 40 rather than arable land 25 to assess the performance of the hydrological model over different spatial scales the model performance was also assessed for the hunselbeek catchment a nested subcatchment of the bellebeek amatya et al 2016 the hunselbeek subcatchment has an area of 21 5 km2 thereby comprising nearly a quarter of the larger bellebeek catchment as in the bellebeek catchment 40 of the hunselbeek watershed is covered by grassland while approximately a third of this subcatchment consists of arable land urban areas and forests cover respectively 16 and 13 of the area agentschap informatie vlaanderen 2016 top soil textures in the maarkebeek and bellebeek catchments are silt and silt loam dondeyne et al 2013 the slopes in the study areas applied in manning s equation eq 9 were derived from the filled dem fig 3 vlaanderen and milieumaatschappij 2006 to avoid a flow velocity of zero a minimum slope of 0 001 m m was implemented the maarkebeek catchment has a more accidented terrain than the bellebeek catchment with an average slope of 6 versus 4 in resp the maarkebeek and bellebeek catchment and a maximum slope of approx 24 in both catchments 2 3 1 implementation of model configurations the cn values for a λ of 0 2 were derived from the 2012 land use dataset with 5 m resolution agentschap informatie vlaanderen 2016 and soil information on texture and drainage using look up tables usda natural resource conservation service 1986 fig 4 an overview of the implemented cn values can be found in table 3 the resulting cn dataset was then resampled to a resolution of 50 m using bilinear interpolation fig 4 consequently these cn values were conjugated for a λ of 0 05 according to eq 4 the relevant soil characteristics for the amc correction methods namely soil moisture content at wilting point field capacity and saturation were derived by means of pedotransfer functions from a legacy soil profile database beckers et al 2011 ottoy et al 2015 weynants et al 2009 antecedent moisture content in the top 30 cm of soil was simulated by the distributed hydrological model of arcnemo from 2000 to 2012 for the three study areas raes et al 2009 van opstal et al 2013 manning s equation eq 9 applied in the re infiltration methods of van loo 2018 and its variant ksat derives the travel time over pixels requires values for slope fig 3 the hydraulic radius rh and manning s roughness coefficient n for overland flow rh is approximated by overland flow depth for simplicity a constant and uniform value for flow depth was assumed whereby three rh values were assessed 1 mm 2 mm and 3 mm an increase in rh increases overland flow velocity thereby lowering the travel time over pixels and thus reducing infiltration and increasing runoff volumes the sensitivity of the van loo and ksat re infiltration methods to the rh values was assessed using the sensitivity index s with m the model response variable under consideration pianosi et al 2016 s a b s m x 1 r h δ x m m x 1 r h x m δ r h values for manning s n table 4 were determined based on the 2012 land use dataset agentschap informatie vlaanderen 2016 using look up tables engman and asce 1986 kalyanapu et al 2009 morgan et al 1998 vieux 2016 since seasonality may affect soil roughness for vegetated land cover classes the performance of a manning s n adjusted to the meteorological seasons was also assessed the tabulated manning s n values in table 4 were taken as the base value nb in fall and these were seasonally adjusted depending on the vegetation type nb increased to account for increasing vegetation cover in spring and summer and lowered to account for sparser vegetation in winter arcement and schneider 1989 resulting in higher infiltration and lower runoff in spring and summer than in winter and fall table 4 the saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat mm hr fig 4 implemented in the ksat re infiltration was derived using pedotransfer functions weynants et al 2009 based on the database aardewerk stat beckers et al 2011 ottoy et al 2015 2 3 2 evaluation of model configurations validation data were collected in the form of rainfall events resulting in peak discharges at least 1 5 times higher than the baseflow prior to the event accordingly daily rainfall data were acquired from the rain gauge networks of the royal meteorological institute rmi and the flanders environment agency vmm van opstal et al 2014 discharge data were derived from flow gauging stations at the watershed outlets vlaamse milieumaatschappij et al 2020 based on these data respectively 165 164 and 124 rainfall events were selected for the maarkebeek bellebeek and hunselbeek watersheds table 5 the runoff volumes corresponding to each rainfall event were derived from the hydrographs by separating direct runoff from baseflow using the constant slope method this method separates direct runoff and baseflow using the line between the lowest discharge before the rising limb of the hydrograph and the inflection point on its recession limb mccuen 1998 based on this rainfall event information the rr models modeled the runoff volumes at the outlets the model accuracy was then assessed with the rmse relative to the mean of the observed runoff volumes rrmse i 1 m y obs i y pred i 2 m y obs with m the number of validation events yobs and y obs the runoff volumes derived from the discharge data and their mean and ypred the runoff volumes calculated by the rr model model accuracy was also evaluated based on the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 nse 1 i 1 m y obs i y pred i 2 i 1 m y obs i y obs i 2 the nse assesses model performance compared to the mean of the observed values with negative nses indicating a model prediction worse than the mean while a nse of 1 representing a perfect prediction arcnemo calculated daily discharge simulations between 2001 and 2010 for the studied catchments which resulted in nses of respectively 0 42 0 33 and 0 43 for the maarkebeek bellebeek and hunselbeek catchments based on arcnemo s performance and thresholds reported by ladson and weinmann 2008 the rr model performance was deemed adequate if nse values 0 3 and good if nse 0 5 moriasi et al 2007 3 results the simulations were run on a dell latitude laptop computer with an intel core i7 processor with 4 cores 2 7 ghz cpu and 16 gb ram the average run time of the assessed models was approximately 1 s and 3 s for respectively the maarkebeek 48 km2 and bellebeek 88 km2 catchments the nse and rrmse of the different rr models in the three study areas are provided in resp tables 6 and 7 more models reached the adequate nse threshold of 0 3 for the catchments of the hunselbeek and bellebeek than for the maarkebeek catchment the models performed best in the hunselbeek catchment with higher nse values than the larger bellebeek catchment the results show that the performance of the default scs cn method was inadequate for all three catchments with a relative rmse exceeding the mean of observed runoff volumes and with negative nse values in the maarkebeek and bellebeek catchments and a nse of only 0 14 in the hunselbeek catchment model performance was highly influenced by the different amc correction methods of the two amc correction methods tested the amc correction method of neitsch et al 2011 performed best it generally performed better than equivalent models without amc correction and outperformed the amc correction of chow et al 1988 in the bellebeek and hunselbeek catchments the method of chow et al 1988 did not reach nse of 0 3 in any model configuration and resulted in the highest rmse values in the bellebeek and hunselbeek catchments these findings are not congruent with the results of mishra et al 2008 who found that in estimating amc dependent cn values the method of neitsch et al 2011 performed poorer than the method proposed by chow et al 1988 however mishra et al 2008 did not assess the performance of these methods in modelling runoff volumes of two tested values for λ the original 0 2 usda natural resource conservation service 1986 and the alternative value 0 05 hawkins et al 2001 the λ of 0 05 overall increased model performance thereby underpinning the results of woodward et al 2003 that assigning λ a value of 0 05 provides a more appropriate estimation of the initial abstraction ia in the scs cn method the performance of the different re infiltration methods were influenced by the choice in amc correction method and λ value though overall the van loo re infiltration method outperformed the other methods with more models having adequate to good nse values it is the only re infiltration method to obtain good performance in all three study catchments the p ia re infiltration method deriving infiltration from rainfall and the scs cn variable ia did not improve the model performance of the default scs cn this method only produced adequate to good results for the hunselbeek catchment when combined with the amc correction of neitsch et al 2011 although straightforward with the least model parameters of the three infiltration methods the proposed p ia method is also limited in its ability to adjust to specific conditions e g overland flow velocity seasonal variations overall the van loo method outperformed the ksat method leading to higher nse and lower rrmse values by incorporating the seasonality of vegetation cover in manning s n coefficients model performance increased with the increase in nse higher for models implementing the van loo method the relative variation in nse and rrmse values resp tables 6 and 7 indicate that the van loo re infiltration method is more sensitive to changes in manning s n than the proposed ksat alternative a similar observation can be made for changes in hydraulic radius rh which is confirmed by the average sensitivity index s eq 10 provided in table 8 s is consistently higher for models implementing the van loo re infiltration method than corresponding models implementing its ksat variant the van loo and ksat re infiltration methods derive infiltration by multiplying the infiltration rate with the travel time over pixels the infiltration rate in the van loo re infiltration method is approximated by the infiltration derived from the scs cn method while the infiltration rate in the ksat method is determined by ksat whereas ksat values reach maxima of respectively 20 2 and 7 mm hr in the maarkebeek and bellebeek catchments the infiltration rate in the van loo method can reach much higher values depending on cn parameters rainfall amount and the incoming runoff an equal perturbation in rh and thus travel time will therefore result in higher runoff volume fluctuation in the van loo method in fig 5 the influence of the amc correction methods and λ value in combination with the re infiltration method using scs cn parameters p ia is visualized through log log scatterplots for the bellebeek catchment this figure illustrates that the amc correction of chow et al 1988 overestimates runoff volumes while a more conservative and accurate correction is implemented by the amc correction method of neitsch et al 2011 fig 5 shows an overestimation of runoff volume in two summer events characterized by an average rainfall per pixel exceeding 70 mm this overestimation is reduced by the amc correction of neitsch et al 2011 the 0 05 λ value resulted in an increase in runoff volumes as can be seen in fig 5 the combination of a λ of 0 05 and the correction of chow et al 1988 thus leads to a higher overestimation of runoff volumes reflected in a decrease in nse and increase in rrmse as reflected in tables 6 and 7 the rr models implementing the van loo and ksat re infiltration methods are visualized for the bellebeek catchment in resp figs 6 and 7 the results in tables 6 and 7 show a better model performance of rr model configurations implementing van loo re infiltration fig 6 reflected by less scattering in the plots compared to the p ia fig 5 and ksat methods fig 7 both re infiltration methods were tested with hydraulic radius rh values of 1 mm fig 6a c fig 7a c 2 mm and 3 mm fig 6 d fig 7b d and a seasonally adjusted manning s n fig 6c d fig 7c d the higher sensitivity to variations in rh of the van loo method table 8 is exemplified by comparing the increase in runoff volume from fig 6a c to fig 6b d and from fig 7a c to fig 7b d the increase is higher for the van loo method consequently the only model configurations reaching a good performance with nse values of at least 0 5 in all three study areas were combinations of the amc correction of neitsch et al 2011 and van loo re infiltration method with rh equaling 3 mm and a seasonally adjusted manning s n these configurations reached good model performance for both λ values however the λ of 0 05 resulted in higher nse values in the bellebeek and hunselbeek catchments namely nse values of resp 0 57 0 56 and 0 66 and rrmse values of resp 68 73 and 66 the scatterplots of this model configuration with a λ of 0 05 are provided for the three study catchments in fig 8 these plots mainly show scattering and errors at lower runoff volumes 4 discussion an event based rr model was conceptualized based on the scs cn method with the objective to integrate this model in an iterative optimization procedure evaluating the hydrological impact of land use changes in a downstream area of interest gabriels et al submitted for this purpose eighteen rr model configurations were evaluated in three study areas these model configurations simulate the relationship between rainfall and runoff in a spatially explicit way with a spatial resolution of 50 m this spatial resolution is appropriate for assessing land use changes with sufficient detail while maintaining the high computational efficiency of the model the rr model configurations are each computationally efficient thereby allowing a large number of model simulations to be performed in the context of the optimization framework higher spatial resolutions would negatively impact the computational efficiency of the rr model and limit its application potential in spatial optimization analyses additionally the rr model takes into account spatial interaction along the flow path using re infiltration schemes model performance was evaluated using the nse rrmse and sensitivity index a nse value of 0 5 was set as a threshold to indicate a sufficiently good model performance however a higher threshold value e g of 0 8 ritter and muñoz carpena 2013 is typically applied to indicate good model performance however given its specific application purpose in an iterative optimization approach the emphasis is on a relative comparison of land use changes in alternative locations rather than an absolute representation of runoff volume a lower nse threshold was tolerated volk et al 2010 yeo and guldmann 2010 by incorporating the seasonality of vegetation cover in manning s n coefficients model performance increased for both re infiltration methods using manning s equation with the increase in nse higher for the van loo method despite the lack of calibration of model parameters as only three uniformly distributed values for rh were tested this model configuration was considered sufficiently accurate to be implemented in an iterative optimization framework comparing the impact of land use changes at different locations in catchments the limited sensitivity analysis presented in table 8 shows that the van loo re infiltration method is sensitive to variations in the hydraulic radius rh to limit the rr model complexity and maintain its efficiency the hydraulic radius rh was assumed constant and uniform across the catchments three values for rh were assessed in the conceptualization of the rr model which ranged between 1 mm and 3 mm these values were assumed to represent an average overland flow depth over the catchment by assuming constant values for rh the runoff rate determined in the manning s equation is solely dependent on a pixel s soil roughness as represented by manning s n and its slope increasing the value for rh in the rr models will thus increase the runoff rate and correspondingly the simulated runoff volumes fig 7 indicates that rr models implementing a value of rh of 1 mm underestimate the hydraulic radius this is also reflected by field data measurements collected by knapen et al 2009 of the hydraulic radius in agricultural fields in flanders which ranged between 4 and 15 mm for conventionally tilled field plots without vegetation residue as the sensitivity analysis of rh indicates that the rr model implementing the re infiltration scheme of van loo 2018 is sensitive to variations in rh table 8 a more extensive calibration and validation is required for this model parameter evaluating a wider range of higher values for rh on an independent set of observations alternatively the approach proposed by liu et al 2003 using a power relationship to relate the hydraulic radius and the upstream area of a pixel could also be evaluated as this approach would make the values of rh less arbitrary however this alternative approach would require additional calibration and adds complexity to the rr model thereby limiting its applicability in spatial optimization analyses the van loo re infiltration method is also more sensitive to variations in manning s roughness coefficient n as reflected in tables 6 and 7 the seasonal adjustments to manning s n table 5 increase runoff volume in winter and decrease it in spring and summer improving as reflected in the nse values though this is congruent with the findings of fu et al 2019 that manning s n is affected by vegetation cover these overall seasonal variations in runoff volume may not necessarily reflect solely variations in vegetation cover soil structure also influences manning s n and thus seasonal agricultural practices impacting soil structure such as tillage will also influence runoff generation overland flow and re infiltration processes gabriel et al 2019 maetens et al 2012 for instance variations in soil structure and tillage practices can lead to preferential flow paths appels et al 2011 the effect of which are not considered in the rr model configurations moreover vegetation cover in arable fields also depends on the crop type e g maize stalks provide minimal cover to the soil and will contribute minimally to an increase in manning s n correspondingly an increase in manning s n in summer in forests reflects an increase in undergrowth however an increase in the litter layer in fall can also justify the implementation of a higher manning s n in this season consequently the seasonal variations in manning s n implemented in this study are too coarse to take into consideration these spatial variations a more extensive literature review including data from field trials and a sensitivity analysis should be carried out to further refine these adjustments in manning s n to incorporate seasonal variations in vegetation cover and soil structure the rr model configurations leading to the highest nse values combines the amc method of neitsch et al 2011 a λ value of 0 05 and the re infiltration method of van loo 2018 with a seasonally adjusted manning s roughness coefficient n this model configuration results in nse values of resp 0 57 0 56 and 0 66 in the maarkebeek bellebeek and hunselbeek however the developed rr model is highly empirical not accounting for the physical soil and hydrological processes but rather approximating these processes with model parameters cn2 and manning s n derived from look up tables consequently the implementation of an alternative amc or re infiltration method may compensate or exacerbate inadequate representation of these parameters this is an indication of the issue of equifinality where the same output can be obtained with different combinations of multiple parameter values beven 2006 this issue is exacerbated by the lack of full calibration and validation of the rr model consequently it is important to note that no absolute conclusion can be drawn from this study regarding the performance of the assessed methods rather the van loo neitsch configuration with λ equaling 0 05 is found to perform best in the maarkebeek bellebeek and hunselbeek catchments given the initial choice of parameters to draw more general conclusions a more extensive calibration validation and sensitivity analysis is required based on more catchments however given its computational efficiency while being spatial explicit the model is applicable for spatial optimization analyses that require a large number of model simulations 5 conclusion the aim of this study was to conceptualize and implement a computationally efficient spatially distributed rr model taking into account overland flow routing and re infiltration along the flow paths for use in applications requiring iterative optimization e g for determining spatially explicit land use distributions that minimize flood hazard several configurations of the widely used scs cn model were tested whereby the configurations differed in amc correction method re infiltration algorithm and values for λ rh and manning s n since few re infiltration algorithms based on the scs cn method have been reported on two alternative approaches were proposed and tested in addition to the method implemented by van loo van loo 2018 the model configurations were used to simulate event based runoff volumes in three catchments in flanders belgium the maarkebeek catchment 48 km2 bellebeek catchment 88 km2 and its subcatchment of the hunselbeek 21 5 km2 to evaluate model performance nse values were calculated for respectively 165 164 and 124 rainfall events in these catchments the results clearly indicated higher nse values for a λ value of 0 05 woodward et al 2003 the amc correction method implemented in the swat model neitsch et al 2011 and the re infiltration method proposed by van loo 2018 taking into account overland flow velocity with a hydraulic radius rh of 3 mm and manning s roughness coefficients n adjusted to seasonal variations in vegetation cover this scs cn model configuration achieved nse values of 0 57 0 56 and 0 66 in the three studied catchments which was deemed sufficiently accurate to assess and compare the hydrological impacts of land use alternatives however since a full calibration and validation of the rr model is lacking a high level of uncertainty is connected to the parameters implemented in the rr model as such the conclusion that the rr model configuration of van loo neitsch with a λ value of 0 05 outperforms all other tested configurations is not an absolute finding nevertheless the conceptualized rr model is able to assess hydrological impacts in a computationally efficient and spatially explicit way allowing for spatial interaction through re infiltration this allows us to apply the model for spatial optimization analyses given the current implementation of parameter values it is deemed sufficiently accurate in its application in the maarkebeek bellebeek and hunselbeek catchments for integration in future iterative spatial optimization analyses in these catchments credit

meteorological forcing and hydrological data in the shuidong forest wetland catchment sfwc were continuously measured by eddy covariance ec tower and water monitoring instruments from 2019 to 2020

hydrology in sfwc an in situ continuous monitoring station was set up in the outlet the whole monitoring time began at 18 july and ended at 26 oct 2020 lasting 40 days which belongs to the rainy

water monitoring instruments was demonstrated in fig 3 a potable greenhouse gas analyzer ps 3010 abb canada was used to observe the soil co2 flux from farmland forest and wetland respectively three independent plots 1 m 1 m were set up within a 5 m 5 m area at each land use to guarantee reliability of measured results all selected plots were located in the footprint of the ec tower the in situ greenhouse gas measurement experiment was conducted on 25 aug 2020 and 18 to 20 apr 2021 following a medium rain fig 3 c and fig s4 2 5 laboratory analysis of water and soil samples the dissolved

was analyzed without hydrochloride acid pretreatment yu et al 2018 fluorescence excitation emission matrices eems were collected with a spectrofluorometer f4600 hitachi japan equipped with a 150 w xenon arc lamp at 20 using 10 nm excitation and emission slit widths yao et al 2011 hoge et al 1993 parallel factor analysis parafac was increasingly used to decompose fluorescence eems into their underlying chemical components and conducted in matlab r2019a based on the dreem toolbox 0 6 0 murphy et al 2013 murphy et al 2014 this toolbox for matlab is presented to support improved visualization and sensitivity analyses of parafac models in fluorescence spectroscopy 2 6 calculation formulas q10 was used to describe the temperature sensitivity of soil respiration at an interval of 10 c meyer et al 2018 detailed calculation method was shown as follows 1 re a e x p b t a 2 q 10 e x p 10 b where re lloyd and taylor 1994 is the ecosystem respiration g c m 2 d 1 ta is the air temperature c and a b are constants fitted to the regression equation the sw soil water content mm is the amount of water in soil column of 50 cm below the surface of the soil calculated by using the following equation huang et al 2013 3 sw ρ h w where ρ is the bulk soil density at a certain depth g cm 3 h is the thickness of the soil layer mm and w is the soil moisture at depths of 10 20 and 50 cm this equation can be divided two parts 1 the volumetric water content at a certain soil layer q ρ w 2 the water content of a certain soil layer mm q h the soil moisture values at depths of 10 20 and 50 cm were assumed to be average moisture of the soil column of 0 10 10 20 and 20 50 cm respectively the corresponding soil column height h was 10 10 and 30 cm respectively then the sw from 0 to 50 was calculated to be the sum of soil water content above three soil columns the bulk soil density in neighboring forest soil at soil column of 0 10 10 32 and 32 53 cm had relatively uniform bulk density and was recorded to be 1 31 1 57 and 1 57 g cm 3 http www issas cas cn the average bulk soil density with value of 1 48 g cm 3 was used in this calculation runoff yield refers to the amount of daily generated flow from soil column of 50 cm below the surface of the soil mm h2o d 1 it contains precipitation evapotranspiration and soil water change and can be calculated with the following equation neitsch et al 2009 msoil20 was the lowest among the three soil depths fig s2 indicating percolation capacity might have a decline with the increase of soil depth due to high antecedent soil moisture always means high percolation in the upper layer lai et al 2016 moreover capillary rise to surface water in sandy loam soil was reported to be higher than silt loam and silt clay loam awan et al 2014 and the soil texture in sfwc was dominated by silt clay texture thus percolation and capillary rise parts were not considered into the above runoff yield calculation equation 4 runoffyield p r e c e a sw t sw 0 where prec is the amount of precipitation mm h2o ea is the amount of evapotranspiration mm provided by the ec tower swt and sw0 are the end and initial time period of soil water content respectively mm h2o and t is the time day it should be noted that soil moisture measurement was derived from mixed forests which had the highest proportion in this forest wetland catchment therefore the runoff yield estimation represents the hydrological processes at catchment scale that might also alter our local carbon dynamics 2 7 statistical analysis first daily nee gpp and re changing patterns were analyzed during 2019 to 2020 in sfwc then correlation analysis was conducted between main meteorological factors and daily co2 exchange pesenti et al 2019 parafac was also conducted to identify the main chemical components of dissolved organic matter dom in the stream water quality were continuous in situ monitored to determine the key hydrological drivers finally the soil co2 flux and average annual nee values from forest farmland and wetland were compared to explore their contribution to the positive local nee values all fitting plots were implemented in origin 2018b origin lab northampton u s a correlation coefficients between daily co2 exchange and main meteorological factors were derived in r version 3 6 2 one way analysis of variance was conducted by adopting the spss 20 0 software spss inc u s a 3 results 3 1 daily co2 exchange and its correlation with meteorological factors the whole time series data was divided into rainy june to september and dry october to may season based on the meteorological forcing data during 2019 to 2020 table s1 during rainy season we observed clear variations in daily nee re and gpp ranging from 3 17 to 15 21 0 62 to 22 26 and 0 06 to 17 02 g c m 2 d 1 respectively the net co2 emissions were observed in this forest wetland catchment with a daily mean nee june to september in 2019 and 2020 of 1 85 g c m 2 d 1 from local footprint area it should be noted that large nee fluctuation mainly occurred during rainy period by contrast the daily nee re and gpp showed small variations during dry season with mean values of 0 32 0 64 0 97 0 97 and 0 63 1 30 g c m 2 d 1 respectively fig 4 during rainy season fig 5 a air temperature tair and relative humidity rh were found to be positively correlated with daily nee with the coefficient values of 0 51 and 0 57 p 0 01 respectively while photosynthetically active radiation par had a negative correlation with value of 0 36 p 0 01 both gpp and re had significant positive correlation with tair par had significant positive correlation with gpp while rh showed significant positive correlation with re in addition only re was observed to have significant correlation with nee indicating nee was mainly controlled by re during rainy season during dry season fig s3 both par and tair were positively correlated with gpp re while only par was shown to be negatively correlated with nee unlike rainy season the correlation between rh and nee was not significant furthermore gpp and re showed significant negative correlation with nee daily re and tair was fitted by exponential model during rainy season p 0 01 and q10 value was calculated to be 4 06 fig 5 b 3 2 hydrologic export and its relationship with nee spectral loadings of 3 component and their contour plots were presented in fig 6 component 1 c1 ex em 265 485 nm was high molecular weight humic like substance with terrestrial character component 2 c2 ex em 250 405 nm was low molecular weight humic like compounds component 3 c3 ex em 275 325 nm was likely to be related to the presence of protein like substances in particular tryptophan and tyrosine dom in stream from the sfwc was dominated by doc and don compounds via the above chemical component analysis doc and don concentrations were the highest in surface runoff table 1 while the groundwater had the minimum values suggesting the surface runoff was an important source for diffuse doc and don export both stream and groundwater had high silicate concentrations indicating groundwater was also a vital supply source for the stream though the spatial scale of entire catchment was much larger than the ec tower footprint significant positive linear relationship between daily nee and runoff yield calculated via eq 3 and 4 was still found during the rainy season with fitting coefficient of 0 21 p 0 01 fig 7 a this suggested that the hydrologic transport from upland forests in sfwc affected the local nee variations slight discrepancy was observed between daily doc and don variations which might be caused by their different transport process p 0 01 fig 7 b daily average doc concentrations had significant positive linear relationship with nee with fitting coefficient of 0 52 p 0 01 fig 7 c though the relationship between the don concentrations and daily nee also could be fitted by linear model the fitting coefficient was only 0 13 p 0 05 fig 7 d unlike doc the driving effects of don on local nee gradually reduced with the increase of concentration these results suggested that doc and don concentrations at the catchment scale may affect nee variations during the in situ monitoring period 3 3 soil co2 flux changes from different land uses during rainy season the soil co2 flux from farmland forest and wetland were measured by using a portable greenhouse gas analyzer with mean values of 8 58 11 89 and 23 73 μmol m 2 s 1 respectively fig 8 a during dry season the average soil co2 flux values measured from above three land uses were 0 53 2 23 and 1 47 μmol m 2 s 1 respectively fig s4 we further compiled the public nee data in farmland forest and wetland from global perspective table s2 fig s5 and found the annual average nee values were 416 8 244 4 and 35 4 g c m 2 respectively fig 8 b compared with forest and farmland the wetland in sfwc could be a highly possible contribution source for positive nee values significant higher soc total carbon tc and total nitrogen tn content was observed in wetland than forest significant discrepancy was observed between msoil10 in forest and wetland with values of 38 25 and 53 57 respectively table 2 this indicated that high soil moisture soil organic carbon and nitrogen might be the reasons for high soil co2 flux from wetland 4 discussion 4 1 carbon flux variations and their controlling factors the clear daily nee re and gpp variations were observed during rainy season while small variations were found during dry season fig 4 to determine the dominant meteorological factors in controlling daily carbon fluxes we mainly focused on tair rh and par jia et al 2018 during dry season fig s3 the significant positive correlation between nee and par indicated that nee direction was mainly controlled by gpp gomez casanovas et al 2020 during rainy season tair and rh was positively correlated with nee while par was negatively correlated p 0 01 fig 5 a besides the significant positive influence of tair on both gpp and re we also found the significant positive correlation between par and gpp and rh and re respectively furthermore nee direction was mainly controlled by re instead of gpp fig 5 a therefore the positive correlation between nee and rh might be induced by the stimulation of re however the rh was previously found to be negatively correlated with ecosystem respiration ouyang and zheng 2000 li et al 2018 this phenomenon observed in this study could be explained by the following two reasons first the positive correlation between rh and nee might be caused by rainfall events during rainy season q10 was high with value of 4 06 fig 5 b while majority of which in forest soil fell in the range of 1 3 to 5 23 lloyd and taylor 1994 li et al 2008 ignace 2019 highly sensitive soil respiration to temperature might be caused by adequate microbial biomass and organic substrates ding et al 2016 davidson et al 2006 zhou et al 2016 similarly rainfall could enhance approximately 16 21 of the soil co2 flux in temperate broad leaved forests due to the increase in the soil microbial activity and biomass lee et al 2002 furthermore soil co2 emissions from wetland could increase to 245 and positive nee was even observed in an asian tropical rain forest caused by accelerated litterfall decomposition rates petrakis et al 2017 zhang et al 2010 moreover the rainfall events could lead to a decrease in gpp by reducing par due to associated increases in cloud cover saunders et al 2014 secondly catchment scale hydrological variation could control local co2 fluxes sjögersten et al 2006 during rainy season significant positive linear relationship between daily nee and runoff yield indicated the crucial effect of hydrologic transport from upland forests on nee fig 7 a the occurrence of rainfall events not only changed the hydrological process but also affected the transport of various elements though there existed spatial scale mismatch between the selected catchment and ec tower footprint daily average doc and don concentrations in the stream had significant positive linear relationship with nee values fig 7 c and d during the rainfall event the stream contained a large amount of dom and moved into the footprint of the ec tower supplementary video 1 low molecular weight compounds lmws such as some doc don were still detected in the surface runoff and stream fig 6 though highly bioavailable characteristics berggren et al 2010 lmws can play the role of root exudates and stimulate the saprotrophic microbes to decompose more recalcitrant soc which is also known as priming effects janssens et al 2010 lindahl and tunlid 2014 this effect might exert more influence on wetland than other two land uses due to the highest soil co2 flux were observed fig 8 b and s4 furthermore the co2 uptake rate reported in maize farmland under similar latitudes was larger than our measured soil co2 flux verma et al 2005 béziat et al 2009 hollinger et al 2005 alberti et al 2010 therefore the wetland might contribute most to the positive local nee values in this forest wetland catchment similar results were also found by other studies to quantify the atmospheric carbon budget nee values were measured at a typha and nymphaea dominated freshwater marsh wetland in northwestern ohio usa 41 27 51 28 n 82 59 45 02 w during march 2011 to march 2013 the marsh wetland was surrounded by maize dominated farmland with area proportion for only 4 during several intense rainfall events this marsh wetland had positive daily nee and released 3 g c co2 m 2 to the atmosphere within six days the enhanced marsh wetland soil respiration might be caused by pulsed hydrological inputs of organic matter and nutrients from the surrounding farmland chu et al 2014 lake valkea kotinen area 0 04 km2 was a small headwater lake located in a boreal coniferous forest area southern finland 61 14 n 25 4 e the mean annual nee was estimated to be 77 11 g c m 2 yr 1 during five consecutive ice free periods from 2003 to 2007 huotari et al 2011 doc in soil and ground water was dominated by lmws and terrestrial inputs to aquatic ecosystem was estimated to be 5 13 g c m 2 yr 1 rasilo et al 2015 this could decrease the co2 uptake of an old growth forest catchment by providing carbon source for heterotrophic respiration 4 2 nee changes under future climate scenarios significant positive correlation between the hydrological processes and nee showed that rainfall was an important factor in controlling co2 emissions from local footprint area in this forest wetland catchment due to the long term low temperature and slow decomposition of forest litter humus content in soil was high and diffuse exports was more significant during rainfall events weintraub et al 2015 kateb et al 2013 herrmann and witter 2002 for example heavy rainfall would lead to large diffuse doc and don exports in a middle high latitude european deciduous forest catchment solinger et al 2001 this could provide adequate substrates for microbes and the vigorous microbial activity would decompose the organic matter rapidly under a warmer climate in addition medium rain 10 25 mm day was projected to increase in northeast china by using the couple model intercomparison project 5 phase cmip5 simulations under the rcp4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenarios chen 2013 we derived the monthly average soil moisture in northeast china from january 2021 to december 2100 by using the gfdl cm3 model under the rcp 8 5 scenario donner et al 2011 soil moisture showed significant positive linear changing trends during the predicted period also indicating an increasing precipitation trend fig s6 moreover rising temperature could lead to more frequent freeze thaw cycles and enlarge the diffuse exports which may accelerate the soil carbon emissions herrmann and witter 2002 tian et al 2016 therefore a co2 emission hotspot was expected to occur in the forest wetland catchment under future climate scenarios the carbon emission contribution in forest wetland catchment needs to be considered into the terrestrial carbon cycle model to predict future climate change accurately 5 conclusions in this study the nee changing trends during 2019 to 2020 in the middle high latitude sfwc were investigated by using ec method during dry season the significant negative correlation between nee and par was found during rainy season positive nee was observed with daily mean of 1 85 g c m 2 d 1 indicating a net co2 emission tair and rh were dominant positive influencing factors for the nee with correlation coefficients of 0 51 and 0 57 respectively p 0 01 par had negative correlation with daily nee with correlation coefficient of 0 36 p 0 01 both gpp and re had significant positive correlation with tair par had significant positive correlation with gpp while rh showed significant positive correlation with re significant positive linear relationship was also observed between the doc and don concentrations and the daily nee with fitting coefficients of 0 52 and 0 13 respectively the diffuse doc and don exports from surrounding land uses forest farmland and wetland might be crucial driving forces for local positive nee wetland might contribute the most for the observed positive nee values and the co2 emission hotspot was expected to occur in the forest wetland catchment under the rcp 8 5 scenario credit authorship contribution statement wei ouyang writing original draft conceptualization formal analysis methodology

4264,forest wetland catchments are widely distributed in middle high latitude and their hydrological and biogeochemical processes are sensitive to climate change the net ecosystem exchange nee meteorological forcing and hydrological data in the shuidong forest wetland catchment sfwc were continuously measured by eddy covariance ec tower and water monitoring instruments from 2019 to 2020 during rainy season large carbon dioxide emission was detected with mean nee value of 1 85 g c m 2 d 1 from local footprint area significant positive correlation was observed between daily nee and air temperature tair relative humidity rh we further found that the nee was mainly controlled by ecosystem respiration re instead of gross primary production gpp which might be caused by local high q10 value in addition dissolved organic carbon doc and dissolved organic don concentrations near the stream outlet also had significant positive relationship with nee indicating the hydrological transport from upland forests may trigger the soil priming effect and result in higher co2 emission within the local footprint area soil co2 flux measurements from different land uses suggested that wetland may be the primary co2 emission source during rainy season under the representative concentration pathway rcp 8 5 scenario the co2 emission hotspot was expected to occur in this forest wetland catchment due to more frequent rainfall events predicted in this region keywords net ecosystem exchange forest wetland catchment dissolved organic matter rainfall 1 introduction current rising temperature has extensively caused boreal forests in lowlands to be replaced with wetlands resulting in highly fragmented landscapes koven et al 2011 baltzer et al 2014 helbig et al 2016 this spatial heterogeneity in geology soil and vegetation properties may lead to large uncertainties on the interaction between biosphere and atmosphere in forest wetland catchments forest represents an important carbon sink yu et al 2014 magnani et al 2007 while different wetland types were reported to have much larger net ecosystem exchange nee variations from net carbon source holl et al 2019 lafleur et al 2003 to carbon sink waddington and roulet 2000 the positive nee values were observed in a forest to bog restoration site and valkea kotinen lake surrounded by forests mazzola et al 2020 huotari et al 2011 while negative nee values were found in thermokarst collapse bogs and a thawing boreal forest wetland landscape johnston et al 2014 helbig et al 2017 furthermore nee variation in forest wetland catchments is strongly regulated by hydrological processes devito et al 1996 mchale et al 2004 compared with boreal forests the hydrologic exchange in temperate forests is more frequent and stronger fröberg et al 2006 laudon et al 2012 seasonal defoliation decomposition and accumulation in middle high latitude forests can provide a substantial organic matter reservoir for diffuse exports in addition the increase in the frequency of extreme precipitation and freeze thaw cycles caused by climate warming may further aggravate forest carbon and nitrogen loss westra et al 2014 herrmann et al 2002 ouyang et al 2018 casson et al 2010 chen et al 2013 hydrologic flows transport large amounts of diffuse dissolved organic carbon doc and nitrogen don from upland forests into downstream wetlands due to the existed hydraulic gradient perakis and hedin 2002 wang et al 2020 waterloo et al 2006 quinton et al 2009 therefore the nee direction and magnitude may be altered due to short term turnover priming effects of wetland soil organic carbon caused by inputs of doc and don allison et al 2010 yan et al 2018 cleveland and townsend 2006 kuzyakov et al 2000 in this study we continuously measured the meteorological forcing and nee in a middle high latitude forest wetland catchment locating at a mountainous region from 2019 to 2020 in the meantime we monitored the hydrological and water quality data to assess how the local nee were affected by surrounding hydrological processes in addition we analyzed soil co2 flux from different land uses within the footprint area to examine their contribution to local nee this study was conducted to reveal the following two aspects of nee variations from local footprint area in a forest wetland catchment i main driving factors and ii nee source from different land uses 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area description the shuidong forest wetland catchment sfwc located in northeastern china is a small mountainous watershed in the

water monitoring instruments was demonstrated in fig 3 a potable greenhouse gas analyzer ps 3010 abb canada was used to observe the soil co2 flux from farmland forest and wetland respectively three independent plots 1 m 1 m were set up within a 5 m 5 m area at each land use to guarantee reliability of measured results all selected plots were located in the footprint of the ec tower the in situ greenhouse gas measurement experiment was conducted on 25 aug 2020 and 18 to 20 apr 2021 following a medium rain fig 3 c and fig s4 2 5 laboratory analysis of water and soil samples the dissolved

was analyzed without hydrochloride acid pretreatment yu et al 2018 fluorescence excitation emission matrices eems were collected with a spectrofluorometer f4600 hitachi japan equipped with a 150 w xenon arc lamp at 20 using 10 nm excitation and emission slit widths yao et al 2011 hoge et al 1993 parallel factor analysis parafac was increasingly used to decompose fluorescence eems into their underlying chemical components and conducted in matlab r2019a based on the dreem toolbox 0 6 0 murphy et al 2013 murphy et al 2014 this toolbox for matlab is presented to support improved visualization and sensitivity analyses of parafac models in fluorescence spectroscopy 2 6 calculation formulas q10 was used to describe the temperature sensitivity of soil respiration at an interval of 10 c meyer et al 2018 detailed calculation method was shown as follows 1 re a e x p b t a 2 q 10 e x p 10 b where re lloyd and taylor 1994 is the ecosystem respiration g c m 2 d 1 ta is the air temperature c and a b are constants fitted to the regression equation the sw soil water content mm is the amount of water in soil column of 50 cm below the surface of the soil calculated by using the following equation huang et al 2013 3 sw ρ h w where ρ is the bulk soil density at a certain depth g cm 3 h is the thickness of the soil layer mm and w is the soil moisture at depths of 10 20 and 50 cm this equation can be divided two parts 1 the volumetric water content at a certain soil layer q ρ w 2 the water content of a certain soil layer mm q h the soil moisture values at depths of 10 20 and 50 cm were assumed to be average moisture of the soil column of 0 10 10 20 and 20 50 cm respectively the corresponding soil column height h was 10 10 and 30 cm respectively then the sw from 0 to 50 was calculated to be the sum of soil water content above three soil columns the bulk soil density in neighboring forest soil at soil column of 0 10 10 32 and 32 53 cm had relatively uniform bulk density and was recorded to be 1 31 1 57 and 1 57 g cm 3 http www issas cas cn the average bulk soil density with value of 1 48 g cm 3 was used in this calculation runoff yield refers to the amount of daily generated flow from soil column of 50 cm below the surface of the soil mm h2o d 1 it contains precipitation evapotranspiration and soil water change and can be calculated with the following equation neitsch et al 2009 msoil20 was the lowest among the three soil depths fig s2 indicating percolation capacity might have a decline with the increase of soil depth due to high antecedent soil moisture always means high percolation in the upper layer lai et al 2016 moreover capillary rise to surface water in sandy loam soil was reported to be higher than silt loam and silt clay loam awan et al 2014 and the soil texture in sfwc was dominated by silt clay texture thus percolation and capillary rise parts were not considered into the above runoff yield calculation equation 4 runoffyield p r e c e a sw t sw 0 where prec is the amount of precipitation mm h2o ea is the amount of evapotranspiration mm provided by the ec tower swt and sw0 are the end and initial time period of soil water content respectively mm h2o and t is the time day it should be noted that soil moisture measurement was derived from mixed forests which had the highest proportion in this forest wetland catchment therefore the runoff yield estimation represents the hydrological processes at catchment scale that might also alter our local carbon dynamics 2 7 statistical analysis first daily nee gpp and re changing patterns were analyzed during 2019 to 2020 in sfwc then correlation analysis was conducted between main meteorological factors and daily co2 exchange pesenti et al 2019 parafac was also conducted to identify the main chemical components of dissolved organic matter dom in the stream water quality were continuous in situ monitored to determine the key hydrological drivers finally the soil co2 flux and average annual nee values from forest farmland and wetland were compared to explore their contribution to the positive local nee values all fitting plots were implemented in origin 2018b origin lab northampton u s a correlation coefficients between daily co2 exchange and main meteorological factors were derived in r version 3 6 2 one way analysis of variance was conducted by adopting the spss 20 0 software spss inc u s a 3 results 3 1 daily co2 exchange and its correlation with meteorological factors the whole time series data was divided into rainy june to september and dry october to may season based on the meteorological forcing data during 2019 to 2020 table s1 during rainy season we observed clear variations in daily nee re and gpp ranging from 3 17 to 15 21 0 62 to 22 26 and 0 06 to 17 02 g c m 2 d 1 respectively the net co2 emissions were observed in this forest wetland catchment with a daily mean nee june to september in 2019 and 2020 of 1 85 g c m 2 d 1 from local footprint area it should be noted that large nee fluctuation mainly occurred during rainy period by contrast the daily nee re and gpp showed small variations during dry season with mean values of 0 32 0 64 0 97 0 97 and 0 63 1 30 g c m 2 d 1 respectively fig 4 during rainy season fig 5 a air temperature tair and relative humidity rh were found to be positively correlated with daily nee with the coefficient values of 0 51 and 0 57 p 0 01 respectively while photosynthetically active radiation par had a negative correlation with value of 0 36 p 0 01 both gpp and re had significant positive correlation with tair par had significant positive correlation with gpp while rh showed significant positive correlation with re in addition only re was observed to have significant correlation with nee indicating nee was mainly controlled by re during rainy season during dry season fig s3 both par and tair were positively correlated with gpp re while only par was shown to be negatively correlated with nee unlike rainy season the correlation between rh and nee was not significant furthermore gpp and re showed significant negative correlation with nee daily re and tair was fitted by exponential model during rainy season p 0 01 and q10 value was calculated to be 4 06 fig 5 b 3 2 hydrologic export and its relationship with nee spectral loadings of 3 component and their contour plots were presented in fig 6 component 1 c1 ex em 265 485 nm was high molecular weight humic like substance with terrestrial character component 2 c2 ex em 250 405 nm was low molecular weight humic like compounds component 3 c3 ex em 275 325 nm was likely to be related to the presence of protein like substances in particular tryptophan and tyrosine dom in stream from the sfwc was dominated by doc and don compounds via the above chemical component analysis doc and don concentrations were the highest in surface runoff table 1 while the groundwater had the minimum values suggesting the surface runoff was an important source for diffuse doc and don export both stream and groundwater had high silicate concentrations indicating groundwater was also a vital supply source for the stream though the spatial scale of entire catchment was much larger than the ec tower footprint significant positive linear relationship between daily nee and runoff yield calculated via eq 3 and 4 was still found during the rainy season with fitting coefficient of 0 21 p 0 01 fig 7 a this suggested that the hydrologic transport from upland forests in sfwc affected the local nee variations slight discrepancy was observed between daily doc and don variations which might be caused by their different transport process p 0 01 fig 7 b daily average doc concentrations had significant positive linear relationship with nee with fitting coefficient of 0 52 p 0 01 fig 7 c though the relationship between the don concentrations and daily nee also could be fitted by linear model the fitting coefficient was only 0 13 p 0 05 fig 7 d unlike doc the driving effects of don on local nee gradually reduced with the increase of concentration these results suggested that doc and don concentrations at the catchment scale may affect nee variations during the in situ monitoring period 3 3 soil co2 flux changes from different land uses during rainy season the soil co2 flux from farmland forest and wetland were measured by using a portable greenhouse gas analyzer with mean values of 8 58 11 89 and 23 73 μmol m 2 s 1 respectively fig 8 a during dry season the average soil co2 flux values measured from above three land uses were 0 53 2 23 and 1 47 μmol m 2 s 1 respectively fig s4 we further compiled the public nee data in farmland forest and wetland from global perspective table s2 fig s5 and found the annual average nee values were 416 8 244 4 and 35 4 g c m 2 respectively fig 8 b compared with forest and farmland the wetland in sfwc could be a highly possible contribution source for positive nee values significant higher soc total carbon tc and total nitrogen tn content was observed in wetland than forest significant discrepancy was observed between msoil10 in forest and wetland with values of 38 25 and 53 57 respectively table 2 this indicated that high soil moisture soil organic carbon and nitrogen might be the reasons for high soil co2 flux from wetland 4 discussion 4 1 carbon flux variations and their controlling factors the clear daily nee re and gpp variations were observed during rainy season while small variations were found during dry season fig 4 to determine the dominant meteorological factors in controlling daily carbon fluxes we mainly focused on tair rh and par jia et al 2018 during dry season fig s3 the significant positive correlation between nee and par indicated that nee direction was mainly controlled by gpp gomez casanovas et al 2020 during rainy season tair and rh was positively correlated with nee while par was negatively correlated p 0 01 fig 5 a besides the significant positive influence of tair on both gpp and re we also found the significant positive correlation between par and gpp and rh and re respectively furthermore nee direction was mainly controlled by re instead of gpp fig 5 a therefore the positive correlation between nee and rh might be induced by the stimulation of re however the rh was previously found to be negatively correlated with ecosystem respiration ouyang and zheng 2000 li et al 2018 this phenomenon observed in this study could be explained by the following two reasons first the positive correlation between rh and nee might be caused by rainfall events during rainy season q10 was high with value of 4 06 fig 5 b while majority of which in forest soil fell in the range of 1 3 to 5 23 lloyd and taylor 1994 li et al 2008 ignace 2019 highly sensitive soil respiration to temperature might be caused by adequate microbial biomass and organic substrates ding et al 2016 davidson et al 2006 zhou et al 2016 similarly rainfall could enhance approximately 16 21 of the soil co2 flux in temperate broad leaved forests due to the increase in the soil microbial activity and biomass lee et al 2002 furthermore soil co2 emissions from wetland could increase to 245 and positive nee was even observed in an asian tropical rain forest caused by accelerated litterfall decomposition rates petrakis et al 2017 zhang et al 2010 moreover the rainfall events could lead to a decrease in gpp by reducing par due to associated increases in cloud cover saunders et al 2014 secondly catchment scale hydrological variation could control local co2 fluxes sjögersten et al 2006 during rainy season significant positive linear relationship between daily nee and runoff yield indicated the crucial effect of hydrologic transport from upland forests on nee fig 7 a the occurrence of rainfall events not only changed the hydrological process but also affected the transport of various elements though there existed spatial scale mismatch between the selected catchment and ec tower footprint daily average doc and don concentrations in the stream had significant positive linear relationship with nee values fig 7 c and d during the rainfall event the stream contained a large amount of dom and moved into the footprint of the ec tower supplementary video 1 low molecular weight compounds lmws such as some doc don were still detected in the surface runoff and stream fig 6 though highly bioavailable characteristics berggren et al 2010 lmws can play the role of root exudates and stimulate the saprotrophic microbes to decompose more recalcitrant soc which is also known as priming effects janssens et al 2010 lindahl and tunlid 2014 this effect might exert more influence on wetland than other two land uses due to the highest soil co2 flux were observed fig 8 b and s4 furthermore the co2 uptake rate reported in maize farmland under similar latitudes was larger than our measured soil co2 flux verma et al 2005 béziat et al 2009 hollinger et al 2005 alberti et al 2010 therefore the wetland might contribute most to the positive local nee values in this forest wetland catchment similar results were also found by other studies to quantify the atmospheric carbon budget nee values were measured at a typha and nymphaea dominated freshwater marsh wetland in northwestern ohio usa 41 27 51 28 n 82 59 45 02 w during march 2011 to march 2013 the marsh wetland was surrounded by maize dominated farmland with area proportion for only 4 during several intense rainfall events this marsh wetland had positive daily nee and released 3 g c co2 m 2 to the atmosphere within six days the enhanced marsh wetland soil respiration might be caused by pulsed hydrological inputs of organic matter and nutrients from the surrounding farmland chu et al 2014 lake valkea kotinen area 0 04 km2 was a small headwater lake located in a boreal coniferous forest area southern finland 61 14 n 25 4 e the mean annual nee was estimated to be 77 11 g c m 2 yr 1 during five consecutive ice free periods from 2003 to 2007 huotari et al 2011 doc in soil and ground water was dominated by lmws and terrestrial inputs to aquatic ecosystem was estimated to be 5 13 g c m 2 yr 1 rasilo et al 2015 this could decrease the co2 uptake of an old growth forest catchment by providing carbon source for heterotrophic respiration 4 2 nee changes under future climate scenarios significant positive correlation between the hydrological processes and nee showed that rainfall was an important factor in controlling co2 emissions from local footprint area in this forest wetland catchment due to the long term low temperature and slow decomposition of forest litter humus content in soil was high and diffuse exports was more significant during rainfall events weintraub et al 2015 kateb et al 2013 herrmann and witter 2002 for example heavy rainfall would lead to large diffuse doc and don exports in a middle high latitude european deciduous forest catchment solinger et al 2001 this could provide adequate substrates for microbes and the vigorous microbial activity would decompose the organic matter rapidly under a warmer climate in addition medium rain 10 25 mm day was projected to increase in northeast china by using the couple model intercomparison project 5 phase cmip5 simulations under the rcp4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenarios chen 2013 we derived the monthly average soil moisture in northeast china from january 2021 to december 2100 by using the gfdl cm3 model under the rcp 8 5 scenario donner et al 2011 soil moisture showed significant positive linear changing trends during the predicted period also indicating an increasing precipitation trend fig s6 moreover rising temperature could lead to more frequent freeze thaw cycles and enlarge the diffuse exports which may accelerate the soil carbon emissions herrmann and witter 2002 tian et al 2016 therefore a co2 emission hotspot was expected to occur in the forest wetland catchment under future climate scenarios the carbon emission contribution in forest wetland catchment needs to be considered into the terrestrial carbon cycle model to predict future climate change accurately 5 conclusions in this study the nee changing trends during 2019 to 2020 in the middle high latitude sfwc were investigated by using ec method during dry season the significant negative correlation between nee and par was found during rainy season positive nee was observed with daily mean of 1 85 g c m 2 d 1 indicating a net co2 emission tair and rh were dominant positive influencing factors for the nee with correlation coefficients of 0 51 and 0 57 respectively p 0 01 par had negative correlation with daily nee with correlation coefficient of 0 36 p 0 01 both gpp and re had significant positive correlation with tair par had significant positive correlation with gpp while rh showed significant positive correlation with re significant positive linear relationship was also observed between the doc and don concentrations and the daily nee with fitting coefficients of 0 52 and 0 13 respectively the diffuse doc and don exports from surrounding land uses forest farmland and wetland might be crucial driving forces for local positive nee wetland might contribute the most for the observed positive nee values and the co2 emission hotspot was expected to occur in the forest wetland catchment under the rcp 8 5 scenario credit authorship contribution statement wei ouyang writing original draft conceptualization formal analysis methodology
