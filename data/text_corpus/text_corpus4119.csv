20595,to explore the dynamical characteristics of the deepwater test string a fluid structure coupling vibration model of the deepwater test string was established and the model was solved by using the method of characteristics a similarity experiment of the deepwater test string was performed to verify the model combined with the related data of a well in the south china sea the dynamical characteristics of the test string were analyzed to obtain the vibration regulation of the test string results showed that the test string vibrated periodically when gas passed through it and its lateral deformation in the seawater segment was evidently larger than that in the formation the test string s largest deformation was in the middle of the seawater segment and its deformation in the upper part of the formation segment was larger to the middle and lower parts a large longitudinal amplitude occurred in the lower part of the formation segment with the increasing of surface current velocity the lateral and longitudinal displacements of the test string in seawater segment increased the lateral and longitudinal displacements of the test string increased with gas production and decreased with test string s thickness besides the interaction effect between the gas and the test string increased with the gas density increasing these results are highly significant for reducing the vibration of the deepwater test string and protecting its safety keywords deepwater test string fluid structure coupling method of characteristics vibration displacement 1 introduction deepwater testing is an important part of evaluating oil and gas reservoirs in deepwater oil and gas development during the testing process the test string which is the key equipment enters formation through the riser and the riser deforms subjected to the marine environment load which further affects the deformation of the test string simultaneously while high pressure gas entering the test string from the formation and reaching the platform wellhead it causes fluid structure coupling vibration which aggravates the collision contact between the test string and the riser and the casing leading to the fracture and failure of the test string and other accidents therefore it is of great significance to study the dynamic characteristics of the deepwater test string scholars have studied the mechanical behavior of test strings liang et al 1999 established the differential equation for fluid structure coupling vibration in the formation segment of a test string and showed that the vibration of the test string is concerned with the axial load of the test string and the density of the fluid inside the test string gao et al 2002a 2002b 2004 found the helical buckling often occurred near the lower end of test string and friction appeared during well testing and production and proved that the friction could prevent large loads caused by high pressure and high temperature from spreading which could result in severe deformation in test string dou et al 2007 2008 considered the well structure load high temperature and high pressure of the test string and analyzed the axial mechanical behavior of the test string and obtained the critical load and deformation characteristics of the test string salguero et al 2007 studied the high temperature and high pressure gas through the deepwater test string and concluded that the temperature distribution and the high pressure fluid friction effect had great influence on the axial deformation of deepwater test string li et al 2008 2011a b 2012 considered the performance of fluid in a test string and the internal pressure of the string and established a mathematical model of mechanics analysis for test string formation in the test zeng et al 2010 established a prediction model for the variation of the temperature and pressure in the test string and analyzed the influence of pressure and temperature changes on the stress and deformation of the test string wendler et al 2012 studied the influence of some important parameters on the vibration of test string in the process of deepwater testing and found that the mobile vessels and ocean load had great influence on the vibration of test string zhang et al 2014 established the longitudinal vibration mechanics model of a deepwater test string and analyzed the longitudinal free dynamical characteristics of the test string using vibration mechanics theory wei and liu 2015 analyzed the mechanical behavior of a deepwater test string and suggested that the dynamic model of the test string should consider factors such as riser influence high pressure fluid and perforation impact load he et al 2017 established the calculation model of the deformation of a deepwater test string and concluded that the test string s possible dangerous segment was generally in the state of complex force in three directions patcha et al 2017 discussed the smart drilling stem test string and evaluated a deepwater well test operation and formation segment gao et al 2019 studied a test string s dynamic behavior during the testing process and found that the slip joint did not interrupt the test string s mechanical behavior during the testing process the previous studies have focused on the mechanical behavior of buckling deformation of test strings under the change of pressure and temperature furthermore the previous models were mainly used for land formation segment test string however for the deepwater test string subjected to ocean load the test string of seawater segment will deform with the riser deformation during the deepwater testing the gas flows out of the formation and get into the test string in the formation segment and then passes through the deformed test string in the seawater segment where the high speed flow of gas may induce the large vibration of the test string both in lateral and longitudinal directions li 2012 the large lateral and longitudinal displacement of the test string may cause the collision between the test string and the riser which may result in strength and safety issues of the test string nevertheless previous studies have not analyzed the dynamic characteristics of the deepwater test string and the collision between the test string and the riser in the process of testing yet thus the engineering problem of gas induced deepwater test string vibration shall be studied and the deepwater test string vibration damage issue must be solved in the process of deepwater testing this study aims to investigate the dynamic characteristics of the deepwater test string a fluid structure interaction analysis model for the deepwater test string was established by considering the deformation of the test string in the seawater segment and the combination with the formation segment the method of characteristics moc was used to solve the model and a similarity experiment was performed to verify the model through simulation the vibration mechanism of the deepwater test string was analyzed and its dynamical characteristics were discussed 2 fluid structure coupling vibration model of a deepwater test string the deepwater test string system is a double layer string system which divided into seawater and formation segments the inner layer is the test string structure which isolated from the production zone by packer and the riser and casing are the outer layers of the seawater section and formation section respectively as shown in fig 1 the outer layer of the seawater segment string is primarily composed of the riser the bop and the flexible joint the inner layer is primarily composed of the flow head the underwater safety valve the underwater test tree and the tubing for connection during oil and gas testing high pressure oil and gas flow enter the wellbore from the reservoir and then through the test string 2 1 lateral deformation model for the test string in seawater segment in deep water testing environment the seawater section of the test string is mainly affected by the complex marine environmental load since the riser deformation is consistent with the lateral deformation of the test string in the offshore condition the lateral deformation of the riser is used to simulate the lateral deformation of the test string instead he 2015 so as to provide initial conditions for the dynamic calculation of the vibration of the test string induced by internal fluid under the bending condition the governing equation of the riser can be expressed as meng 2018 1 e i

conditions we assume that the rotary stiffness of the flexible joint at the lower end of the riser is k h and that of which at the top of the riser is k u therefore the boundary conditions of the riser can be expressed as 3 x 0 t 0 e i 2 x 0 t z 2 k h x 0 t z 4 x l t s p e i 2 x l t z 2 k u x l t z the marine environmental loads on the riser are generated by waves surface currents and winds the combined wave surface current and wind loads are calculated by the following formula wilson 2003 5 f y 1 2 c ρ w d d z u x u x c m ρ w π d z 2 4 d u x d t 1 2 c d d z ρ w u 2 where c d is the drag

which can be simplified into homogeneous circular segment beams constrained at both ends as shown in fig 2 a this study focuses on the deformation and vibration of the test string induced by the gas test process the impact and contact force between the test string and the riser are disregarded and the test string s initial deformation in the seawater segment is consistent with that of the riser for test string systems in which the inner diameter of the pipe is much smaller than the pipe length and usually be calculated based on timoshenko beam model lesmez 1989 shen et al 2009 during the testing the gas flows in the test string at high speed so that the timoshenko beam element model is more adoptable for the deepwater test string than euler bernoulli model xia et al 2020 and the bending force and displacement satisfy hooker s law wiggert and tijsseling 2001 the fluid structure coupling equations of the test string are derived from the test string element for force analysis as

and the initial gas velocity is considered the flow of gas in the test string at a constant velocity the upper end of the deepwater test string is fixed at the platform limiting the lateral and longitudinal displacements and rotation of the upper test string the upper end boundary of the test string can be described as he 2015 shen et al 2009 20 u x 0 u y 0 u z 0 ϕ x 0 ϕ y 0 ϕ z 0 the lower

equations which are characteristic equations characteristic equations are then solved via numerical integration characteristic equations are transformed using the linear fitting method for example

and the characteristic equations are shown in equations 26 and 27 d z d t a p 1 indicates that the propagation direction of the moment wave is the same as the positive direction of the z axis and thus is called a positive characteristic line and expressed as c d z d t a p 1 indicates that the propagation direction is the same as the negative direction of the z axis and thus is called a negative characteristic line and expressed as c 26 c d m z d t a p 1 ρ p j d ϕ z d t 0 d z d t a p 1 g ρ p 27 c d m z d t a p 1 ρ p j d ϕ z d t 0 d z d t a p 1 similarly partial differential equations 8 19 can be transformed into corresponding characteristic equations see appendix a fig 3 shows the computational grid the characteristic waves are integrated into their respective characteristic lines the obtained 14 resulting finite difference equations are combined with boundary conditions to solve the discrete points along the test string keramat et al 2012 tijsseling 2003 the simplified flowchart of the model solution process is depicted in fig 4 3 model validation to verify the fluid structure coupling vibration model of the deepwater test string similar experiments were conducted to test string dynamical characteristics in the seawater segment the basic parameters of the test string system are shown in table 1 the experimental schematic is shown in fig 5 and the actual experimental process is shown in fig 6 the experimental equipment primarily included the test string model and the strain analysis system a pe pipe was adopted in the test string system the outer and inner pipes were the riser and the test string respectively as shown in fig 7 a many strain sensors were installed around the inner pipe to collect strain data of the test string the vibration data of test string were obtained via data analysis and processing mao et al 2015 under the condition of 0 1 m s of surface current velocity and 80 m3 h of gas production the test string s lateral deformation was consistent with the riser s as shown in fig 7 b the numerical results of the test string s deformation distribution at a certain time and the lateral displacement at point 4 of the test string are compared with the experimental results as shown in fig 8 the numerical results agree well with the experimental results and the slight difference between the numerical and experimental results might be caused by the unsteady gas flow in the experimental process 4 engineering case analysis 4 1 basic parameters and analysis of results the test string s initial deformation of the seawater segment is consistent with that of the riser which can be verified through similar experiments on the dynamical characteristics of the test string in the above seawater segment a deepwater well in the south china sea mao et al 2016a b was selected for dynamical characteristic analysis the initial morphology of the test string is shown in fig 9 table 2 lists the main parameters of the experiment mao et al 2016a b fig 10 shows the lateral vibration of the test string when gas production is 100 104 m3 d fig 10 a shows the lateral deformation of the test string at different times and fig 10 b presents the cloud chart of the test string s lateral displacement changing with time fig 10 indicates that when gas passes through the test string the test string generates periodic vibration and the lateral deformation of the test string in the seawater segment is evidently larger than that in the formation segment under the action of ocean load the test string of the seawater segment deforms considerably along with the riser and the deformation of the test string will affects the distribution and size of gas pulsation wang et al 2011 the gas will exerts additional force on the curved test string while its velocity and direction change due to the deformation of the test string when passes through it consequently the vibration of the seawater test string is greater than that of the formation segment yu et al 2015 fig 11 shows the time variation of the lateral displacement and the maximum lateral amplitude of the test string at different positions the lateral amplitude of the test string in the seawater segment is relatively large and the lateral displacement of the test string is the largest at 500 m node 6 near the middle the lateral vibration amplitude of the test string in the formation segment is relatively small which is consistent with the law presented in fig 10 fig 12 shows the test string position relationship with the riser and the casing the distance between the test string and the riser is 0 19 m and the distance between the casing is 0 05m as shown in fig 11 b the maximum lateral vibration amplitude of the test string in the seawater segment is 0 69 m which exceeds the maximum space between the test string and the riser the maximum vibration amplitude of the middle and upper parts in the formation segment is 0 12 m which exceeds the maximum space between the test string and the casing therefore the test string collides both with the casing and the riser fig 13 shows the time variation of the longitudinal displacement and the longitudinal maximum amplitude of the test string at different positions fig 13 shows that the test string also generates large longitudinal vibration and the longitudinal amplitude of the test string in the formation segment is larger than that in the seawater segment the closer to the lower end of the test string the greater the longitudinal amplitude of the test string among which the longitudinal amplitude of the test string s bottom end node 21 is the largest under the action of high speed gas flow the force fluctuation of the test string is induced and gas exerts an axial force on the test string resulting in the longitudinal vibration of the test string ju et al 2014 when gas flows from the formation into the test string the string s lateral amplitude is zero due to the packer constraints near the bottom lateral displacement zero longitudinal free constraints as shown in fig 11 b the pressure energy of gas was converted into the longitudinal vibration energy of the test string and thus the longitudinal amplitude was maximum near the bottom of the test string yang 2007 in addition the test string in the formation segment is initially in vertical shape and its elastic deformation space is large yang et al 2016 therefore when gas passes through the test string the longitudinal displacement of the test string in the formation segment is larger than that in the seawater segment 4 2 effect of the surface current velocity on the test string s dynamical characteristics fig 14 shows the comparison diagram of the test string morphologies at different surface current velocities fig 15 a b present the time variation of the lateral displacement of the test string at different surface current velocities respectively fig 15 c shows the comparison diagram of the test string s maximum lateral displacement amplitude fig 16 shows the comparison cloud of the test string s lateral displacement fig 17 a b and c show the time variation of the longitudinal displacement of the test string s different nodes at different surface current velocities respectively fig 17 d shows the comparison diagram of the test string s maximum longitudinal amplitude three different surface current velocities of 0 m s 0 8 m s and 1 1 m s were set up to study the influence of surface current velocity on the dynamic characteristics of the test string the variation of surface current velocity has great influence on the lateral deformation of test string as shown in fig 14 and the lateral deformation of test string increases with the increase of surface current velocity figs 15 17 show the consistent rule that the vibration of the test string exhibits a periodic change and both the lateral and longitudinal displacements increase with surface current velocity turning up when the test string deforms under surface current load the vibration of which is relatively stable and the amplitude is larger with the increase of the lateral displacement the vibration amplitude of the test string is smaller and gradually decays when the test string is not subjected to surface current load by contrast the reason is that the test string is not deformed and both ends are fixed the test string exhibits a tension state and thus the stiffness of the test string increases and the deformation resistance of the test string increases yang 2007 thus in actual engineering the damage caused by the vibration of the test string can be reduced significantly by impairing the influence of ocean surface current on the test string shape 4 3 effect of gas production on the test string s dynamical characteristics fig 18 a b show the time history diagram of lateral displacement of the test string at different gas production respectively fig 18 c shows the comparison diagram of the test string s maximum lateral displacement amplitude fig 19 shows the comparison cloud of the test string s lateral displacement fig 20 a and b and 20 c show the longitudinal displacement time changes of the test string s different nodes at different gas production respectively fig 20 d shows the comparison diagram of the test string s maximum longitudinal amplitude figs 18 20 show that the lateral and longitudinal displacements of the test string increases with an increase in gas production for high production gas wells given the increasing production the volume of gas flowing through the unit cross segmental area get larger and the velocity of gas flow within the same diameter the impact force on the test string and the test string vibration increase li et al 2011a b long term effected in this condition may cause test string failure and destruction and excessive longitudinal vibration may loosen the test string s threaded joints and lead to leakage simultaneously the test string undergoes fatigue failure at a low force level liu et al 2019 therefore the damage caused by gas induced test string vibration can be reduced by determining the optimal gas production in actual engineering 4 4 effect of the gas density on the test string s dynamical characteristics fig 21 a b show the lateral displacement time changes of the test string when gas density was 220 240 and 260 kg m3 respectively fig 21 c shows the comparison diagram of the test string s maximum lateral displacement amplitude fig 22 shows the comparison cloud of the test string s lateral displacement figs 21 and 22 show that when gas density increases the lateral displacement of the test string increases slightly and the vibration mode of the test string changes given the increasing gas density the interaction between gas and the test string increases giacobbi et al 2020 as the fluctuation amplitude of the gas density increases the test string would become more unstable due to parametric resonances bai et al 2018 xie et al 2019 therefore the lateral vibration of the test string increases and the vibration mode of the test string changes significantly fig 23 a and b and 23 c show the longitudinal displacement time changes of the test string when gas density was 220 240 and 260 kg m3 respectively fig 23 d shows the comparison diagram of the test string s maximum longitudinal displacement amplitude fig 23 shows that the change in gas density slightly influences the longitudinal vibration of the test string and the longitudinal amplitude of the test string changes less fig 23 comparison diagram of the test string s longitudinal vibration under different gas densities a with the gas density of 220 kg m3 b with a gas density of 240 kg m3 c with a gas density of 260 kg m3 and d longitudinal maximum amplitude 4 5 effect of pipe thickness on the test string s dynamical characteristics from fig 24 a and b show the lateral displacement time changes of the test string when pipe thickness was 9 65 7 37 and 6 88 mm respectively fig 24 c shows the comparison diagram of the test string s maximum lateral displacement amplitude fig 25 shows the comparison cloud of the test string s lateral displacement fig 26 a and b and 26 c show the longitudinal displacement time changes of the test string s different nodes when pipe thickness was 9 65 7 37 and 6 88 mm respectively fig 26 d shows the comparison diagram of the test string s maximum longitudinal displacement amplitude figs 24 26 show that the test string s lateral and longitudinal displacements decrease with an increase in pipe thickness the reason for this result is that the moment inertia of the test string increases with pipe thickness and thus the bending strength of the test string increases and its resistance to deformation also increases li et al 2014 tijsseling 2007 therefore in practical engineering increasing pipe thickness could reduce the damage of the test string caused by the collision between the test string and the casing and the riser 5 conclusion this research established a fluid structure interaction analysis model of deepwater test string in the process of deepwater testing the dynamic characteristics of deepwater test string solved by proposed model and method are validated against the available experiment the main conclusions are as follows when the gas passes through the deep water test string the test string will experience periodic vibration among them the test string lateral displacement of the seawater segment is larger than that of the formation segment and the lateral displacement in the middle of the test string in seawater segment is the largest so the collision probability between the test string and the riser is greatly increased the closer to the lower end of the test string the greater the longitudinal displacement of the test string among which the longitudinal amplitude at the bottom of the test string is the largest under the influence of surface current the larger the deformation of the test string in seawater section the more severe the vibration will be the lateral and longitudinal displacements of test string increase with the increase of gas production and decrease with the increase of test string thickness with the gas density in the test string increases the interaction effect between the gas and the test string increases but the influence on the longitudinal vibration of the test string is small in practical engineering we should pay more attention to the test string in the seawater segment and measures can be taken to weaken the influence of surface current load on the deformation of it the support device can be added between the riser and the test string to reduce the bending of the test string for instance and thus reduce the vibration of test string during oil and gas testing for the test string in the formation segment the longitudinal displacement of the test string in the lower section of the test string is relatively large in addition the damage to the test string caused by its vibration can be reduced by using a thicker test pipe string and choosing the optimal gas production under the premise of meeting the needs and costs of natural gas production credit authorship contribution statement liangjie mao conceptualization methodology supervision writing review editing xin he data

upper part of the formation segment was larger to the middle and lower parts a large longitudinal amplitude occurred in the lower part of the formation segment with the increasing of surface current velocity the lateral and longitudinal displacements of the test string in seawater segment increased the lateral and longitudinal displacements of the test string increased with gas production and decreased with test string s thickness besides the interaction effect between the gas and the test string increased with the gas density increasing these results are highly significant for reducing the vibration of the deepwater test string and protecting its safety keywords deepwater test string fluid structure coupling method of characteristics vibration displacement 1 introduction deepwater testing is an important part of evaluating oil and gas reservoirs in deepwater oil and gas development during the testing process the test string which is the key equipment enters formation through the riser and the riser deforms subjected to the marine environment load which further affects the deformation of the test string simultaneously while high pressure gas entering the test string from the formation and reaching the platform wellhead it causes fluid structure coupling vibration which aggravates the collision contact between the test string and the riser and the casing leading to the fracture and failure of the test string and other accidents therefore it is of great significance to study the dynamic characteristics of the deepwater test string scholars have studied the mechanical behavior of test strings liang et al 1999 established the differential equation for fluid structure coupling vibration in the formation segment of a test string and showed that the vibration of the test string is concerned with the axial load of the test string and the density of the fluid inside the test string gao et al 2002a 2002b 2004 found the helical buckling often occurred near the lower end of test string and friction appeared during well testing and production and proved that the friction could prevent large loads caused by high pressure and high temperature from spreading which could result in severe deformation in test string dou et al 2007 2008 considered the well structure load high temperature and high pressure of the test string and analyzed the axial mechanical behavior of the test string and obtained the critical load and deformation characteristics of the test string salguero et al 2007 studied the high temperature and high pressure gas through the deepwater test string and concluded that the temperature distribution and the high pressure fluid friction effect had great influence on the axial deformation of deepwater test string li et al 2008 2011a b 2012 considered the performance of fluid in a test string and the internal pressure of the string and established a mathematical model of mechanics analysis for test string formation in the test zeng et al 2010 established a prediction model for the variation of the temperature and pressure in the test string and analyzed the influence of pressure and temperature changes on the stress and deformation of the test string wendler et al 2012 studied the influence of some important parameters on the vibration of test string in the process of deepwater testing and found that the mobile vessels and ocean load had great influence on the vibration of test string zhang et al 2014 established the longitudinal vibration mechanics model of a deepwater test string and analyzed the longitudinal free dynamical characteristics of the test string using vibration mechanics theory wei and liu 2015 analyzed the mechanical behavior of a deepwater test string and suggested that the dynamic model of the test string should consider factors such as riser influence high pressure fluid and perforation impact load he et al 2017 established the calculation model of the deformation of a deepwater test string and concluded that the test string s possible dangerous segment was generally in the state of complex force in three directions patcha et al 2017 discussed the smart drilling stem test string and evaluated a deepwater well test operation and formation segment gao et al 2019 studied a test string s dynamic behavior during the testing process and found that the slip joint did not interrupt the test string s mechanical behavior during the testing process the previous studies have focused on the mechanical behavior of buckling deformation of test strings under the change of pressure and temperature furthermore the previous models were mainly used for land formation segment test string however for the deepwater test string subjected to ocean load the test string of seawater segment will deform with the riser deformation during the deepwater testing the gas flows out of the formation and get into the test string in the formation segment and then passes through the deformed test string in the seawater segment where the high speed flow of gas may induce the large vibration of the test string both in lateral and longitudinal directions li 2012 the large lateral and longitudinal displacement of the test string may cause the collision between the test string and the riser which may result in strength and safety issues of the test string nevertheless previous studies have not analyzed the dynamic characteristics of the deepwater test string and the collision between the test string and the riser in the process of testing yet thus the engineering problem of gas induced deepwater test string vibration shall be studied and the deepwater test string vibration damage issue must be solved in the process of deepwater testing this study aims to investigate the dynamic characteristics of the deepwater test string a fluid structure interaction analysis model for the deepwater test string was established by considering the deformation of the test string in the seawater segment and the combination with the formation segment the method of characteristics moc was used to solve the model and a similarity experiment was performed to verify the model through simulation the vibration mechanism of the deepwater test string was analyzed and its dynamical characteristics were discussed 2 fluid structure coupling vibration model of a deepwater test string the deepwater test string system is a double layer string system which divided into seawater and formation segments the inner layer is the test string structure which isolated from the production zone by packer and the riser and casing are the outer layers of the seawater section and formation section respectively as shown in fig 1 the outer layer of the seawater segment string is primarily composed of the riser the bop and the flexible joint the inner layer is primarily composed of the flow head the underwater safety valve the underwater test tree and the tubing for connection during oil and gas testing high pressure oil and gas flow enter the wellbore from the reservoir and then through the test string 2 1 lateral deformation model for the test string in seawater segment in deep water testing environment the seawater section of the test string is mainly affected by the complex marine environmental load since the riser deformation is consistent with the lateral deformation of the test string in the offshore condition the lateral deformation of the riser is used to simulate the lateral deformation of the test string instead he 2015 so as to provide initial conditions for the dynamic calculation of the vibration of the test string induced by internal fluid under the bending condition the governing equation of the riser can be expressed as meng 2018 1 e i

riser can be expressed as 3 x 0 t 0 e i 2 x 0 t z 2 k h x 0 t z 4 x l t s p e i 2 x l t z 2 k u x l t z the marine environmental loads on the riser are generated by waves surface currents and winds the combined wave surface current and wind loads are calculated by the following formula wilson 2003 5 f y 1 2 c ρ w d d z u x u x c m ρ w π d z 2 4 d u x d t 1 2 c d d z ρ w u 2 where c d is the drag

which can be simplified into homogeneous circular segment beams constrained at both ends as shown in fig 2 a this study focuses on the deformation and vibration of the test string induced by the gas test process the impact and contact force between the test string and the riser are disregarded and the test string s initial deformation in the seawater segment is consistent with that of the riser for test string systems in which the inner diameter of the pipe is much smaller than the pipe length and usually be calculated based on timoshenko beam model lesmez 1989 shen et al 2009 during the testing the gas flows in the test string at high speed so that the timoshenko beam element model is more adoptable for the deepwater test string than euler bernoulli model xia et al 2020 and the bending force and displacement satisfy hooker s law wiggert and tijsseling 2001 the fluid structure coupling equations of the test string are derived from the test string element for force analysis as

and the initial gas velocity is considered the flow of gas in the test string at a constant velocity the upper end of the deepwater test string is fixed at the platform limiting the lateral and longitudinal displacements and rotation of the upper test string the upper end boundary of the test string can be described as he 2015 shen et al 2009 20 u x 0 u y 0 u z 0 ϕ x 0 ϕ y 0 ϕ z 0 the lower

is called a positive characteristic line and expressed as c d z d t a p 1 indicates that the propagation direction is the same as the negative direction of the z axis and thus is called a negative characteristic line and expressed as c 26 c d m z d t a p 1 ρ p j d ϕ z d t 0 d z d t a p 1 g ρ p 27 c d m z d t a p 1 ρ p j d ϕ z d t 0 d z d t a p 1 similarly partial differential equations 8 19 can be transformed into corresponding characteristic equations see appendix a fig 3 shows the computational grid the characteristic waves are integrated into their respective characteristic lines the obtained 14 resulting finite difference equations are combined with boundary conditions to solve the discrete points along the test string keramat et al 2012 tijsseling 2003 the simplified flowchart of the model solution process is depicted in fig 4 3 model validation to verify the fluid structure coupling vibration model of the deepwater test string similar experiments were conducted to test string dynamical characteristics in the seawater segment the basic parameters of the test string system are shown in table 1 the experimental schematic is shown in fig 5 and the actual experimental process is shown in fig 6 the experimental equipment primarily included the test string model and the strain analysis system a pe pipe was adopted in the test string system the outer and inner pipes were the riser and the test string respectively as shown in fig 7 a many strain sensors were installed around the inner pipe to collect strain data of the test string the vibration data of test string were obtained via data analysis and processing mao et al 2015 under the condition of 0 1 m s of surface current velocity and 80 m3 h of gas production the test string s lateral deformation was consistent with the riser s as shown in fig 7 b the numerical results of the test string s deformation distribution at a certain time and the lateral displacement at point 4 of the test string are compared with the experimental results as shown in fig 8 the numerical results agree well with the experimental results and the slight difference between the numerical and experimental results might be caused by the unsteady gas flow in the experimental process 4 engineering case analysis 4 1 basic parameters and analysis of results the test string s initial deformation of the seawater segment is consistent with that of the riser which can be verified through similar experiments on the dynamical characteristics of the test string in the above seawater segment a deepwater well in the south china sea mao et al 2016a b was selected for dynamical characteristic analysis the initial morphology of the test string is shown in fig 9 table 2 lists the main parameters of the experiment mao et al 2016a b fig 10 shows the lateral vibration of the test string when gas production is 100 104 m3 d fig 10 a shows the lateral deformation of the test string at different times and fig 10 b presents the cloud chart of the test string s lateral displacement changing with time fig 10 indicates that when gas passes through the test string the test string generates periodic vibration and the lateral deformation of the test string in the seawater segment is evidently larger than that in the formation segment under the action of ocean load the test string of the seawater segment deforms considerably along with the riser and the deformation of the test string will affects the distribution and size of gas pulsation wang et al 2011 the gas will exerts additional force on the curved test string while its velocity and direction change due to the deformation of the test string when passes through it consequently the vibration of the seawater test string is greater than that of the formation segment yu et al 2015 fig 11 shows the time variation of the lateral displacement and the maximum lateral amplitude of the test string at different positions the lateral amplitude of the test string in the seawater segment is relatively large and the lateral displacement of the test string is the largest at 500 m node 6 near the middle the lateral vibration amplitude of the test string in the formation segment is relatively small which is consistent with the law presented in fig 10 fig 12 shows the test string position relationship with the riser and the casing the distance between the test string and the riser is 0 19 m and the distance between the casing is 0 05m as shown in fig 11 b the maximum lateral vibration amplitude of the test string in the seawater segment is 0 69 m which exceeds the maximum space between the test string and the riser the maximum vibration amplitude of the middle and upper parts in the formation segment is 0 12 m which exceeds the maximum space between the test string and the casing therefore the test string collides both with the casing and the riser fig 13 shows the time variation of the longitudinal displacement and the longitudinal maximum amplitude of the test string at different positions fig 13 shows that the test string also generates large longitudinal vibration and the longitudinal amplitude of the test string in the formation segment is larger than that in the seawater segment the closer to the lower end of the test string the greater the longitudinal amplitude of the test string among which the longitudinal amplitude of the test string s bottom end node 21 is the largest under the action of high speed gas flow the force fluctuation of the test string is induced and gas exerts an axial force on the test string resulting in the longitudinal vibration of the test string ju et al 2014 when gas flows from the formation into the test string the string s lateral amplitude is zero due to the packer constraints near the bottom lateral displacement zero longitudinal free constraints as shown in fig 11 b the pressure energy of gas was converted into the longitudinal vibration energy of the test string and thus the longitudinal amplitude was maximum near the bottom of the test string yang 2007 in addition the test string in the formation segment is initially in vertical shape and its elastic deformation space is large yang et al 2016 therefore when gas passes through the test string the longitudinal displacement of the test string in the formation segment is larger than that in the seawater segment 4 2 effect of the surface current velocity on the test string s dynamical characteristics fig 14 shows the comparison diagram of the test string morphologies at different surface current velocities fig 15 a b present the time variation of the lateral displacement of the test string at different surface current velocities respectively fig 15 c shows the comparison diagram of the test string s maximum lateral displacement amplitude fig 16 shows the comparison cloud of the test string s lateral displacement fig 17 a b and c show the time variation of the longitudinal displacement of the test string s different nodes at different surface current velocities respectively fig 17 d shows the comparison diagram of the test string s maximum longitudinal amplitude three different surface current velocities of 0 m s 0 8 m s and 1 1 m s were set up to study the influence of surface current velocity on the dynamic characteristics of the test string the variation of surface current velocity has great influence on the lateral deformation of test string as shown in fig 14 and the lateral deformation of test string increases with the increase of surface current velocity figs 15 17 show the consistent rule that the vibration of the test string exhibits a periodic change and both the lateral and longitudinal displacements increase with surface current velocity turning up when the test string deforms under surface current load the vibration of which is relatively stable and the amplitude is larger with the increase of the lateral displacement the vibration amplitude of the test string is smaller and gradually decays when the test string is not subjected to surface current load by contrast the reason is that the test string is not deformed and both ends are fixed the test string exhibits a tension state and thus the stiffness of the test string increases and the deformation resistance of the test string increases yang 2007 thus in actual engineering the damage caused by the vibration of the test string can be reduced significantly by impairing the influence of ocean surface current on the test string shape 4 3 effect of gas production on the test string s dynamical characteristics fig 18 a b show the time history diagram of lateral displacement of the test string at different gas production respectively fig 18 c shows the comparison diagram of the test string s maximum lateral displacement amplitude fig 19 shows the comparison cloud of the test string s lateral displacement fig 20 a and b and 20 c show the longitudinal displacement time changes of the test string s different nodes at different gas production respectively fig 20 d shows the comparison diagram of the test string s maximum longitudinal amplitude figs 18 20 show that the lateral and longitudinal displacements of the test string increases with an increase in gas production for high production gas wells given the increasing production the volume of gas flowing through the unit cross segmental area get larger and the velocity of gas flow within the same diameter the impact force on the test string and the test string vibration increase li et al 2011a b long term effected in this condition may cause test string failure and destruction and excessive longitudinal vibration may loosen the test string s threaded joints and lead to leakage simultaneously the test string undergoes fatigue failure at a low force level liu et al 2019 therefore the damage caused by gas induced test string vibration can be reduced by determining the optimal gas production in actual engineering 4 4 effect of the gas density on the test string s dynamical characteristics fig 21 a b show the lateral displacement time changes of the test string when gas density was 220 240 and 260 kg m3 respectively fig 21 c shows the comparison diagram of the test string s maximum lateral displacement amplitude fig 22 shows the comparison cloud of the test string s lateral displacement figs 21 and 22 show that when gas density increases the lateral displacement of the test string increases slightly and the vibration mode of the test string changes given the increasing gas density the interaction between gas and the test string increases giacobbi et al 2020 as the fluctuation amplitude of the gas density increases the test string would become more unstable due to parametric resonances bai et al 2018 xie et al 2019 therefore the lateral vibration of the test string increases and the vibration mode of the test string changes significantly fig 23 a and b and 23 c show the longitudinal displacement time changes of the test string when gas density was 220 240 and 260 kg m3 respectively fig 23 d shows the comparison diagram of the test string s maximum longitudinal displacement amplitude fig 23 shows that the change in gas density slightly influences the longitudinal vibration of the test string and the longitudinal amplitude of the test string changes less fig 23 comparison diagram of the test string s longitudinal vibration under different gas densities a with the gas density of 220 kg m3 b with a gas density of 240 kg m3 c with a gas density of 260 kg m3 and d longitudinal maximum amplitude 4 5 effect of pipe thickness on the test string s dynamical characteristics from fig 24 a and b show the lateral displacement time changes of the test string when pipe thickness was 9 65 7 37 and 6 88 mm respectively fig 24 c shows the comparison diagram of the test string s maximum lateral displacement amplitude fig 25 shows the comparison cloud of the test string s lateral displacement fig 26 a and b and 26 c show the longitudinal displacement time changes of the test string s different nodes when pipe thickness was 9 65 7 37 and 6 88 mm respectively fig 26 d shows the comparison diagram of the test string s maximum longitudinal displacement amplitude figs 24 26 show that the test string s lateral and longitudinal displacements decrease with an increase in pipe thickness the reason for this result is that the moment inertia of the test string increases with pipe thickness and thus the bending strength of the test string increases and its resistance to deformation also increases li et al 2014 tijsseling 2007 therefore in practical engineering increasing pipe thickness could reduce the damage of the test string caused by the collision between the test string and the casing and the riser 5 conclusion this research established a fluid structure interaction analysis model of deepwater test string in the process of deepwater testing the dynamic characteristics of deepwater test string solved by proposed model and method are validated against the available experiment the main conclusions are as follows when the gas passes through the deep water test string the test string will experience periodic vibration among them the test string lateral displacement of the seawater segment is larger than that of the formation segment and the lateral displacement in the middle of the test string in seawater segment is the largest so the collision probability between the test string and the riser is greatly increased the closer to the lower end of the test string the greater the longitudinal displacement of the test string among which the longitudinal amplitude at the bottom of the test string is the largest under the influence of surface current the larger the deformation of the test string in seawater section the more severe the vibration will be the lateral and longitudinal displacements of test string increase with the increase of gas production and decrease with the increase of test string thickness with the gas density in the test string increases the interaction effect between the gas and the test string increases but the influence on the longitudinal vibration of the test string is small in practical engineering we should pay more attention to the test string in the seawater segment and measures can be taken to weaken the influence of surface current load on the deformation of it the support device can be added between the riser and the test string to reduce the bending of the test string for instance and thus reduce the vibration of test string during oil and gas testing for the test string in the formation segment the longitudinal displacement of the test string in the lower section of the test string is relatively large in addition the damage to the test string caused by its vibration can be reduced by using a thicker test pipe string and choosing the optimal gas production under the premise of meeting the needs and costs of natural gas production credit authorship contribution statement liangjie mao conceptualization methodology supervision writing review editing xin he data

20596,s lay and j lay systems are progressively utilized for deepwater pipeline installation the paper presents a simple and feasible model for the static and dynamic analysis of s lay and j lay pipelines this mechanical model of the laying pipeline is established by the combination of the vector mechanics principle with the numerical technique based upon the vector form intrinsic finite element vfife method the internal forces resulted from element deformations and node rotations as well as the external forces due to hydrodynamic loads and the boundary interactions are fully taken into account the movement governing equation of pipeline particles is solved by the explicit central difference approach using program coding two numerical models of a 12 inch pipeline being laid to 1000 m water depth are created in order to illustrate in detail the modeling process of s laying and j laying pipeline respectively and also verify the feasibility of the vfife model with a reasonable accuracy for deepwater pipeline installation the effects of wave height and sloping seabed on the pipeline responses are identified and the noticeable differences of the pipeline behaviors between the s lay and j lay operation are observed the results offer a significant reference for the installation design of the offshore pipeline keywords offshore pipeline deepwater installation s lay j lay vector form intrinsic finite element vfife 1 introduction hundreds and thousands of offshore pipelines need to be installed onto the sea floor for the oil gas transportation with the great development of offshore oil and gas industries the pipelines during installation experience severe ocean environment and construction loads which always become the special emphasis in the design stage as the pipelay technology and equipment progress several installation methods such as tow lay reel lay s lay and j lay have been developed to adapt the various water depths pipe diameters and laying speeds bruschi et al 2015 in view of deepwater applications the s lay and j lay systems are deemed to be the most feasible and worldwide used gong et al 2014 as illustrated in fig 1 the s lay pipeline contains two parts one is the overbend from the tensioner to the lift off point lop on the last stinger roller location and another is the sagbend from the lop to the touchdown point tdp on the seabed the j lay pipeline just involves a suspended part of the sagbend from the pipelay tower to the tdp on the seabed during the process of laying pipelines the location of the tdp varies along the pipeline on the seabed to form a touchdown zone tdz the mechanical behaviors of s lay and j lay pipelines generally exhibit complicated non linear characteristics involving large displacements of the pipeline boundary interactions and external loads etc extensive studies have been conducted to solve these non linear problems using numerical tools such as abaqus offpipe orcaflex etc or laboratory tests the numerical tools could provide comprehensive finite element analyses of pipeline installation to obtain some desired results o grady and harte 2013 xie et al 2015 gong and xu 2016 wang et al 2017 but they are usually time consuming and sometimes complicated for structural engineers to acquire the basic principle on the other side physical modeling experiments are generally limited to local models or small scale owing to high costs and technical restrictions of laboratory facilities zhang et al 2015 ruan et al 2018 liang et al 2019 at the early design stages offshore pipeline engineers prefer to seek more plain and time saving approaches to accomplish the preliminary analysis of pipe lay configuration and mechanical behaviors therefore simple and effective methods with the reasonable accuracy are also required as auxiliary models for the fast analyses of deepwater laying pipelines several analytical and numerical means for the pipeline installation have been developed over the past decades mainly including the catenary method singular perturbation method finite difference method and finite element method dixon and rutledge 1968 guarracino and mallardo 1999 szczotka 2011 yuan et al 2012a based on the catenary and large deflection theory kang et al 2015 developed a sectional mechanics model to analyze the influence of top tension wet weight and stiffness on the j lay riser subsequently trapper 2019 considered the whole pipeline as a single continuous segment to conduct the structural analysis of laying pipeline configuration gong et al 2014 2020 presented two full finite element models separately for deepwater s lay and j lay systems to investigate the dynamic behaviors of the offshore pipeline under surface waves ocean currents and vessel motions ivic et al 2017 established a non linear elastic beam model to deal with the s lay pipeline problem and obtained the main parameters for the optimization of pipe laying kim and kim 2019 utilized the finite

pipeline installation lately xu and gong 2020a built a dedicated finite element model to evaluate the influence of pipelay parameters on the pipeline dynamic behaviors for the s lay operation an innovative numerical technique termed as the vector form intrinsic finite element vfife method was considered to be capable of dealing with some complex problems of structural analysis such as large displacements multiple material non linearities structural body movements and dynamic contact behaviors this technique proposed by ting et al 2004 has been rapidly applied for the non linear analysis of complicated structural behaviors due to its particular advantages of the simple physical concept and high computational efficiency lien et al 2012 wu 2013 recently yuan et al 2015 employed this method to investigate the landslide impact on submarine pipelines considering the axial soil resistance at the sliding zone xu and lin 2017a 2017b explored the influence of initial stress and imperfection size on the critical axial forces of upheaval buckling for submarine pipelines on the uneven seabed li et al 2018 analyzed the non linear behaviors of three types of marine risers with large deformations in three dimensional spaces in this paper a simple and feasible numerical model was proposed for the analysis of the deepwater s lay and j lay pipeline based upon the vfife technique in this model the laying pipeline was discretized into a series of mass particles which were connected by massless beam elements the movement governing equations of the pipeline particles were established by using the second newton s law in which the particle displacement and position vectors were described by tracing the nodal movements in a path unit moreover the internal forces were calculated in light of element deformations and node rotations and the external forces including contact forces with stinger rollers seabed soil resistance and hydrodynamic forces were sufficiently taken into account the explicit central difference method was adopted to solve the governing equations via a great number of loop iterations with matlab program codes the effectiveness and applicability of the vfife method for pipeline installation were verified by two numerical models of the 12 inch pipelines being laid to 1000 m water depth subsequently the influences of wave height and sloping seabed on dynamic behaviors of the s laying and j laying pipelines were adequately assessed to offer a significant reference for the design of deepwater pipeline installation 2 vfife modeling of s lay and j lay pipeline the vfife method combining the vector mechanics with the finite element technique is deemed to be an innovative concept for the analysis of structural behaviors the fundamental principles of this method are presented in detail with clear physical concepts in the references ting et al 2004 2012 which contain point value description path unit element deformation and corresponding mechanical formulations this method is adopted in the literature to establish a feasible model for the simulation of deepwater s lay and j lay pipelines whose main characteristics are briefly depicted in the following sections 2 1 movement governing equations to better describe the s lay and j lay model a global coordinate system x y z is established with the origin point at the top end of laying pipeline as displayed in fig 2 the initial position of the laying pipeline is a horizontal straight line which is divided into n segments by n 1 nodes also called mass particles the mechanical properties of the pipeline such as mass weight buoyancy drag etc are concentrated on the particles the top particle of the pipeline is fixed on the pipelay vessel and the other particles of the pipeline moved from the sea level to the designated positions in the given time simultaneously the gravity and buoyancy are loaded on the pipeline in a ramped loading way for the s lay a part of pipeline particles in the overbend will contact with the stinger rollers at fixed coordinate positions another part of the pipeline particles in the tdz will be supported by the seabed soil at horizontal positions finally the pipeline under the combined actions of gravity buoyancy and contact forces attain the target s lay and j lay shape at the equilibrium positions assuming that t 0 and t n are the starting and ending time of the node movement the time from t 0 to t n is discretized into a sequence of smaller time steps δt divided by t 0 t i 1 t i t i 1 t n during one time step t i 1 t t i the initial conditions of all particles use the state at t i 1 instead of the starting state at t 0 the displacement and position of the pipeline are described by tracing the nodal movements based upon the second newton s law the movement governing equations of the pipeline particles can be expressed as 1 m j d 2 x j d t 2 t f j ext t f j int t f j dmp t i j d 2 θ j d t 2 t m j ext t m j int t m j dmp t j 1 2 n where m j and i j are the mass and rotational inertia matrix of the particle j x j and θ j are the displacement and rotation angle matrix f j ext and m j ext are the external force and moment matrix f j int and m j int are the internal force and moment matrix f j dmp and m j dmp are the damping force and moment matrix 2 2 internal forces in order to calculate the internal forces a group of local axial coordinate systems x ˆ y ˆ z ˆ is built along the rod segment during one time step ti 1 t ti the displacement and rotation angle of the particle at the ti 1 time are given as the initial parameters the virtual inverse motion including the translation and the rotation can be carried out to obtain the pure deformation δ ˆ e of the segment i j and the rotation angles ϕ ˆ j of the particle i and j which are separately given by 2 δ ˆ e l i l i 1 ϕ ˆ j β ˆ x j β ˆ x i β ˆ y j θ ˆ y t β ˆ z j θ ˆ z t j i j where li and li 1 are the segment i j length at the ti and ti 1 time β ˆ x j β ˆ y j and β ˆ z j are the rotation angle of particles i and j at the ti 1 time β ˆ x i is the twist angle of the particle i θ ˆ y t and θ ˆ z t are the bending angle of the segment i j based upon the flexural theory of materials mechanics the internal force of the rod segment is calculated by the pure deformation of the segment and the rotation angle of the particle thus for one time step ti 1 t ti the corresponding increment of internal forces can be expressed as 3 δ f ˆ x ˆ j δ m ˆ x ˆ j δ m ˆ k i δ m ˆ k j 1 l i 1 e a 0 0 0 0 g h ˆ 0 0 0 0 4 i ˆ k 2 i ˆ k 0 0 2 i ˆ k 4 i ˆ k δ ˆ e ϕ ˆ x ˆ j ϕ ˆ k i ϕ ˆ k j k y ˆ z ˆ where δ f ˆ and δ m ˆ are the tension and bending moment incrememt e and g are the elastic and secant modulus of the pipe a is the cross section area of the pipe ĥ and i ˆ k are the torsional and axial moments of inertia of the pipe and given by h ˆ i ˆ y ˆ i ˆ z ˆ π d 4 1 d 1 d 4 32 the other six component increments of forces and moments can be calculated by the force equlibrium equations the internal force f ˆ i j and moment m ˆ i j of the two particles i and j can be calculated by adding the correponding increments in the local coordinate and the coordinate transformation is then conducted to obtain the internal forces in the global coordinate system which are integrated to the particles and given by 4 f j int r i ω i t f ˆ i j m j int r i ω i t m ˆ i j j i j where r i is the positive rotation matrix ω i t is the transformation matrix from local coordinate to global coordinate the detailed expressions of the two matrixes are in appendix a 2 3 external forces 2 3 1 contact forces with stinger rollers for the s lay operation the pipeline in the overbend is continuously supported by the stinger rollers prior to calculating their contact forces an inspection should be conducted to confirm that the pipeline is in contact with the roller the locations of stinger rollers are firstly defined by a set of coordinate points for each roller point a nearest pipe segment with two adjacent pipe nodes would be found through a series of iterative pilot calculations the distance and position vector between the roller point and pipe nodes are then calculated to determine the contact condition if the mutual interaction is identified the contact force is finally calculated and applied to the pipe segment the segment forces are distributed to the adjacent nodes based on the distance between the node and the roller as illustrated in fig 3 the contact forces of the pipe segment and adjacent nodes are separately given by 5 f r 1 1 k 1 1 k 2 d r 1 r 2 6 f r 1 d 2 d 1 d 2 f r f r 2 d 1 d 1 d 2 f r where k 1 and k 2 are the contact stiffness of the pipe and the roller relative to the pipe diameter and self weight d is the shortest separation distance of the centerlines between the pipe and the roller r 1 and r 2 are the radii of the pipe and the roller d 1 and d 2 are the distances between the node 1 node 2 and the roller respectively 2 3 2 seabed soil resistance the laying pipeline at the bottom is freely supported by the seabed soil during s lay and j lay operation the seabed soil resistance behaves non linearly to the pipeline embedment and several soil models have been developed to reveal the pipe soil interaction mechanisms during the pipelay process aubeny and biscontin 2009 randolph and quiggin 2009 yuan et al 2012b in this study the interaction relationship between the pipeline and seabed soil is derived from a non linear soil model randolph and quiggin 2009 as illustrated in fig 4 four kinds of penetration modes including not in contact initial penetration uplift and repenetration are applied to simulate the cyclic variations of the pipeline periodic embedment into the seabed the soil resistance p z for different penetration modes is depending upon the ultimate penetration resistance p u z and expressed as 7 p z ξ 1 ξ p u z 8 p u z a z d b s u z d where ξ z d k max is a non dimensional penetration factor d is the pipe diameter z is the pipeline penetration k max is the normalized maximum stiffness the soil undrained shear strength refers to s u z s u 0 s ug z in which s u0 is the mudline shear strength and s ug is the shear strength gradient a and b are the non dimensional penetration coefficients 2 3 3 hydrodynamic forces the pipeline during deepwater installation is subjected to the hydrodynamic loads which are induced by surface waves and ocean currents the fluid velocity for each wave component is predicted in the basis of the airy wave theory the ocean current is generally looked on as a two dimensional steady flow in the vertical profile variable in magnitude and consistence in direction with water depth the hydrodynamic forces can be calculated in light of the morison s equation morison et al 1950 which is expressed as 9 f d 1 2 c d ρ a v r v r where c d is the drag coefficient for the pipe ρ is the density of water a is the drag area v r is the fluid velocity relative to the pipe 3 solution procedure in view of the vfife analysis of s lay and j lay pipeline the central difference method is ulitized to solve the movement governing eq 1 and the absolute displacement and rotation angle of the pipeline particles are calculated by 10 x j i 1 2 c 1 x j i c 2 x j i 1 c 1 δ t 2 m 1 f ext f int θ j i 1 2 c 1 θ j i c 2 θ j i 1 c 1 δ t 2 i 1 m ext m int where c 1 1 1 ζ δ t 2 and c 2 c 1 1 ζ δ t 2 are the damping coefficients ζ is the damping factor δt is the time step at the initial time the external and internal forces and moments are calculated in light of the default parameters and the displacement x j 1 and rotation angle θ j 1 of the pipe particle at the time t 1 can be obtained by 11 x j 1 x j 0 δ t 1 1 2 δ t ζ x j 0 δ t 2 f ext f int 2 m j θ j 1 θ j 0 δ t 1 1 2 δ t ζ θ j 0 δ t 2 m ext m int 2 i j where x j 0 and θ j 0 are the displacement and rotation angle of the pipe particle j at the time t 0 x j 0 and θ j 0 are the displacement velocity and rotation velocity of the pipe particle j at the time t 0 the numerical calculation of the s lay and j lay pipeline is performed by the coding program the calculation procedure is illustrated in fig 5 and summarized as follows ① input the initial parameters for the laying pipeline stinger rollers for the s lay and seabed soil set the calculated time step δt and the total time et and conduct the initial calculation based on eq 11 ② compute the displacement and rotation of pipe particles by eq 10 ③ calculate the internal forces f j int and m j int from the element

resistance by pipe soil interaction from eq 7 8 and the hydrodynamic forces induced by surface waves and ocean currents from eq 9 ⑤ solve the motion governing eq 1 with all the internal and external forces using the central difference method ⑥ go to the next step and conduct the calculation by the next time increment until reaching the total time 4 results and discussion 4 1 forming process of s lay and j lay pipeline in order to evaluate the effectiveness and applicability of the vfife method two numerical models of the s lay and j lay pipeline were established to analyze the pipeline static and dynamic behaviors in deepwater installation the basic parameters for the laying pipeline were selected from a practical engineering case in the liwan3 1 lw3 1 gas field in the south china sea the steel pipe diameter is 323 9 mm with a wall thickness of 23 8 mm elastic modulus of 2 07 105 mpa and poisson s ratio of 0 3 for modeling the seabed soil the undrained shear strength of the soil is assumed to have zero strength intercept at the mudline with a shear strength gradient of 1 5 kpa m the soil coefficients a and b are taken as 6 0 and 0 25 respectively and the non dimensional penetration factor kmax is set as 200 besides a stinger with a total length of 100 m and a curvature radius of 98 m is set up for the s lay operation the laying water depth is 1000 m fig 6 illustrates the forming process of the pipeline configuration for the s lay and j lay installation the pipeline is located at the sea level at the initial time t 0 s and then continuously descends onto the seabed with the damping factor of 1 0 finally the pipeline is anchored at a horizontal position of x 2000 m and gradually shapes into a catenary configuration with the damping factor of 10 0 in view of the s lay process the pipeline in the overbend is supported by stinger rollers and forms an arc shape a small time step of 5 10 5 s is needed for the calculation due to the pipe stinger roller interaction and the total calculated time of 300 s is used to attain a stable s shaped state for the j lay process a time step of 1 10 4 s is suitable but the total calculated time of 500 s is required for the pipeline to achieve the final j shaped state the time history of pipe tension at the top node is shown in fig 7 for the s lay the top tension of the pipeline increases from 0 kn to 1306 11 kn then has a slight decrease to 1280 75 kn and finally reached to the maximum value of 1821 72 kn similarly the top tension of the j lay pipeline firstly has a great increase from 0 kn to 1399 60 kn then reduced to 1028 20 kn and at last slightly increased to a stable value of 1060 01 kn the tension time history of the top node reflects the whole laying process of the pipeline from the sea level to the sea floor the time history of the top tension for the s lay is different from the j lay after the time of 100 s for which the deflection of the s lay pipeline varies more slowly than that of the j lay pipeline due to the support of stinger rollers in the overbend 4 2 comparison and verification 4 2 1 static response the static behaviors of the s lay and j lay pipeline in terms of configuration axial tension bending moment and stress are compared with the corresponding results calculated by the orcaflex orcina 2017 as presented in fig 8 the close agreements of both methods are observed for the s lay and j lay pipeline respectively the distribution curves of the configuration and axial tension are matched along the entire pipeline for the two numerical methods the deflection of the j lay pipeline is steeper than that of the s lay pipeline and thus the axial tension of the j lay pipeline is smaller in contrast with the one of the s lay pipeline moreover the variation trends of the bending moment and stress of the pipeline from the vfife method are close to the results from orcaflex the maximum bending moment and stress of the pipeline occurred in the overbend for the s lay installation as a result of the stinger roller support and in the touchdown zone for the j lay installation induced by the seabed soil resistance to further explore the difference of pipeline responses between the s lay and the j lay the maximum static response results for both laying techniques are illustrated in fig 9 the axial tension of the s lay pipeline at the top end is 1821 72 kn while the axial tension of the j lay pipeline at the top end is only 1061 01 kn and the difference between two laying methods is 41 76 the maximum axial tensions of the laying pipeline at the tdz are 921 25 kn and 164 06 kn for both laying techniques and the difference attains 82 19 the maximum bending moment and stress of the s lay pipeline are 626 96 kn m and 480 24 mpa in the overbend and just 54 23 kn m and 75 68 mpa in the sagbend the maximum bending moment and stress of the j lay pipeline are 261 34 kn m and 174 03 mpa in the sagbend the differences reach 381 91 and 129 96 in contrast with these results of the s lay pipeline in the same zone 4 2 2 dynamic response in the dynamic analysis a regular ocean condition is used for convenient comparison the surface wave time history is shown in fig 10 with the wave height of 1 0 m according to the practical measurement in the lw3 1 gas field the vertical distribution of current velocity among various water depths is displayed in fig 11 with the surface velocity of 1 0 m s and the current direction is set as 0 deg along with the pipelay direction the effects of surface waves and ocean currents on the laying pipeline are mainly in two aspects one is the wave induced pipelay vessel motions which offer a great excitation on the top end of the pipeline and another is the hydrodynamic loads which are acted on the pipeline the wave frequency motion of the pipelay vessel is calculated by use of the displacement response amplitude operator rao which defines the vessel motions responses for each degree of freedom dof to one prescribed wave direction and period the heave motion of the vessel is demonstrated to be the dominant motion response among the six dofs motions of the pipelay vessel xu and gong 2020b and thus it is considered in this study for the dynamic analysis given by v t r h a cos 2 π t t φ where r h is the heave displacement rao of the vessel a is the wave amplitude t is the wave period and ϕ is the phase lag in the dynamic analyses of s lay and j lay pipelines the basic parameters of r h 1 5 t 8 0 s and ϕ π 2 are assumed the heave motion time history responses of the s lay and j lay vessel are illustrated in fig 12 which match consistently between the vfife method and orcaflex besides the axial and normal drag coefficients of 0 024 and 1 2 are separately assumed to calculate the hydrodynamic forces the numerical damping in the vfife method is crucial for the dynamic response analysis of the laying pipeline in deep waters and it should be reasonably selected fig 13 shows the effect of the damping factor on the maximum and minimum tension response of the s lay and j lay pipeline at the top end with the increase of damping factor from 1 0 to 2 5 the maximum tension of the s lay pipeline linearly increases from 1974 41 kn to 2132 30 kn whilst the minimum tension of the pipeline gradually decreases from 1676 06 kn to 1524 01 kn the tension time history agrees well with the time domain response results obtained by the orcaflex when the damping factor is 1 5 as shown in fig 14 a similarly for the j lay operation as the damping factor augments from 1 0 to 1 75 the maximum tension of the pipeline enlarge from 1145 86 kn to 1189 99 kn and the minimum tension of the pipeline reduces from 980 39 kn to 936 29 kn the tension time history matches well with the corresponding results calculated by the orcaflex when the damping factor is 1 25 as displayed in fig 14 b therefore the structural damping factors of 1 5 and 1 25 are separately employed for the s lay and j lay pipeline to obtain the accurate dynamic response behaviors fig 15 and fig 16 illustrate the maximum dynamic response results of each pipe particle along the s lay and j lay pipeline which are calculated by the vfife method and the orcaflex respectively the axial tensions of the overall pipeline coincide well for the s lay and j lay operations moreover the curves of bending moments for both laying operations independently match together along the entire pipeline particularly in the overbend region for the s lay the variable trend of bending moment due to the roller supports is highly coincident and the actual minor difference becomes insignificant the close agreements of the response results further verify the reasonable accuracy of the vfife method for the dynamic analysis of deepwater pipeline installation 4 3 effect of wave height for the sake of having a distinct intuition to the effect of wave height on the dynamic responses of s lay and j lay pipelines six groups of wave heights 0 0 5 1 0 1 5 2 0 and 2 5 m are selected in the numerical analyses the axial tension and bending moment of the s lay and j lay pipelines are separately shown in fig 17 and fig 18 and their maximum responses varying with wave heights are displayed in fig 19 as the wave height increases from 0 0 m to 2 5 m the axial tensions of the overall pipeline have a significant increase for the two laying operations the maximum tension at the top end augments 27 95 from 1821 72 kn to 2330 84 kn for the s lay and 22 91 from 1061 01 kn to 1304 12 kn for the j lay whereas the bending moments of the pipeline for the two laying operations slightly increase the increment of maximum bending moment is just 3 84 from 626 96 kn m to 651 06 kn m for the s lay and 11 52 from 261 34 kn m to 291 45 kn m for the j lay as can be seen from fig 19 the axial tension and bending moment of both the s lay and j lay pipelines linearly increase with the increase of wave height the maximum responses of the pipeline for the s lay operation are evidently larger than those for the j lay operation 4 4 effect of sloping seabed the seabed in deep waters is generally uneven with a certain slope and the sloping seabed is a considerable factor for the route survey of offshore pipeline installation in order to investigate the influence of sloping seabed on the dynamic behaviors of the s lay and j lay pipelines two seabed cases are used in the numerical models for the comparison one case is that the pipeline is laid on the horizontal seabed and the other case is that the pipeline is laid on the sloping seabed with a gradient of 4 the wave height is taken as 1 0 m and other parameters are identical with the above mentioned ones the pipeline configuration axial tension and bending moment of the s laying and j laying pipeline onto the horizontal seabed and sloping seabed are illustrated in fig 20 to fig 22 respectively see fig 21 it can be seen from the configuration distribution curves that the laying pipeline onto the sloping seabed is steeper than that onto the horizontal seabed particularly in the tdz for the j lay operation in the case of considering sloping seabed the axial tension of the entire pipeline has a great augment for both s lay and j lay operation and the maximum tensions at the top end attain 2161 74 kn and 1360 86 kn respectively while the pipeline was laid onto the horizontal seabed the maximum tensions are only 2026 86 kn and 1112 26 kn and the differences for both cases reach 6 65 and 22 35 respectively the bending moments of the s lay pipeline for the two seabed cases are almost identical as a whole except at the location of contacting with the last roller the pipeline bending moment reduces 24 43 from 559 62 kn m to 422 93 kn m besides the bending moment distribution of the j lay pipeline for both seabed cases differs and the maximum bending moment decreases 31 93 from 263 81 kn m to 179 58 kn m when considering the effect of sloping seabed these results adequately demonstrated that the sloping seabed affects the configuration axial tension and bending moment of the laying pipeline especially in the tdz 5 conclusion the paper presents an effective and feasible model for the simulation of deepwater s lay and j lay pipeline through the vfife technique this model discretizes the laying pipeline into a series of mass particles connected by massless beam elements the movement governing equations of the pipeline particles are built based on the second newton s law in which the particle displacement and position vector are represented by tracing the nodal movements in a path unit furthermore the internal forces and the external forces of the laying pipeline are investigated in detail the explicit central difference approach is employed to solve the governing equations by using matlab program coding the static and dynamic behaviors of an s lay and j lay pipeline are obtained in terms of the laying configuration axial tension bending moment and stress the significant contribution of this study is to observe the remarkable differences of the pipeline behaviors between the s lay and j lay operation some crucial conclusions are summarized as follows 1 the vfife model of laying pipeline based upon the vector mechanics and the finite element technique can dynamically simulate the forming process of the s lay and j lay pipeline in the numerical calculation a smaller time step is required for the s lay installation than that for the j lay installation due to the contact of the pipeline and stinger rollers the deflection of the s lay pipeline varies more slowly in contrast with one of the j lay pipeline the top tension of the laying pipeline firstly increases then slightly decreases and finally reaches a stable value as the pipeline is gradually laid onto the seabed 2 the static and dynamic behaviors of the s lay and j lay pipeline are reasonably modeled by the numerical model composing of mass particles and massless elements the calculated results are compared with the ones obtained by the orcaflex in terms of pipe lay configuration axial tension bending moment and stress the close agreements are observed to verify the accuracy and applicability of the vfife model for the analysis of pipeline installation the maximum tension bending moment and stress of the s lay pipeline are obviously larger than those of the j lay pipeline 3 the numerical damping in the vfife model is a considerable influencing factor of the pipeline dynamic behaviors the increase of the damping factor raises the maximum tensions of the s lay and j lay pipeline and reduces the minimum tensions of both laying pipelines additionally the variation of the pipeline tension amplitude for the s lay operation is more sensible in contrast with that for the j lay operation the rational selection of damping factor is crucial for the dynamic response analysis of deepwater laying pipelines 4 the wave height has an evident influence on the dynamic behaviors of the s lay and j lay pipeline the augment of wave height enhances the axial tension and bending moment of the two laying pipelines the effect of wave height on the pipeline responses for the s lay operation is more obvious in axial tension but relatively smaller in bending moment compared to corresponding results for the j lay operation the influencing levels of wave height on dynamic behaviors of the pipeline are distinctly different between the s lay and j lay methods which should be reasonably considered in the deepwater pipeline design 5 the pipeline being laid onto the sloping seabed is significantly different in contrast with the one onto the horizontal seabed particularly in the touchdown zone the deflections of the pipelines are steeper the axial tensions of the pipelines are larger but the bending moments of the pipelines are smaller for both s lay and j lay operations additionally it is recommended that the detailed influences of various types of sloping seabeds on the pipeline behaviors during the laying process be further investigated in future researches credit authorship contribution statement pu xu

accuracy for deepwater pipeline installation the effects of wave height and sloping seabed on the pipeline responses are identified and the noticeable differences of the pipeline behaviors between the s lay and j lay operation are observed the results offer a significant reference for the installation design of the offshore pipeline keywords offshore pipeline deepwater installation s lay j lay vector form intrinsic finite element vfife 1 introduction hundreds and thousands of offshore pipelines need to be installed onto the sea floor for the oil gas transportation with the great development of offshore oil and gas industries the pipelines during installation experience severe ocean environment and construction loads which always become the special emphasis in the design stage as the pipelay technology and equipment progress several installation methods such as tow lay reel lay s lay and j lay have been developed to adapt the various water depths pipe diameters and laying speeds bruschi et al 2015 in view of deepwater applications the s lay and j lay systems are deemed to be the most feasible and worldwide used gong et al 2014 as illustrated in fig 1 the s lay pipeline contains two parts one is the overbend from the tensioner to the lift off point lop on the last stinger roller location and another is the sagbend from the lop to the touchdown point tdp on the seabed the j lay pipeline just involves a suspended part of the sagbend from the pipelay tower to the tdp on the seabed during the process of laying pipelines the location of the tdp varies along the pipeline on the seabed to form a touchdown zone tdz the mechanical behaviors of s lay and j lay pipelines generally exhibit complicated non linear characteristics involving large displacements of the pipeline boundary interactions and external loads etc extensive studies have been conducted to solve these non linear problems using numerical tools such as abaqus offpipe orcaflex etc or laboratory tests the numerical tools could provide comprehensive finite element analyses of pipeline installation to obtain some desired results o grady and harte 2013 xie et al 2015 gong and xu 2016 wang et al 2017 but they are usually time consuming and sometimes complicated for structural engineers to acquire the basic principle on the other side physical modeling experiments are generally limited to local models or small scale owing to high costs and technical restrictions of laboratory facilities zhang et al 2015 ruan et al 2018 liang et al 2019 at the early design stages offshore pipeline engineers prefer to seek more plain and time saving approaches to accomplish the preliminary analysis of pipe lay configuration and mechanical behaviors therefore simple and effective methods with the reasonable accuracy are also required as auxiliary models for the fast analyses of deepwater laying pipelines several analytical and numerical means for the pipeline installation have been developed over the past decades mainly including the catenary method singular perturbation method finite difference method and finite element method dixon and rutledge 1968 guarracino and mallardo 1999 szczotka 2011 yuan et al 2012a based on the catenary and large deflection theory kang et al 2015 developed a sectional mechanics model to analyze the influence of top tension wet weight and stiffness on the j lay riser subsequently trapper 2019 considered the whole pipeline as a single continuous segment to conduct the structural analysis of laying pipeline configuration gong et al 2014 2020 presented two full finite element models separately for deepwater s lay and j lay systems to investigate the dynamic behaviors of the offshore pipeline under surface waves ocean currents and vessel motions ivic et al 2017 established a non linear elastic beam model to deal with the s lay pipeline problem and obtained the main parameters for the optimization of pipe laying kim and kim 2019 utilized the finite element method and the minimum energy principle to formulate a time domain motion equation for the j lay and s lay pipeline and proposed an efficient analysis approach for structural safety design of pipeline installation lately xu and gong 2020a built a dedicated finite element model to evaluate the influence of pipelay parameters on the pipeline dynamic behaviors for the s lay operation an innovative numerical technique termed as the vector form intrinsic finite element vfife method was considered to be capable of dealing with some complex problems of structural analysis such as large displacements multiple material non linearities structural body movements and dynamic contact behaviors this technique proposed by ting et al 2004 has been rapidly applied for the non linear analysis of complicated structural behaviors due to its particular advantages of the simple physical concept and high computational efficiency lien et al 2012 wu 2013 recently yuan et al 2015 employed this method to investigate the landslide impact on submarine pipelines considering the axial soil resistance at the sliding zone xu and lin 2017a 2017b explored the influence of initial stress and imperfection size on the critical axial forces of upheaval buckling for submarine pipelines on the uneven seabed li et al 2018 analyzed the non linear behaviors of three types of marine risers with large deformations in three dimensional spaces in this paper a simple and feasible numerical model was proposed for the analysis of the deepwater s lay and j lay pipeline based upon the vfife technique in this model the laying pipeline was discretized into a series of mass particles which were connected by massless beam elements the movement governing equations of the pipeline particles were established by using the second newton s law in which the particle displacement and position vectors were described by tracing the nodal movements in a path unit moreover the internal forces were calculated in light of element deformations and node rotations and the external forces including contact forces with stinger rollers seabed soil resistance and hydrodynamic forces were sufficiently taken into account the explicit central difference method was adopted to solve the governing equations via a great number of loop iterations with matlab program codes the effectiveness and applicability of the vfife method for pipeline installation were verified by two numerical models of the 12 inch pipelines being laid to 1000 m water depth subsequently the influences of wave height and sloping seabed on dynamic behaviors of the s laying and j laying pipelines were adequately assessed to offer a significant reference for the design of deepwater pipeline installation 2 vfife modeling of s lay and j lay pipeline the vfife method combining the vector mechanics with the finite element technique is deemed to be an innovative concept for the analysis of structural behaviors the fundamental principles of this method are presented in detail with clear physical concepts in the references ting et al 2004 2012 which contain point value description path unit element deformation and corresponding mechanical formulations this method is adopted in the literature to establish a feasible model for the simulation of deepwater s lay and j lay pipelines whose main characteristics are briefly depicted in the following sections 2 1 movement governing equations to better describe the s lay and j lay model a global coordinate system x y z is established with the origin point at the top end of laying pipeline as displayed in fig 2 the initial position of the laying pipeline is a horizontal straight line which is divided into n segments by n 1 nodes also called mass particles the mechanical properties of the pipeline such as mass weight buoyancy drag etc are concentrated on the particles the top particle of the pipeline is fixed on the pipelay vessel and the other particles of the pipeline moved from the sea level to the designated positions in the given time simultaneously the gravity and buoyancy are loaded on the pipeline in a ramped loading way for the s lay a part of pipeline particles in the overbend will contact with the stinger rollers at fixed coordinate positions another part of the pipeline particles in the tdz will be supported by the seabed soil at horizontal positions finally the pipeline under the combined actions of gravity buoyancy and contact forces attain the target s lay and j lay shape at the equilibrium positions assuming that t 0 and t n are the starting and ending time of the node movement the time from t 0 to t n is discretized into a sequence of smaller time steps δt divided by t 0 t i 1 t i t i 1 t n during one time step t i 1 t t i the initial conditions of all particles use the state at t i 1 instead of the starting state at t 0 the displacement and position of the pipeline are described by tracing the nodal movements based upon the second newton s law the movement governing equations of the pipeline particles can be expressed as 1 m j d 2 x j d t 2 t f j ext t f j int t f j dmp t i j d 2 θ j d t 2 t m j ext t m j int t m j dmp t j 1 2 n where m j and i j are the mass and rotational inertia matrix of the particle j x j and θ j are the displacement and rotation angle matrix f j ext and m j ext are the external force and moment matrix f j int and m j int are the internal force and moment matrix f j dmp and m j dmp are the damping force and moment matrix 2 2 internal forces in order to calculate the internal forces a group of local axial coordinate systems x ˆ y ˆ z ˆ is built along the rod segment during one time step ti 1 t ti the displacement and rotation angle of the particle at the ti 1 time are given as the initial parameters the virtual inverse motion including the translation and the rotation can be carried out to obtain the pure deformation δ ˆ e of the segment i j and the rotation angles ϕ ˆ j of the particle i and j which are separately given by 2 δ ˆ e l i l i 1 ϕ ˆ j β ˆ x j β ˆ x i β ˆ y j θ ˆ y t β ˆ z j θ ˆ z t j i j where li and li 1 are the segment i j length at the ti and ti 1 time β ˆ x j β ˆ y j and β ˆ z j are the rotation angle of particles i and j at the ti 1 time β ˆ x i is the twist angle of the particle i θ ˆ y t and θ ˆ z t are the bending angle of the segment i j based upon the flexural theory of materials mechanics the internal force of the rod segment is calculated by the pure deformation of the segment and the rotation angle of the particle thus for one time step ti 1 t ti the corresponding increment of internal forces can be expressed as 3 δ f ˆ x ˆ j δ m ˆ x ˆ j δ m ˆ k i δ m ˆ k j 1 l i 1 e a 0 0 0 0 g h ˆ 0 0 0 0 4 i ˆ k 2 i ˆ k 0 0 2 i ˆ k 4 i ˆ k δ ˆ e ϕ ˆ x ˆ j ϕ ˆ k i ϕ ˆ k j k y ˆ z ˆ where δ f ˆ and δ m ˆ are the tension and bending moment incrememt e and g are the elastic and secant modulus of the pipe a is the cross section area of the pipe ĥ and i ˆ k are the torsional and axial moments of inertia of the pipe and given by h ˆ i ˆ y ˆ i ˆ z ˆ π d 4 1 d 1 d 4 32 the other six component increments of forces and moments can be calculated by the force equlibrium equations the internal force f ˆ i j and moment m ˆ i j of the two particles i and j can be calculated by adding the correponding increments in the local coordinate and the coordinate transformation is then conducted to obtain the internal forces in the global coordinate system which are integrated to the particles and given by 4 f j int r i ω i t f ˆ i j m j int r i ω i t m ˆ i j j i j where r i is the positive rotation matrix ω i t is the transformation matrix from local coordinate to global coordinate the detailed expressions of the two matrixes are in appendix a 2 3 external forces 2 3 1 contact forces with stinger rollers for the s lay operation the pipeline in the overbend is continuously supported by the stinger rollers prior to calculating their contact forces an inspection should be conducted to confirm that the pipeline is in contact with the roller the locations of stinger rollers are firstly defined by a set of coordinate points for each roller point a nearest pipe segment with two adjacent pipe nodes would be found through a series of iterative pilot calculations the distance and position vector between the roller point and pipe nodes are then calculated to determine the contact condition if the mutual interaction is identified the contact force is finally calculated and applied to the pipe segment the segment forces are distributed to the adjacent nodes based on the distance between the node and the roller as illustrated in fig 3 the contact forces of the pipe segment and adjacent nodes are separately given by 5 f r 1 1 k 1 1 k 2 d r 1 r 2 6 f r 1 d 2 d 1 d 2 f r f r 2 d 1 d 1 d 2 f r where k 1 and k 2 are the contact stiffness of the pipe and the roller relative to the pipe diameter and self weight d is the shortest separation distance of the centerlines between the pipe and the roller r 1 and r 2 are the radii of the pipe and the roller d 1 and d 2 are the distances between the node 1 node 2 and the roller respectively 2 3 2 seabed soil resistance the laying pipeline at the bottom is freely supported by the seabed soil during s lay and j lay operation the seabed soil resistance behaves non linearly to the pipeline embedment and several soil models have been developed to reveal the pipe soil interaction mechanisms during the pipelay process aubeny and biscontin 2009 randolph and quiggin 2009 yuan et al 2012b in this study the interaction relationship between the pipeline and seabed soil is derived from a non linear soil model randolph and quiggin 2009 as illustrated in fig 4 four kinds of penetration modes including not in contact initial penetration uplift and repenetration are applied to simulate the cyclic variations of the pipeline periodic embedment into the seabed the soil resistance p z for different penetration modes is depending upon the ultimate penetration resistance p u z and expressed as 7 p z ξ 1 ξ p u z 8 p u z a z d b s u z d where ξ z d k max is a non dimensional penetration factor d is the pipe diameter z is the pipeline penetration k max is the normalized maximum stiffness the soil undrained shear strength refers to s u z s u 0 s ug z in which s u0 is the mudline shear strength and s ug is the shear strength gradient a and b are the non dimensional penetration coefficients 2 3 3 hydrodynamic forces the pipeline during deepwater installation is subjected to the hydrodynamic loads which are induced by surface waves and ocean currents the fluid velocity for each wave component is predicted in the basis of the airy wave theory the ocean current is generally looked on as a two dimensional steady flow in the vertical profile variable in magnitude and consistence in direction with water depth the hydrodynamic forces can be calculated in light of the morison s equation morison et al 1950 which is expressed as 9 f d 1 2 c d ρ a v r v r where c d is the drag coefficient for the pipe ρ is the density of water a is the drag area v r is the fluid velocity relative to the pipe 3 solution procedure in view of the vfife analysis of s lay and j lay pipeline the central difference method is ulitized to solve the movement governing eq 1 and the absolute displacement and rotation angle of the pipeline particles are calculated by 10 x j i 1 2 c 1 x j i c 2 x j i 1 c 1 δ t 2 m 1 f ext f int θ j i 1 2 c 1 θ j i c 2 θ j i 1 c 1 δ t 2 i 1 m ext m int where c 1 1 1 ζ δ t 2 and c 2 c 1 1 ζ δ t 2 are the damping coefficients ζ is the damping factor δt is the time step at the initial time the external and internal forces and moments are calculated in light of the default parameters and the displacement x j 1 and rotation angle θ j 1 of the pipe particle at the time t 1 can be obtained by 11 x j 1 x j 0 δ t 1 1 2 δ t ζ x j 0 δ t 2 f ext f int 2 m j θ j 1 θ j 0 δ t 1 1 2 δ t ζ θ j 0 δ t 2 m ext m int 2 i j where x j 0 and θ j 0 are the displacement and rotation angle of the pipe particle j at the time t 0 x j 0 and θ j 0 are the displacement velocity and rotation velocity of the pipe particle j at the time t 0 the numerical calculation of the s lay and j lay pipeline is performed by the coding program the calculation procedure is illustrated in fig 5 and summarized as follows ① input the initial parameters for the laying pipeline stinger rollers for the s lay and seabed soil set the calculated time step δt and the total time et and conduct the initial calculation based on eq 11 ② compute the displacement and rotation of pipe particles by eq 10 ③ calculate the internal forces f j int and m j int from the element deformations and node rotation angles using eq 2 4 ④ calculate the external forces f j ext and m j ext including the contact force with stinger rollers for the s lay operation by eq 5 6 the seabed resistance by pipe soil interaction from eq 7 8 and the hydrodynamic forces induced by surface waves and ocean currents from eq 9 ⑤ solve the motion governing eq 1 with all the internal and external forces using the central difference method ⑥ go to the next step and conduct the calculation by the next time increment until reaching the total time 4 results and discussion 4 1 forming process of s lay and j lay pipeline in order to evaluate the effectiveness and applicability of the vfife method two numerical models of the s lay and j lay pipeline were established to analyze the pipeline static and dynamic behaviors in deepwater installation the basic parameters for the laying pipeline were selected from a practical engineering case in the liwan3 1 lw3 1 gas field in the south china sea the steel pipe diameter is 323 9 mm with a wall thickness of 23 8 mm elastic modulus of 2 07 105 mpa and poisson s ratio of 0 3 for modeling the seabed soil the undrained shear strength of the soil is assumed to have zero strength intercept at the mudline with a shear strength gradient of 1 5 kpa m the soil coefficients a and b are taken as 6 0 and 0 25 respectively and the non dimensional penetration factor kmax is set as 200 besides a stinger with a total length of 100 m and a curvature radius of 98 m is set up for the s lay operation the laying water depth is 1000 m fig 6 illustrates the forming process of the pipeline configuration for the s lay and j lay installation the pipeline is located at the sea level at the initial time t 0 s and then continuously descends onto the seabed with the damping factor of 1 0 finally the pipeline is anchored at a horizontal position of x 2000 m and gradually shapes into a catenary configuration with the damping factor of 10 0 in view of the s lay process the pipeline in the overbend is supported by stinger rollers and forms an arc shape a small time step of 5 10 5 s is needed for the calculation due to the pipe stinger roller interaction and the total calculated time of 300 s is used to attain a stable s shaped state for the j lay process a time step of 1 10 4 s is suitable but the total calculated time of 500 s is required for the pipeline to achieve the final j shaped state the time history of pipe tension at the top node is shown in fig 7 for the s lay the top tension of the pipeline increases from 0 kn to 1306 11 kn then has a slight decrease to 1280 75 kn and finally reached to the maximum value of 1821 72 kn similarly the top tension of the j lay pipeline firstly has a great increase from 0 kn to 1399 60 kn then reduced to 1028 20 kn and at last slightly increased to a stable value of 1060 01 kn the tension time history of the top node reflects the whole laying process of the pipeline from the sea level to the sea floor the time history of the top tension for the s lay is different from the j lay after the time of 100 s for which the deflection of the s lay pipeline varies more slowly than that of the j lay pipeline due to the support of stinger rollers in the overbend 4 2 comparison and verification 4 2 1 static response the static behaviors of the s lay and j lay pipeline in terms of configuration axial tension bending moment and stress are compared with the corresponding results calculated by the orcaflex orcina 2017 as presented in fig 8 the close agreements of both methods are observed for the s lay and j lay pipeline respectively the distribution curves of the configuration and axial tension are matched along the entire pipeline for the two numerical methods the deflection of the j lay pipeline is steeper than that of the s lay pipeline and thus the axial tension of the j lay pipeline is smaller in contrast with the one of the s lay pipeline moreover the variation trends of the bending moment and stress of the pipeline from the vfife method are close to the results from orcaflex the maximum bending moment and stress of the pipeline occurred in the overbend for the s lay installation as a result of the stinger roller support and in the touchdown zone for the j lay installation induced by the seabed soil resistance to further explore the difference of pipeline responses between the s lay and the j lay the maximum static response results for both laying techniques are illustrated in fig 9 the axial tension of the s lay pipeline at the top end is 1821 72 kn while the axial tension of the j lay pipeline at the top end is only 1061 01 kn and the difference between two laying methods is 41 76 the maximum axial tensions of the laying pipeline at the tdz are 921 25 kn and 164 06 kn for both laying techniques and the difference attains 82 19 the maximum bending moment and stress of the s lay pipeline are 626 96 kn m and 480 24 mpa in the overbend and just 54 23 kn m and 75 68 mpa in the sagbend the maximum bending moment and stress of the j lay pipeline are 261 34 kn m and 174 03 mpa in the sagbend the differences reach 381 91 and 129 96 in contrast with these results of the s lay pipeline in the same zone 4 2 2 dynamic response in the dynamic analysis a regular ocean condition is used for convenient comparison the surface wave time history is shown in fig 10 with the wave height of 1 0 m according to the practical measurement in the lw3 1 gas field the vertical distribution of current velocity among various water depths is displayed in fig 11 with the surface velocity of 1 0 m s and the current direction is set as 0 deg along with the pipelay direction the effects of surface waves and ocean currents on the laying pipeline are mainly in two aspects one is the wave induced pipelay vessel motions which offer a great excitation on the top end of the pipeline and another is the hydrodynamic loads which are acted on the pipeline the wave frequency motion of the pipelay vessel is calculated by use of the displacement response amplitude operator rao which defines the vessel motions responses for each degree of freedom dof to one prescribed wave direction and period the heave motion of the vessel is demonstrated to be the dominant motion response among the six dofs motions of the pipelay vessel xu and gong 2020b and thus it is considered in this study for the dynamic analysis given by v t r h a cos 2 π t t φ where r h is the heave displacement rao of the vessel a is the wave amplitude t is the wave period and ϕ is the phase lag in the dynamic analyses of s lay and j lay pipelines the basic parameters of r h 1 5 t 8 0 s and ϕ π 2 are assumed the heave motion time history responses of the s lay and j lay vessel are illustrated in fig 12 which match consistently between the vfife method and orcaflex besides the axial and normal drag coefficients of 0 024 and 1 2 are separately assumed to calculate the hydrodynamic forces the numerical damping in the vfife method is crucial for the dynamic response analysis of the laying pipeline in deep waters and it should be reasonably selected fig 13 shows the effect of the damping factor on the maximum and minimum tension response of the s lay and j lay pipeline at the top end with the increase of damping factor from 1 0 to 2 5 the maximum tension of the s lay pipeline linearly increases from 1974 41 kn to 2132 30 kn whilst the minimum tension of the pipeline gradually decreases from 1676 06 kn to 1524 01 kn the tension time history agrees well with the time domain response results obtained by the orcaflex when the damping factor is 1 5 as shown in fig 14 a similarly for the j lay operation as the damping factor augments from 1 0 to 1 75 the maximum tension of the pipeline enlarge from 1145 86 kn to 1189 99 kn and the minimum tension of the pipeline reduces from 980 39 kn to 936 29 kn the tension time history matches well with the corresponding results calculated by the orcaflex when the damping factor is 1 25 as displayed in fig 14 b therefore the structural damping factors of 1 5 and 1 25 are separately employed for the s lay and j lay pipeline to obtain the accurate dynamic response behaviors fig 15 and fig 16 illustrate the maximum dynamic response results of each pipe particle along the s lay and j lay pipeline which are calculated by the vfife method and the orcaflex respectively the axial tensions of the overall pipeline coincide well for the s lay and j lay operations moreover the curves of bending moments for both laying operations independently match together along the entire pipeline particularly in the overbend region for the s lay the variable trend of bending moment due to the roller supports is highly coincident and the actual minor difference becomes insignificant the close agreements of the response results further verify the reasonable accuracy of the vfife method for the dynamic analysis of deepwater pipeline installation 4 3 effect of wave height for the sake of having a distinct intuition to the effect of wave height on the dynamic responses of s lay and j lay pipelines six groups of wave heights 0 0 5 1 0 1 5 2 0 and 2 5 m are selected in the numerical analyses the axial tension and bending moment of the s lay and j lay pipelines are separately shown in fig 17 and fig 18 and their maximum responses varying with wave heights are displayed in fig 19 as the wave height increases from 0 0 m to 2 5 m the axial tensions of the overall pipeline have a significant increase for the two laying operations the maximum tension at the top end augments 27 95 from 1821 72 kn to 2330 84 kn for the s lay and 22 91 from 1061 01 kn to 1304 12 kn for the j lay whereas the bending moments of the pipeline for the two laying operations slightly increase the increment of maximum bending moment is just 3 84 from 626 96 kn m to 651 06 kn m for the s lay and 11 52 from 261 34 kn m to 291 45 kn m for the j lay as can be seen from fig 19 the axial tension and bending moment of both the s lay and j lay pipelines linearly increase with the increase of wave height the maximum responses of the pipeline for the s lay operation are evidently larger than those for the j lay operation 4 4 effect of sloping seabed the seabed in deep waters is generally uneven with a certain slope and the sloping seabed is a considerable factor for the route survey of offshore pipeline installation in order to investigate the influence of sloping seabed on the dynamic behaviors of the s lay and j lay pipelines two seabed cases are used in the numerical models for the comparison one case is that the pipeline is laid on the horizontal seabed and the other case is that the pipeline is laid on the sloping seabed with a gradient of 4 the wave height is taken as 1 0 m and other parameters are identical with the above mentioned ones the pipeline configuration axial tension and bending moment of the s laying and j laying pipeline onto the horizontal seabed and sloping seabed are illustrated in fig 20 to fig 22 respectively see fig 21 it can be seen from the configuration distribution curves that the laying pipeline onto the sloping seabed is steeper than that onto the horizontal seabed particularly in the tdz for the j lay operation in the case of considering sloping seabed the axial tension of the entire pipeline has a great augment for both s lay and j lay operation and the maximum tensions at the top end attain 2161 74 kn and 1360 86 kn respectively while the pipeline was laid onto the horizontal seabed the maximum tensions are only 2026 86 kn and 1112 26 kn and the differences for both cases reach 6 65 and 22 35 respectively the bending moments of the s lay pipeline for the two seabed cases are almost identical as a whole except at the location of contacting with the last roller the pipeline bending moment reduces 24 43 from 559 62 kn m to 422 93 kn m besides the bending moment distribution of the j lay pipeline for both seabed cases differs and the maximum bending moment decreases 31 93 from 263 81 kn m to 179 58 kn m when considering the effect of sloping seabed these results adequately demonstrated that the sloping seabed affects the configuration axial tension and bending moment of the laying pipeline especially in the tdz 5 conclusion the paper presents an effective and feasible model for the simulation of deepwater s lay and j lay pipeline through the vfife technique this model discretizes the laying pipeline into a series of mass particles connected by massless beam elements the movement governing equations of the pipeline particles are built based on the second newton s law in which the particle displacement and position vector are represented by tracing the nodal movements in a path unit furthermore the internal forces and the external forces of the laying pipeline are investigated in detail the explicit central difference approach is employed to solve the governing equations by using matlab program coding the static and dynamic behaviors of an s lay and j lay pipeline are obtained in terms of the laying configuration axial tension bending moment and stress the significant contribution of this study is to observe the remarkable differences of the pipeline behaviors between the s lay and j lay operation some crucial conclusions are summarized as follows 1 the vfife model of laying pipeline based upon the vector mechanics and the finite element technique can dynamically simulate the forming process of the s lay and j lay pipeline in the numerical calculation a smaller time step is required for the s lay installation than that for the j lay installation due to the contact of the pipeline and stinger rollers the deflection of the s lay pipeline varies more slowly in contrast with one of the j lay pipeline the top tension of the laying pipeline firstly increases then slightly decreases and finally reaches a stable value as the pipeline is gradually laid onto the seabed 2 the static and dynamic behaviors of the s lay and j lay pipeline are reasonably modeled by the numerical model composing of mass particles and massless elements the calculated results are compared with the ones obtained by the orcaflex in terms of pipe lay configuration axial tension bending moment and stress the close agreements are observed to verify the accuracy and applicability of the vfife model for the analysis of pipeline installation the maximum tension bending moment and stress of the s lay pipeline are obviously larger than those of the j lay pipeline 3 the numerical damping in the vfife model is a considerable influencing factor of the pipeline dynamic behaviors the increase of the damping factor raises the maximum tensions of the s lay and j lay pipeline and reduces the minimum tensions of both laying pipelines additionally the variation of the pipeline tension amplitude for the s lay operation is more sensible in contrast with that for the j lay operation the rational selection of damping factor is crucial for the dynamic response analysis of deepwater laying pipelines 4 the wave height has an evident influence on the dynamic behaviors of the s lay and j lay pipeline the augment of wave height enhances the axial tension and bending moment of the two laying pipelines the effect of wave height on the pipeline responses for the s lay operation is more obvious in axial tension but relatively smaller in bending moment compared to corresponding results for the j lay operation the influencing levels of wave height on dynamic behaviors of the pipeline are distinctly different between the s lay and j lay methods which should be reasonably considered in the deepwater pipeline design 5 the pipeline being laid onto the sloping seabed is significantly different in contrast with the one onto the horizontal seabed particularly in the touchdown zone the deflections of the pipelines are steeper the axial tensions of the pipelines are larger but the bending moments of the pipelines are smaller for both s lay and j lay operations additionally it is recommended that the detailed influences of various types of sloping seabeds on the pipeline behaviors during the laying process be further investigated in future researches credit authorship contribution statement pu xu

20597,this paper develops and proposes an inverse tracing method itm in the time domain to tackle the problem of the radiating noise caused by unsteady propeller sheet cavitation in which the relationship between the time of the noise source and the time of the propagated sound can be inversely traced by the piecewise cubic spline functions by applying the inversely traced relationship into the solution of the wave equation the dirac delta function is assumed to simplify to δ 0 so the time integral is assumed to vanish in addition the unlimited differential terms also can be replaced by differentiating the piecewise cubic spline functions in order to validate the corrections of the itm the far field noise calculated by the itm is compared with that predicted by the far field method proposed by nobel et al 1986 and good agreement is shown the near field noise obtained by the itm is checked by the experimental results of a container ship and the itm overestimates the experimental data by about 2 db a workboat is also taken as a computing sample to predict the radiating noise caused by unsteady propeller sheet cavitation because the cavity volumes are over predicted the predicted noises by the itm are obviously stronger than the measured noises as the numerical cavity volumes are modified to meet the measured volumes by adjusting the cavitation number the predicted sound pressure level spl at the first blade passing frequency i e the maximum spl by the itm is smaller than the measured value by 4 db at higher blade passing frequencies the measured spls are remarkably stronger than the predicted levels due to the appearance of tip vortex cavitation in the model test keywords inverse tracing method itm propeller sheet cavitation cubic spline blade passing frequency 1 introduction a propeller operating in a non uniform wake field in the ocean is one of the prime sources of the underwater acoustic noises of a ship radiating noises from a ship s propellers are used to serve some specific purpose such as remote sensing and military defense and this has attracted attention in research according to baiter 1992 the narrow band noise as produced by propeller sheet cavitation almost dominates the low frequency range therefore this study aims to develop an inverse tracing method itm in the time domain to compute the radiating noises caused by the unsteady sheet cavitation of an operating propeller in addition in order to verify the itm proposed in this paper a comparison between the numerical and experimental results is carried out huse and guoqiang 1982 developed a semi empirical prediction method to predict the exciting force caused by propeller cavitation they estimated the cavitation volume on the propeller blade surface by using experimental data salvatore and ianniello 2003 published a hydrodynamic model for transient sheet cavitation on propellers in non uniform inviscid flow and created a hydroacoustic model for propeller noise based on the ffowcs williams and hawkings fwh equation they demonstrated that the noise predictions of the fwh equation were in agreement with those obtained by the bernoulli equation model kehr and kao 2004 derived the incident blade rate pressure as induced by unsteady sheet cavitation monopole in the time domain for both the near and far fields their derived equations included some simplified assumptions regarding the differential term of the retarded time for the imposed itm the differential term of the retarded time is replaced by the cubic spline function and the simplified assumptions applied by kehr and kao 2004 are unnecessary brouwer 2005 applied a stationary set of rings of the monopole and dipole sources in the frequency domain to solve propeller induced noise and vibrations seol and moon 2009 derived the governing equation of pressure fluctuations induced by sheet cavitation according to the ffowcs williams approach kellett et al 2013 used the permeable source surface to significantly improve the predicted results they suggested neglecting free surface modelling if the user is interested in results of above 200hz the accuracy and corresponding frequency range that are suitable for kellett et al 2013 are not discussed lee et al 2014 proposed the analytic source model i e multi parameter inversion scheme to determine the position of the noise sources due to propeller sheet cavitation and defined the corresponding source strengths the results show a good agreement with the cavitation dynamics of a propeller li et al 2015 and li et al 2018 predicted the underwater radiating noise generated by the cavitating propeller of a coastal tanker a cfd method which consists of a multi phase delayed detached eddy simulation ddes and an fwh acoustic analogy was applied to predict the radiating noise for the model and the full scale propeller where the tonal noise kept a fairly good agreement with the measured signal at both scales up to the 6th bpf blade passing frequency for the model scale propeller the fundamental blade frequency was 93 hz and the maximum error was about 8 db as the frequency was higher than 64 hz the 8th bpf for the full scale propeller the predicted tones were lower than the sea trial data due to the insufficient resolution of tip vortex cavitation tvc in the cfd simulation it was expected that tvc would be an important contribution in the frequency range of 50 112 hz the maximum under prediction in this range is about 28 db at 72 hz at frequencies above 200 hz the broadband noise becomes more under predicted with the increasing frequency artur et al 2016 used large eddy simulation and an fwh acoustic analogy to estimate the cavitation induced noise the sauer and schnerr mass transfer model was also applied to predict the cavitation extensions a blade pass tonal noise was predicted and showed the expected behavior the dominant frequency in the signals also coincided closely with that observed for the cavity volume fluctuations namely 22hz testa et al 2018 predicted the tonal noise caused by unsteady propeller sheet cavitation where the numerical scheme was based on the standard fwh equation there was good agreement between two hydrodynamic models tvm and ebm ebm is the equivalent blade modelling in which an equivalent source body defined by the blade plus cavities is included the maximum difference between the spectral components of these models never exceeded 0 6 db throughout the discrete frequency spectrum and ranged from 1bpf 122 hz to 10bpf the growth of a bubble attached on the blade surface was detected by transpiration terms hence the integrals were easier than the boundary element method as proposed in salvatore and ianniello 2003 the existence of fluctuating cavities was modeled only through the transpiration velocity lloyd et al 2015 bensow and liefvendahl 2016 lidtke et al 2016 and ianiello 2016 also applied the fwh equation to calculate the propeller radiated noise and suggested that it is only suitable for the far field besides this the fwh equation cannot take the effect of marine environmental conditions such as a free surface into consideration as indicated in nobuaki and hikaru 2018 who developed semi empirical methods to estimate the propeller cavitation noise in the near field their numerical results were able to capture tonal noises of up to the 3rd bpf and the maximum difference between the numerical and experimental results was about 10 db the noise at a frequency 1 khz obtained by nobuaki and hikaru 2018 was underestimated by 11 db relative to the experiment the resolution of the broadband noise was limited at 1 khz in the full scale due to a temporal resolution for the cfd simulation in this paper the itm in the time domain is developed to predict the radiating noise caused by unsteady propeller sheet cavitation moreover the numerical scheme is combined with the cubic spline function to replace the unlimited differential term caused by the retarded time the proposed itm can take the free surface into consideration the validation tests for the itm are carried out in addition the numerical results predicted by itm are also compared with the experimental data of a workboat it is verified that the proposed itm is suitable for both the far and near fields 2 inverse tracing method itm i theoretical formulations the flow field is assumed to be compressible and inviscid the unsteady propeller sheet cavitation is considered to be the only noise source in the linear wave equation its induced acoustic pressure can be represented by 1 2 ϕ c a v 1 c 0 2 2 ϕ c a v t 2 q and 2 p c a v ρ 0 ϕ c a v r t t where ϕ c a v is the velocity potential due to unsteady propeller sheet cavitation c 0 is the mean sound speed q is the cavity volume source strength per unit volume p c a v is the acoustic pressure due to unsteady propeller sheet cavitation ρ 0 is the mean fluid density r is the position vector of the field point and t is the time of the field point equation 2 was derived by using the linearized continuity equation and the linear inviscid force equation in kinsler et al 1982 equation 2 is usually used to represent the acoustic pressure the solution to equation 1 morse and ingard 1968 can be expressed as integrals over the noise source volume v s and the noise source time t s 3 ϕ c a v r t 1 4 π t s v s q r s t s r δ t s t r c 0 d v s d t s where r is the distance from the noise source to the field point δ is the dirac delta function and r c 0 is the propagation delay i e the delay between the noise source and the field point the coordinate system is illustrated in fig 1 which shows that the rotating noise source with angular velocity ω is located at the position vector r s x s r s θ s at t s and the field point is located at the position vector r x r θ the distance from the noise source to the field point r can be expressed as 4 r t s x x s t s 2 y y s t s 2 z z s t s 2 the total source strength corresponding to the sheet cavity volume of the propeller at time t s i e the total volume change of the sheet cavitation over the time can be computed by summing up the components of the discrete cavity source strength on the propeller camber surface 5 q r s t s dv s m 1 b i 1 i j 1 j q c a v m i j t s where b is the number of propeller blades i is the number of divided elements in the chordwise direction and j is the number of divided elements in a span wise direction the total number of elements on the propeller camber surface is i j as shown in fig 1 regarding wave propagation there is a propagation delay r t s c 0 from the noise source to the field point the relation between the observer time t and the retarded time t s is 6 t s t r t s c 0 ii tracing the relation between time t and time t s the field time t corresponding to the point source time t s can be traced inversely by equation 6 for example it is assumed that the point source rotating with 10 rps is initially located at x s 0 m y s 1 m z s 0 m and that the field point is at x 5 m y 5 m z 5 m the number of time steps in one period is 60 for the rotating point source the distance between the field point and point source at each time step i e r t s in one period can be computed by equation 4 as illustrated in fig 2 fig 3 a is derived from fig 2 in fig 2 one period is divided into sixty time steps i e there are sixty points in fig 2 and the distance r t s corresponding to each retarded time t s can be obtained after obtaining the distance r t s corresponding to each retarded time t s the field time t at different retarded times t s can be traced by substituting the distance r t s and the retarded time t s at every time step into equation 6 therefore the relation between the field time t and the retarded time t s at each time step can be plotted as shown in fig 3 a in fig 2 the variation of the distance r t s at different retarded times t s is not obvious and the value of r t s c 0 is very small so the retarded time t s seems to depend linearly on the field time t in fig 3 a the linear fit quadratic fir and piecewise cubic spline fits are applied in presenting the actual t s t distribution as shown in fig 3 a as different fits are applied to present the relation shown in fig 3 a the values of t s t at different field times t are illustrated in fig 3 b the linear fit results in a constant t s t the quadratic fit results in the linear distribution of t s t the distribution of t s t is quadratic as the piecewise cubic spline fits are applied although fig 3 a seems to have a linear distribution slight jitters still exist the residuals caused by the linear fit the quadratic fit and the piecewise cubic spline fits are 1 73 0 65 and 0 31 respectively residuals are related to the actual t s t distribution in fig 3 a as the t t s relation is fitted by the piecewise cubic splines the distribution of t s t shown in fig 3 b is obtained by differentiating the piecewise cubic spline functions table 1 shows the residuals related to the actual t s t distribution by different fits at various receiver positions in table 1 the residual caused by the piecewise cubic spline fits is the smallest as compared with those due to the linear and quadratic fits at various receiver positions thus the quadratic distribution of t s t as shown in fig 3 b should be more reasonable in order to improve the accuracy and avoid large residuals a higher order fit cubic spline fit is used in this paper the distribution shown in fig 3 a can be described well by a cubic spline 7 t s a l t 3 b l t 2 c l t d l f t a cubic spline is a spline constructed of piecewise third order polynomials where subscript l denotes the l th piecewise third order polynomial as there are n time steps in one period the cubic spline includes n third order polynomials and time t is included in the l th interval 8 2 π ω n l 1 t 2 π ω n l where 2 π ω is the time period n is the total number of time steps included in one period and a l b l c l and d l are the coefficients of the l th piecewise third order polynomial every third order polynomial passes the endpoints moreover the second derivative of each polynomial is set to zero at the endpoints for smoothing the junctions between two time steps thus the equation of the third order polynomial can be solved hazewinkel 2001 the cubic spline is widely applied in numerical simulations and the formulations of the coefficients for each piecewise third order polynomial i e a l b l c l and d l can be referred to in hazewinkel michiel 2001 take fig 4 for example as the number of time steps is 60 in one period i e every 6o counts as a time step and there are 60 piecewise third order polynomials to describe the t s t curve in one period before computing the sound pressure at a certain field time t the l nt third order polynomial in which the certain field time t is located is determined first in the l nt third order polynomials the coefficients i e a l b l c l and d l are constants iv the radiating noise equation 6 shows that the retarded time t s is function of the observer time t and itself t s in fact the proposed itm redefines the relation between the retarded time t s and the observer time t by equation 7 i e t s f t thus the distance between the point source and the observer r t s can be presented as r f t by applying equations 6 and 7 in equation 3 the dirac delta function in equation 9 is assumed to simplify to δ 0 so one can assume the time integral to vanish i e t s δ 0 d t s 1 then substituting equation 5 into equation 3 an approximate solution of the perturbation potential induced by the unsteady propeller sheet cavity volume at any field location and time t can be obtained as follows 9 ϕ c a v r t 1 4 π t s v s q r s t s r δ 0 d v s d t s 1 4 π v s t s q r s f t r f t δ 0 d t s d v s 1 4 π v s q r s f t r f t t s δ 0 d t s d v s 1 4 π v s q r s f t r f t d v s

unsteady propeller sheet cavitation is contributed to from two parts the first part is due to the temporal variation of the sheet cavity volume i e source strength and can be expressed as follows 11 p

not applied equation 7 is proposed to deal with the term t s t in order to avoid unlimited expanded formulations by applying equation 7 in the term t s t the unlimited expanded formulations are naturally avoided as shown in equation 16 the proposed itm is without the simplified assumptions that appeared in kehr and kao 2004 16 t s t 3 a l t 2 2 b l t c l the unlimited differential term t s t is calculated according to l nt third order polynomials and the coefficients i e a l b l c l and d l are independent of the field time t in the l nt third order polynomials by substituting equation 16

reflecting effect reflected waves are generated to the field point when the radiating waves of a propeller are incident on the free surface as illustrated in fig 5 the sounds reflected from the free surface can be considered as being generated from the imaged propeller which is located symmetrically on the opposite side of the free surface i e the lloyd mirror if the free surface is assumed to be rigid and the imaged propeller has a positive source strength with respect to the actual propeller if the free surface is considered to be soft the imaged propeller has a negative source strength with respect to the actual propeller equations 17 19 are used to compute the acoustic pressure caused by the imaged propeller the coordinate system r i x i r i θ i which is relative to the imaged propeller center is adopted instead of r x r θ the coordinates system r i x i r i θ i can be represented as follows 21 x i x r i y i 2 z i 2 2 h r cos θ 2 r sin θ 2 θ i tan 1 z i y i tan 1 r sin θ 2 h r cos θ where h is the propeller shaft immersion 3 experimental setup this study conducted model scale experiments for a workboat in the underwater anechoic chamber of the ntou cavitation tunnel where the model scale results were transformed into full scale results the full scale values were compared with the numerical results to verify the proposed numerical schemes the hull and propeller of a model scale ship were installed in the test section of the ntou cavitation tunnel the test section of the tunnel was 2 6m w x 1 5m h x 10m l the free surface was substituted with aluminum plates to suppress the wave system of the model in the model test the scaled propeller diameter was 0 23 m the corresponding shaft speed was 27 rps and the ship model was equipped with a rudder a propeller and a shaft line the stern arrangement is shown in fig 6 as illustrated in fig 7 a an underwater microphone was mounted in the underwater anechoic chamber to measure the underwater noise the coordinates of the microphone positions are listed in table 2 the microphone type is b k 8103 and the frequency range is 1 ha 170 khz the horizontal and vertical directional responses are 2 db and 3 db at 100 khz respectively for the daq data acquisition the adapters are jp 0162 and an integral cable with non submersible 10 32 unf connector is used the data acquisition daq input card offers eight channels each at a very high speed the input card transforms the high speed series into an extremely fast transient recorder with selectable anti aliasing filtering high bandwidth and low noise input amplifiers with 0 1 error the sample rate is 25 ms s in the experimental procedure the k t thrust coefficient identity rule was followed to ensure that the loading of the ship and model propellers was equal moreover the cavitation number responded to the local value in a horizontal plane through 0 8r r the propeller radius in the 12 o clock blade position as the thrust coefficient and cavitation number of the model are the same as those of the full scale ship the distribution of the stern inflow and the sheet cavitation can be accurately observed it is noted that the propeller inflows for the model and full scale ship are also consistent i e the distribution of the inflow attack ankles for the model and full scale propellers are the same by following the k t identity rule as indicated in fig 7 b the underwater anechoic chamber was below the test section of the cavitation tunnel and full of water as the shells of the test section and the anechoic chamber were specially designed the sound waves of the external environment could not penetrate into the test section or the anechoic chamber moreover although the propeller was installed in a reverberant environment as the window had the same acoustic impedance as that of the water separating the test section and the anechoic chamber the noise that radiated from the propeller passed completely through the window and was then measured in the anechoic chamber kehr 2004 according to hykat hsva 1998 this test equipment and setup were the same as that of the well known hydrodynamics and cavitation tunnel hykat of the hamburgische schiffbau versuchsanstalt gmbh hsva in order to measure only the noise generated by the operating propeller the noises caused by the shaft vibration the motor operation and the turbulence in the flow field were classified as background noise and were measured in advance when measuring the background noise the propeller was removed a dummy hub was installed and the background noise was measured under the same test conditions the measured background noise was then used to correct the measured results of the propeller according to the recommendations of ross 1976 22 s p l r e a l 10 log 10 s p

level of the background noise please refer to fig 19 4 measured and numerical results this paper introduces a new method itm where the unlimited expansion which is due to differential term t s t is replaced by differentiating the cubic spline function the proposed method itm can solve the noise caused by the unsteady propeller sheet cavitation a workboat was taken as the computing sample and numerical prediction and experimental measurements were carried out the results were then compared the main dimensions of this workboat are listed in table 3 i the source strength for the sample workboat the sample workboat in this paper is shown in fig 6 the noise source is the unsteady sheet cavitation generated by the operating propeller the sheet cavitation volumes at different blade angles should be correctly calculated before the resulting acoustic pressures are predicted the associated data of this propeller are listed in table 3 and k t and k q are the respective thrust and

cavitation number σ can be represented as follows 27 σ p a t m ρ g h p v 0 5 ρ 0 π n d 2 where p atm is the atmospheric pressure p v is the vapor pressure and h is the propeller shaft immersion the axial and tangential inflow velocities of the propeller at different blade angles and radial positions are shown in figs 9 and 10 the blade angle is viewed from the stern the starboard side corresponds to 90 and the port side to 270 r is the propeller radius the blade root is at 0 2r and the blade tip is at 1 0r both the axial and tangential velocities are non dimensionalized by the ship velocity v s fig 9 illustrates the nominal flow velocities caused by the ship hull without the operating propeller fig 10 shows the effective flow velocities with a consideration of the ship s hull and the operating propeller both the axial and tangential velocities shown in fig 10 are larger than those plotted in fig 9 due to the suction force generated by the operating propeller as shown in fig 10 the axial inflow of nearly 24 is obviously hindered by the stern as a result the inflow velocity is the lowest moreover as the tangential inflow of the ship is asymmetric the 90 and 270 values are opposite to each other the absolute value of the tangential inflow velocity at the 90 position is the largest because the rotating direction is opposite to the tangential inflow the unsteady sheet cavitation due to the operating propeller is predicted by the unsteady lifting surface theory puf 3a developed by kerwin and lee 1978 in puf 3a the number of chord wise lattice elements on the key blade must be specified as either 10 or 20 while the maximum number of input radii for specifying the propeller geometry is 15 in other words the maximum number of meshes to describe the propeller camber surface is 15 20 according to kao 2018 12 20 meshes are sufficient for correctly predicting the source strength by puf 3a lee 1979 reported the results obtained by the unsteady lifting surface theory with all three mesh arrangements 18 10 9 10 and 9 20 it is evident that extremely satisfactory convergence has been achieved in this paper 15 20 meshes i e the maximum number are distributed on each propeller surface fig 11 plots the cavitation extensions of a single blade at different blade angles as calculated by puf 3a and measured in the ntou cavitation tunnel respectively a comparison with fig 11 suggests that the sheet cavitation extension predicted by puf 3a is larger than the measurements by ntou due to the inaccurate prediction of the effective velocity distribution the effective velocities as shown in fig 10 only consider the uniform suction effect over the propeller disk in fact there was a stronger suction effect in the area near the twelve o clock position of the propeller disk thus the axial effective inflow velocity near the twelve o clock position as illustrated in fig 10 is relatively lower than the values of the actual condition and it generates more series cavitation this inaccuracy can only be improved further by using an unsteady rans solver which considers the actual propeller suction effect that occurs in the ship s wake according to fig 11 the sheet cavitation extensions are generated mainly between 15 and 15 and especially at zero degrees in addition while the measured results show that both the sheet and tip vortex cavitation appear the theory of puf 3a cannot predict the tip vortex cavitation according to english 1979 and artur et al 2016 in addition to the broadband characteristics the unsteady tip vortex cavitation also contributes to noise amplitudes at multiples of the blade rate frequencies the total cavity volume vcav of the first propeller blade at different blade angles is illustrated in fig 12 the total source strengths of the first propeller blade at different blade angles i e the value of i 1 20 j 1 15 q c a v 1 i j for the first propeller blade at different time ts are shown in fig 13 the source strength is a variation of sheet cavity volume in time the curve shown in fig 12 is differentiated to get the data illustrated in fig 13 ii validation test for the itm a for the far field the proposed method in this study itm is compared with the far field method proposed by noble et al 1986 the source strengths at σ 1 789 as illustrated in fig 13 were used to predict the radiating noise by using equation 17 the computing conditions are listed in table 3 and the field point is located at x r θ as shown in table 2 fig 14 indicates the predicted radiating noises of these two methods at the bpfs without considering the free surface the generated noises are expressed as spls in db by a reference pressure of 1μ pa the time domain signals obtained through equation 17 are transformed to the frequency domain amplitudes by using discrete fourier transform fig 14 shows that these two methods are in good agreement with a maximum difference of less than 0 5 db when the field point is very close to the propeller i e x 1 m r 0 m θ 180 deg the predicted results of these two methods differ greatly as shown in fig 15 the present method itm distributes the point sources on the entire blade and does not simplify the distance between the point source and the field point which makes it suitable for the near and far fields the method proposed by noble et al 1986 uses a point source to replace the entire blade and there are some simplifications of the distance between the point source and the field point the spls predicted by the present method are smaller than those by the far field method due to the destructive interference between the different point sources on the entire blade b for the near field the proposed itm is suitable for both the far and near fields besides this the proposed itm can take the free surface into the consideration the predicted results of the itm in the far field are in a good agreement with those of the far field method proposed by noble et al 1986 in order to verify that the itm is also suitable for the near field with a satisfactory accuracy the container ship shown in kao 2018 was modeled to compute the near field noise due to its unsteady sheet cavitation the associated data of the container ship and the propeller are listed in table 4 the source strength used to predict the radiating noise in equation 17 can be found in kao 2018 fig 16 presents the sheet cavitation extensions at different angular positions the measured sheet cavitation extensions are similar to those calculated by puf 3a the measured results hykat hsva 1998 indicate that the sheet and tip vortex cavitations both appear between 30 and 50 respectively the theory of puf 3a cannot predict the tip vortex cavitation thus it cannot be found in the numerical results the field point is located above the propeller center and very close to the propeller as shown in fig 17 the distance between the field point and the blade tip is 0 84r and r is the propeller radius kehr and kao 2004 show that as the distance between the propeller center and the field point is smaller than 5r r the propeller radius the field is near field a comparison between the numerical and experimental results is illustrated in fig 18 the maximum spl appears in the first blade frequency the spl at the first bpf i e the dominant spl that is estimated by the present method itm is larger than the measured spl by 2 db at higher blade passing frequencies the measured spls are remarkably stronger than the predicted levels due to the appearance of tip vortex cavitation in the experiment iii the measured noise for a sample workboat in the case of the workboat the rotating speed of the model propeller in the model test was 27 rps the field point is located at xm ym zm as indicated in table 2 fig 19 shows the measured spectra of the mounted microphone in fig 19 splt includes the propeller operation and the background noises the sound pressure levels of the background noise splb are typically 10 db lower than splt both the splt and splb spectra feature narrow band tones and broad band content according to ross 1976 the sound pressure levels that are caused purely by the unsteady sheet cavitation of the operating propeller splreal can be calculated by equation 22 due to the relatively small values of splb the distribution of the splreal is almost the same as that of the splt and the greatest splreal appears in the first bpf the scaling laws as introduced in ittc 2017 are used to transform the measured splreal in the cavitation tunnel into full scale values according to ittc 2017 the increased spl for the full scale is as follows 28 δ s p l 20 log d s d m 1 r m r s 1 σ s σ m 1 n s d s n m d m 2 ρ 0 s ρ 0 m 1 db where subscript s indicates the full scale and subscript m refers to the model scale d is the propeller diameter r is the distance from the noise source to the field point σ is the cavitation number n is the rotating speed and ρ 0 is the fluid density in this paper the full scale position of the field point is directly scaled by the ratio d s d m thus the first two terms can be reformulated as follows 29 d s d m 1 r m r s 1 d s d m 1 r m r m d s d m 1 1 moreover the cavitation number of the experiment is identical to the full scale conditions i e σ s σ m hence equation 29 can be summarized in equation 30 30 δ s p l 20 log n s d s n m d m 2 ρ s ρ m 1 db the model and transformed i e full scale values for the splreal at different bpfs are listed in table 5 the greatest full scale splreal appears at the 1st bpf and is 143 2 db iv the predicted noise caused by the overestimated cavity volume for the sample workboat in this section the overestimated source strength σ 1 789 is applied to predict the radiating noise as shown in fig 11 the computing conditions are listed in table 3 a rigid free surface i e positive image is considered the field point is located at x r θ as indicated in table 2 table 5 shows the spls at different bpfs for the field point located at x r θ and the maximum spl 147 6 db appears at the first bpf 14 2 hz although the measured unsteady tip vortex cavitation amplifies the spls at the bpfs as illustrated in fig 11 the predicted spls are still remarkably larger than the measured values the overestimation of the spl may be caused by the over predicted cavity volume as well as the numerical assumptions and simplifications in the next section the cavity volume is modified to meet the measured size for exploring the effect of the cavity volume on the spls v the predicted noise caused by the modified cavity volume for the sample workboat as the cavitation number increases the cavity volume predicted by puf 3a is decreased the computing conditions are listed in table 3 however the cavitation number σ is adjusted from 1 789 to 2 55 to decrease the cavity volume in order to meet the measured volume extension as shown in fig 20 the predicted cavity volumes with σ 2 55 by puf 3a are shown in fig 20 fig 20 indicates that the distribution of the cavity volumes with a modified cavitation number σ 2 55 is similar to the measured volume the total cavity volume and total source strengths of the first propeller blade with the modified cavitation number σ 2 55 at different blade angles are plotted in figs 12 and 13 respectively the comparisons shown in figs 12 and 13 indicate that the total cavity volumes and total source strength of the first propeller blade at different blade angles are both reduced due to the higher cavitation number σ 2 55 in order to correctly verify the itm the modified source strengths σ 2 55 as shown in fig 13 are used to predict the propeller radiating noise for the field point located at x r θ as indicated in table 2 in other words the numerical and measured cavity volumes are similar and comparisons between the predicted and measured spls are carried out the predicted spls are illustrated in fig 21 and table 5 according to kim et al 2014 and baiter 1992 the cavitation of marine propellers is the most crucial source of underwater radiating noise the spl can be effectively brought down by reducing the cavity volume as the propeller cavitation is greatly reduced the non cavitating noise caused by the linear dipole becomes a practical issue in this paper the cavitation number is modified from 1 789 to 2 55 in order to reduce the cavity volume and to meet the measured size as the cavity volume is reduced the point source strength q c a v m i j t s which is included in equation 17 is correspondingly reduced consequently the predicted spls become lower according to fig 21 the maximum spl appears at the first bpf and the predicted spls are smaller than the measured values at the first bpf the numerical spl is smaller than the measured values by 4 db at the higher bpfs i e the 3rd 8th bpfs the measured spls are also stronger than the predicted values especially at the 5th bpf the spl is remarkably amplified by the tip vortex cavitation and the difference between the predicted and measured values is 9 5 db the differences may be caused by a lack of consideration of the tip vortex cavitation and hull scattering effects the present method itm calculates the radiating noise caused by unsteady propeller sheet cavitation without considering the tip vortex cavitation and scattering wave from the ship hull according to kehr and kao 2011 the waves scattered from the ship hull will amplify the spl at bpfs by 3 6 db english 1979 showed that the tip vortex cavitation can amplify the spls at bpfs akihisa konno 2002 indicated that the noises caused by tip vortex cavitation are of broad band and appear at high frequencies in akihisa konno 2002 the tip vortex cavitation contributes remarkably to the noise amplitudes at higher bpfs in this section the predicted spls are smaller than those that are measured therefore the predictions in this section are more reasonable than those in section iv according to the indications in english 1979 akihisa konno 2002 and kehr and kao 2011 table 6 compares the accuracy of the proposed itm to those of the other methods cited in the introduction 5 conclusions this paper proposed the inverse tracing method itm in the time domain to calculate the radiating noise caused by unsteady propeller sheet cavitation the itm was validated both in the far and near fields using a workboat as the computing sample this study compared the predicted results with the measured values the conclusions are as follows 1 in the scheme of the itm the relationship between the source time and the field time is presented by the cubic spline functions therefore the unlimited differential terms in the solution of the wave equation can be expressed by the coefficients of the piecewise third order polynomial by applying the relationship presented by the cubic spline functions into the solution of the wave equation the dirac delta function is assumed to simplify to δ 0 so the time integral is assumed to vanish 2 the proposed itm can be applied in both the near and far fields the predicted results of the itm in the far field are in good agreement with those of the far field method by nobel et al 1986 in the near field the spl at the first bpf i e the dominant spl estimated by the present method itm is larger than the measured spl by 2 db for the container ship sampled in kao 2018 3 the sheet cavity volume at every time step must be correctly calculated in order to accurately predict the radiating noise as the sheet cavity volumes are over predicted the predicted radiating noise by the itm is remarkably stronger than the measured radiating noise 4 for the sample workboat as the sheet cavity volumes are modified to meet the measured sizes the predicted spl at the first bpf i e the maximum spl is smaller than the measured value by 4 db the difference is possibly due to the enhancement caused by waves scattering from the model ship hull as well as the tip

20597,this paper develops and proposes an inverse tracing method itm in the time domain to tackle the problem of the radiating noise caused by unsteady propeller sheet cavitation in which the relationship between the time of the noise source and the time of the propagated sound can be inversely traced by the piecewise cubic spline functions by applying the inversely traced relationship into the solution of the wave equation the dirac delta function is assumed to simplify to δ 0 so the time integral is assumed to vanish in addition the unlimited differential terms also can be replaced by differentiating the piecewise cubic spline functions in order to validate the corrections of the itm the far field noise calculated by the itm is compared with that predicted by the far field method proposed by nobel et al 1986 and good agreement is shown the near field noise obtained by the itm is checked by the experimental results of a container ship and the itm overestimates the experimental data by about 2 db a workboat is also taken as a computing sample to predict the radiating noise caused by unsteady propeller sheet cavitation because the cavity volumes are over predicted the predicted noises by the itm are obviously stronger than the measured noises as the numerical cavity volumes are modified to meet the measured volumes by adjusting the cavitation number the predicted sound pressure level spl at the first blade passing frequency i e the maximum spl by the itm is smaller than the measured value by 4 db at higher blade passing frequencies the measured spls are remarkably stronger than the predicted levels due to the appearance of tip vortex cavitation in the model test keywords inverse tracing method itm propeller sheet cavitation cubic spline blade passing frequency 1 introduction a propeller operating in a non uniform wake field in the ocean is one of the prime sources of the underwater acoustic noises of a ship radiating noises from a ship s propellers are used to serve some specific purpose such as remote sensing and military defense and this has attracted attention in research according to baiter 1992 the narrow band noise as produced by propeller sheet cavitation almost dominates the low frequency range therefore this study aims to develop an inverse tracing method itm in the time domain to compute the radiating noises caused by the unsteady sheet cavitation of an operating propeller in addition in order to verify the itm proposed in this paper a comparison between the numerical and experimental results is carried out huse and guoqiang 1982 developed a semi empirical prediction method to predict the exciting force caused by propeller cavitation they estimated the cavitation volume on the propeller blade surface by using experimental data salvatore and ianniello 2003 published a hydrodynamic model for transient sheet cavitation on propellers in non uniform inviscid flow and created a hydroacoustic model for propeller noise based on the ffowcs williams and hawkings fwh equation they demonstrated that the noise predictions of the fwh equation were in agreement with those obtained by the bernoulli equation model kehr and kao 2004 derived the incident blade rate pressure as induced by unsteady sheet cavitation monopole in the time domain for both the near and far fields their derived equations included some simplified assumptions regarding the differential term of the retarded time for the imposed itm the differential term of the retarded time is replaced by the cubic spline function and the simplified assumptions applied by kehr and kao 2004 are unnecessary brouwer 2005 applied a stationary set of rings of the monopole and dipole sources in the frequency domain to solve propeller induced noise and vibrations seol and moon 2009 derived the governing equation of pressure fluctuations induced by sheet cavitation according to the ffowcs williams approach kellett et al 2013 used the permeable source surface to significantly improve the predicted results they suggested neglecting free surface modelling if the user is interested in results of above 200hz the accuracy and corresponding frequency range that are suitable for kellett et al 2013 are not discussed lee et al 2014 proposed the analytic source model i e multi parameter inversion scheme to determine the position of the noise sources due to propeller sheet cavitation and defined the corresponding source strengths the results show a good agreement with the cavitation dynamics of a propeller li et al 2015 and li et al 2018 predicted the underwater radiating noise generated by the cavitating propeller of a coastal tanker a cfd method which consists of a multi phase delayed detached eddy simulation ddes and an fwh acoustic analogy was applied to predict the radiating noise for the model and the full scale propeller where the tonal noise kept a fairly good agreement with the measured signal at both scales up to the 6th bpf blade passing frequency for the model scale propeller the fundamental blade frequency was 93 hz and the maximum error was about 8 db as the frequency was higher than 64 hz the 8th bpf for the full scale propeller the predicted tones were lower than the sea trial data due to the insufficient resolution of tip vortex cavitation tvc in the cfd simulation it was expected that tvc would be an important contribution in the frequency range of 50 112 hz the maximum under prediction in this range is about 28 db at 72 hz at frequencies above 200 hz the broadband noise becomes more under predicted with the increasing frequency artur et al 2016 used large eddy simulation and an fwh acoustic analogy to estimate the cavitation induced noise the sauer and schnerr mass transfer model was also applied to predict the cavitation extensions a blade pass tonal noise was predicted and showed the expected behavior the dominant frequency in the signals also coincided closely with that observed for the cavity volume fluctuations namely 22hz testa et al 2018 predicted the tonal noise caused by unsteady propeller sheet cavitation where the numerical scheme was based on the standard fwh equation there was good agreement between two hydrodynamic models tvm and ebm ebm is the equivalent blade modelling in which an equivalent source body defined by the blade plus cavities is included the maximum difference between the spectral components of these models never exceeded 0 6 db throughout the discrete frequency spectrum and ranged from 1bpf 122 hz to 10bpf the growth of a bubble attached on the blade surface was detected by transpiration terms hence the integrals were easier than the boundary element method as proposed in salvatore and ianniello 2003 the existence of fluctuating cavities was modeled only through the transpiration velocity lloyd et al 2015 bensow and liefvendahl 2016 lidtke et al 2016 and ianiello 2016 also applied the fwh equation to calculate the propeller radiated noise and suggested that it is only suitable for the far field besides this the fwh equation cannot take the effect of marine environmental conditions such as a free surface into consideration as indicated in nobuaki and hikaru 2018 who developed semi empirical methods to estimate the propeller cavitation noise in the near field their numerical results were able to capture tonal noises of up to the 3rd bpf and the maximum difference between the numerical and experimental results was about 10 db the noise at a frequency 1 khz obtained by nobuaki and hikaru 2018 was underestimated by 11 db relative to the experiment the resolution of the broadband noise was limited at 1 khz in the full scale due to a temporal resolution for the cfd simulation in this paper the itm in the time domain is developed to predict the radiating noise caused by unsteady propeller sheet cavitation moreover the numerical scheme is combined with the cubic spline function to replace the unlimited differential term caused by the retarded time the proposed itm can take the free surface into consideration the validation tests for the itm are carried out in addition the numerical results predicted by itm are also compared with the experimental data of a workboat it is verified that the proposed itm is suitable for both the far and near fields 2 inverse tracing method itm i theoretical formulations the flow field is assumed to be compressible and inviscid the unsteady propeller sheet cavitation is considered to be the only noise source in the linear wave equation its induced acoustic pressure can be represented by 1 2 ϕ c a v 1 c 0 2 2 ϕ c a v t 2 q and 2 p c a v ρ 0 ϕ c a v r t t where ϕ c a v is the velocity potential due to unsteady propeller sheet cavitation c 0 is the mean sound speed q is the cavity volume source strength per unit volume p c a v is the acoustic pressure due to unsteady propeller sheet cavitation ρ 0 is the mean fluid density r is the position vector of the field point and t is the time of the field point equation 2 was derived by using the linearized continuity equation and the linear inviscid force equation in kinsler et al 1982 equation 2 is usually used to represent the acoustic pressure the solution to equation 1 morse and ingard 1968 can be expressed as integrals over the noise source volume v s and the noise source time t s 3 ϕ c a v r t 1 4 π t s v s q r s t s r δ t s t r c 0 d v s d t s where r is the distance from the noise source to the field point δ is the dirac delta function and r c 0 is the propagation delay i e the delay between the noise source and the field point the coordinate system is illustrated in fig 1 which shows that the rotating noise source with angular velocity ω is located at the position vector r s x s r s θ s at t s and the field point is located at the position vector r x r θ the distance from the noise source to the field point r can be expressed as 4 r t s x x s t s 2 y y s t s 2 z z s t s 2 the total source strength corresponding to the sheet cavity volume of the propeller at time t s i e the total volume change of the sheet cavitation over the time can be computed by summing up the components of the discrete cavity source strength on the propeller camber surface 5 q r s t s dv s m 1 b i 1 i j 1 j q c a v m i j t s where b is the number of propeller blades i is the number of divided elements in the chordwise direction and j is the number of divided elements in a span wise direction the total number of elements on the propeller camber surface is i j as shown in fig 1 regarding wave propagation there is a propagation delay r t s c 0 from the noise source to the field point the relation between the observer time t and the retarded time t s is 6 t s t r t s c 0 ii tracing the relation between time t and time t s the field time t corresponding to the point source time t s can be traced inversely by equation 6 for example it is assumed that the point source rotating with 10 rps is initially located at x s 0 m y s 1 m z s 0 m and that the field point is at x 5 m y 5 m z 5 m the number of time steps in one period is 60 for the rotating point source the distance between the field point and point source at each time step i e r t s in one period can be computed by equation 4 as illustrated in fig 2 fig 3 a is derived from fig 2 in fig 2 one period is divided into sixty time steps i e there are sixty points in fig 2 and the distance r t s corresponding to each retarded time t s can be obtained after obtaining the distance r t s corresponding to each retarded time t s the field time t at different retarded times t s can be traced by substituting the distance r t s and the retarded time t s at every time step into equation 6 therefore the relation between the field time t and the retarded time t s at each time step can be plotted as shown in fig 3 a in fig 2 the variation of the distance r t s at different retarded times t s is not obvious and the value of r t s c 0 is very small so the retarded time t s seems to depend linearly on the field time t in fig 3 a the linear fit quadratic fir and piecewise cubic spline fits are applied in presenting the actual t s t distribution as shown in fig 3 a as different fits are applied to present the relation shown in fig 3 a the values of t s t at different field times t are illustrated in fig 3 b the linear fit results in a constant t s t the quadratic fit results in the linear distribution of t s t the distribution of t s t is quadratic as the piecewise cubic spline fits are applied although fig 3 a seems to have a linear distribution slight jitters still exist the residuals caused by the linear fit the quadratic fit and the piecewise cubic spline fits are 1 73 0 65 and 0 31 respectively residuals are related to the actual t s t distribution in fig 3 a as the t t s relation is fitted by the piecewise cubic splines the distribution of t s t shown in fig 3 b is obtained by differentiating the piecewise cubic spline functions table 1 shows the residuals related to the actual t s t distribution by different fits at various receiver positions in table 1 the residual caused by the piecewise cubic spline fits is the smallest as compared with those due to the linear and quadratic fits at various receiver positions thus the quadratic distribution of t s t as shown in fig 3 b should be more reasonable in order to improve the accuracy and avoid large residuals a higher order fit cubic spline fit is used in this paper the distribution shown in fig 3 a can be described well by a cubic spline 7 t s a l t 3 b l t 2 c l t d l f t a cubic spline is a spline constructed of piecewise third order polynomials where subscript l denotes the l th piecewise third order polynomial as there are n time steps in one period the cubic spline includes n third order polynomials and time t is included in the l th interval 8 2 π ω n l 1 t 2 π ω n l where 2 π ω is the time period n is the total number of time steps included in one period and a l b l c l and d l are the coefficients of the l th piecewise third order polynomial every third order polynomial passes the endpoints moreover the second derivative of each polynomial is set to zero at the endpoints for smoothing the junctions between two time steps thus the equation of the third order polynomial can be solved hazewinkel 2001 the cubic spline is widely applied in numerical simulations and the formulations of the coefficients for each piecewise third order polynomial i e a l b l c l and d l can be referred to in hazewinkel michiel 2001 take fig 4 for example as the number of time steps is 60 in one period i e every 6o counts as a time step and there are 60 piecewise third order polynomials to describe the t s t curve in one period before computing the sound pressure at a certain field time t the l nt third order polynomial in which the certain field time t is located is determined first in the l nt third order polynomials the coefficients i e a l b l c l and d l are constants iv the radiating noise equation 6 shows that the retarded time t s is function of the observer time t and itself t s in fact the proposed itm redefines the relation between the retarded time t s and the observer time t by equation 7 i e t s f t thus the distance between the point source and the observer r t s can be presented as r f t by applying equations 6 and 7 in equation 3 the dirac delta function in equation 9 is assumed to simplify to δ 0 so one can assume the time integral to vanish i e t s δ 0 d t s 1 then substituting equation 5 into equation 3 an approximate solution of the perturbation potential induced by the unsteady propeller sheet cavity volume at any field location and time t can be obtained as follows 9 ϕ c a v r t 1 4 π t s v s q r s t s r δ 0 d v s d t s 1 4 π v s t s q r s f t r f t δ 0 d t s d v s 1 4 π v s q r s f t r f t t s δ 0 d t s d v s 1 4 π v s q r s f t r f t d v s

unsteady propeller sheet cavitation is contributed to from two parts the first part is due to the temporal variation of the sheet cavity volume i e source strength and can be expressed as follows 11 p

reflecting effect reflected waves are generated to the field point when the radiating waves of a propeller are incident on the free surface as illustrated in fig 5 the sounds reflected from the free surface can be considered as being generated from the imaged propeller which is located symmetrically on the opposite side of the free surface i e the lloyd mirror if the free surface is assumed to be rigid and the imaged propeller has a positive source strength with respect to the actual propeller if the free surface is considered to be soft the imaged propeller has a negative source strength with respect to the actual propeller equations 17 19 are used to compute the acoustic pressure caused by the imaged propeller the coordinate system r i x i r i θ i which is relative to the imaged propeller

where h is the propeller shaft immersion 3 experimental setup this study conducted model scale experiments for a workboat in the underwater anechoic chamber of the ntou cavitation tunnel where the model scale results were transformed into full scale results the full scale values were compared with the numerical results to verify the proposed numerical schemes the hull and propeller of a model scale ship were installed in the test section of the ntou cavitation tunnel the test section of the tunnel was 2 6m w x 1 5m h x 10m l the free surface was substituted with aluminum plates to suppress the wave system of the model in the model test the scaled propeller diameter was 0 23 m the corresponding shaft speed was 27 rps and the ship model was equipped with a rudder a propeller and a shaft line the stern arrangement is shown in fig 6 as illustrated in fig 7 a an underwater microphone was mounted in the underwater anechoic chamber to measure the underwater noise the coordinates of the microphone positions are listed in table 2 the microphone type is b k 8103 and the frequency range is 1 ha 170 khz the horizontal and vertical directional responses are 2 db and 3 db at 100 khz respectively for the daq data acquisition the adapters are jp 0162 and an integral cable with non submersible 10 32 unf connector is used the data acquisition daq input card offers eight channels each at a very high speed the input card transforms the high speed series into an extremely fast transient recorder with selectable anti aliasing filtering high bandwidth and low noise input amplifiers with 0 1 error the sample rate is 25 ms s in the experimental procedure the k t thrust coefficient identity rule was followed to ensure that the loading of the ship and model propellers was equal moreover the cavitation number responded to the local value in a horizontal plane through 0 8r r the propeller radius in the 12 o clock blade position as the thrust coefficient and cavitation number of the model are the same as those of the full scale ship the distribution of the stern inflow and the sheet cavitation can be accurately observed it is noted that the propeller inflows for the model and full scale ship are also consistent i e the distribution of the inflow attack ankles for the model and full scale propellers are the same by following the k t identity rule as indicated in fig 7 b the underwater anechoic chamber was below the test section of the cavitation tunnel and full of water as the shells of the test section and the anechoic chamber were specially designed the sound waves of the external environment could not penetrate into the test section or the anechoic chamber moreover although the propeller was installed in a reverberant environment as the window had the same acoustic impedance as that of the water separating the test section and the anechoic chamber the noise that radiated from the propeller passed completely through the window and was then measured in the anechoic chamber kehr 2004 according to hykat hsva 1998 this test equipment and setup were the same as that of the well known hydrodynamics and cavitation tunnel hykat of the hamburgische schiffbau versuchsanstalt gmbh hsva in order to measure only the noise generated by the operating propeller the noises caused by the shaft vibration the motor operation and the turbulence in the flow field were classified as background noise and were measured in advance when measuring the background noise the propeller was removed a dummy hub was installed and the background noise was measured under the same test conditions the measured background noise was then used to correct the measured results of the propeller according to the recommendations of ross 1976 22 s p l r e a l 10 log 10 s p

propeller advanced ratio as defined by equation 25 25 j a v a n d v a is the propeller inflow velocity fig 8 shows the propeller performance curve which is used to determine the propeller thrust coefficient k t in order to follow the thrust identity rule in the process of the experiment in fig 8 ηo is the propeller efficiency and it is defined by equation 26 26 η o j a 2 π k t k q the cavitation number σ can be represented as follows 27 σ p a t m ρ g h p v 0 5 ρ 0 π n d 2 where p atm is the atmospheric pressure p v is the vapor pressure and h is the propeller shaft immersion the axial and tangential inflow velocities of the propeller at different blade angles and radial positions are shown in figs 9 and 10 the blade angle is viewed from the stern the starboard side corresponds to 90 and the port side to 270 r is the propeller radius the blade root is at 0 2r and the blade tip is at 1 0r both the axial and tangential velocities are non dimensionalized by the ship velocity v s fig 9 illustrates the nominal flow velocities caused by the ship hull without the operating propeller fig 10 shows the effective flow velocities with a consideration of the ship s hull and the operating propeller both the axial and tangential velocities shown in fig 10 are larger than those plotted in fig 9 due to the suction force generated by the operating propeller as shown in fig 10 the axial inflow of nearly 24 is obviously hindered by the stern as a result the inflow velocity is the lowest moreover as the tangential inflow of the ship is asymmetric the 90 and 270 values are opposite to each other the absolute value of the tangential inflow velocity at the 90 position is the largest because the rotating direction is opposite to the tangential inflow the unsteady sheet cavitation due to the operating propeller is predicted by the unsteady lifting surface theory puf 3a developed by kerwin and lee 1978 in puf 3a the number of chord wise lattice elements on the key blade must be specified as either 10 or 20 while the maximum number of input radii for specifying the propeller geometry is 15 in other words the maximum number of meshes to describe the propeller camber surface is 15 20 according to kao 2018 12 20 meshes are sufficient for correctly predicting the source strength by puf 3a lee 1979 reported the results obtained by the unsteady lifting surface theory with all three mesh arrangements 18 10 9 10 and 9 20 it is evident that extremely satisfactory convergence has been achieved in this paper 15 20 meshes i e the maximum number are distributed on each propeller surface fig 11 plots the cavitation extensions of a single blade at different blade angles as calculated by puf 3a and measured in the ntou cavitation tunnel respectively a comparison with fig 11 suggests that the sheet cavitation extension predicted by puf 3a is larger than the measurements by ntou due to the inaccurate prediction of the effective velocity distribution the effective velocities as shown in fig 10 only consider the uniform suction effect over the propeller disk in fact there was a stronger suction effect in the area near the twelve o clock position of the propeller disk thus the axial effective inflow velocity near the twelve o clock position as illustrated in fig 10 is relatively lower than the values of the actual condition and it generates more series cavitation this inaccuracy can only be improved further by using an unsteady rans solver which considers the actual propeller suction effect that occurs in the ship s wake according to fig 11 the sheet cavitation extensions are generated mainly between 15 and 15 and especially at zero degrees in addition while the measured results show that both the sheet and tip vortex cavitation appear the theory of puf 3a cannot predict the tip vortex cavitation according to english 1979 and artur et al 2016 in addition to the broadband characteristics the unsteady tip vortex cavitation also contributes to noise amplitudes at multiples of the blade rate frequencies the total cavity volume vcav of the first propeller blade at different blade angles is illustrated in fig 12 the total source strengths of the first propeller blade at different blade angles i e the value of i 1 20 j 1 15 q c a v 1 i j for the first propeller blade at different time ts are shown in fig 13 the source strength is a variation of sheet cavity volume in time the curve shown in fig 12 is differentiated to get the data illustrated in fig 13 ii validation test for the itm a for the far field the proposed method in this study itm is compared with the far field method proposed by noble et al 1986 the source strengths at σ 1 789 as illustrated in fig 13 were used to predict the radiating noise by using equation 17 the computing conditions are listed in table 3 and the field point is located at x r θ as shown in table 2 fig 14 indicates the predicted radiating noises of these two methods at the bpfs without considering the free surface the generated noises are expressed as spls in db by a reference pressure of 1μ pa the time domain signals obtained through equation 17 are transformed to the frequency domain amplitudes by using discrete fourier transform fig 14 shows that these two methods are in good agreement with a maximum difference of less than 0 5 db when the field point is very close to the propeller i e x 1 m r 0 m θ 180 deg the predicted results of these two methods differ greatly as shown in fig 15 the present method itm distributes the point sources on the entire blade and does not simplify the distance between the point source and the field point which makes it suitable for the near and far fields the method proposed by noble et al 1986 uses a point source to replace the entire blade and there are some simplifications of the distance between the point source and the field point the spls predicted by the present method are smaller than those by the far field method due to the destructive interference between the different point sources on the entire blade b for the near field the proposed itm is suitable for both the far and near fields besides this the proposed itm can take the free surface into the consideration the predicted results of the itm in the far field are in a good agreement with those of the far field method proposed by noble et al 1986 in order to verify that the itm is also suitable for the near field with a satisfactory accuracy the container ship shown in kao 2018 was modeled to compute the near field noise due to its unsteady sheet cavitation the associated data of the container ship and the propeller are listed in table 4 the source strength used to predict the radiating noise in equation 17 can be found in kao 2018 fig 16 presents the sheet cavitation extensions at different angular positions the measured sheet cavitation extensions are similar to those calculated by puf 3a the measured results hykat hsva 1998 indicate that the sheet and tip vortex cavitations both appear between 30 and 50 respectively the theory of puf 3a cannot predict the tip vortex cavitation thus it cannot be found in the numerical results the field point is located above the propeller center and very close to the propeller as shown in fig 17 the distance between the field point and the blade tip is 0 84r and r is the propeller radius kehr and kao 2004 show that as the distance between the propeller center and the field point is smaller than 5r r the propeller radius the field is near field a comparison between the numerical and experimental results is illustrated in fig 18 the maximum spl appears in the first blade frequency the spl at the first bpf i e the dominant spl that is estimated by the present method itm is larger than the measured spl by 2 db at higher blade passing frequencies the measured spls are remarkably stronger than the predicted levels due to the appearance of tip vortex cavitation in the experiment iii the measured noise for a sample workboat in the case of the workboat the rotating speed of the model propeller in the model test was 27 rps the field point is located at xm ym zm as indicated in table 2 fig 19 shows the measured spectra of the mounted microphone in fig 19 splt includes the propeller operation and the background noises the sound pressure levels of the background noise splb are typically 10 db lower than splt both the splt and splb spectra feature narrow band tones and broad band content according to ross 1976 the sound pressure levels that are caused purely by the unsteady sheet cavitation of the operating propeller splreal can be calculated by equation 22 due to the relatively small values of splb the distribution of the splreal is almost the same as that of the splt and the greatest splreal appears in the first bpf the scaling laws as introduced in ittc 2017 are used to transform the measured splreal in the cavitation tunnel into full scale values according to ittc 2017 the increased spl for the full scale is as follows 28 δ s p l 20 log d s d m 1 r m r s 1 σ s σ m 1 n s d s n m d m 2 ρ 0 s ρ 0 m 1 db where subscript s indicates the full scale and subscript m refers to the model scale d is the propeller diameter r is the distance from the noise source to the field point σ is the cavitation number n is the rotating speed and ρ 0 is the fluid density in this paper the full scale position of the field point is directly scaled by the ratio d s d m thus the first two terms can be reformulated as follows 29 d s d m 1 r m r s 1 d s d m 1 r m r m d s d m 1 1 moreover the cavitation number of the experiment is identical to the full scale conditions i e σ s σ m hence equation 29 can be summarized in equation 30 30 δ s p l 20 log n s d s n m d m 2 ρ s ρ m 1 db the model and transformed i e full scale values for the splreal at different bpfs are listed in table 5 the greatest full scale splreal appears at the 1st bpf and is 143 2 db iv the predicted noise caused by the overestimated cavity volume for the sample workboat in this section the overestimated source strength σ 1 789 is applied to predict the radiating noise as shown in fig 11 the computing conditions are listed in table 3 a rigid free surface i e positive image is considered the field point is located at x r θ as indicated in table 2 table 5 shows the spls at different bpfs for the field point located at x r θ and the maximum spl 147 6 db appears at the first bpf 14 2 hz although the measured unsteady tip vortex cavitation amplifies the spls at the bpfs as illustrated in fig 11 the predicted spls are still remarkably larger than the measured values the overestimation of the spl may be caused by the over predicted cavity volume as well as the numerical assumptions and simplifications in the next section the cavity volume is modified to meet the measured size for exploring the effect of the cavity volume on the spls v the predicted noise caused by the modified cavity volume for the sample workboat as the cavitation number increases the cavity volume predicted by puf 3a is decreased the computing conditions are listed in table 3 however the cavitation number σ is adjusted from 1 789 to 2 55 to decrease the cavity volume in order to meet the measured volume extension as shown in fig 20 the predicted cavity volumes with σ 2 55 by puf 3a are shown in fig 20 fig 20 indicates that the distribution of the cavity volumes with a modified cavitation number σ 2 55 is similar to the measured volume the total cavity volume and total source strengths of the first propeller blade with the modified cavitation number σ 2 55 at different blade angles are plotted in figs 12 and 13 respectively the comparisons shown in figs 12 and 13 indicate that the total cavity volumes and total source strength of the first propeller blade at different blade angles are both reduced due to the higher cavitation number σ 2 55 in order to correctly verify the itm the modified source strengths σ 2 55 as shown in fig 13 are used to predict the propeller radiating noise for the field point located at x r θ as indicated in table 2 in other words the numerical and measured cavity volumes are similar and comparisons between the predicted and measured spls are carried out the predicted spls are illustrated in fig 21 and table 5 according to kim et al 2014 and baiter 1992 the cavitation of marine propellers is the most crucial source of underwater radiating noise the spl can be effectively brought down by reducing the cavity volume as the propeller cavitation is greatly reduced the non cavitating noise caused by the linear dipole becomes a practical issue in this paper the cavitation number is modified from 1 789 to 2 55 in order to reduce the cavity volume and to meet the measured size as the cavity volume is reduced the point source strength q c a v m i j t s which is included in equation 17 is correspondingly reduced consequently the predicted spls become lower according to fig 21 the maximum spl appears at the first bpf and the predicted spls are smaller than the measured values at the first bpf the numerical spl is smaller than the measured values by 4 db at the higher bpfs i e the 3rd 8th bpfs the measured spls are also stronger than the predicted values especially at the 5th bpf the spl is remarkably amplified by the tip vortex cavitation and the difference between the predicted and measured values is 9 5 db the differences may be caused by a lack of consideration of the tip vortex cavitation and hull scattering effects the present method itm calculates the radiating noise caused by unsteady propeller sheet cavitation without considering the tip vortex cavitation and scattering wave from the ship hull according to kehr and kao 2011 the waves scattered from the ship hull will amplify the spl at bpfs by 3 6 db english 1979 showed that the tip vortex cavitation can amplify the spls at bpfs akihisa konno 2002 indicated that the noises caused by tip vortex cavitation are of broad band and appear at high frequencies in akihisa konno 2002 the tip vortex cavitation contributes remarkably to the noise amplitudes at higher bpfs in this section the predicted spls are smaller than those that are measured therefore the predictions in this section are more reasonable than those in section iv according to the indications in english 1979 akihisa konno 2002 and kehr and kao 2011 table 6 compares the accuracy of the proposed itm to those of the other methods cited in the introduction 5 conclusions this paper proposed the inverse tracing method itm in the time domain to calculate the radiating noise caused by unsteady propeller sheet cavitation the itm was validated both in the far and near fields using a workboat as the computing sample this study compared the predicted results with the measured values the conclusions are as follows 1 in the scheme of the itm the relationship between the source time and the field time is presented by the cubic spline functions therefore the unlimited differential terms in the solution of the wave equation can be expressed by the coefficients of the piecewise third order polynomial by applying the relationship presented by the cubic spline functions into the solution of the wave equation the dirac delta function is assumed to simplify to δ 0 so the time integral is assumed to vanish 2 the proposed itm can be applied in both the near and far fields the predicted results of the itm in the far field are in good agreement with those of the far field method by nobel et al 1986 in the near field the spl at the first bpf i e the dominant spl estimated by the present method itm is larger than the measured spl by 2 db for the container ship sampled in kao 2018 3 the sheet cavity volume at every time step must be correctly calculated in order to accurately predict the radiating noise as the sheet cavity volumes are over predicted the predicted radiating noise by the itm is remarkably stronger than the measured radiating noise 4 for the sample workboat as the sheet cavity volumes are modified to meet the measured sizes the predicted spl at the first bpf i e the maximum spl is smaller than the measured value by 4 db the difference is possibly due to the enhancement caused by waves scattering from the model ship hull as well as the tip vortex cavitation that appears in the experiments credit authorship contribution statement jui hsiang kao conceived and designed the analysis collected the data contributed data or analysis tools

20598,the thawing of sea ice in the north pole accelerates the opening of new shipping routes through the arctic ocean to identify an economical and safe shipping route in the arctic ocean a risk

seed is generated using the a star algorithm to obtain a reasonable initial solution and reduce computational time the suggested system is applied to the araon an icebreaker operating in the arctic ocean with various voyage plans the results show that the proposed system can be applied effectively to ships operating in the arctic ocean graphical abstract image 1 keywords ship route planning arctic ocean optimization sea ice polaris 1 introduction 1 1 background owing to the increasing global temperature the thawing of sea ice in the north pole is accelerating the decrease in ice covered areas in the north pole has necessitated the opening of new shipping routes through the arctic ocean for reducing fuel oil consumption and travel times accordingly the demand for optimal and safe shipping routes through the arctic ocean is increasing although numerous studies and programs regarding ship route planning exist their application to the arctic ocean is insufficient as the north pole is primarily covered with sea ice a risk assessment of the ice regime is required the ice breaking capability of a ship should be prescribed according to the ice condition in addition power should be predicted and the resistance in ice covered areas should be estimated then speed must be optimized under the consideration of sea ice resistance for practical results in this study route and speed optimization through the arctic ocean was performed to minimize power consumption during operation hence the risk of the ice regime was assessed based on the ice condition of the north pole 1 2 related studies there have been various studies regarding ship route planning the route planning methods can be divided into cell based and cell free methods according to cell usage for the cell based method the a star and dijkstra algorithms are commonly used and were improved for path planning in the past joo et al 2012 e c kim et al 2016 vettor and soares 2016 due to the limitation of the cell based method that it limits the searching directions and the speed optimization is hard to be applied the cell free methods have been developed also the methods such as the three dimensional dynamic programming method zaccone and figari 2017 genetic algorithm lee et al 2018 time space network based algorithm lin and chang 2018 and multi scale visibility graph method wu et al 2021 have been applied to the ship route planning problems meanwhile for the route planning of ships operating through the ice covered area the risk assessment of the ice regime and the ship transit model that considers the impact of the sea ice should also be taken into account this section provides studies related to route planning considering sea ice see table 1 studies regarding the application of ship route planning in the arctic ocean are few compared with those regarding traditional route optimization problems kotovirta et al 2009 sought the optimal route over the ice covered baltic sea area using powell s method and the polytope method in the paper three models were integrated the ship transit model ice model and optimization model the parameters for ice conditions such as ice thickness and concentration were considered using the high resolution operational model for the baltic model smith and stephenson 2013 analyzed navigable arctic shipping routes under several climate change scenarios and vessel classes to assess future changes least cost navigation routes were derived based on the canadian arctic ice regime shipping system airss transport canada 2003 which enables a ship to navigate ice covered areas safely nam et al 2013 introduced an enhanced algorithm to determine the optimal route in the arctic the navigation system comprised a numerical sea ice model transit model and route optimization model the dijkstra algorithm dijkstra 1959 was adopted for the route finding model which minimized the total cost for fuel oil operation port charge icebreaker fee and capital cost furthermore uncertainties in sea ice behavior in the arctic ocean were predicted choi et al 2015 suggested an uncertainty based path planning model to obtain the optimal route under time varying stochastic conditions the uncertain ice prediction model simulated dynamic sea ice behavior with uncertainties and the result was delivered to an optimization model for path planning the a star algorithm hart et al 1968 was employed for path planning it is a well known heuristic path planning algorithm that minimizes distance transit time and failure rate grandinetti 2017 developed a cost benefit model for shipping in the arctic ocean the voyage operational and capital costs were estimated whereas the ice resistance was calculated the polar operational limit assessment risk indexing system polaris abs 2016 was used to consider the risk of ice based on different ice classes of ships and different types of ice regimes the developed cost benefit model was verified by comparing it with the actual voyage furthermore it was used to perform the simulation of two cases wang et al 2018 regarded a route planning problem as a multi criteria decision making problem and proposed a modified a algorithm in their study the sailing time economic benefits and navigation safety were considered and multi models of the sea ice prediction and multiple experts knowledge were used as input of the route optimization model wei et al 2020 presented a projection of arctic sea ice conditions and shipping activities during the 21st century the technical accessibility to shipping was calculated with the climate model including the sea ice thickness and concentration then the optimal route was obtained using the least cost path algorithm minimizing traveling time existing studies related to the ship route planning in the arctic ocean optimized shipping routes to minimize time distance cost and failure rate due to sea ice the ship transit model was developed by estimating the ship resistance through the sea ice to calculate the costs additionally the risk of the ice regime was evaluated based on the airss and polaris or simplified methods however route optimization considering the change in speed was not performed and the suggested optimization algorithms were not suitable for the simultaneous optimization of route and speed furthermore cell based algorithms are generally adopted such as the dijkstra and a star algorithms which generate a path by connecting the center points of the cells the simultaneous optimization of route and speed using a cell free seed based genetic algorithm is proposed herein to obtain a safe and economical shipping route through the arctic ocean sea ice risk assessment was performed using the polaris and the ship performance was evaluated based on an ice covered area for the application we performed ship route planning through the bering sea and the arctic ocean and analyzed the results by varying the sea ice conditions 2 theoretical backgrounds the configuration of the system for ship route planning through the arctic ocean is shown in fig 1 the ship route planning system is composed of a performance evaluation model and an optimization model first for the ship route planning problem input data pertaining to the ship model voyage plan including arrival and departure ports weather conditions and geographical data are required then the optimal route with information regarding the path time and power consumption is obtained as the output the detailed input and output data for the ship route planning system are shown in table 2 the ship s performance in the arctic ocean was affected by environmental conditions such as sea ice and weather in the ship performance model the total ship resistance was estimated considering the marine environment and sea ice additionally speed correction and power prediction were performed in addition the ice regime was defined based on the polaris rule and the risk index outcome rio which is an index that can be used to evaluate the risk of a specified ice regime was calculated ship route planning can be defined as an optimization problem that minimizes certain cost functions under a specified condition in the optimization model the basic elements for the optimization are defined the design variables which represent the route the objective function to be minimized and the constraints that should be satisfied subsequently a route composed of a series of nodes is generated from the defined design variables during the optimization each route candidate is evaluated using the objective function and the constraints are calculated using the performance evaluation model once the route candidate is evaluated an optimization method is required to obtain the optimal route in this study we solved the ship route planning problem defined by the optimization model using a seed genetic algorithm which improves the genetic algorithm by generating seeds based on the initial solution and constructing a seed database lee 2017 finally the optimal ship route generated using the models above was visualized using a multilayer architecture the user interface matched the grid and pixel of each layer of the route and the geography and ice condition were visualized simultaneously 2 1 performance evaluation model 2 1 1 power estimation to predict the ship resistance in sea ice speed correction and power estimation the transit and sea ice prediction models developed by the korea research institute of ships and ocean engineering kriso were adopted the kriso arctic safe routing system kars includes the sea ice condition predictions ship performance predictions derived from the ship transit model based on model tests and data pertaining to real voyage conditions jeong et al 2018b yang et al 2018 suggested a voyage environmental information system to predict the dynamic information regarding the sea ice ocean wave and weather near real time using satellite observation and numerical model based prediction data the sea ice and marine environmental data for the arctic region with a latitude above 67 were stored at a resolution of 2 5 km whereas the data for the bering sea with a range of longitude 117 198 and latitude 22 67 were stored at a resolution of 0 25 the environmental data used in the transit model code prediction period and time range are presented in table 3 yang et al 2018 the prediction period and range varied according to the environmental data and the resolutions at the bering sea and the arctic ocean differed the environmental prediction data were stored separately according to the prediction period and range based on the data type for the route evaluation the last predicted environmental data at a specified location and time were used as input data the latest data are used if the prediction data do not exist the ship performance prediction model comprised three parts first the database for the safe speed of ice class vessels was constructed based on the model tests and then the ice resistance was determined jeong et al 2017 2018a through the model test a numerical method was developed and evaluated kim et al 2018 then the safe speed predictions for ship and ice collisions were analyzed using finite element method based simulations nho et al 2018 the structural safety of the hull in the sea ice collision situation was assessed finally a ship transit model was developed in open water and sea ice covered areas kim et al 2016 in the ship transit model the relationship between rpm and power rpm and speed were defined we adopted the developed ship transit model to obtain the actual speed and power consumption generated by the specified rpm and environmental conditions 2 1 2 rio calculation the ice class of the ship and the standard that determines the likelihood of passing the ice covered area is defined in the polaris by the international maritime organization the polaris integrates the experiences and best practices of the canadian airss and russian ice certificate abs 2016 the canadian airss defines the ice state as an ice regime as well as the ice regime severity transport canada 2003 in the russian ice certificate the risk to the hull is determined by the ice thickness strength and ship speed the process of evaluating the possibility of passing through an ice covered area is presented in fig 2 based on the polaris rule the ice condition is assessed based on the risk value rv and rio the rv indicates the severity of the ship for the ice regime and is presented as a function of the ice class of the ship operation season and ice regime condition the rv was obtained by referring to the tables provided by imo msc 1 circ 1519 imo 2016 the tables show the rv for the decayed and normal ice conditions in this study the normal ice condition was assumed since the information about the stage of decay was not provided the ice regime condition which is determined by the development and decay stages is classified by the ice thickness consequently the rio which indicates the possibility of a ship passing the ice regime is calculated as the product of the ice regime rv and the ice concentration c 1 rio c rv in this study the sea ice data predicted based on the weather prediction model in table 3 were used the higher the rv value the lower is the ice regime severity and the more likely is a ship to pass an area with a higher rio if the value of rio is negative then the area is not operational or speed reduction is required see fig 2 2 2 optimization model in this section the optimization model for the entire system is described the ship route planning problem for economy and safety can be formulated as an optimization model this section defines the design variables constraints and objective function which are the basic components of the optimization model 2 2 1 design variables for the ship route optimization the design variables that represent the route should be defined in this study the route was represented as a set of intermediate points with equal time intervals the intermediate points including the departure and arrival ports were defined as nodes the nodes were connected with a segment with equal time durations known as unit time which was provided as input data as shown in table 2 the departure port arrival port and required time of arrival are included in the voyage plan the number of required nodes can be calculated by dividing the required time of arrival by the unit time to optimize the speed and path simultaneously we assumed that each node contained information regarding the path and speed at the location represented as the heading angle and rpm respectively lee et al 2018 the location of each intermediate node starting from the departure port can be calculated using the ship transit model using the specified engine rpm and the environmental conditions at the location the speed can be calculated using the ship transit model consequently the speed heading angle and unit time determine the position of the next node the route was completed by connecting the last intermediate node to the arrival port to satisfy the voyage plan therefore the last intermediate node only contained information regarding the rpm and the heading angle was determined by the direction of the arrival port as the length of the last segment was also calculated automatically the time duration of the segment did not equal the unit time the last node which was the arrival port did not contain information regarding the rpm and heading angle the route comprised n intermediate nodes that can be represented as a set of rpms and heading angles which are the design variables in the following equation lee et al 2018 2 r o u t e n 0 n 1 n n 1 n n n n 1 θ 0 r p m 0 θ 1 r p m 1 θ n 1 r p m n 1 0 r p m n 0 0 θ r p m where n i represents ith intermediate node θ i and rpm i are the heading angle and rpm at the ith node and θ and rpm are the sets of the heading angles and rpms of every node in the route respectively for route generation the location of each node was calculated based on the rpm and heading angle at the previous node the ship transit model calculates the actual speed while considering the environmental conditions in existing studies that define a route as a set of nodes the speed at each node was assumed to be constant along the segment during the unit time lee et al 2018 however as the unit time is generally set to several hours the environmental conditions particularly the sea ice condition in the arctic ocean often changes during navigation therefore the shipping speed was updated based on the resolution of the environmental data at the arctic ocean and the bering sea i e 2 5 km and 0 25 respectively yang et al 2018 see fig 3 to obtain the exact location of the nodes vincenty s formula which calculates the distance between two points on the surface of a spheroid vincenty 1975 was used the computational time required for the optimization depended on the number of design variables which was determined by the required time of arrival and the unit time in this study we assumed that the ship did not change its heading angle during the unit time between nodes therefore the continuity and complexity of the final route were closely related to the unit time generally the course alternation and speed change during the navigation in the ocean is performed few times a day fig 4 shows examples of optimal routes for the same voyage plan based on different unit times as the unit time decreased from 12 to 3 h the optimal route became more continuous and complicated lee et al 2018 generated ship routes by nodes with various unit times from 3 h to 24 h and compared the optimal route by changing unit time as a result the unit time with 6 h yielded the optimal route with 97 5 of total fuel oil consumption tfoc and computation time reduced by 44 2 compared to the result of 3 h in this study the unit time was chosen to find the optimal route with a reasonable range of the objective function and the acceptable computation time for each case 2 2 2 constraints the optimized route should satisfy several constraints related to the safety of the ship and voyage plan five constraints were formulated in this study the required time of arrival land avoidance rio criteria restrictions of heading angle and rpm and northeast northwest passage first the ship should reach the arrival port within the required time of arrival which is provided in the voyage plan it is represented by the following inequation 3 e t a θ r p m r t a 0 where eta is the estimated time of arrival which was obtained from the design variables and rta is the required time of arrival respectively the shipping route could not pass through land or sea areas with shallow depths for the specified longitude and latitude the geographical data provided information regarding whether the position was on the land or in the sea as well as the depth information for the case of the sea the information was stored in a grid comprising longitudes and latitudes divided by 0 1 then we verified whether each segment of the route passed through the grid which is land or shallow water with a smaller depth than the minimum under keel clearance the constraint is expressed as follows where h is the water depth t the draft and ukc the under keel clearance 4 h l o n l a t l o n l a t r o u t e t u k c for the safety of ships passing through the arctic ocean the polaris provides a standard that indicates the possibility of a ship passing the ice regime abs 2016 according to the ice class of the ship defined by the polaris the rio of a specified ice regime is obtained furthermore it is not operational or speed reduction is required if the rio is negative therefore we added rio criteria as additional constraints such that the route cannot pass through the ice regime with a negative rio 5 rio l o n l a t l o n l a t r o u t e 0 in addition the restrictions of the design variables rpm and heading angle were included as constraints the minimum and maximum rpms were provided as input data and the range of the heading angle was defined as 180 180 the restrictions on the rpm and heading angle ranges are expressed as follows 6 θ min θ i θ max r p m min r p m i r p m max finally an optional constraint was added such that the path in the arctic ocean followed a certain passage in some cases the ship had to avoid the territorial waters of other countries and followed either the northeast or northwest passage therefore an additional constraint that restrained the location of the nodes from passing a certain area was formulated the initial voyage data included information regarding whether the ship can pass a certain area the region in which ships cannot pass is defined as the constraint 2 2 3 objective function the optimization aims to yield an economical route that requires the lowest fuel consumption while satisfying the constraint states above the performance of a ship changes according to weather conditions roh 2013 in this study the objective function was set as the summation of the total power consumption the total power consumption can be obtained from the ship transit model explained in section 2 1 finally the optimization model searches for the optimal route that minimizes the objective function 2 2 4 seed genetic algorithm to obtain an optimal route based on the optimization model a genetic algorithm goldberg 1989 which is a global optimization algorithm was adopted in this case a well known genetic algorithm i e the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm deb et al 2002 was selected as the genetic algorithm is a metaheuristic algorithm the solution depends on a random search therefore a significant amount of time is required to obtain the optimal solution using a genetic algorithm and the consistency of the result is poor lee et al 2001 2002 hence the seed genetic algorithm lee 2017 was adopted the simulation cost for the optimization was reduced by applying the concept of seed the seed genetic algorithm improves the genetic algorithm by generating seeds and constructing a seed database in this study the initial solution was generated using the a star algorithm and the seed database was constructed based on the voyage plan which consists departure and arrival ports required time of arrival restrained area and unit time there exists one seed for the same voyage plan and the seed is updated when a better solution with a smaller objective function is obtained by the genetic algorithm 2 3 route searching algorithm 2 3 1 seed generation based on a star algorithm the a star algorithm hart et al 1968 is a cell based path searching algorithm generally used in many fields of computer science the cell based method uses a cell which is defined as a small region generated from a grid the a star algorithm generates a path by connecting the center point of the cells thereby limiting the search direction and generating an angled shaped path however owing to its simplicity and fast computation time the a star algorithm has been implemented in many studies to obtain optimal shipping routes choi et al 2015 joo et al 2012 in this study we generated an initial solution of the genetic algorithm using the a star algorithm for fast convergence in existing studies of path planning using a cell based algorithm at a relatively low latitude the grid was generated based on the latitude and longitude lee 2017 lee et al 2018 however the grid using the longitude and latitude cannot be implemented at the poles as the distance between the cells becomes extremely small and the distortion increases significantly the path is generated based on the mercator projection which is generally used for the navigation map furthermore the latter has high latitude inflation and even becomes infinite at the poles therefore for arctic ocean applications the grid is generated separately for the arctic ocean and the area below a latitude of 67 in the arctic area the azimuthal equidistant projection is used to create a grid which has a small distortion near the pole fig 5 presents the grid generated for the a star algorithm based on the latitude as explained in section 2 1 1 the weather data of the bering sea with a longitude range of 117 198 and latitude range of 22 67 were stored with a resolution of 0 25 and 2 5 km in those of the arctic ocean hence the maximum resolution of the grid was set to the resolution of the weather data because the ship can navigate between two regions of different grids the connection points between the two grids were defined as shown in fig 6 the a star algorithm generated several connected paths when the ship was traveling between the arctic ocean and the rest area the connection points were set temporarily only for the a star algorithm and the genetic algorithm searched for the optimal path regardless of the connection points once the shipping path was generated using the a star algorithm the path form had to be changed using design variables that can be used as the initial solution for the genetic algorithm the path expressed as the set of center points of the cells should be redefined by the set of rpms and heading angles hence the number of nodes that compose the path should be changed based on the unit time and the required time or arrival furthermore as the path created by the a star algorithm does not contain information regarding the speed an appropriate assumption is required generally a fixed rpm is assumed and the location of the next nodes is calculated using the speed and unit time following the path generated by the a star algorithm however in the arctic ocean the resistance of the ship changes significantly with sea ice conditions and an rpm adjustment is required to achieve a constant speed therefore if a constant rpm is assumed then the initial solution may not be generated correctly based on the path generated by the a star algorithm in this study the length of each segment was calculated by dividing the total length of the path by the number of segments and the required speed and rpm were obtained in a reverse manner the number of segments is determined by dividing the required time of arrival by the unit time fig 7 shows the procedure to create an initial solution based on the path generated by the a star algorithm first the center points of the cell composing the path were transformed into longitude and latitude information the distance between the nodes was assumed to be constant and calculated by the total length of the path and the number of segments then the speed at each node was obtained and the ship transit model was used to calculate the required rpm while considering the weather and sea ice data finally the new node s location was obtained by following the path created by the a star algorithm and then the heading angle was calculated the rpms and heading angles are obtained and set as the initial solution for the genetic algorithm if the seed does not exist 2 3 2 validation test the seed genetic algorithm implements seed as an initial solution to reduce the computational time required to obtain an optimal solution and efficiently obtain the global optimum to validate the seed genetic algorithm s effectiveness we compared the optimal route obtained from the genetic algorithm through the presence of seed based on the a star algorithm the voyage departing from tuktoyaktuk canada and arriving at murmansk russia was selected as depicted in fig 8 the required arrival time was set manually to 12 days by finding a possible range of time with a maximum speed of 16 knots for reference the average duration of a given voyage plan was obtained by assuming the speed roughly as 12 knots in normal environmental conditions which is the service speed of araon kopri 2011 the unit time was set to be 6 h by referring to the study of lee et al 2018 in the genetic algorithm without seed the initial solution was randomly set based on randomly distributed design variables the population of the genetic algorithm was set to 200 and the optimal routes with generations of 100 200 500 1000 2000 and 5000 were obtained fig 9 shows the shipping route with and without seed based on the number of generations as depicted in fig 9 the optimization of the shipping route without seed required more generations to reach the optimal solution compared with the solution with seed for the randomly generated initial solution the constraints defined in the optimization model were not satisfied until 500 generations furthermore the optimal route might converge to the local optimum owing to the inconsistency of the initial solution as shown in fig 9 this tendency was more evident as the shipping route became more complex the initial solution was generated using the a star algorithm in the seed genetic algorithm with a computational time of less than 1 s the initial solution based on the a star algorithm satisfied all the constraints and the shipping route indicated a similar tendency after 5000 generations based on the number of generations the total powers of the shipping routes were compared on the log scale as shown in fig 10 the total powers for the shipping routes with and without seed are indicated as a solid blue and red line respectively the dotted gray line implies that the solution does not satisfy the routing problem s constraints such as the required time of arrival land and sea ice avoidance with seed the difference in the solution s total power consumption after 2000 generations and 5000 generations was less than 1 however the solution without seed could not converge to the optimum solution in 5000 generations owing to the local optimum problem and an insufficient number of generations for convergence the genetic algorithm without seed consumed more power in yielded a shipping route hence we are convinced that the use of the seed based on the a star algorithm can improve the genetic algorithm s efficiency providing a consistent initial solution and fewer generations for convergence 3 applications ice trials for araon a research vessel to investigate the arctic ocean were conducted and the kars system was validated in this study we applied the suggested ship route planning algorithm to araon araon is an icebreaker operating in the antarctic with an ice class of pc 5 the specifications of the ship are listed in table 4 3 1 prototype program for ship route planning a prototype program was developed for ship route planning through the arctic ocean using the c language fig 11 shows the configuration of the prototype program the voyage plan including the departure and arrival port date and required time of arrival was input in the route planning view the optimization view sets the parameters necessary for the optimization and manages the optimization process the optimized route ice condition and geography map are integrated and visualized in the visualization view the log view shows information regarding the simulation progress 3 2 convergence test the genetic algorithm searches for an optimal solution based on biological phenomena such as mutation crossover and selection the number of populations and generations are set as parameters the number of populations and generations is associated closely with the computational cost and the objective function of the optimal route we performed a test to determine the appropriate range of the parameters to search for the optimal route the voyage departing from busan south korea and arriving at murmansk russia was selected as illustrated in fig 12 and the unit time was 6 h roeva et al 2013 observed the influence of the population size of the genetic algorithm by changing the population size between 5 and 200 to find the optimal population size with a reasonable computation time in this study the optimal route that satisfies all the constraints was not found with a population size smaller than 10 therefore we changed the population size from 10 to 500 so that the algorithm finds the optimal route with an acceptable computation time the generation number was set to 10 times the population number the objective function of the optimal path which indicates the total power consumption was compared based on the number of evaluations on a logical scale the results are depicted in fig 13 as the population and generation numbers increased the computational time increased exponentially the objective function decreased as more evaluations were performed it converged after 2500000 times evaluations with a decreasing rate of less than 0 5 in the following applications the population and generation numbers were set to 500 and 5000 respectively the optimal routes were determined when the objective function decreased by less than 0 5 after 5000 additional generations 3 3 optimal route through northeast and northwest passages to check the applicability of the proposed algorithm and the prototype program they were applied to various examples and the results were compared with actual ship traffic data the voyage plan for ship route planning is summarized in table 5 both cases involved a departure from busan south korea and arrival in murmansk russia the ship followed the northeast and northwest passages for each case and the required time of arrival was set differently the sea ice and weather conditions were the same in both cases as the passage through the northwest was complicated the unit time was set to 3 h the optimal routes for cases 1 and 2 are depicted in figs 14 and 15 respectively owing to the additional constraints the ship passed through russian waters in case 1 northeast passage and territorial waters in canada in the northwest passage in case 2 the ship made a detour to avoid the islands compared with case 1 the ship avoided ice covered areas to reduce power consumption from sea ice resistance table 6 shows the power consumption and total distance of the optimal routes for cases 1 and 2 the required time of arrival was achieved in both cases the ship arrived at the arrival port just in time to minimize the power consumption the northwest passage consumed more power owing to the additional traveling time furthermore the total distance was longer in case 2 because of the islands i e 149 of the northeast passage the optimal routes were compared with the ship traffic density in 2014 provided by the ocean conservancy ocean conservancy 2017 as shown in fig 16 although the sea ice conditions were not exactly identical the optimal routes overlapped with actual ship traffic data in general the northwest passage followed the real traffic data in the complicated region surrounded by islands therefore it was confirmed that the optimization method yielded a reasonable route passing through the arctic ocean 3 4 optimal route with varying sea ice conditions in this application we compared the optimal route through the arctic ocean based on changes in sea ice conditions for one year the voyage plan for the application is summarized in table 7 the departure date was changed from january to december for the same departure and arrival ports and for the same required arrival time the optimal route and the ability to pass through the arctic ocean are presented in fig 17 for 12 cases from january to december fig 17 shows the ice concentration of the arctic ocean at the departure time and the optimal route as the sea ice develops further during the winter the ice covered area is generally the largest in march and the smallest in september the required time of arrival 14 days was achieved from july to october the power consumption and traveling distance for each month are summarized as follows see table 8 the results indicate that the power consumption and the total operation distance were minimum in september when the ice covered area was the smallest in july the power consumption increased as the ship passed through the thick sea ice resulting in a 184 4 power consumption in september as the sea ice melted the total distance of the passage decreased and the ship can operate with a lower rpm thereby reducing power consumption during a fixed time duration therefore the sea ice condition significantly affected the power consumption fig 18 shows the ice thickness and concentration of cases 9 to 12 at the departure time in case 9 july although the ice covered area and ice concentration reduced the ship made a detour owing to the thick sea ice meanwhile in october the ice thickness was the smallest but the ice concentration increased resulting in a detour of the ship the power consumption speed and rpm based on sea ice condition changes in case 9 is depicted in fig 19 as indicated in fig 19 the sea ice concentration along the path reached 0 8 and the thickness of the sea ice increased by 0 93 during the operation the predicted power consumption in the area increased subsequently showing a similar tendency to the sea ice thickness similarly the rpm increased but the corrected speed decreased under severe sea ice conditions therefore in severe sea ice conditions the required rpm to obtain the appropriate speed increased significantly 4 conclusions the demand for efficient and safe shipping routes through the arctic ocean is increasing owing to the thawing of sea ice in the north pole herein a method for ship route planning in the arctic ocean considering the effect of sea ice was proposed a ship route planning system that included performance evaluation and optimization models was developed the optimization model was formulated to consider the ship s direction and speed simultaneously constraints based on the ice property and ice class of the ship were adopted for the application to the arctic ocean to consider the severity of the ice covered area the rio value was calculated based on the polaris then speed correction and power prediction were performed by estimating the ship resistance in the ice covered area using the kars transit model finally a seed based genetic algorithm was adopted for optimization to reduce the computational cost the a star algorithm was applied to obtain the initial solution and seed whereas the optimal solution was searched using a genetic algorithm for the application a convergence test was performed to obtain reasonable parameter ranges for the genetic algorithm the results indicated that the objective function converged within 5000 generations for a population number of 500 to verify the applicability to the actual voyage plan two cases involving northeast and northwest passages were simulated the ship avoided land and risky ice covered areas and satisfied the required time of arrival in both cases in addition the optimal route and the ability to pass through the arctic ocean were analyzed with varying sea ice conditions from january to december 2018 the results indicated that the ship could operate in the arctic ocean for the voyage plan from july to october and consumed the minimum power in september it was observed that the sea ice condition significantly affected the power consumption and speed in this study the ice prediction data used in the transit model only consisted of the ice thickness and concentration however the sea ice conditions in the arctic ocean are various and complex which can be defined by additional factors such as the ice strength and roughness according to the canadian airss the sea ice is considered decayed if it has formed thaw holes or has been rotten and the severity of the ice is decreased in this study we only considered the operation season for the ice strength which indicates the stage of decay the ice roughness is also taken into account in the canadian airss by considering the ice regime deformed by ridges rubble or hummocking we are convinced that if there are possible information about the ice strength and roughness in the future more practical result could be obtained we proposed a global path planning method for the given voyage plan and static obstacles for the specific route planning considering moving obstacles additional local path planning and collision avoidance are required in real time zhao and roh 2019 zhao et al 2019 chun et al 2021 future research will focus on improving the proposed system by including various objective functions apart from power consumption the computational cost will be reduced by code

20598,the thawing of sea ice in the north pole accelerates the opening of new shipping routes through the arctic ocean to identify an economical and safe shipping route in the arctic ocean a risk assessment of the ice regime and an optimization of the route that minimizes the total power consumption should be performed in this study a ship route planning system comprising a performance evaluation model and an optimization model is proposed in the performance evaluation model the power required for the voyage is estimated speed correction is performed using the transit model of the korea research institute of ships and ocean engineering kriso arctic safe routing system kars developed by the kriso the risk index outcome which indicates the severity of the sea ice to the ship is calculated based on the polar operational limit assessment risk indexing system polaris subsequently the ship route planning problem is formulated as an optimization problem in the optimization model the heading angle and engine revolutions per minute are both considered to optimize the speed and path simultaneously the objective function is set as the total power consumption and the constraints for the arrival time avoidance of land criteria for the ice regime and restriction of the design variables are considered then the optimal route is searched based on the seed genetic algorithm the seed is generated using the a star algorithm to obtain a reasonable initial solution and reduce computational time the suggested system is applied to the araon an icebreaker operating in the arctic ocean with various voyage plans the results show that the proposed system can be applied effectively to ships operating in the arctic ocean graphical abstract image 1 keywords ship route planning arctic ocean optimization sea ice polaris 1 introduction 1 1 background owing to the increasing global temperature the thawing of sea ice in the north pole is accelerating the decrease in ice covered areas in the north pole has necessitated the opening of new shipping routes through the arctic ocean for reducing fuel oil consumption and travel times accordingly the demand for optimal and safe shipping routes through the arctic ocean is increasing although numerous studies and programs regarding ship route planning exist their application to the arctic ocean is insufficient as the north pole is primarily covered with sea ice a risk assessment of the ice regime is required the ice breaking capability of a ship should be prescribed according to the ice condition in addition power should be predicted and the resistance in ice covered areas should be estimated then speed must be optimized under the consideration of sea ice resistance for practical results in this study route and speed optimization through the arctic ocean was performed to minimize power consumption during operation hence the risk of the ice regime was assessed based on the ice condition of the north pole 1 2 related studies there have been various studies regarding ship route planning the route planning methods can be divided into cell based and cell free methods according to cell usage for the cell based method the a star and dijkstra algorithms are commonly used and were improved for path planning in the past joo et al 2012 e c kim et al 2016 vettor and soares 2016 due to the limitation of the cell based method that it limits the searching directions and the speed optimization is hard to be applied the cell free methods have been developed also the methods such as the three dimensional dynamic programming method zaccone and figari 2017 genetic algorithm lee et al 2018 time space network based algorithm lin and chang 2018 and multi scale visibility graph method wu et al 2021 have been applied to the ship route planning problems meanwhile for the route planning of ships operating through the ice covered area the risk assessment of the ice regime and the ship transit model that considers the impact of the sea ice should also be taken into account this section provides studies related to route planning considering sea ice see table 1 studies regarding the application of ship route planning in the arctic ocean are few compared with those regarding traditional route optimization problems kotovirta et al 2009 sought the optimal route over the ice covered baltic sea area using powell s method and the polytope method in the paper three models were integrated the ship transit model ice model and optimization model the parameters for ice conditions such as ice thickness and concentration were considered using the high resolution operational model for the baltic model smith and stephenson 2013 analyzed navigable arctic shipping routes under several climate change scenarios and vessel classes to assess future changes least cost navigation routes were derived based on the canadian arctic ice regime shipping system airss transport canada 2003 which enables a ship to navigate ice covered areas safely nam et al 2013 introduced an enhanced algorithm to determine the optimal route in the arctic the navigation system comprised a numerical sea ice model transit model and route optimization model the dijkstra algorithm dijkstra 1959 was adopted for the route finding model which minimized the total cost for fuel oil operation port charge icebreaker fee and capital cost furthermore uncertainties in sea ice behavior in the arctic ocean were predicted choi et al 2015 suggested an uncertainty based path planning model to obtain the optimal route under time varying stochastic conditions the uncertain ice prediction model simulated dynamic sea ice behavior with uncertainties and the result was delivered to an optimization model for path planning the a star algorithm hart et al 1968 was employed for path planning it is a well known heuristic path planning algorithm that minimizes distance transit time and failure rate grandinetti 2017 developed a cost benefit model for shipping in the arctic ocean the voyage operational and capital costs were estimated whereas the ice resistance was calculated the polar operational limit assessment risk indexing system polaris abs 2016 was used to consider the risk of ice based on different ice classes of ships and different types of ice regimes the developed cost benefit model was verified by comparing it with the actual voyage furthermore it was used to perform the simulation of two cases wang et al 2018 regarded a route planning problem as a multi criteria decision making problem and proposed a modified a algorithm in their study the sailing time economic benefits and navigation safety were considered and multi models of the sea ice prediction and multiple experts knowledge were used as input of the route optimization model wei et al 2020 presented a projection of arctic sea ice conditions and shipping activities during the 21st century the technical accessibility to shipping was calculated with the climate model including the sea ice thickness and concentration then the optimal route was obtained using the least cost path algorithm minimizing traveling time existing studies related to the ship route planning in the arctic ocean optimized shipping routes to minimize time distance cost and failure rate due to sea ice the ship transit model was developed by estimating the ship resistance through the sea ice to calculate the costs additionally the risk of the ice regime was evaluated based on the airss and polaris or simplified methods however route optimization considering the change in speed was not performed and the suggested optimization algorithms were not suitable for the simultaneous optimization of route and speed furthermore cell based algorithms are generally adopted such as the dijkstra and a star algorithms which generate a path by connecting the center points of the cells the simultaneous optimization of route and speed using a cell free seed based genetic algorithm is proposed herein to obtain a safe and economical shipping route through the arctic ocean sea ice risk assessment was performed using the polaris and the ship performance was evaluated based on an ice covered area for the application we performed ship route planning through the bering sea and the arctic ocean and analyzed the results by varying the sea ice conditions 2 theoretical backgrounds the configuration of the system for ship route planning through the arctic ocean is shown in fig 1 the ship route planning system is composed of a performance evaluation model and an optimization model first for the ship route planning problem input data pertaining to the ship model voyage plan including arrival and departure ports weather conditions and geographical data are required then the optimal route with information regarding the path time and power consumption is obtained as the output the detailed input and output data for the ship route planning system are shown in table 2 the ship s performance in the arctic ocean was affected by environmental conditions such as sea ice and weather in the ship performance model the total ship resistance was estimated considering the marine environment and sea ice additionally speed correction and power prediction were performed in addition the ice regime was defined based on the polaris rule and the risk index outcome rio which is an index that can be used to evaluate the risk of a specified ice regime was calculated ship route planning can be defined as an optimization problem that minimizes certain cost functions under a specified condition in the optimization model the basic elements for the optimization are defined the design variables which represent the route the objective function to be minimized and the constraints that should be satisfied subsequently a route composed of a series of nodes is generated from the defined design variables during the optimization each route candidate is evaluated using the objective function and the constraints are calculated using the performance evaluation model once the route candidate is evaluated an optimization method is required to obtain the optimal route in this study we solved the ship route planning problem defined by the optimization model using a seed genetic algorithm which improves the genetic algorithm by generating seeds based on the initial solution and constructing a seed database lee 2017 finally the optimal ship route generated using the models above was visualized using a multilayer architecture the user interface matched the grid and pixel of each layer of the route and the geography and ice condition were visualized simultaneously 2 1 performance evaluation model 2 1 1 power estimation to predict the ship resistance in sea ice speed correction and power estimation the transit and sea ice prediction models developed by the korea research institute of ships and ocean engineering kriso were adopted the kriso arctic safe routing system kars includes the sea ice condition predictions ship performance predictions derived from the ship transit model based on model tests and data pertaining to real voyage conditions jeong et al 2018b yang et al 2018 suggested a voyage environmental information system to predict the dynamic information regarding the sea ice ocean wave and weather near real time using satellite observation and numerical model based prediction data the sea ice and marine environmental data for the arctic region with a latitude above 67 were stored at a resolution of 2 5 km whereas the data for the bering sea with a range of longitude 117 198 and latitude 22 67 were stored at a resolution of 0 25 the environmental data used in the transit model code prediction period and time range are presented in table 3 yang et al 2018 the prediction period and range varied according to the environmental data and the resolutions at the bering sea and the arctic ocean differed the environmental prediction data were stored separately according to the prediction period and range based on the data type for the route evaluation the last predicted environmental data at a specified location and time were used as input data the latest data are used if the prediction data do not exist the ship performance prediction model comprised three parts first the database for the safe speed of ice class vessels was constructed based on the model tests and then the ice resistance was determined jeong et al 2017 2018a through the model test a numerical method was developed and evaluated kim et al 2018 then the safe speed predictions for ship and ice collisions were analyzed using finite element method based simulations nho et al 2018 the structural safety of the hull in the sea ice collision situation was assessed finally a ship transit model was developed in open water and sea ice covered areas kim et al 2016 in the ship transit model the relationship between rpm and power rpm and speed were defined we adopted the developed ship transit model to obtain the actual speed and power consumption generated by the specified rpm and environmental conditions 2 1 2 rio calculation the ice class of the ship and the standard that determines the likelihood of passing the ice covered area is defined in the polaris by the international maritime organization the polaris integrates the experiences and best practices of the canadian airss and russian ice certificate abs 2016 the canadian airss defines the ice state as an ice regime as well as the ice regime severity transport canada 2003 in the russian ice certificate the risk to the hull is determined by the ice thickness strength and ship speed the process of evaluating the possibility of passing through an ice covered area is presented in fig 2 based on the polaris rule the ice condition is assessed based on the risk value rv and rio the rv indicates the severity of the ship for the ice regime and is presented as a function of the ice class of the ship operation season and ice regime condition the rv was obtained by referring to the tables provided by imo msc 1 circ 1519 imo 2016 the tables show the rv for the decayed and normal ice conditions in this study the normal ice condition was assumed since the information about the stage of decay was not provided the ice regime condition which is determined by the development and decay stages is classified by the ice thickness consequently the rio which indicates the possibility of a ship passing the ice regime is calculated as the product of the ice regime rv and the ice concentration c 1 rio c rv in this study the sea ice data predicted based on the weather prediction model in table 3 were used the higher the rv value the lower is the ice regime severity and the more likely is a ship to pass an area with a higher rio if the value of rio is negative then the area is not operational or speed reduction is required see fig 2 2 2 optimization model in this section the optimization model for the entire system is described the ship route planning problem for economy and safety can be formulated as an optimization model this section defines the design variables constraints and objective function which are the basic components of the optimization model 2 2 1 design variables for the ship route optimization the design variables that represent the route should be defined in this study the route was represented as a set of intermediate points with equal time intervals the intermediate points including the departure and arrival ports were defined as nodes the nodes were connected with a segment with equal time durations known as unit time which was provided as input data as shown in table 2 the departure port arrival port and required time of arrival are included in the voyage plan the number of required nodes can be calculated by dividing the required time of arrival by the unit time to optimize the speed and path simultaneously we assumed that each node contained information regarding the path and speed at the location represented as the heading angle and rpm respectively lee et al 2018 the location of each intermediate node starting from the departure port can be calculated using the ship transit model using the specified engine rpm and the environmental conditions at the location the speed can be calculated using the ship transit model consequently the speed heading angle and unit time determine the position of the next node the route was completed by connecting the last intermediate node to the arrival port to satisfy the voyage plan therefore the last intermediate node only contained information regarding the rpm and the heading angle was determined by the direction of the arrival port as the length of the last segment was also calculated automatically the time duration of the segment did not equal the unit time the last node which was the arrival port did not contain information regarding the rpm and heading angle the route comprised n intermediate nodes that can be represented as a set of rpms and heading angles which are the design variables in the following equation lee et al 2018 2 r o u t e n 0 n 1 n n 1 n n n n 1 θ 0 r p m 0 θ 1 r p m 1 θ n 1 r p m n 1 0 r p m n 0 0 θ r p m where n i represents ith intermediate node θ i and rpm i are the heading angle and rpm at the ith node and θ and rpm are the sets of the heading angles and rpms of every node in the route respectively for route generation the location of each node was calculated based on the rpm and heading angle at the previous node the ship transit model calculates the actual speed while considering the environmental conditions in existing studies that define a route as a set of nodes the speed at each node was assumed to be constant along the segment during the unit time lee et al 2018 however as the unit time is generally set to several hours the environmental conditions particularly the sea ice condition in the arctic ocean often changes during navigation therefore the shipping speed was updated based on the resolution of the environmental data at the arctic ocean and the bering sea i e 2 5 km and 0 25 respectively yang et al 2018 see fig 3 to obtain the exact location of the nodes vincenty s formula which calculates the distance between two points on the surface of a spheroid vincenty 1975 was used the computational time required for the optimization depended on the number of design variables which was determined by the required time of arrival and the unit time in this study we assumed that the ship did not change its heading angle during the unit time between nodes therefore the continuity and complexity of the final route were closely related to the unit time generally the course alternation and speed change during the navigation in the ocean is performed few times a day fig 4 shows examples of optimal routes for the same voyage plan based on different unit times as the unit time decreased from 12 to 3 h the optimal route became more continuous and complicated lee et al 2018 generated ship routes by nodes with various unit times from 3 h to 24 h and compared the optimal route by changing unit time as a result the unit time with 6 h yielded the optimal route with 97 5 of total fuel oil consumption tfoc and computation time reduced by 44 2 compared to the result of 3 h in this study the unit time was chosen to find the optimal route with a reasonable range of the objective function and the acceptable computation time for each case 2 2 2 constraints the optimized route should satisfy several constraints related to the safety of the ship and voyage plan five constraints were formulated in this study the required time of arrival land avoidance rio criteria restrictions of heading angle and rpm and northeast northwest passage first the ship should reach the arrival port within the required time of arrival which is provided in the voyage plan it is represented by the following inequation 3 e t a θ r p m r t a 0 where eta is the estimated time of arrival which was obtained from the design variables and rta is the required time of arrival respectively the shipping route could not pass through land or sea areas with shallow depths for the specified longitude and latitude the geographical data provided information regarding whether the position was on the land or in the sea as well as the depth information for the case of the sea the information was stored in a grid comprising longitudes and latitudes divided by 0 1 then we verified whether each segment of the route passed through the grid which is land or shallow water with a smaller depth than the minimum under keel clearance the constraint is expressed as follows where h is the water depth t the draft and ukc the under keel clearance 4 h l o n l a t l o n l a t r o u t e t u k c for the safety of ships passing through the arctic ocean the polaris provides a standard that indicates the possibility of a ship passing the ice regime abs 2016 according to the ice class of the ship defined by the polaris the rio of a specified ice regime is obtained furthermore it is not operational or speed reduction is required if the rio is negative therefore we added rio criteria as additional constraints such that the route cannot pass through the ice regime with a negative rio 5 rio l o n l a t l o n l a t r o u t e 0 in addition the restrictions of the design variables rpm and heading angle were included as constraints the minimum and maximum rpms were provided as input data and the range of the heading angle was defined as 180 180 the restrictions on the rpm and heading angle ranges are expressed as follows 6 θ min θ i θ max r p m min r p m i r p m max finally an optional constraint was added such that the path in the arctic ocean followed a certain passage in some cases the ship had to avoid the territorial waters of other countries and followed either the northeast or northwest passage therefore an additional constraint that restrained the location of the nodes from passing a certain area was formulated the initial voyage data included information regarding whether the ship can pass a certain area the region in which ships cannot pass is defined as the constraint 2 2 3 objective function the optimization aims to yield an economical route that requires the lowest fuel consumption while satisfying the constraint states above the performance of a ship changes according to weather conditions roh 2013 in this study the objective function was set as the summation of the total power consumption the total power consumption can be obtained from the ship transit model explained in section 2 1 finally the optimization model searches for the optimal route that minimizes the objective function 2 2 4 seed genetic algorithm to obtain an optimal route based on the optimization model a genetic algorithm goldberg 1989 which is a global optimization algorithm was adopted in this case a well known genetic algorithm i e the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm deb et al 2002 was selected as the genetic algorithm is a metaheuristic algorithm the solution depends on a random search therefore a significant amount of time is required to obtain the optimal solution using a genetic algorithm and the consistency of the result is poor lee et al 2001 2002 hence the seed genetic algorithm lee 2017 was adopted the simulation cost for the optimization was reduced by applying the concept of seed the seed genetic algorithm improves the genetic algorithm by generating seeds and constructing a seed database in this study the initial solution was generated using the a star algorithm and the seed database was constructed based on the voyage plan which consists departure and arrival ports required time of arrival restrained area and unit time there exists one seed for the same voyage plan and the seed is updated when a better solution with a smaller objective function is obtained by the genetic algorithm 2 3 route searching algorithm 2 3 1 seed generation based on a star algorithm the a star algorithm hart et al 1968 is a cell based path searching algorithm generally used in many fields of computer science the cell based method uses a cell which is defined as a small region generated from a grid the a star algorithm generates a path by connecting the center point of the cells thereby limiting the search direction and generating an angled shaped path however owing to its simplicity and fast computation time the a star algorithm has been implemented in many studies to obtain optimal shipping routes choi et al 2015 joo et al 2012 in this study we generated an initial solution of the genetic algorithm using the a star algorithm for fast convergence in existing studies of path planning using a cell based algorithm at a relatively low latitude the grid was generated based on the latitude and longitude lee 2017 lee et al 2018 however the grid using the longitude and latitude cannot be implemented at the poles as the distance between the cells becomes extremely small and the distortion increases significantly the path is generated based on the mercator projection which is generally used for the navigation map furthermore the latter has high latitude inflation and even becomes infinite at the poles therefore for arctic ocean applications the grid is generated separately for the arctic ocean and the area below a latitude of 67 in the arctic area the azimuthal equidistant projection is used to create a grid which has a small distortion near the pole fig 5 presents the grid generated for the a star algorithm based on the latitude as explained in section 2 1 1 the weather data of the bering sea with a longitude range of 117 198 and latitude range of 22 67 were stored with a resolution of 0 25 and 2 5 km in those of the arctic ocean hence the maximum resolution of the grid was set to the resolution of the weather data because the ship can navigate between two regions of different grids the connection points between the two grids were defined as shown in fig 6 the a star algorithm generated several connected paths when the ship was traveling between the arctic ocean and the rest area the connection points were set temporarily only for the a star algorithm and the genetic algorithm searched for the optimal path regardless of the connection points once the shipping path was generated using the a star algorithm the path form had to be changed using design variables that can be used as the initial solution for the genetic algorithm the path expressed as the set of center points of the cells should be redefined by the set of rpms and heading angles hence the number of nodes that compose the path should be changed based on the unit time and the required time or arrival furthermore as the path created by the a star algorithm does not contain information regarding the speed an appropriate assumption is required generally a fixed rpm is assumed and the location of the next nodes is calculated using the speed and unit time following the path generated by the a star algorithm however in the arctic ocean the resistance of the ship changes significantly with sea ice conditions and an rpm adjustment is required to achieve a constant speed therefore if a constant rpm is assumed then the initial solution may not be generated correctly based on the path generated by the a star algorithm in this study the length of each segment was calculated by dividing the total length of the path by the number of segments and the required speed and rpm were obtained in a reverse manner the number of segments is determined by dividing the required time of arrival by the unit time fig 7 shows the procedure to create an initial solution based on the path generated by the a star algorithm first the center points of the cell composing the path were transformed into longitude and latitude information the distance between the nodes was assumed to be constant and calculated by the total length of the path and the number of segments then the speed at each node was obtained and the ship transit model was used to calculate the required rpm while considering the weather and sea ice data finally the new node s location was obtained by following the path created by the a star algorithm and then the heading angle was calculated the rpms and heading angles are obtained and set as the initial solution for the genetic algorithm if the seed does not exist 2 3 2 validation test the seed genetic algorithm implements seed as an initial solution to reduce the computational time required to obtain an optimal solution and efficiently obtain the global optimum to validate the seed genetic algorithm s effectiveness we compared the optimal route obtained from the genetic algorithm through the presence of seed based on the a star algorithm the voyage departing from tuktoyaktuk canada and arriving at murmansk russia was selected as depicted in fig 8 the required arrival time was set manually to 12 days by finding a possible range of time with a maximum speed of 16 knots for reference the average duration of a given voyage plan was obtained by assuming the speed roughly as 12 knots in normal environmental conditions which is the service speed of araon kopri 2011 the unit time was set to be 6 h by referring to the study of lee et al 2018 in the genetic algorithm without seed the initial solution was randomly set based on randomly distributed design variables the population of the genetic algorithm was set to 200 and the optimal routes with generations of 100 200 500 1000 2000 and 5000 were obtained fig 9 shows the shipping route with and without seed based on the number of generations as depicted in fig 9 the optimization of the shipping route without seed required more generations to reach the optimal solution compared with the solution with seed for the randomly generated initial solution the constraints defined in the optimization model were not satisfied until 500 generations furthermore the optimal route might converge to the local optimum owing to the inconsistency of the initial solution as shown in fig 9 this tendency was more evident as the shipping route became more complex the initial solution was generated using the a star algorithm in the seed genetic algorithm with a computational time of less than 1 s the initial solution based on the a star algorithm satisfied all the constraints and the shipping route indicated a similar tendency after 5000 generations based on the number of generations the total powers of the shipping routes were compared on the log scale as shown in fig 10 the total powers for the shipping routes with and without seed are indicated as a solid blue and red line respectively the dotted gray line implies that the solution does not satisfy the routing problem s constraints such as the required time of arrival land and sea ice avoidance with seed the difference in the solution s total power consumption after 2000 generations and 5000 generations was less than 1 however the solution without seed could not converge to the optimum solution in 5000 generations owing to the local optimum problem and an insufficient number of generations for convergence the genetic algorithm without seed consumed more power in yielded a shipping route hence we are convinced that the use of the seed based on the a star algorithm can improve the genetic algorithm s efficiency providing a consistent initial solution and fewer generations for convergence 3 applications ice trials for araon a research vessel to investigate the arctic ocean were conducted and the kars system was validated in this study we applied the suggested ship route planning algorithm to araon araon is an icebreaker operating in the antarctic with an ice class of pc 5 the specifications of the ship are listed in table 4 3 1 prototype program for ship route planning a prototype program was developed for ship route planning through the arctic ocean using the c language fig 11 shows the configuration of the prototype program the voyage plan including the departure and arrival port date and required time of arrival was input in the route planning view the optimization view sets the parameters necessary for the optimization and manages the optimization process the optimized route ice condition and geography map are integrated and visualized in the visualization view the log view shows information regarding the simulation progress 3 2 convergence test the genetic algorithm searches for an optimal solution based on biological phenomena such as mutation crossover and selection the number of populations and generations are set as parameters the number of populations and generations is associated closely with the computational cost and the objective function of the optimal route we performed a test to determine the appropriate range of the parameters to search for the optimal route the voyage departing from busan south korea and arriving at murmansk russia was selected as illustrated in fig 12 and the unit time was 6 h roeva et al 2013 observed the influence of the population size of the genetic algorithm by changing the population size between 5 and 200 to find the optimal population size with a reasonable computation time in this study the optimal route that satisfies all the constraints was not found with a population size smaller than 10 therefore we changed the population size from 10 to 500 so that the algorithm finds the optimal route with an acceptable computation time the generation number was set to 10 times the population number the objective function of the optimal path which indicates the total power consumption was compared based on the number of evaluations on a logical scale the results are depicted in fig 13 as the population and generation numbers increased the computational time increased exponentially the objective function decreased as more evaluations were performed it converged after 2500000 times evaluations with a decreasing rate of less than 0 5 in the following applications the population and generation numbers were set to 500 and 5000 respectively the optimal routes were determined when the objective function decreased by less than 0 5 after 5000 additional generations 3 3 optimal route through northeast and northwest passages to check the applicability of the proposed algorithm and the prototype program they were applied to various examples and the results were compared with actual ship traffic data the voyage plan for ship route planning is summarized in table 5 both cases involved a departure from busan south korea and arrival in murmansk russia the ship followed the northeast and northwest passages for each case and the required time of arrival was set differently the sea ice and weather conditions were the same in both cases as the passage through the northwest was complicated the unit time was set to 3 h the optimal routes for cases 1 and 2 are depicted in figs 14 and 15 respectively owing to the additional constraints the ship passed through russian waters in case 1 northeast passage and territorial waters in canada in the northwest passage in case 2 the ship made a detour to avoid the islands compared with case 1 the ship avoided ice covered areas to reduce power consumption from sea ice resistance table 6 shows the power consumption and total distance of the optimal routes for cases 1 and 2 the required time of arrival was achieved in both cases the ship arrived at the arrival port just in time to minimize the power consumption the northwest passage consumed more power owing to the additional traveling time furthermore the total distance was longer in case 2 because of the islands i e 149 of the northeast passage the optimal routes were compared with the ship traffic density in 2014 provided by the ocean conservancy ocean conservancy 2017 as shown in fig 16 although the sea ice conditions were not exactly identical the optimal routes overlapped with actual ship traffic data in general the northwest passage followed the real traffic data in the complicated region surrounded by islands therefore it was confirmed that the optimization method yielded a reasonable route passing through the arctic ocean 3 4 optimal route with varying sea ice conditions in this application we compared the optimal route through the arctic ocean based on changes in sea ice conditions for one year the voyage plan for the application is summarized in table 7 the departure date was changed from january to december for the same departure and arrival ports and for the same required arrival time the optimal route and the ability to pass through the arctic ocean are presented in fig 17 for 12 cases from january to december fig 17 shows the ice concentration of the arctic ocean at the departure time and the optimal route as the sea ice develops further during the winter the ice covered area is generally the largest in march and the smallest in september the required time of arrival 14 days was achieved from july to october the power consumption and traveling distance for each month are summarized as follows see table 8 the results indicate that the power consumption and the total operation distance were minimum in september when the ice covered area was the smallest in july the power consumption increased as the ship passed through the thick sea ice resulting in a 184 4 power consumption in september as the sea ice melted the total distance of the passage decreased and the ship can operate with a lower rpm thereby reducing power consumption during a fixed time duration therefore the sea ice condition significantly affected the power consumption fig 18 shows the ice thickness and concentration of cases 9 to 12 at the departure time in case 9 july although the ice covered area and ice concentration reduced the ship made a detour owing to the thick sea ice meanwhile in october the ice thickness was the smallest but the ice concentration increased resulting in a detour of the ship the power consumption speed and rpm based on sea ice condition changes in case 9 is depicted in fig 19 as indicated in fig 19 the sea ice concentration along the path reached 0 8 and the thickness of the sea ice increased by 0 93 during the operation the predicted power consumption in the area increased subsequently showing a similar tendency to the sea ice thickness similarly the rpm increased but the corrected speed decreased under severe sea ice conditions therefore in severe sea ice conditions the required rpm to obtain the appropriate speed increased significantly 4 conclusions the demand for efficient and safe shipping routes through the arctic ocean is increasing owing to the thawing of sea ice in the north pole herein a method for ship route planning in the arctic ocean considering the effect of sea ice was proposed a ship route planning system that included performance evaluation and optimization models was developed the optimization model was formulated to consider the ship s direction and speed simultaneously constraints based on the ice property and ice class of the ship were adopted for the application to the arctic ocean to consider the severity of the ice covered area the rio value was calculated based on the polaris then speed correction and power prediction were performed by estimating the ship resistance in the ice covered area using the kars transit model finally a seed based genetic algorithm was adopted for optimization to reduce the computational cost the a star algorithm was applied to obtain the initial solution and seed whereas the optimal solution was searched using a genetic algorithm for the application a convergence test was performed to obtain reasonable parameter ranges for the genetic algorithm the results indicated that the objective function converged within 5000 generations for a population number of 500 to verify the applicability to the actual voyage plan two cases involving northeast and northwest passages were simulated the ship avoided land and risky ice covered areas and satisfied the required time of arrival in both cases in addition the optimal route and the ability to pass through the arctic ocean were analyzed with varying sea ice conditions from january to december 2018 the results indicated that the ship could operate in the arctic ocean for the voyage plan from july to october and consumed the minimum power in september it was observed that the sea ice condition significantly affected the power consumption and speed in this study the ice prediction data used in the transit model only consisted of the ice thickness and concentration however the sea ice conditions in the arctic ocean are various and complex which can be defined by additional factors such as the ice strength and roughness according to the canadian airss the sea ice is considered decayed if it has formed thaw holes or has been rotten and the severity of the ice is decreased in this study we only considered the operation season for the ice strength which indicates the stage of decay the ice roughness is also taken into account in the canadian airss by considering the ice regime deformed by ridges rubble or hummocking we are convinced that if there are possible information about the ice strength and roughness in the future more practical result could be obtained we proposed a global path planning method for the given voyage plan and static obstacles for the specific route planning considering moving obstacles additional local path planning and collision avoidance are required in real time zhao and roh 2019 zhao et al 2019 chun et al 2021 future research will focus on improving the proposed system by including various objective functions apart from power consumption the computational cost will be reduced by code optimization furthermore the result of the suggested method will be compared with the actual navigation data of araon for validation credit authorship contribution statement hye won lee

20599,a novel steel concrete steel composite structure constructed using ultra high performance concrete forming an s uhpc composite structure was applied in arctic offshore structures this type of structure can withstand ice pressure derived from impinging sheet ice in the arctic region in this study the failure mechanism of s uhpc composite beams was explored experimentally and analytically considering the effects of steel fibers in uhpc five groups of push out tests were conducted to reveal the interfacial performance between steel plates and uhpc static tests on s uhpc composite beams were performed to study their structural behaviors the results indicate that steel fibers have a significant effect on the failure modes slippage behavior and mechanical behavior of the s uhpc composite beams furthermore on the basis of test results finite element fe models of the push out tests and static tests of the s uhpc composite beams were developed and validated further a parametric study was carried out to summarize the failure modes of the push out tests and to explore the influence mechanism of steel fibers on the structural behavior of the s uhpc composite beams finally an analytical model for predicting the ultimate strength of s uhpc composite beams was proposed and compared with existing design codes keywords s uhpc composite beams steel fibers failure mechanism fe models analytical model arctic offshore structures 1 introduction the increasing global demand for oil and gas has reawakened the interest of researchers in the development of the arctic region under the harsh environmental conditions in the arctic one challenge for the offshore platform is that withstanding the extreme loads derived from moving ice yan et al 2016a as shown in fig 1 the loads imposed by ice are large and not evenly distributed palmer and croasdale 2012 which leads to the generation of high pressure zones hence localized out of plane loads are the key factors affecting the design of arctic offshore structures this type of structure should satisfy the requirements of high strength and ductility huang et al 2015 and yan et al 2016a adopted steel concrete steel scs composite structures as ice resistant walls in arctic region structures see fig 1 which could be applied at sea water depths of 10 100 m the concept of scs composite structures was originally proposed from a steel plate concrete structure in 1989 dai and liew 2010 the development of which had a significant process for double skin composite dsc structures and bi steel structures roberts et al 1996 therefore scs composite structures in the form of external and internal steel plates shear connectors and core concrete were developed in addition to ice resistant walls in the arctic region these structures have been successfully applied in nuclear power plants protective structures and oil containers yan et al 2016b lin et al 2018 slippage behaviors between steel plates and concrete in scs composite structures have attracted the attention of researchers previous studies have indicated that slippage between steel plates and concrete reduces the mechanical behavior of scs composite structures which can be improved by efficient composite action qin et al 2015 lin et al 2019a shear connectors can not only transfer the shear force but also provide composite action lin et al 2020 to confirm the efficient composite action many types of shear connectors rafiei et al 2015 yang et al 2016 jelovica et al 2016 shariati et al 2013 were used in scs composite structures numerous push out tests were performed to investigate the mechanical behavior of shear connectors yan et al 2014 ozturk et al 2019 wang et al 2019a in addition to traditional shear connectors such as shear studs and cross ties yan et al 2014 2020b adopted novel enhanced c channels and j hook connectors in scs composite structures to improve the interfacial performance between steel plates and concrete moreover a series of studies on experimental and numerical simulations of scs composite structures were carried out to analyze the failure modes and mechanical behavior lin et al 2018 2019a 2020 yan et al 2016a 2019 thereby several theoretical models for predicting the ultimate strength of scs composite structures were proposed and validated by existing test results and numerical simulation results however the above mentioned theoretical models focused on scs composite structures with ordinary concrete as core materials the type of core material also significantly affects the structural behavior of scs composite structures uhpc as a widely used cement based material has superior mechanical behaviors durability and ductility and can be adopted in scs composite structures to form s uhpc composite structures wang et al 2019b zhang et al 2020b s uhpc composite structures take advantage of steel structures and uhpc they can withstand harsh environments of the arctic region and have improved mechanical behaviors reduced maintenance costs and extended working life lin et al 2018 yan et al 2020a 2020b performed experimental and numerical simulations on s uhpc composite beams to reveal the influence of some study parameters on mechanical behaviors including steel plate thickness core concrete depth shear reinforcement ratio and types of shear connectors lin et al 2018 2020 carried out static shear tests to investigate the differences between scs composite beams and s uhpc composite beams all specimens were designed with identical study parameters including arrangements of steel plates and shear connectors except for the core materials scs composite beams concrete with a strength grade of c50 adopted as core materials exhibited shear failure but s uhpc composite beams uhpc adopted as core materials exhibited flexural failure this indicates that adopting uhpc as a core material can change the failure modes of scs composite structures however uhpc is a compounded cement based material the material properties of which are affected by many factors the steel fibers in uhpc lead to the strain hardening behavior of uhpc under tension uhpc with different volume fractions of steel fibers exhibits different material properties zhang et al 2020a hence by adopting uhpc with different volume fractions of steel fibers as core materials s uhpc composite structures would exhibit different structural behaviors it is important to reveal the effect of steel fibers in uhpc on the structural behavior of s uhpc composite structures however previous studies have mainly focused on the mechanical behavior of s uhpc composite structures few studies have been conducted to explore the effect of different volume fractions of steel fibers in uhpc on the failure mechanism of s uhpc composite structures therefore the relationship between the volume fraction of steel fibers in uhpc and the structural behavior of s uhpc composite structures should be studied further the influence mechanism of steel fibers on the structural behavior of s uhpc composite structures can be determined and the failure mechanism of s uhpc composite structures can be explored systematically in order to evaluate the ultimate strength more reasonably this study aims to explore the performance improvement of steel fibers in uhpc on ice resistant structures in the arctic region their failure mechanism under localized out of plane loads derived from moving ice was studied through static tests on s uhpc composite beams under shear loads moreover a series of tests were performed including tensile and compressive tests of uhpc with different volume fractions of steel fibers and push out tests of steel plates to uhpc furthermore on the basis of test results fe models were established and verified to explore the failure mechanism of s uhpc composite beams further the failure modes of the push out tests are summarized herein the influence of steel fibers on the failure modes slippage behavior and ultimate strength of s uhpc composite beams is discussed in detail finally an analytical model for predicting the ultimate strength of s uhpc composite beams is proposed and compared with existing codes 2 experimental investigations 2 1 test specimens and set up 2 1 1 tensile and compressive tests of uhpc tensile tests on uhpc with different volume fractions of steel fibers three specimens for each group were carried out a specialized fixture was designed to fix test specimens dog bone specimens 80 mm 30 mm 13 mm for the tensile region and the test set up for the tensile tests are shown in fig 2 two linear variable differential transformers lvdts were used to measure the deformations of the tensile specimens a force transducer was used to measure the applied loads of the tensile specimens displacement controlled loading was adopted to obtain the whole stress strain curves of the tensile tests moreover during the casting of the tensile specimens cube specimens 100 mm 100 mm 100 mm of uhpc with different volume fractions of steel fibers were prepared to measure the corresponding compressive strength the tensile and compressive specimens were stored at 20 3 c for 24 h before demolding subsequently the demolded specimens were exposed to curing conditions 20 3 c rh 95 for 28 days 2 1 2 push out tests to observe the failure modes of shear studs as shear connectors and the development of cracks near the shear studs more clearly a new set up for push out tests was designed as illustrated in fig 3 four shear studs a diameter of 10 mm length of 80 mm and yield strength of 400 mpa were used to connect h shaped steel 150 mm 150 mm 10 mm q345 and uhpc 100 mm 100 mm 150 mm of which every shear stud was cut in half from the middle the cut surface of the shear studs and the surface of uhpc were on the same plane to observe the failure modes of the shear studs and the development of cracks near the shear studs a detailed test specimen fabrication process is shown in fig 3 a force transducer was used to measure the applied loading displacement controlled loading was applied to the spacer at the top of h shaped steel to obtain the load slippage curves of the push out tests five groups of push out test specimens were prepared three specimens for each group the detailed test parameters of which are listed in table 1 moreover during the casting of the push out test specimens cube specimens 100 mm 100 mm 100 mm of uhpc with different volume fractions of steel fibers and c50 concrete were also prepared to measure the corresponding compressive strength 2 1 3 static tests of s uhpc composite beams a simply supported s uhpc composite beam s uhpc 1 without steel fibers was designed to perform the three point loading test as shown in fig 4 the fabrication procedures of the specimens included a welding shear studs to top and bottom steel plates b assembling top and bottom steel plates by welding cross ties c fabricating wood formworks and d casting of core concrete during the concrete casting process the top and bottom steel plates can be used as a part of the formworks wood formworks were placed on both sides of the specimens to avoid void formation between the concrete and the shear connectors owing to insufficient vibration during casting self compacting uhpc was mixed as the core concrete moreover three simply supported s uhpc composite beams with steel fibers sc2 sc3 and sc3 b and a simply supported scs composite beams sc1 b with ordinary concrete by lin et al 2018 2020 were adopted for comparison and summary all specimens were designed with dimensions of 304 mm width and 406 mm depth the steel plates were all designed with a thickness of 9 8 mm and a yield strength of 375 mpa the shear span to depth ratio was set to 2 5 thereby the structural behaviors of the s uhpc composite beams under shear loads were analyzed moreover cross ties can not only transfer the shear force from steel plate to core concrete but also have the contribution to composite action between steel plate and concrete lin et al 2020 thus to quantify the arrangements of shear connectors including cross ties and shear studs the shear connection coefficient was used yang et al 2016 as expressed in eq 1 1 k n sh n f where n sh is number of shear connectors in shear span n f a sp f y sp 0 7 a st f y s for a sp and a st are cross section area of steel plates and shear studs and f y sp f y s are yield strength of steel plates and shear studs respectively the detailed test parameters are listed table 2 a vertical concentrated load was applied by an electro hydraulic actuator with a capacity of 3000 kn displacement controlled loading was adopted to obtain the load displacement curves of the s uhpc composite beams displacement transducers were adopted to measure the displacement at the location of the loading point at the midspan supports and specimen end for measuring the slippage value between the steel plates and concrete strain gauges were arranged to measure the strain distribution of the steel plates crack patterns were obtained by capturing digital photographs at each loading step a detailed test set up is shown in fig 4 2 2 mixing of uhpc the mixed proportions were designed based on previous research by the authors lin et al 2019b and are listed in table 3 ordinary portland cement with a strength grade of 42 5 was adopted silica fume with a specific surface area of 24 000 m2 kg was used the particle diameters of fine and coarse silica sands were 109 212 μm and 212 380 μm respectively a polycarboxylate superplasticizer sp was used to adjust the fluidity of the mixtures straight steel fibers with a diameter of 0 18 mm length of 13 mm and tensile ultimate strength of 2800 mpa were adopted the volume fractions of the steel fibers were designed with 1 2 and 4 to explore their effects on the structural behaviors of the s uhpc composite beams although uhpc with 4 of steel fibers is rarely applied in practical engineering to explore the effect of steel fibers on the failure mechanism of the s uhpc composite beams this study designed uhpc with 4 of steel fibers to conduct detailed investigations moreover self compacting concrete with strength grade c50 was mixed as a control group in comparison with uhpc q345 steel was applied in steel plates shear studs and cross ties 3 test results 3 1 tensile and compressive test results fig 5 a shows the tensile stress strain curves of uhpc with different volume fractions of steel fibers for the uhpc without steel fibers and with 1 2 and 4 of steel fibers the tensile strengths were 3 5 4 5 11 2 and 19 2 mpa respectively and the strains when the stress decreased to 80 of the tensile strength were 0 000358 0 01 0 03 and 0 04 respectively compared with uhpc without steel fibers the tensile strength of uhpc with 4 of steel fibers increased by 449 this indicates that steel fibers can increase the deformation and ductility of uhpc this is owing to bridge action of steel fibers as illustrated in fig 5 a after the cracking of the tensile specimens the bond strength between the steel fibers and uhpc increased the ductility and tensile strength of the tensile specimens which exhibited strain hardening behaviors higher volume fractions of steel fibers indicate higher bond strength between steel fibers and uhpc thus the tensile strength and the tensile strain increased with an increase in the volume fraction of steel fibers in uhpc fig 5 b shows the compressive strength of uhpc with different volume fractions of steel fibers this figure demonstrates that steel fibers increase the compressive strength of uhpc with an increase in the volume fraction of steel fibers the compressive strength of uhpc increases this is attributed to the properties of steel fibers for orientation which leads to the formation of a steel fiber mesh skeleton this can delay the development of cracks in uhpc and enhance the compressive strength when the volume fraction of steel fibers increased to 4 the compressive strength of uhpc decreased in comparison with that of 2 of steel fibers this is because steel fibers cluster with high volume fractions to increase the voids in uhpc which reduces the contribution of steel fibers on the compressive strength thus the tensile strength of uhpc increases with the volume fraction of steel fibers the compressive strength of uhpc increases with an increase in the volume fraction of steel fibers from 1 to 2 but decreases with an increase in the volume fraction of steel fibers from 2 to 4 3 2 push out test results as illustrated in figs 5 b and 6 the peak load increases with the compressive strength of concrete when the load reaches the peak load cracks form around the shear studs after the peak load the shear studs exhibit a certain deformation and the load slippage curves exhibit ductility until the fracture of the shear studs thus the push out specimens reached the peak load because of the cracking of concrete moreover fig 7 shows the detailed failure modes of the push out specimens as illustrated in fig 7 a and 7 b when the shear studs connect h shaped steel with uhpc with 1 of steel fibers and without steel fibers cracks appear around the shear stud head and the shear stud bar in addition to the shear stud root as illustrated in fig 7 c when the shear studs connect h shaped steel with uhpc with 4 of steel fibers cracks appear only around the shear stud root thus steel fibers can delay the development of cracks near the shear studs 3 3 static tests on s uhpc composite beams 3 3 1 strain distribution of bottom steel plate fig 8 a shows the strain distribution of the bottom steel plates for specimen s uhpc 1 when the strain value reaches 2000 the bottom steel plate yields because the strain of the top steel plate does not reach the yield strain the test results for the strain of the top steel plate are not shown for s uhpc 1 the bottom steel plate yields at the midspan as shown in fig 8 b for specimen sc3 with a smaller shear connection coefficient 0 18 as compared with that of s uhpc1 0 59 the bottom steel plate does not yield as shown in fig 8 c for specimen sc2 with a large shear connection coefficient of 0 30 the bottom steel plate yields moreover according to test results lin et al 2018 for specimens sc1 b and sc3 b with a large shear connection coefficient of 0 59 the bottom steel plate also yields thus the configuration of the shear connectors significantly affects the yielding of the bottom steel plate which is related to the composite action between the bottom steel plate and concrete 3 3 2 crack patterns and crack width fig 9 shows the crack patterns and the width of the critical cracks of the specimens under the peak load specimens s uhpc 1 and sc1 b exhibit shear failure specimens sc2 sc3 and sc3 b exhibit flexural failure for specimens s uhpc 1 and sc3 b in addition to different volume fractions of steel fibers in the core uhpc other study parameters were designed consistently thus steel fibers in uhpc significantly affect the failure modes of the scs composite beams in addition as shown in fig 9 the widths of the critical cracks under the peak load for s uhpc 1 sc1 b sc2 sc3 and sc3 b are 55 10 7 7 and 4 mm respectively this indicates that the width of the critical crack decreases from 55 mm to 4 mm as the steel fiber volume fraction in uhpc increases from 0 to 2 this is because the bridging action of the steel fibers delays the development of critical cracks moreover slippage and separation between the steel plate and concrete can be observed in specimens sc2 sc3 and sc1 b and cannot be observed in specimens s uhpc 1 and sc3 b the failure of s uhpc 1 and sc3 b was due to the crushing of concrete in the compressive zone the failure of sc2 sc3 and sc1 b was due to the slippage between the steel plate and concrete which prevented further use of the bottom steel plate 3 3 3 load displacement curves and ductility fig 10 a shows the load displacement curves of the specimens the ultimate strengths of s uhpc 1 sc1 b and sc3 b are 505 420 and 623 kn respectively corresponding to the tensile strengths of the core concrete with 3 5 3 0 and 11 2 mpa for these specimens in addition to the core concrete other specimen parameters were designed consistently the results indicate that the ultimate strength of the beams increased with the tensile strength of concrete moreover with an increase in the volume fraction of steel fibers the tensile strength of uhpc increased thus steel fibers significantly affected the ultimate strength of the scs composite beams as shown in fig 10 a for sc2 sc3 and sc3 b with the same core concrete the ultimate strengths were 519 348 and 623 kn respectively corresponding to shear connection coefficients of 0 30 0 18 and 0 59 thus the arrangement of shear connectors also affected the ultimate strength of the specimens this is related to the slippage value between the steel plate and concrete as illustrated in fig 10 b however although the arrangements of shear connectors for s uhpc 1 sc1 b and sc3 b were designed consistently the slippage values between the steel plate and concrete of the specimens were different as shown in fig 10 b specimens s uhpc 1 and sc3 b exhibited a smaller slippage value as compared to sc1 b this is because the compressive strength of the core concrete for s uhpc 1 and sc3 b is higher than that for sc1 b which can provide a high bonding resistance at the interface of the steel plate and concrete this situation is consistent with the results of the push out tests as shown in fig 6 moreover the volume fraction of steel fibers affected the compressive strength of uhpc hence the influence of steel fibers on the interfacial performance of steel plates on concrete also required exploration the ductility coefficients of the specimens μ were also calculated according to eq 2 islam 1996 the detailed calculation method is shown in fig 11 2 μ δ max δ y where δ max is the displacement point d when the loading decreases to 85 of the ultimate strength at the descending part of the load displacement curves and δ y is the displacement at point e which can be calculated by obtaining an equivalent elastic stiffness corresponding to the secant stiffness at 75 of the peak load point a further with the equivalent elastic stiffness and peak load the displacement at point b can be obtained which equals the displacement at point e the calculation results are presented in fig 10 a and table 4 the ductility coefficients of specimens s uhpc 1 and sc1 b with shear failure were 1 456 and 1 420 respectively the ductility coefficients of specimens sc2 sc3 and sc3 b with flexural failure were 1 522 1 487 and 2 091 respectively it can be concluded that the ductility of specimens with flexural failure is higher than that with shear failure and that the ductility of specimens without slippage is higher than that with slippage moreover the ductility coefficient of specimen sc3 b is increased by 43 6 in comparison with specimen s uhpc 1 with an increase in the volume fraction of steel fibers from 0 to 2 overall the failure features of the specimens are summarized in table 4 the table shows that the yielding of the bottom steel plate is related to slippage between the steel plate and concrete which affects the composite action between the bottom steel plate and concrete further the contribution of the bottom steel plate to the ultimate strength is affected a large slippage indicates a weak composite action leading to incomplete use of the bottom steel plate furthermore steel fibers in uhpc can change the failure modes decrease the critical crack width and slippage and increase the ultimate strength and ductility of the s uhpc composite beams however the volume fractions of steel fibers in the test specimens were only 0 and 2 and the push out test specimens were only designed with different concrete materials to reveal the failure mechanism of the s uhpc composite beams with other volume fractions of steel fibers and study the effect of steel plate and shear connectors on the failure modes of push out tests the fe analysis was conducted 4 finite element fe analysis next the influence mechanism of steel fibers on the interfacial performance and structural behavior of the s uhpc composite beams was revealed and the failure modes of push out tests were investigated further this was achieved by developing fe models of the s uhpc composite beams with different volume fractions of steel fibers using abaqus software push out tests in this study were used to obtain the friction coefficient between the steel plate and concrete in the fe models static tests on the s uhpc composite beams in this study and in previous research lin et al 2018 2020 were adopted to validate the accuracy of the developed fe models 4 1 material models cross ties steel plates and shear studs were simulated using elasto plastic models for steel materials the poisson s ratio and the elastic modulus are 0 3 and 2 1011 pa respectively the core uhpc was simulated using the concrete damage plasticity model cdpm the poisson ratio and the elastic modulus were obtained by compressive tests the results are listed in table 5 other parameters including dilation angle eccentricity ratio of initial equibiaxial to uniaxial compressive yield stress and ratio of the second stress invariant on the tensile meridian to that on the compressive meridian were set to the referenced values in abaqus which are 30 0 1 1 16 and 0 667 respectively the compressive stress strain curves were obtained using the constitutive models gb 20010 2010 2014 guo et al 2017 which are determined by eq 3 3 y a x c 1 a 1 x c a a 1 0 x c 1 x c b x c 1 2 x c x c 1 where ε c r is the compressive strain corresponding to the peak loading ε c r 700 172 f c 10 6 compressive strain ε x c ε c r σ c is the compressive stress with σ c y f c and parameter a can be determined by eq 4 guo et al 2017 4 a 6 7264 f c 2460 9 17 2 f c 836 4 the tensile stress strain curves were obtained using the tensile tests in this study the parameters of the cdpm were calculated gb 50010 2010 2014 abaqus 2012 the results are listed in table 6 and table 7 4 2 detailed fe models 4 2 1 push out tests fig 12 a shows the detailed fe models and interaction set up of the push out specimens where the core concrete at the location of the shear studs is cut out the boundary conditions and applied loading were consistent with those of the push out tests to confirm both the accuracy of the simulation and the computer processing time a mesh convergence analysis was carried out as shown in fig 12 b finally a mesh size of 0 01 m 0 01 m 0 01 m was selected subsequently to obtain the friction coefficient between uhpc with different volume fractions of steel fibers and the steel plate the ultimate strength of the push out tests was simulated and compared with that of the simulation results further the friction coefficient between uhpc with different volume fractions of steel fibers and the steel plate could be adopted in the simulations of static tests on the s uhpc composite beams 4 2 2 static tests on s uhpc composite beams the fe model and interaction set up of the s uhpc composite beams are illustrated in fig 13 a where the friction coefficients of surface to surface contact are determined according to the simulation results of the push out tests the boundary conditions and applied loading were consistent with those of the static tests of the s uhpc composite beams for the interaction between shear studs and concrete surface to surface contact was adopted based on the simulation results of the push out tests as shown in fe1 to reduce the computer processing time embedded action was adopted to simulate the interaction between shear studs and concrete as shown in fe2 the load displacement curves of specimen sc1 b are illustrated in fig 13 b which indicates that the simulation results of the two simulation methods are similar and have a good fit with the test results thus embedded action fe2 was implemented herein to simulate the interaction between shear studs and concrete 4 3 determination of friction coefficient according to previous studies the friction coefficient between uhpc with different volume fractions of steel fibers and steel plate was determined to be 0 3 0 9 al ghamedy and willam 1990 yan et al 2016b by adjusting the friction coefficient in the fe models and comparing the ultimate strength of the push out specimens with the test results the accurate friction coefficients in the fe models were obtained as shown in fig 14 based on the friction coefficients static tests on the s uhpc composite beams could be simulated further 4 4 validations of developed fe models fig 15 illustrates the ratio of test results to simulation results of ultimate strength indicating that the ultimate strength of s uhpc composite beams can be simulated accurately by the developed fe models fig 16 shows the load displacement curves of s uhpc composite beams in this paper and by lin et al 2018 2020 which exhibits the yielding points of cross ties and bottom steel plate it indicates that the developed fe modes have a good fit with test results fig 17 shows the comparison for crack patterns of push out specimens and s uhpc composite beams between simulation results and test results as illustrated in fig 17 a the cracks form around the shear stud head shear stud bar and the shear stud root in the simulation results which is consistent with push out test results as illustrated in fig 17 b and fig 17 c crack patterns of simulation results are also consistent with that of test results indicating that failure modes of s uhpc composite beams with shear failure and flexural failure can both be predicted accurately 4 5 parametric study the failure modes of the push out specimens can reflect the actual interfacial performance in this study reaching the peak load of the specimens in the push out tests was due to the cracking of concrete a parametric study based on the validated fe models was carried out to explore other failure modes of the push out specimens and the effect of steel fibers on the structural behavior of the s uhpc composite beams the detailed study parameters are listed in table 8 further an analytical model for predicting the ultimate strength of the s uhpc composite beams was proposed moreover various simulation cases of the s uhpc composite beams were used to verify the accuracy of the analytical model 4 5 1 failure modes of push out specimens after the analysis of the simulation results it can be concluded that the failure modes of the push out specimens can be divided into three types 1 punching failure of steel plates corresponding to push out specimens with low strength steel plates 2 shear failure of shear connectors corresponding to push out specimens with low strength shear connectors and 3 cracking failure of concrete corresponding to push out specimens with low strength concrete as illustrated in fig 18 this result indicates the failure mechanism of the interfacial performance between the steel plate and concrete and can be applied in the analytical model for predicting the ultimate strength of the s uhpc composite beams 4 5 2 ultimate strength of s uhpc composite beams with different volume fractions of steel fibers uhpc with different volume fractions of steel fibers was adopted as the core concrete to explore the effect of steel fibers on the ultimate strength and failure modes of the s uhpc composite beams detailed parameters are listed in table 8 the simulation results of the ultimate strength and failure modes of the s uhpc composite beams are illustrated in fig 19 the results indicate that the ultimate strength of the s uhpc composite beams increased as the volume fraction of steel fibers in the core uhpc was increased the ultimate strength of s uhpc composite beams with 4 of steel fibers increased by 108 9 80 2 and 61 3 respectively in comparison with that of s uhpc composite beams without steel fibers and with 1 of steel fibers and 2 of steel fibers moreover as shown in fig 19 b the failure modes of the s uhpc composite beams changed from shear failure to flexural failure with an increase in the volume fraction of steel fibers in the core uhpc up to 2 thus increasing the volume fraction of steel fibers can increase the ultimate strength and change the failure modes of the s uhpc composite beams 5 discussions 5 1 failure mechanism and failure mode classifications of s uhpc composite beams on the basis of the results of the static tests and fe analysis the failure mechanism of the s uhpc composite beams was determined as demonstrated in fig 20 when loading was applied to the s uhpc composite beams the shear connectors transferred the interfacial shear force between the steel plate and concrete cracks formed in the shear span of the s uhpc composite beams with an increase in the loading the flexural crack developed into a critical crack for s uhpc composite beams with steel fibers which exhibited flexural failure the web shear crack developed into a critical diagonal crack for s uhpc composite beams without steel fibers which exhibited shear failure with an increase in the volume fraction of steel fibers up to 2 the failure modes of the s uhpc composite beams changed from shear failure to flexural failure moreover as the loading was increased the shear connectors deformed according to the simulation results in fig 18 three types of failure at the interface between the steel plate and concrete may appear punch failure of steel plates shear failure of shear connectors and cracking failure of core concrete as illustrated in fig 7 for the cracking failure of core concrete with an increase in the volume fraction of steel fibers in uhpc cracks near the shear connectors decreased finally the interfacial bond strength reached its ultimate bond strength when steel plates shear connectors and core concrete are designed sufficiently and efficient composite action is reached slippage cannot occur and the bottom steel plate yields the failure of the s uhpc composite beam was caused by the crushing of concrete this failure mode is defined as without slippage failure for example the case of specimens s uhpc 1 and sc3 b lin et al 2018 when steel plates shear connectors and core concrete are designed insufficiently and composite action is not efficient slippage appears and leads to failure of the s uhpc composite beam when the bottom steel plate yields the failure mode is defined as partial slippage failure for example the case of sc2 lin et al 2020 and sc1 b lin et al 2018 when the slippage value is large and the bottom steel plate does not yield the failure mode is defined as slippage failure for example the case of sc3 lin et al 2020 overall according to the critical crack patterns the failure modes of the s uhpc composite beams can be categorized into flexural failure and shear failure which are related to the volume fractions of steel fibers in uhpc moreover s uhpc composite beams with shear failure or flexural failure can both be categorized into slippage failure partial slippage failure and without slippage failure in terms of slippage value between the steel plate and concrete and yielding of the bottom steel plate being related to composite action 5 2 influence mechanism of steel fibers according to the test and simulation results it can be concluded that steel fibers in uhpc have an important effect on the failure modes critical crack width slippage ultimate strength and ductility of the s uhpc composite beams this is because the tensile strength of concrete in the tensile zone is weak when adopting uhpc with smaller volume fractions of steel fibers as core materials bridge action of steel fibers and the strain hardening behavior of uhpc can increase the tensile strength of concrete in the tensile zone and delay the appearance of critical cracks therefore the ultimate strength provided by the core uhpc in the s uhpc composite beams was improved the core uhpc can withstand more shear force which causes the failure of the s uhpc composite beams to be governed by the bending moment the failure modes changed from shear failure to flexural failure when the volume fraction of steel fibers was increased to 2 moreover with an increase in the compressive strength of the core concrete the slippage of the s uhpc composite beams decreased this is because the shear connectors deformed and the cracking of concrete near the shear studs appeared the high compressive strength of concrete and bridge action of steel fibers can delay the cracking of concrete near the shear studs furthermore bridging action and strain hardening behaviors of steel fibers can also delay the development of critical cracks therefore the critical crack width decreases and the ductility of the s uhpc composite beams increases thus the volume fractions of steel fibers should be considered when evaluating the slippage and ultimate strength of the s uhpc composite beams 6 theoretical analysis 6 1 cracking resistance of uhpc with different volume fractions of steel fibers to quantify the effects of volume fractions of steel fibers on structural behaviors of s uhpc composite beams the cracking resistance of uhpc was proposed a computational model of composite mechanics alwan et al 1991 was adopted to calculate the cracking resistance of uhpc with different volume fractions of steel fibers as shown in fig 21 it was assumed that uhpc was an isotropic material consisting of concrete and steel fibers the cracking resistance was provided by concrete and steel fibers thus the cracking resistance f cr can be calculated by eq 5 5 f cr β sf f t0 f sf where f t0 is the cracking resistance provided by plain uhpc f t0 3 5 mpa by tensile tests in this paper β sf is a parameter related to effects of steel fibers cecs 1992 f sf is the cracking resistance provided by steel fibers the cracking resistance provided by steel fibers was owing to bond strength between steel fibers and concrete as expressed by eq 6 6 f sf π d sf l sf τ sf n sf where d sf is the diameter of steel fibers l sf is the length of steel fibers τ sf is the bond stress between plain uhpc and steel fibers τ f 0 28 f c bs 8110 1997 n sf is the number of steel fibers n sf ϕ ρ sf π d sf 2 4 where ρ sf is the volume fractions of steel fibers ϕ is a reduced factor of steel fibers ϕ 0 41 gao and liu 1994 gao 2002 this was because uhpc had the properties of steel fibers for orientation the steel fibers which were distributed at the direction of concrete cracking can contribute to enhance the cracking resistance 6 2 composite action coefficient a composite action coefficient was deduced to calculate the accurate contribution of steel plates to ultimate strength of s uhpc composite beams considering the different failure modes of push out specimens fig 22 shows the force analysis at the interface between steel plate and core concrete when the interfacial shear force reached the ultimate bond force the slippage between uhpc and bottom steel plate appeared the slippage between concrete and top steel plate did not appear this paper considered the interfacial performance between concrete and bottom steel plate according to the previous researches by lin et al 2020 as shown in fig 22 the interfacial shear force f in can be deduced by eq 7 7 τ f in δ 0 b t 2 t 1 δ 0 b m 2 m 1 δ 0 h e b v 2 h e b where τ is the bond strength at the interface between steel plate and core concrete when v 2 reaches the ultimate shear force subjected by core concrete v c the slippage appears h e is the efficient section depth which equals to the distance between the center of the core concrete and top steel plate as illustrated in fig 22 the interfacial shear force is provided by shear connectors and interfacial friction force the interfacial friction force f f can be calculated by eq 8 8 f f μ 0 v c where v c equals ultimate strength provided by core concrete under the critical state of slippage μ 0 is the interfacial friction coefficient i e μ 0 0 7 aci 318 05 2005 as shown in fig 18 the failure modes of push out specimens include cracking failure of concrete punching failure of steel plate and shear failure of shear

ultimate tensile strength of a shear stud and f u 500 mpa α 0 2 h sc d 1 3 h sc d 4 or α 1 h sc d 4 h sc is the shear stud length the interfacial shear force provided by a shear connector f s can be determined as eq 12 12 f s min f c f sp f sc the composite action coefficient can be calculated according to the previous research lin et al 2020 as expressed by eq 13 13 η n n 0 where n 0 and n are the number of shear connectors under the critical state of slippage and under the real state respectively within the shear span finally according to simultaneous eqs 7 8 12 and 13 the composite action coefficient η can be obtained by eq 14 14 η f s n v c a h e μ 0 where a is the shear span length and η 1 6 3 ultimate strength of s uhpc composite beams 6 3 1 flexural ultimate strength in terms of the existing research lin et al 2020 the flexural ultimate strength of s uhpc composite beams can be calculated based on plane hypothesis by eq 15 15 m u m con η m sp where m c is the flexural ultimate strength provided by core concrete and m sp is the flexural ultimate strength provided by steel plates the detailed calculation methods are listed in table 9 where x 1 and x sf are the height of the core concrete in the compression zone and tensile zone respectively ξ is the reduction coefficient of yield strength of steel plate considering appropriately 80 of the total yield strength of the steel plate leng and song 2016 6 3 2 shear ultimate strength the modified compression field theory vecchio and collins 1986 was adopted to calculate the shear ultimate strength v u as illustrated in fig 23 which is determined by eq 16 16 v u v c η v sp v t where v c v sp and v t are the ultimate shear strength provided by the concrete steel plates and cross ties respectively it was assumed that cross ties yielded across the critical diagonal crack v c was obtained by modifying the aci 349 06 code 2006 considering the effects of steel fibers as expressed by eq 17 17 v c 0 17 f cr b d c where d c is the core concrete depth f cr is the proposed cracking resistance by eq 5 in this paper v t is determined by eq 18 aci 349 06 code 2006 18 v t a sv f y tie h tie l t tan α where h tie is the cross ties length a sv is the cross section area of the cross ties within the spacing l t α is the angle between the longitudinal direction and the critical diagonal crack assuming as 45 aci 349

criteria as expressed by eq 20 20 σ x 2 3 τ x 2 f y sp 2 the ultimate shear stress τ sp can be obtained for τ sp ξ f y sp 3 where ξ is the reduction coefficient of yield strength of steel plate considering appropriately 80 of the total yield strength of the steel plate leng and song 2016 6 4 validations of the proposed analytical models the results of the static tests lin et al 2018 2020 and fe simulations were used to compare with those of the proposed analytical models fig 24 shows the ratio of the ultimate strength of test results or fe simulation results to the predicted ultimate strength by analytical methods where the average value and cov are 1 01 and 0 06 respectively it implies that the analytical method agrees with the test results and simulation results existing codes were adopted to compare with the proposed analytical model including aci 349 06 2006 and jeag 4816 2009 codes fig 24 shows the ratio of the ultimate strength of test results or fe simulation results to the predicted ultimate strength by aci 349 06 2006 and jeag 4816 2009 codes where the average value and cov are 1 28 and 0 28 for jeag 4816 code and 1 16 and 0 27 for aci 349 06 code respectively it indicates that the ultimate strength of s uhpc composite beams is more accurately predicted by the proposed analytical models than that by the existing codes 7 conclusions this study adopts s uhpc composite structures as ice resistant structures in the arctic region the failure mechanism of s uhpc composite beams was revealed by considering the effect of steel fibers the detailed conclusions are summarized as follows 1 the tensile strength of uhpc with 4 of steel fibers increased by 449 as compared with that of uhpc without steel fibers owing to bridge action of steel fibers when the volume fraction of steel fibers was increased from 0 to 2 the compressive strength of uhpc increased when the volume fraction of steel fibers was increased from 2 to 4 the compressive strength of uhpc decreased owing to steel fiber clustering 2 the failure modes of the push out specimens could be divided into punching failure of steel plates shear failure of shear connectors and cracking failure of concrete the ultimate strength of the push out specimens increased with the compressive strength of concrete steel fibers could delay the development of cracks near the shear connectors 3 the friction coefficients between the steel plate and uhpc with different volume fractions of steel fibers were determined using fe simulations further fe models of the s uhpc composite beams were established and the simulation results were consistent with the static test results in terms of ultimate strength load displacement curves and failure modes 4 steel fibers in uhpc could change the failure modes and increase the ultimate strength of the s uhpc composite beams by increasing the tensile strength of the core concrete as the volume fraction of steel fibers was increased up to 2 the failure modes of the s uhpc composite beams changed from shear failure to flexural failure the ultimate strength of s uhpc composite beams with 4 of steel fibers increased by 108 9 as compared with that of s uhpc composite beams without steel fibers 5 the critical crack width decreased and the ductility of the s uhpc composite beams increased owing to the bridging action and strain hardening behavior of steel fibers the critical crack width under the peak load decreased from 55 mm to 4 mm and the ductility coefficient increased by 43 6 with an increase in the volume fraction of steel fibers from 0 to 2 6 methods for calculating the cracking resistance of uhpc with different volume fractions of steel fibers were proposed a composite action coefficient was deduced to determine the composite action between the steel plate and concrete finally considering the effect of steel fibers an analytical model for predicting the ultimate strength of the s uhpc composite beams was developed and compared

20599,a novel steel concrete steel composite structure constructed using ultra high performance concrete forming an s uhpc composite structure was applied in arctic offshore structures this type of structure can withstand ice pressure derived from impinging sheet ice in the arctic region in this study the failure mechanism of s uhpc composite beams was explored experimentally and analytically considering the effects of steel fibers in uhpc five groups of push out tests were conducted to reveal the interfacial performance between steel plates and uhpc static tests on s uhpc composite beams were performed to study their structural behaviors the results indicate that steel fibers have a significant effect on the failure modes slippage behavior and mechanical behavior of the s uhpc composite beams furthermore on the basis of test results finite element fe models of the push out tests and static tests of the s uhpc composite beams were developed and validated further a parametric study was carried out to summarize the failure modes of the push out tests and to explore the influence mechanism of steel fibers on the structural behavior of the s uhpc composite beams finally an analytical model for predicting the ultimate strength of s uhpc composite beams was proposed and compared with existing design codes keywords s uhpc composite beams steel fibers failure mechanism fe models analytical model arctic offshore structures 1 introduction the increasing global demand for oil and gas has reawakened the interest of researchers in the development of the arctic region under the harsh environmental conditions in the arctic one challenge for the offshore platform is that withstanding the extreme loads derived from moving ice yan et al 2016a as shown in fig 1 the loads imposed by ice are large and not evenly distributed palmer and croasdale 2012 which leads to the generation of high pressure zones hence localized out of plane loads are the key factors affecting the design of arctic offshore structures this type of structure should satisfy the requirements of high strength and ductility huang et al 2015 and yan et al 2016a adopted steel concrete steel scs composite structures as ice resistant walls in arctic region structures see fig 1 which could be applied at sea water depths of 10 100 m the concept of scs composite structures was originally proposed from a steel plate concrete structure in 1989 dai and liew 2010 the development of which had a significant process for double skin composite dsc structures and bi steel structures roberts et al 1996 therefore scs composite structures in the form of external and internal steel plates shear connectors and core concrete were developed in addition to ice resistant walls in the arctic region these structures have been successfully applied in nuclear power plants protective structures and oil containers yan et al 2016b lin et al 2018 slippage behaviors between steel plates and concrete in scs composite structures have attracted the attention of researchers previous studies have indicated that slippage between steel plates and concrete reduces the mechanical behavior of scs composite structures which can be improved by efficient composite action qin et al 2015 lin et al 2019a shear connectors can not only transfer the shear force but also provide composite action lin et al 2020 to confirm the efficient composite action many types of shear connectors rafiei et al 2015 yang et al 2016 jelovica et al 2016 shariati et al 2013 were used in scs composite structures numerous push out tests were performed to investigate the mechanical behavior of shear connectors yan et al 2014 ozturk et al 2019 wang et al 2019a in addition to traditional shear connectors such as shear studs and cross ties yan et al 2014 2020b adopted novel enhanced c channels and j hook connectors in scs composite structures to improve the interfacial performance between steel plates and concrete moreover a series of studies on experimental and numerical simulations of scs composite structures were carried out to analyze the failure modes and mechanical behavior lin et al 2018 2019a 2020 yan et al 2016a 2019 thereby several theoretical models for predicting the ultimate strength of scs composite structures were proposed and validated by existing test results and numerical simulation results however the above mentioned theoretical models focused on scs composite structures with ordinary concrete as core materials the type of core material also significantly affects the structural behavior of scs composite structures uhpc as a widely used cement based material has superior mechanical behaviors durability and ductility and can be adopted in scs composite structures to form s uhpc composite structures wang et al 2019b zhang et al 2020b s uhpc composite structures take advantage of steel structures and uhpc they can withstand harsh environments of the arctic region and have improved mechanical behaviors reduced maintenance costs and extended working life lin et al 2018 yan et al 2020a 2020b performed experimental and numerical simulations on s uhpc composite beams to reveal the influence of some study parameters on mechanical behaviors including steel plate thickness core concrete depth shear reinforcement ratio and types of shear connectors lin et al 2018 2020 carried out static shear tests to investigate the differences between scs composite beams and s uhpc composite beams all specimens were designed with identical study parameters including arrangements of steel plates and shear connectors except for the core materials scs composite beams concrete with a strength grade of c50 adopted as core materials exhibited shear failure but s uhpc composite beams uhpc adopted as core materials exhibited flexural failure this indicates that adopting uhpc as a core material can change the failure modes of scs composite structures however uhpc is a compounded cement based material the material properties of which are affected by many factors the steel fibers in uhpc lead to the strain hardening behavior of uhpc under tension uhpc with different volume fractions of steel fibers exhibits different material properties zhang et al 2020a hence by adopting uhpc with different volume fractions of steel fibers as core materials s uhpc composite structures would exhibit different structural behaviors it is important to reveal the effect of steel fibers in uhpc on the structural behavior of s uhpc composite structures however previous studies have mainly focused on the mechanical behavior of s uhpc composite structures few studies have been conducted to explore the effect of different volume fractions of steel fibers in uhpc on the failure mechanism of s uhpc composite structures therefore the relationship between the volume fraction of steel fibers in uhpc and the structural behavior of s uhpc composite structures should be studied further the influence mechanism of steel fibers on the structural behavior of s uhpc composite structures can be determined and the failure mechanism of s uhpc composite structures can be explored systematically in order to evaluate the ultimate strength more reasonably this study aims to explore the performance improvement of steel fibers in uhpc on ice resistant structures in the arctic region their failure mechanism under localized out of plane loads derived from moving ice was studied through static tests on s uhpc composite beams under shear loads moreover a series of tests were performed including tensile and compressive tests of uhpc with different volume fractions of steel fibers and push out tests of steel plates to uhpc furthermore on the basis of test results fe models were established and verified to explore the failure mechanism of s uhpc composite beams further the failure modes of the push out tests are summarized herein the influence of steel fibers on the failure modes slippage behavior and ultimate strength of s uhpc composite beams is discussed in detail finally an analytical model for predicting the ultimate strength of s uhpc composite beams is proposed and compared with existing codes 2 experimental investigations 2 1 test specimens and set up 2 1 1 tensile and compressive tests of uhpc tensile tests on uhpc with different volume fractions of steel fibers three specimens for each group were carried out a specialized fixture was designed to fix test specimens dog bone specimens 80 mm 30 mm 13 mm for the tensile region and the test set up for the tensile tests are shown in fig 2 two linear variable differential transformers lvdts were used to measure the deformations of the tensile specimens a force transducer was used to measure the applied loads of the tensile specimens displacement controlled loading was adopted to obtain the whole stress strain curves of the tensile tests moreover during the casting of the tensile specimens cube specimens 100 mm 100 mm 100 mm of uhpc with different volume fractions of steel fibers were prepared to measure the corresponding compressive strength the tensile and compressive specimens were stored at 20 3 c for 24 h before demolding subsequently the demolded specimens were exposed to curing conditions 20 3 c rh 95 for 28 days 2 1 2 push out tests to observe the failure modes of shear studs as shear connectors and the development of cracks near the shear studs more clearly a new set up for push out tests was designed as illustrated in fig 3 four shear studs a diameter of 10 mm length of 80 mm and yield strength of 400 mpa were used to connect h shaped steel 150 mm 150 mm 10 mm q345 and uhpc 100 mm 100 mm 150 mm of which every shear stud was cut in half from the middle the cut surface of the shear studs and the surface of uhpc were on the same plane to observe the failure modes of the shear studs and the development of cracks near the shear studs a detailed test specimen fabrication process is shown in fig 3 a force transducer was used to measure the applied loading displacement controlled loading was applied to the spacer at the top of h shaped steel to obtain the load slippage curves of the push out tests five groups of push out test specimens were prepared three specimens for each group the detailed test parameters of which are listed in table 1 moreover during the casting of the push out test specimens cube specimens 100 mm 100 mm 100 mm of uhpc with different volume fractions of steel fibers and c50 concrete were also prepared to measure the corresponding compressive strength 2 1 3 static tests of s uhpc composite beams a simply supported s uhpc composite beam s uhpc 1 without steel fibers was designed to perform the three point loading test as shown in fig 4 the fabrication procedures of the specimens included a welding shear studs to top and bottom steel plates b assembling top and bottom steel plates by welding cross ties c fabricating wood formworks and d casting of core concrete during the concrete casting process the top and bottom steel plates can be used as a part of the formworks wood formworks were placed on both sides of the specimens to avoid void formation between the concrete and the shear connectors owing to insufficient vibration during casting self compacting uhpc was mixed as the core concrete moreover three simply supported s uhpc composite beams with steel fibers sc2 sc3 and sc3 b and a simply supported scs composite beams sc1 b with ordinary concrete by lin et al 2018 2020 were adopted for comparison and summary all specimens were designed with dimensions of 304 mm width and 406 mm depth the steel plates were all designed with a thickness of 9 8 mm and a yield strength of 375 mpa the shear span to depth ratio was set to 2 5 thereby the structural behaviors of the s uhpc composite beams under shear loads were analyzed moreover cross ties can not only transfer the shear force from steel plate to core concrete but also have the contribution to composite action between steel plate and concrete lin et al 2020 thus to quantify the arrangements of shear connectors including cross ties and shear studs the shear connection coefficient was used yang et al 2016 as expressed in eq 1 1 k n sh n f where n sh is number of shear connectors in shear span n f a sp f y sp 0 7 a st f y s for a sp and a st are cross section area of steel plates and shear studs and f y sp f y s are yield strength of steel plates and shear studs respectively the detailed test parameters are listed table 2 a vertical concentrated load was applied by an electro hydraulic actuator with a capacity of 3000 kn displacement controlled loading was adopted to obtain the load displacement curves of the s uhpc composite beams displacement transducers were adopted to measure the displacement at the location of the loading point at the midspan supports and specimen end for measuring the slippage value between the steel plates and concrete strain gauges were arranged to measure the strain distribution of the steel plates crack patterns were obtained by capturing digital photographs at each loading step a detailed test set up is shown in fig 4 2 2 mixing of uhpc the mixed proportions were designed based on previous research by the authors lin et al 2019b and are listed in table 3 ordinary portland cement with a strength grade of 42 5 was adopted silica fume with a specific surface area of 24 000 m2 kg was used the particle diameters of fine and coarse silica sands were 109 212 μm and 212 380 μm respectively a polycarboxylate superplasticizer sp was used to adjust the fluidity of the mixtures straight steel fibers with a diameter of 0 18 mm length of 13 mm and tensile ultimate strength of 2800 mpa were adopted the volume fractions of the steel fibers were designed with 1 2 and 4 to explore their effects on the structural behaviors of the s uhpc composite beams although uhpc with 4 of steel fibers is rarely applied in practical engineering to explore the effect of steel fibers on the failure mechanism of the s uhpc composite beams this study designed uhpc with 4 of steel fibers to conduct detailed investigations moreover self compacting concrete with strength grade c50 was mixed as a control group in comparison with uhpc q345 steel was applied in steel plates shear studs and cross ties 3 test results 3 1 tensile and compressive test results fig 5 a shows the tensile stress strain curves of uhpc with different volume fractions of steel fibers for the uhpc without steel fibers and with 1 2 and 4 of steel fibers the tensile strengths were 3 5 4 5 11 2 and 19 2 mpa respectively and the strains when the stress decreased to 80 of the tensile strength were 0 000358 0 01 0 03 and 0 04 respectively compared with uhpc without steel fibers the tensile strength of uhpc with 4 of steel fibers increased by 449 this indicates that steel fibers can increase the deformation and ductility of uhpc this is owing to bridge action of steel fibers as illustrated in fig 5 a after the cracking of the tensile specimens the bond strength between the steel fibers and uhpc increased the ductility and tensile strength of the tensile specimens which exhibited strain hardening behaviors higher volume fractions of steel fibers indicate higher bond strength between steel fibers and uhpc thus the tensile strength and the tensile strain increased with an increase in the volume fraction of steel fibers in uhpc fig 5 b shows the compressive strength of uhpc with different volume fractions of steel fibers this figure demonstrates that steel fibers increase the compressive strength of uhpc with an increase in the volume fraction of steel fibers the compressive strength of uhpc increases this is attributed to the properties of steel fibers for orientation which leads to the formation of a steel fiber mesh skeleton this can delay the development of cracks in uhpc and enhance the compressive strength when the volume fraction of steel fibers increased to 4 the compressive strength of uhpc decreased in comparison with that of 2 of steel fibers this is because steel fibers cluster with high volume fractions to increase the voids in uhpc which reduces the contribution of steel fibers on the compressive strength thus the tensile strength of uhpc increases with the volume fraction of steel fibers the compressive strength of uhpc increases with an increase in the volume fraction of steel fibers from 1 to 2 but decreases with an increase in the volume fraction of steel fibers from 2 to 4 3 2 push out test results as illustrated in figs 5 b and 6 the peak load increases with the compressive strength of concrete when the load reaches the peak load cracks form around the shear studs after the peak load the shear studs exhibit a certain deformation and the load slippage curves exhibit ductility until the fracture of the shear studs thus the push out specimens reached the peak load because of the cracking of concrete moreover fig 7 shows the detailed failure modes of the push out specimens as illustrated in fig 7 a and 7 b when the shear studs connect h shaped steel with uhpc with 1 of steel fibers and without steel fibers cracks appear around the shear stud head and the shear stud bar in addition to the shear stud root as illustrated in fig 7 c when the shear studs connect h shaped steel with uhpc with 4 of steel fibers cracks appear only around the shear stud root thus steel fibers can delay the development of cracks near the shear studs 3 3 static tests on s uhpc composite beams 3 3 1 strain distribution of bottom steel plate fig 8 a shows the strain distribution of the bottom steel plates for specimen s uhpc 1 when the strain value reaches 2000 the bottom steel plate yields because the strain of the top steel plate does not reach the yield strain the test results for the strain of the top steel plate are not shown for s uhpc 1 the bottom steel plate yields at the midspan as shown in fig 8 b for specimen sc3 with a smaller shear connection coefficient 0 18 as compared with that of s uhpc1 0 59 the bottom steel plate does not yield as shown in fig 8 c for specimen sc2 with a large shear connection coefficient of 0 30 the bottom steel plate yields moreover according to test results lin et al 2018 for specimens sc1 b and sc3 b with a large shear connection coefficient of 0 59 the bottom steel plate also yields thus the configuration of the shear connectors significantly affects the yielding of the bottom steel plate which is related to the composite action between the bottom steel plate and concrete 3 3 2 crack patterns and crack width fig 9 shows the crack patterns and the width of the critical cracks of the specimens under the peak load specimens s uhpc 1 and sc1 b exhibit shear failure specimens sc2 sc3 and sc3 b exhibit flexural failure for specimens s uhpc 1 and sc3 b in addition to different volume fractions of steel fibers in the core uhpc other study parameters were designed consistently thus steel fibers in uhpc significantly affect the failure modes of the scs composite beams in addition as shown in fig 9 the widths of the critical cracks under the peak load for s uhpc 1 sc1 b sc2 sc3 and sc3 b are 55 10 7 7 and 4 mm respectively this indicates that the width of the critical crack decreases from 55 mm to 4 mm as the steel fiber volume fraction in uhpc increases from 0 to 2 this is because the bridging action of the steel fibers delays the development of critical cracks moreover slippage and separation between the steel plate and concrete can be observed in specimens sc2 sc3 and sc1 b and cannot be observed in specimens s uhpc 1 and sc3 b the failure of s uhpc 1 and sc3 b was due to the crushing of concrete in the compressive zone the failure of sc2 sc3 and sc1 b was due to the slippage between the steel plate and concrete which prevented further use of the bottom steel plate 3 3 3 load displacement curves and ductility fig 10 a shows the load displacement curves of the specimens the ultimate strengths of s uhpc 1 sc1 b and sc3 b are 505 420 and 623 kn respectively corresponding to the tensile strengths of the core concrete with 3 5 3 0 and 11 2 mpa for these specimens in addition to the core concrete other specimen parameters were designed consistently the results indicate that the ultimate strength of the beams increased with the tensile strength of concrete moreover with an increase in the volume fraction of steel fibers the tensile strength of uhpc increased thus steel fibers significantly affected the ultimate strength of the scs composite beams as shown in fig 10 a for sc2 sc3 and sc3 b with the same core concrete the ultimate strengths were 519 348 and 623 kn respectively corresponding to shear connection coefficients of 0 30 0 18 and 0 59 thus the arrangement of shear connectors also affected the ultimate strength of the specimens this is related to the slippage value between the steel plate and concrete as illustrated in fig 10 b however although the arrangements of shear connectors for s uhpc 1 sc1 b and sc3 b were designed consistently the slippage values between the steel plate and concrete of the specimens were different as shown in fig 10 b specimens s uhpc 1 and sc3 b exhibited a smaller slippage value as compared to sc1 b this is because the compressive strength of the core concrete for s uhpc 1 and sc3 b is higher than that for sc1 b which can provide a high bonding resistance at the interface of the steel plate and concrete this situation is consistent with the results of the push out tests as shown in fig 6 moreover the volume fraction of steel fibers affected the compressive strength of uhpc hence the influence of steel fibers on the interfacial performance of steel plates on concrete also required exploration the ductility coefficients of the specimens μ were also calculated according to eq 2 islam 1996 the detailed calculation method is shown in fig 11 2 μ δ max δ y where δ max is the displacement point d when the loading decreases to 85 of the ultimate strength at the descending part of the load displacement curves and δ y is the displacement at point e which can be calculated by obtaining an equivalent elastic stiffness corresponding to the secant stiffness at 75 of the peak load point a further with the equivalent elastic stiffness and peak load the displacement at point b can be obtained which equals the displacement at point e the calculation results are presented in fig 10 a and table 4 the ductility coefficients of specimens s uhpc 1 and sc1 b with shear failure were 1 456 and 1 420 respectively the ductility coefficients of specimens sc2 sc3 and sc3 b with flexural failure were 1 522 1 487 and 2 091 respectively it can be concluded that the ductility of specimens with flexural failure is higher than that with shear failure and that the ductility of specimens without slippage is higher than that with slippage moreover the ductility coefficient of specimen sc3 b is increased by 43 6 in comparison with specimen s uhpc 1 with an increase in the volume fraction of steel fibers from 0 to 2 overall the failure features of the specimens are summarized in table 4 the table shows that the yielding of the bottom steel plate is related to slippage between the steel plate and concrete which affects the composite action between the bottom steel plate and concrete further the contribution of the bottom steel plate to the ultimate strength is affected a large slippage indicates a weak composite action leading to incomplete use of the bottom steel plate furthermore steel fibers in uhpc can change the failure modes decrease the critical crack width and slippage and increase the ultimate strength and ductility of the s uhpc composite beams however the volume fractions of steel fibers in the test specimens were only 0 and 2 and the push out test specimens were only designed with different concrete materials to reveal the failure mechanism of the s uhpc composite beams with other volume fractions of steel fibers and study the effect of steel plate and shear connectors on the failure modes of push out tests the fe analysis was conducted 4 finite element fe analysis next the influence mechanism of steel fibers on the interfacial performance and structural behavior of the s uhpc composite beams was revealed and the failure modes of push out tests were investigated further this was achieved by developing fe models of the s uhpc composite beams with different volume fractions of steel fibers using abaqus software push out tests in this study were used to obtain the friction coefficient between the steel plate and concrete in the fe models static tests on the s uhpc composite beams in this study and in previous research lin et al 2018 2020 were adopted to validate the accuracy of the developed fe models 4 1 material models cross ties steel plates and shear studs were simulated using elasto plastic models for steel materials the poisson s ratio and the elastic modulus are 0 3 and 2 1011 pa respectively the core uhpc was simulated using the concrete damage plasticity model cdpm the poisson ratio and the elastic modulus were obtained by compressive tests the results are listed in table 5 other parameters including dilation angle eccentricity ratio of initial equibiaxial to uniaxial compressive yield stress and ratio of the second stress invariant on the tensile meridian to that on the compressive meridian were set to the referenced values in abaqus which are 30 0 1 1 16 and 0 667 respectively the compressive stress strain curves were obtained using the constitutive models gb 20010 2010 2014 guo et al 2017 which are determined by eq 3 3 y a x c 1 a 1 x c a a 1 0 x c 1 x c b x c 1 2 x c x c 1 where ε c r is the compressive strain corresponding to the peak loading ε c r 700 172 f c 10 6 compressive strain ε x c ε c r σ c is the compressive stress with σ c y f c and parameter a can be determined by eq 4 guo et al 2017 4 a 6 7264 f c 2460 9 17 2 f c 836 4 the tensile stress strain curves were obtained using the tensile tests in this study the parameters of the cdpm were calculated gb 50010 2010 2014 abaqus 2012 the results are listed in table 6 and table 7 4 2 detailed fe models 4 2 1 push out tests fig 12 a shows the detailed fe models and interaction set up of the push out specimens where the core concrete at the location of the shear studs is cut out the boundary conditions and applied loading were consistent with those of the push out tests to confirm both the accuracy of the simulation and the computer processing time a mesh convergence analysis was carried out as shown in fig 12 b finally a mesh size of 0 01 m 0 01 m 0 01 m was selected subsequently to obtain the friction coefficient between uhpc with different volume fractions of steel fibers and the steel plate the ultimate strength of the push out tests was simulated and compared with that of the simulation results further the friction coefficient between uhpc with different volume fractions of steel fibers and the steel plate could be adopted in the simulations of static tests on the s uhpc composite beams 4 2 2 static tests on s uhpc composite beams the fe model and interaction set up of the s uhpc composite beams are illustrated in fig 13 a where the friction coefficients of surface to surface contact are determined according to the simulation results of the push out tests the boundary conditions and applied loading were consistent with those of the static tests of the s uhpc composite beams for the interaction between shear studs and concrete surface to surface contact was adopted based on the simulation results of the push out tests as shown in fe1 to reduce the computer processing time embedded action was adopted to simulate the interaction between shear studs and concrete as shown in fe2 the load displacement curves of specimen sc1 b are illustrated in fig 13 b which indicates that the simulation results of the two simulation methods are similar and have a good fit with the test results thus embedded action fe2 was implemented herein to simulate the interaction between shear studs and concrete 4 3 determination of friction coefficient according to previous studies the friction coefficient between uhpc with different volume fractions of steel fibers and steel plate was determined to be 0 3 0 9 al ghamedy and willam 1990 yan et al 2016b by adjusting the friction coefficient in the fe models and comparing the ultimate strength of the push out specimens with the test results the accurate friction coefficients in the fe models were obtained as shown in fig 14 based on the friction coefficients static tests on the s uhpc composite beams could be simulated further 4 4 validations of developed fe models fig 15 illustrates the ratio of test results to simulation results of ultimate strength indicating that the ultimate strength of s uhpc composite beams can be simulated accurately by the developed fe models fig 16 shows the load displacement curves of s uhpc composite beams in this paper and by lin et al 2018 2020 which exhibits the yielding points of cross ties and bottom steel plate it indicates that the developed fe modes have a good fit with test results fig 17 shows the comparison for crack patterns of push out specimens and s uhpc composite beams between simulation results and test results as illustrated in fig 17 a the cracks form around the shear stud head shear stud bar and the shear stud root in the simulation results which is consistent with push out test results as illustrated in fig 17 b and fig 17 c crack patterns of simulation results are also consistent with that of test results indicating that failure modes of s uhpc composite beams with shear failure and flexural failure can both be predicted accurately 4 5 parametric study the failure modes of the push out specimens can reflect the actual interfacial performance in this study reaching the peak load of the specimens in the push out tests was due to the cracking of concrete a parametric study based on the validated fe models was carried out to explore other failure modes of the push out specimens and the effect of steel fibers on the structural behavior of the s uhpc composite beams the detailed study parameters are listed in table 8 further an analytical model for predicting the ultimate strength of the s uhpc composite beams was proposed moreover various simulation cases of the s uhpc composite beams were used to verify the accuracy of the analytical model 4 5 1 failure modes of push out specimens after the analysis of the simulation results it can be concluded that the failure modes of the push out specimens can be divided into three types 1 punching failure of steel plates corresponding to push out specimens with low strength steel plates 2 shear failure of shear connectors corresponding to push out specimens with low strength shear connectors and 3 cracking failure of concrete corresponding to push out specimens with low strength concrete as illustrated in fig 18 this result indicates the failure mechanism of the interfacial performance between the steel plate and concrete and can be applied in the analytical model for predicting the ultimate strength of the s uhpc composite beams 4 5 2 ultimate strength of s uhpc composite beams with different volume fractions of steel fibers uhpc with different volume fractions of steel fibers was adopted as the core concrete to explore the effect of steel fibers on the ultimate strength and failure modes of the s uhpc composite beams detailed parameters are listed in table 8 the simulation results of the ultimate strength and failure modes of the s uhpc composite beams are illustrated in fig 19 the results indicate that the ultimate strength of the s uhpc composite beams increased as the volume fraction of steel fibers in the core uhpc was increased the ultimate strength of s uhpc composite beams with 4 of steel fibers increased by 108 9 80 2 and 61 3 respectively in comparison with that of s uhpc composite beams without steel fibers and with 1 of steel fibers and 2 of steel fibers moreover as shown in fig 19 b the failure modes of the s uhpc composite beams changed from shear failure to flexural failure with an increase in the volume fraction of steel fibers in the core uhpc up to 2 thus increasing the volume fraction of steel fibers can increase the ultimate strength and change the failure modes of the s uhpc composite beams 5 discussions 5 1 failure mechanism and failure mode classifications of s uhpc composite beams on the basis of the results of the static tests and fe analysis the failure mechanism of the s uhpc composite beams was determined as demonstrated in fig 20 when loading was applied to the s uhpc composite beams the shear connectors transferred the interfacial shear force between the steel plate and concrete cracks formed in the shear span of the s uhpc composite beams with an increase in the loading the flexural crack developed into a critical crack for s uhpc composite beams with steel fibers which exhibited flexural failure the web shear crack developed into a critical diagonal crack for s uhpc composite beams without steel fibers which exhibited shear failure with an increase in the volume fraction of steel fibers up to 2 the failure modes of the s uhpc composite beams changed from shear failure to flexural failure moreover as the loading was increased the shear connectors deformed according to the simulation results in fig 18 three types of failure at the interface between the steel plate and concrete may appear punch failure of steel plates shear failure of shear connectors and cracking failure of core concrete as illustrated in fig 7 for the cracking failure of core concrete with an increase in the volume fraction of steel fibers in uhpc cracks near the shear connectors decreased finally the interfacial bond strength reached its ultimate bond strength when steel plates shear connectors and core concrete are designed sufficiently and efficient composite action is reached slippage cannot occur and the bottom steel plate yields the failure of the s uhpc composite beam was caused by the crushing of concrete this failure mode is defined as without slippage failure for example the case of specimens s uhpc 1 and sc3 b lin et al 2018 when steel plates shear connectors and core concrete are designed insufficiently and composite action is not efficient slippage appears and leads to failure of the s uhpc composite beam when the bottom steel plate yields the failure mode is defined as partial slippage failure for example the case of sc2 lin et al 2020 and sc1 b lin et al 2018 when the slippage value is large and the bottom steel plate does not yield the failure mode is defined as slippage failure for example the case of sc3 lin et al 2020 overall according to the critical crack patterns the failure modes of the s uhpc composite beams can be categorized into flexural failure and shear failure which are related to the volume fractions of steel fibers in uhpc moreover s uhpc composite beams with shear failure or flexural failure can both be categorized into slippage failure partial slippage failure and without slippage failure in terms of slippage value between the steel plate and concrete and yielding of the bottom steel plate being related to composite action 5 2 influence mechanism of steel fibers according to the test and simulation results it can be concluded that steel fibers in uhpc have an important effect on the failure modes critical crack width slippage ultimate strength and ductility of the s uhpc composite beams this is because the tensile strength of concrete in the tensile zone is weak when adopting uhpc with smaller volume fractions of steel fibers as core materials bridge action of steel fibers and the strain hardening behavior of uhpc can increase the tensile strength of concrete in the tensile zone and delay the appearance of critical cracks therefore the ultimate strength provided by the core uhpc in the s uhpc composite beams was improved the core uhpc can withstand more shear force which causes the failure of the s uhpc composite beams to be governed by the bending moment the failure modes changed from shear failure to flexural failure when the volume fraction of steel fibers was increased to 2 moreover with an increase in the compressive strength of the core concrete the slippage of the s uhpc composite beams decreased this is because the shear connectors deformed and the cracking of concrete near the shear studs appeared the high compressive strength of concrete and bridge action of steel fibers can delay the cracking of concrete near the shear studs furthermore bridging action and strain hardening behaviors of steel fibers can also delay the development of critical cracks therefore the critical crack width decreases and the ductility of the s uhpc composite beams increases thus the volume fractions of steel fibers should be considered when evaluating the slippage and ultimate strength of the s uhpc composite beams 6 theoretical analysis 6 1 cracking resistance of uhpc with different volume fractions of steel fibers to quantify the effects of volume fractions of steel fibers on structural behaviors of s uhpc composite beams the cracking resistance of uhpc was proposed a computational model of composite mechanics alwan et al 1991 was adopted to calculate the cracking resistance of uhpc with different volume fractions of steel fibers as shown in fig 21 it was assumed that uhpc was an isotropic material consisting of concrete and steel fibers the cracking resistance was provided by concrete and steel fibers thus the cracking resistance f cr can be calculated by eq 5 5 f cr β sf f t0 f sf where f t0 is the cracking resistance provided by plain uhpc f t0 3 5 mpa by tensile tests in this paper β sf is a parameter related to effects of steel fibers cecs 1992 f sf is the cracking resistance provided by steel fibers the cracking resistance provided by steel fibers was owing to bond strength between steel fibers and concrete as expressed by eq 6 6 f sf π d sf l sf τ sf n sf where d sf is the diameter of steel fibers l sf is the length of steel fibers τ sf is the bond stress between plain uhpc and steel fibers τ f 0 28 f c bs 8110 1997 n sf is the number of steel fibers n sf ϕ ρ sf π d sf 2 4 where ρ sf is the volume fractions of steel fibers ϕ is a reduced factor of steel fibers ϕ 0 41 gao and liu 1994 gao 2002 this was because uhpc had the properties of steel fibers for orientation the steel fibers which were distributed at the direction of concrete cracking can contribute to enhance the cracking resistance 6 2 composite action coefficient a composite action coefficient was deduced to calculate the accurate contribution of steel plates to ultimate strength of s uhpc composite beams considering the different failure modes of push out specimens fig 22 shows the force analysis at the interface between steel plate and core concrete when the interfacial shear force reached the ultimate bond force the slippage between uhpc and bottom steel plate appeared the slippage between concrete and top steel plate did not appear this paper considered the interfacial performance between concrete and bottom steel plate according to the previous researches by lin et al 2020 as shown in fig 22 the interfacial shear force f in can be deduced by eq 7 7 τ f in δ 0 b t 2 t 1 δ 0 b m 2 m 1 δ 0 h e b v 2 h e b where τ is the bond strength at the interface between steel plate and core concrete when v 2 reaches the ultimate shear force subjected by core concrete v c the slippage appears h e is the efficient section depth which equals to the distance between the center of the core concrete and top steel plate as illustrated in fig 22 the interfacial shear force is provided by shear connectors and interfacial friction force the interfacial friction force f f can be calculated by eq 8 8 f f μ 0 v c where v c equals ultimate strength provided by core concrete under the critical state of slippage μ 0 is the interfacial friction coefficient i e μ 0 0 7 aci 318 05 2005 as shown in fig 18 the failure modes of push out specimens include cracking failure of concrete punching failure of steel plate and shear failure of shear connectors for the shear connectors with cracking failure of concrete according to aci 349 06 code 2006 the calculation formula is expressed by eq 9 9 f c 0 333 f c a n γ c where f c is the compressive strength of core concrete which should consider the effects of steel fibers a n is an area influenced by the spacing of shear studs a n min π h s 2 1 d h s s l s w γ c is the partial factor for concrete and equals to 1 5 according to eurocode 2 2004 for the shear connectors with punching failure of steel plate the punching shear strength of the steel plate eurocode 3 2005 can be determined by eq 10 10 f sp π d t f y 3 γ s where γ s is the partial factor for steel plates and equals 1 0 eurocode 3 2005 for the shear connectors with shear failure of shear connectors the ultimate strength of the shear studs can be determined by eq 11 eurocode 4 2004 11 f sc 0 29 α d s 2 f c e c γ v 0 8 f u π d s 2 4 γ v where γ v is the partial factor and its value is set to 1 0 f u is the ultimate tensile strength of a shear stud and f u 500 mpa α 0 2 h sc d 1 3 h sc d 4 or α 1 h sc d 4 h sc is the shear stud length the interfacial shear force provided by a shear connector f s can be determined as eq 12 12 f s min f c f sp f sc the composite action coefficient can be calculated according to the previous research lin et al 2020 as expressed by eq 13 13 η n n 0 where n 0 and n are the number of shear connectors under the critical state of slippage and under the real state respectively within the shear span finally according to simultaneous eqs 7 8 12 and 13 the composite action coefficient η can be obtained by eq 14 14 η f s n v c a h e μ 0 where a is the shear span length and η 1 6 3 ultimate strength of s uhpc composite beams 6 3 1 flexural ultimate strength in terms of the existing research lin et al 2020 the flexural ultimate strength of s uhpc composite beams can be calculated based on plane hypothesis by eq 15 15 m u m con η m sp where m c is the flexural ultimate strength provided by core concrete and m sp is the flexural ultimate strength provided by steel plates the detailed calculation methods are listed in table 9 where x 1 and x sf are the height

the steel plate leng and song 2016 6 3 2 shear ultimate strength the modified compression field theory vecchio and collins 1986 was adopted to calculate the shear ultimate strength v u as illustrated in fig 23 which is determined by eq 16 16 v u v c η v sp v t where v c v sp and v t are the ultimate shear strength provided by the concrete steel plates and cross ties respectively it was assumed that cross ties yielded across the critical diagonal crack v c was obtained by modifying the aci 349 06 code 2006 considering the effects of steel fibers as expressed by eq 17 17 v c 0 17 f cr b d c where d c is the core concrete depth f cr is the proposed cracking resistance by eq 5 in this paper v t is determined by eq 18 aci 349 06 code 2006 18 v t a sv f y tie h tie l t tan α where h tie is

considering appropriately 80 of the total yield strength of the steel plate leng and song 2016 6 4 validations of the proposed analytical models the results of the static tests lin et al 2018 2020 and fe simulations were used to compare with those of the proposed analytical models fig 24 shows the ratio of the ultimate strength of test results or fe simulation results to the predicted ultimate strength by analytical methods where the average value and cov are 1 01 and 0 06 respectively it implies that the analytical method agrees with the test results and simulation results existing codes were adopted to compare with the proposed analytical model including aci 349 06 2006 and jeag 4816 2009 codes fig 24 shows the ratio of the ultimate strength of test results or fe simulation results to the predicted ultimate strength by aci 349 06 2006 and jeag 4816 2009 codes where the average value and cov are 1 28 and 0 28 for jeag 4816 code and 1 16 and 0 27 for aci 349 06 code respectively it indicates that the ultimate strength of s uhpc composite beams is more accurately predicted by the proposed analytical models than that by the existing codes 7 conclusions this study adopts s uhpc composite structures as ice resistant structures in the arctic region the failure mechanism of s uhpc composite beams was revealed by considering the effect of steel fibers the detailed conclusions are summarized as follows 1 the tensile strength of uhpc with 4 of steel fibers increased by 449 as compared with that of uhpc without steel fibers owing to bridge action of steel fibers when the volume fraction of steel fibers was increased from 0 to 2 the compressive strength of uhpc increased when the volume fraction of steel fibers was increased from 2 to 4 the compressive strength of uhpc decreased owing to steel fiber clustering 2 the failure modes of the push out specimens could be divided into punching failure of steel plates shear failure of shear connectors and cracking failure of concrete the ultimate strength of the push out specimens increased with the compressive strength of concrete steel fibers could delay the development of cracks near the shear connectors 3 the friction coefficients between the steel plate and uhpc with different volume fractions of steel fibers were determined using fe simulations further fe models of the s uhpc composite beams were established and the simulation results were consistent with the static test results in terms of ultimate strength load displacement curves and failure modes 4 steel fibers in uhpc could change the failure modes and increase the ultimate strength of the s uhpc composite beams by increasing the tensile strength of the core concrete as the volume fraction of steel fibers was increased up to 2 the failure modes of the s uhpc composite beams changed from shear failure to flexural failure the ultimate strength of s uhpc composite beams with 4 of steel fibers increased by 108 9 as compared with that of s uhpc composite beams without steel fibers 5 the critical crack width decreased and the ductility of the s uhpc composite beams increased owing to the bridging action and strain hardening behavior of steel fibers the critical crack width under the peak load decreased from 55 mm to 4 mm and the ductility coefficient increased by 43 6 with an increase in the volume fraction of steel fibers from 0 to 2 6 methods for calculating the cracking resistance of uhpc with different volume fractions of steel fibers were proposed a composite action coefficient was deduced to determine the composite action between the steel plate and concrete finally considering the effect of steel fibers an analytical model for predicting the ultimate strength of the s uhpc composite beams was developed and compared with existing design codes the proposed analytical methods were more accurate and agreed well with the test and fe analysis results credit authorship contribution statement youzhu lin
