25000,urban ecosystem services ues are the benefits supplied by nature to people in urban systems the supply of ues is threatened because of widespread increasing urbanisation modelling scenarios that optimise ues supplies can support sustainable urban planning processes ues are linked to land use land cover lulc types which enables the optimisation of ues supply to be based on lulc configurations however current modelling approaches are not suitably adapted to the link between ues optimisation and lulc configurations one possibility to target ues optimal supply is to use mathematical optimisation methods the objective of this study is to test the combined use of participatory modelling and optimisation models to deliver spatial solutions that maximise ues by optimal urban lulc configurations an integrated model is built using a multi objective integer linear programming moilp model along with lulc performance scores to maximise a set of locally supplied ues this is illustrated with a case study of lisbon portugal involving the participation of key stakeholders to validate and benchmark the selection of optimisation constraints results show land optimally allocated to land cover types with high ues functions combined with a reshuffling and densification of residential land thus the new lulc configuration increased multiple ues supplies while maintaining a level of housing capacity the model shows clear implications of increasing land cover types whose ues functions are high compared to most other lulc classes moreover incorporating stakeholder participatory modelling offers a transdisciplinary and interdisciplinary scientific contribution intersecting mathematical optimisation ues and urban planning keywords ecosystem services participatory modelling spatial optimisation biodiversity 1 introduction in 2015 the united nations published its agenda for a sustainable development of our society undp 2015 this agenda is composed of 17 sustainability goals of which goal 11 targets sustainable cities and goals 6 13 14 and 15 target the preservation of biodiversity and the provided ecosystem services folke et al 2016 ecosystem services are the contributions from natural capital that enhance human well being boyd and banzhaf 2007 haines young and potschin young 2018 while ecosystem services are often provided by large natural ecosystems mountains forests rivers etc they are also supplied in urban ecosystems calderón contreras and quiroz rosas 2017 luederitz et al 2015 the key challenge is to enhance the supply of urban ecosystem services ues which are constrained by the concentration of a growing population in urban systems tobias 2012 the goal of this study is to understand the potential for alternative land use land cover lulc arrangements in cities which can maximise the local supply of ecosystem services in this study we consider the ues that are supplied locally within the urban system as the supply of ues is linked to the type of urban lulc burkhard et al 2009 jin et al 2017 kontogianni et al 2010 adequate urban planning approaches should therefore be deployed to address the abovementioned challenges on top of this the supply of multiple ues must be considered to support a more holistic and more resilient configuration of the lulc seppelt et al 2013 accordingly the numerous potential lulc configurations and economic and environmental constraints that must be considered reid et al 2005 make the task of reaching an adequate let alone optimal solution very complex herzig et al 2014 kaim et al 2018 this paper tackles this goal by developing a model to identify spatially specific optimal ues supply according to different lulc configurations this model can be useful to support the draft of urban plans and strategies that consider multiple potentially conflicting constraints in this regard several optimisation approaches targeting ecosystem services have already been deployed mostly for the improved management of agricultural landscapes kaim et al 2018 and forests castro et al 2018 chen et al 2016 due to the multiple objectives and non linear relations to consider models based on heuristic algorithms are frequently proposed as they allow for reasonable resolution time and limited computational memory usage bierlaire 2015 heuristic methods have been applied to optimising multiple ecosystem services based on lulc cao et al 2012 haque and asami 2014 hu et al 2014 li et al 2018 masoomi et al 2013 verhagen et al 2018 however heuristic approaches do not necessarily lead to globally optimal solutions groot et al 2018 moilanen 2008 global optima can however be determined using mathematical optimisation modelling mathematical optimisation is a branch of applied mathematics that uses rigorous methods to determine the best solution to quantitatively defined complex problems snyman and wilke 2018 such as the supply of ecosystem services epa 2012 mathematical optimisation methods have been applied to ecosystem services both with single wang et al 2014 xue and ma 2018 and multiple objective problems there are various ways of dealing with multi objective optimisation problems such as objective weighting and epsilon constraints herzig et al 2014 a multi objective linear programming model using epsilon constraints was developed to optimise rural lulc configurations and thereby associated ecosystem services herzig et al 2014 this model considered constraints of maximal lulc allocation to avoid monocultures and of performance to ensure certain levels of multiple ecosystem services supply in new zealand herzig et al 2014 and south korea herzig et al 2018 moreover a multi objective mixed integer linear programming model targeting fire hazard reduction in forests was introduced by schroder et al 2016 which integrated budget constraints and area limitations with the exception of pribadi and xu 2017 mathematical optimisation of ecosystem services supplied in urban areas have so far not been addressed pribadi and xu 2017 proposed a mixed integer non linear programming model constrained by minimal targets of new green spaces and the impracticability of using high density settlements areas for such lulc conversions in these optimisation methods various authors included economic aspects in their models however they all focused specifically on operating costs or revenues stemming from the different land uses the above literature synthesis reveals two relevant shortcomings 1 lulc conversion costs have so far not been comprehensively integrated into models and 2 urban level mathematical optimisation still needs to be developed because of the complex ecosystem demands and competition between artificial and natural lulc functions in cities therefore the main scientific contribution of this work is the novel development of an ues optimisation method based on a multi objective integer linear programming moilp model formulation combined with a qualitative economic assessment of lulc conversion costs accordingly a participatory modelling approach is proposed to characterise these conversion costs more specifically we deliberated with relevant experts to understand local context via surveys participatory approaches which we borrow from social sciences is a term for including inputs from stakeholders such as community members or other researchers to consider a range of viewpoints this can be used to reach consensus when problems are wicked van den belt 2004 while realistic lulc conversion economics should consider land acquisition costs revenue losses direct costs of conversion and maintenance herzig et al 2014 and transaction costs such a detailed quantitative approach implies considerable effort in data acquisition reflecting specific local conditions gourevitch et al 2016 hence with the purpose of developing a proof of concept integrated model a qualitative valuation approach based on expert opinion is presented which aims to reflect the potential economic effort related to lulc change this approach allowed us to identify areas that are perceived as unlikely to undergo lulc change in addition there are areas that are legally protected for their heritage value or ecological role where lulc changes are not permitted acknowledging these legally protected areas is more realistic and aids to inform more plausible futures however it constrains optimal solutions and investigation of less realistic futures which could be also relevant to explore more radical alternatives as a consequence together with participatory modelling approaches we have also worked with the development of different scenarios optimisation models are a common technique to support the development of scenarios including urban developments börjeson et al 2006 scenarios can be conceptualised as consistent and plausible pictures of possible future states even if they are unlikely eea 2009 2011 börjeson et al 2006 defined three types of scenarios predictive normative and explorative their characteristics and parallelisms the first type investigates what will happen under likely conditions or if we alter them the second type looks at how a specific target could be reached the third one explores situations that are regarded as possible to happen if we act in a certain way the first and third types have some similarities but explorative scenarios are more adequate to investigate the consequences of alternative developments with respect to strategic issues and focus on long time horizons since deep changes are usually required moreover unlike predictive scenarios explorative scenarios are often interested in the investigation of visionary or unlikely options as possible future states eea 2011 the purpose of this type of scenarios is less focused on the plausibility and more on to obtain a further understanding on alternatives to trigger discussions or ideas of interested parties such as ngos policy analysists or researchers börjeson et al 2006 eea 2011 the following section describes the methodological steps of the modelling approach which is later tested in a case study involving the city of lisbon portugal in section 3 the case study poses two scenarios one predictive and one explorative the predictive scenario considers known political lulc constraints while the explorative scenario disregards those political constraints the results from these two scenarios are compared and contrasted in section 4 these developments are then discussed with respect to relevant state of the art literature in section 5 and conclusions are drawn in the last section 2 methodology 2 1 model structure the structure equations constraints and assumptions are presented for an ues optimiser based on lulc fig 1 shows the structure of the integrated multi objective optimisation model for urban areas this is formulated as a moilp model whose objective is to maximise ues supplies through land use change while considering 1 ues constraints and 2 socio economic constraints ues constraints reflect the requirements that at city level the considered ecosystem services should not be degraded compared to the as is situation moreover considering that ues are enjoyed at local level lulc changes should not lead to deterioration of ues associated with local recreation the cultural recreation ues is selected here to represent the importance of nature based urban recreation supplied locally cortinovis et al 2018 which can be more relevant to urban residents than the ecological functions relating local supplies of provisioning and regulating ues camps calvet et al 2016 the economic constraints instead reflect budget limitations and the inappropriateness of changing areas with relevant infrastructures sets and their elements are represented in bold parameters are represented in normal font while dependent and independent variables are indicated with italics the constraints imposed on the model are defined in sections 2 2 2 6 three types of sets were considered in this problem es the set of ecosystem services es being modelled e g flood protection local climate regulation biodiversity p the set of parcels representing geographical areas p1 p2 pp here delimited as grid cells l the set of lulc classes l e g urban park industries transport the following parameters were required as fixed inputs to the model a p area of parcel p ha i e s l specific impact of an es related to a lulc l ha 1 x e s p 0 the initial value of an es in a parcel p qualitative c l 0 l the conversion cost from land type l0 to land type l qualitative c constraining factor limiting change costs at parcel level qualitative b constraining factor limiting change costs at urban level qualitative the decision variables to be optimised are x e s p the variable quantifying the value of an ecosystem service es in a parcel p y p l the binary variable allocating 1 or not 0 an optimised land use l to parcel p 0 or 1 2 2 objective function and variable definition the objective of the model was to maximise one ecosystem service type es in a landscape composed of parcels p 1 max p i n p x e s p the performance score x es p of an ecosystem service es in a parcel p with an area ap was quantified as follows 2 x e s p a p l i n l i e s l y p

be selected per cell which is enforced by the following equation 3 l i n l y p l 1 p i n p 2 3 ecosystem service constraints when dealing with the constraints related to the supply of ues we assumed that the selection of new lulc should not lead to a loss of ecosystem service supplying potential x e s p 0 in the whole region 4 p i n p a p l i n l i e s l y p l p i n p x e s p 0 e s i n e s

lulc type l in parcel p the variable y p l needs to reflect conversion costs in this work the qualitative approach described in section 3 4 was used accordingly cost constraints were implemented twice

use l0 to a lulc type l and c the constraining factor limiting the conversion cost this approach can help to reflect the constraint that certain lulc e g industries or transport should not be considered as the change would imply the removal of large and or relevant infrastructures see supplementary information conversion cost scores furthermore lulc changes were also constrained by limited budget b at city scale in the quantitative assessment underpinning the proposed model this represented the willingness to invest more or less in the overall improvement of ues supply 7 p i n p a p l i

ecosystem services being maximised the optimisation of these services implies a multi objective optimisation approach while several methods to multi objective optimisation are used in the literature an epsilon constraints approach was used in this work as it helped to preserve the moilp model while reflecting the priorities of the users in their decision process the epsilon constraints approach ranks the multiple objectives the highest rank is optimised first this result then becomes an addition constraint in the subsequent optimisation of the next highest rank and so on for each objective the number of epsilon constraints is therefore one fewer than the number of objectives in the context of multiple ecosystem services the multiple ecosystem services were benchmarked by importance as was also the case in the work of herzig et al 2014 the most relevant es was then used for the objective function of the first optimisation run see further details on the selection of relevant ues in section 3 2 in a second run the second most important es was used as objective function while the value of the first es x e s 1 r u n 1 was used as constrain in the model such as 9 x e s 1 r u n 2 x e s 1 r u n 1 3 case study lisbon 3 1 scope and system boundary the implementation of the method described in section 2 is illustrated through a case study of the city of lisbon portugal we took the 2018 corine land cover clc raster map from copernicus land monitoring https land copernicus eu pan european corine land cover clc2018 which has a spatial resolution of 100 m and a minimum mapping unit of 25 ha lulc are classified using the clc land classes classification system https www eea europa eu publications cor0 landcover within this study area there are 14 unique lulc classes over an area of 8562 ha see fig 2 each parcel grid cell is 1 ha in area and is characterised by one of the 14 lulc classes 3 2 selected ecosystem services to determine which ues were most relevant for lisbon we conducted a participatory workshop with representatives of three lisbon stakeholder groups belonging to the lisbon municipality câmara municipal de lisboa the directorate general for the territorial development direcção geral do território and the university of lisbon on 16th of march 2018 a main goal of the workshop was to benchmark the importance of selected ues with respect to addressing urban challenges more specifically respondents were asked to benchmark urban challenges relating to ues using categorical interval scales of high importance 3 medium importance 2 and low importance 1 the average results showed that flood protection local climate regulation and biodiversity were the three most important ues accordingly these three ues were selected in order of their importance for use in the optimisation model see table 1 3 3 ues indicators the lulc relevance functions described by burkhard et al 2009 and burkhard et al 2014 were used as proxy indicators in lieu of measured ues values the ecosystem services matrix approach developed by burkhard et al 2009 and burkhard kandziora hou and müller 2014 links lulc to ecosystem services relevance on a normalised linear scale for the full matrix see supplementary information performance scores no relevance is given by 0 and very high relevance is given by 5 these scores do not quantify the physical flows so the results are limited to the maximisation of relevance rather than the maximisation of physical quantities or flows 3 4 economic constraints to understand the feasibility of lulc conversions an expert survey was conducted online between september and october 2018 the survey used the delphi method with two rounds to reach consensus on which lulc conversions should be considered in the model constraints the survey invited 30 urban systems and land economics experts to rank the elasticity of lulc demand from 1 inelastic readily changed to 3 highly elastic with a 4th option of infeasible the survey results were aggregated with anonymity between respondents before a second round of the same questions but with the added information of the group average in this second round the participants were given the choice of changing their answer according to the group average ten of the original 30 participants completed the second round the responses from the second round converged towards consensus and the mean average scores were used to divide lulc into two categories feasible or infeasible these constraints are tabulated in supplementary information conversion cost scores lisbon has some heritage and conservation sites which are legally protected and the social cultural value of preserving these sites may be in conflict with maximising ues the question of whether to consider these protected sites as fixed as they are in reality or explore hypothetical outcomes depends on the scope of the decisions being supported by the model accordingly we developed two scenarios by which to explore the impact of fixing certain heritage sites see section 3 5 the map of protected areas is shown in fig 3 3 5 scenario development in this paper both a predictive scenario and an explorative scenario were developed following which in our case study pertain to two alternative lulc conversion constraints the explorative scenario preserves transport infrastructure land open scenario explorative while the predictive scenario additionally preserves areas that are legally protected for nature and heritage reasons protected heritage scenario predictive for the protected heritage scenario cells that were unfeasible to be converted because legal protection of a significant part of their area were identified this required the mapping of legally protected cultural and natural heritage and protected natural areas over our cell structure for this we used the databases of the epic webgis http epic webgis portugal isa ulisboa pt of the university of lisbon and the open gis database http data cml opendata arcgis com of the lisbon municipal chamber which included spatial layers with protected natural areas and heritage shown in supplementary information heritage features from the set of legally protected heritage recorded statues sculptures and mobile objects were removed since those are objects that could be easily re located in some cases the databases recorded the protected heritage in the form of point that indicate the centre of the protected areas to associate these points with specific surfaces we overlapped them onto the lulc maps used in this study this allowed us to calculate the amount of surface protected even if in some cases this was not completely accurate since we could not be sure that all the area of each individual lulc polygon selected was protected any cell containing a part of a protected area was marked as unfeasible for conversion to another lulc 3 6 epsilon approach following the moilp ε approach three single objectives were defined for the three ues to be maximised the order of the single objective optimisations was based on the ranking of importance determined by our stakeholders preferences see table 1 each successive objective function was more constrained by respecting the optimised result of the previous result as an additional constraint table 2 4 results in this section we show the results from our two case study scenarios of lisbon the open scenario explorative and the protected heritage scenario predictive this demonstrates how the mathematical method was used to optimise selected ues indirectly by way of lulc conversions observing two differently constrained models 4 1 ues supply the three ues were optimised iteratively using the ε constraint method each iteration added one more constraint that the es optimised in the previous iteration should not decrease the first iteration ε0 maximised flood protection the resulting supply of flood protection in ε0 was then observed as a minimum threshold in the next iteration ε1 which maximised local climate regulation the optimised local climate regulation and flood protection were both observed as minimum thresholds in the final iteration ε2 which maximised biodiversity thus the moilp became increasingly constrained and the incremental changes became progressively smaller at each iteration under the open scenario the potential of each specific ues supply increased based on the lulc changes flood protection potential increased 851 which was a larger relative increase than the other ues local climate regulation potential increased by 278 and biodiversity potential increased by 65 meanwhile recreation which was preserved as a constraint increased 159 incidentally ues supplies were lower in the protected heritage scenario compared to the open scenario the potential of each specific ues supply increased flood protection increased 695 which was a larger relative increase than the other ues local climate regulation increased 222 biodiversity increased 51 and recreation increased 125 these results are shown in fig 4 note however that these results are necessarily affected by the characteristics of the input data in our case the clc map provides open access and validated test data which is adequate to test the methodological approach but suffers from a lack of thematic detail especially in large green urban areas for instance the larger green area in lisbon the parque florestal de monsanto located west in the map in fig 2 is described by a single patch classified under the green urban area class while this is overall true it lacks thematic detail that affects the final outputs because it underestimated the ues that are currently delivered by this green urban area notably it disregards its high diversity of habitats including forest shrubland and grassland dominated habitats arranged in a landscape mosaic in the open scenario the ues supplies increased mostly due to conversions to shrubland habitats i e clc class of moors and heathland this happened largely in areas that were initial green urban areas commercial and industrial or sports and leisure facilities similarly the ues supplies from the protected heritage scenario as with the open scenario mostly increased due to conversions to shrubland habitats as with the open scenario this happened largely in areas that were formerly green urban areas and commercial or industrial or sports and leisure facilities however in the heritage scenario fewer urban fabric area was converted due to the prevalence of protected sites in the older central neighbourhoods these changes in landscape patterns correspond to spatial variation in the potential to supply the modelled ues the spatial pattern of ues supplies for both scenarios is shown in fig 5 while the central areas of lisbon did not see increases in ues as shown by the large grey spaces dominated by very consolidated continuous urban fabric landscape in fig 5 there were increases in the modelled ues in the margins of this consolidated area most increases in ues supply potential are linked to changes in the northern parts of the city which were initially less consolidated landscapes with large agricultural and recreational open spaces these landscapes were largely converted to shrubland habitats in both scenarios due to the low cost of converting between these land cover classes and due to the multi functional potential of this type of land cover to supply the selected ues simultaneously 4 2 lulc allocation in both scenarios the lulc pattern became more homogenous as ues were optimised meaning lulc classes characterised as relevant for multiple ues became more widespread substituting lulc that were less relevant this resulted in a decrease in lulc diversity the trade offs between lulc classes is shown in supplementary information lulc maps the optimiser selected widespread shrubland class due to its high relevance to ues and relatively low cost of conversion as a consequence the optimal lulc allocation in both scenarios was dominated by conversions to shrubland habitats especially from commercial and industrial units and urban parks and due to the housing constraint there was a complete conversion from discontinuous urban fabric to continuous urban fabric this concentrated the housing areas and freed up other areas for conversions to moors and heathland the main lulc allocation differences in the protected scenario compared to the open scenario were the retention of more industrial and commercial units discontinuous urban fabric and some central green urban areas which also meant a higher diversity of lulc both in absolute terms and in terms of spatial distribution both scenarios saw a densification of urban fabrics while it was more noticeable in the open scenario in the protected heritage scenario housing capacity was less spatially efficient due to the preservation of discontinuous urban fabric in some protected areas which meant more area was required in other areas to satisfy the housing capacity constraint these were mostly the conversion of discontinuous urban fabric in the newer northern neighbourhoods to continuous urban fabric and consequently fewer of those northern cells were converted to ues rich lulc classes continuous urban fabric featured heavily in the initial land pattern of lisbon however it supplies few ues as shown by its low relevance in the matrix of performance scores burkhard et al 2009 nevertheless it provides an essential social service housing in a more spatially efficiency way than other lulc due to the constraint on protecting a certain level of housing capacity the optimiser replaced less spatially efficient housing land covers such as discontinuous urban fabrics with continuous urban fabric the result was a complete loss of discontinuous urban fabric land and a slight increase in continuous urban fabric because this freed up more spatial units for lulc that supply ues 4 3 trade offs overall the two optimised scenarios resulted in a concentration of the residential area in dense continuous urban fabric to free the land for the supply of ues in fig 6 we compare the two scenarios with the initial situation in terms of population density in residential areas normalised with respect to the initial situation and supply potential for each analysed ues including recreation expressed as the ratio between current and the maximum score of the burkhard et al 2009 scale across all cells in the open scenario the population density increased by 17 which translated into a higher ues provision for all services flood protection raised from the initial 2 of the maximum potential to 17 local climate regulation improved from 8 to 31 biodiversity from 22 to 37 and recreation from 16 to 40 of the maximum potential in the protected heritage scenario the population density in the urban area increased by 12 because of the inclusion of the constraint preventing the conversion of heritage areas into land cover types with a higher ues performance this resulted in a 3 5 loss in the ues provision potential compared to the open scenario 5 discussion 5 1 optimisation strategy the optimisation strategy was successful insofar as we engaged stakeholders and experts in deliberating over a complex local problem and consequently generated results for urban ecosystem service ues supplies with respect to land use optimisation notwithstanding the generally successful integration of approaches we identify four main limitations in our proof of concept model 1 a lack of thematic detail in the lucl map for urban areas 2 lack of temporal details 3 lack of consideration of non linear trends and consideration of synergies between ues and 4 missing interaction between human and natural systems in the work of burkhard et al 2009 the clc class of moors and heathlands i e shrubland cover are scored as highly relevant for recreation while green urban areas were characterised with only medium relevance see supplementary information performance scores burkhard et al 2009 however green urban areas in a city could be very different from each other being more or less artificialised to split green urban areas into more classes would help to better differentiate their variable supply of difference services this conjecture calls into question the need for an urban specific lulc ues matrix equivalent to that developed by burkhard et al 2009 with a higher categorical detail of lulc classes temporal details are relevant for understanding how lulc will need to change over time to accommodate the needs of a changing population and economy additionally there is a time lag between the conversion of a lulc class and the ues supplied by that lulc which hampers depicting a more complex although closer to the reality cause effect modelling of ues supplies additionally the set of ues supplied by that lulc will not have the same life cycle for example a landscape with shrubland cover can immediately supply recreation but the regeneration of biodiversity supplied by that landscape may take much longer our model assumes the set of supplied ues occur simultaneously and indefinitely in other words the model compares the actual situation with two steady states open and protected heritage but is not capable of capturing the transition phase from the former to the latter the performance scores used in this model burkhard et al 2009 are useful for communicating scales of relevance for ues however they are limited in explaining non linear trends in ues such as biodiversity r boumans et al 2015 ideally the use of quantitative biophysical e g tonnes of biomass yield year ha for valuing energy provision could help on this however direct and indirect measurements are difficult to obtain and would need to be converted into a common unit system e g ha to make the equations comparable and easily communicable for policy makers and lay stakeholders this type of standardisation has been achieved in well regarded ecosystem assessments r boumans et al 2002 costanza et al 1997 2017 reid et al 2005 strand et al 2018 but not at the spatial detail considered in this model monetary units and standard indices nonetheless monetarisation of ecological values introduces other challenges such as statistical robustness and avoiding subjectivity adamowicz et al 1997 daily 1997 hence the quantification of ues sensitivity to near optimal lulc configurations is still an open research questions exist since there are still no universally accepted indicator metric burkhard and maes 2017 regarding consideration of ues mutual effects the model lacks the capacity to account for ues synergies due to spatial continuity of lulc functions as discussed by garcía nieto garcía nieto et al 2013 this makes it difficult to understand how the fragmentation of landscapes found in the optimal lulc configuration may in reality supply ues to value synergistic properties of ues the model should have considered the neighbourhood of each grid cell research in landscape ecology tells us that patterns between lulc types and also between synergistic bundles of ues may often be non linear this is not acknowledged in the model we presented nor in previous studies which inspired the present paper e g herzig et al 2014 however this might not be so problematic for ues assessments compared to non urban es assessments because of high degree of fragmentation in cities which in reality may limit the potential for synergies between neighbouring types of landscapes nevertheless research is progressing in the valorisation of these synergies with the application of cellular automata and heuristic methods for ues accounting for example the large neighbourhood cellular automata of liao et al 2016 can give a performance score variation based on the sum of the performances a grid cells cellular neighbourhood examples like this one are still not considering links to mathematical optimisation which could be an interesting space for future integrated modelling research furthermore our model does not consider causal relationships linking human and natural systems for example the model does not account for competition between demand for ecosystem services and built capital and how these competing demands can affect the urban landscape these interactions may involve feedback loops between human and natural elements and processes system dynamics sd may be a useful modelling framework to overcome this limitation of our model in not considering quantitative causal relationships generated by the interaction between lulc and ues as well as the abovementioned limitations relating to neighbourhood and of non linearity effects fügenschuh and vierhaus 2014 herzig and rutledge 2013 sd is used extensively in ecosystem modelling to map and assess the supply of ecosystem services r boumans et al 2002 r boumans et al 2015 r j boumans et al 2014 the lumass model herzig et al 2014 has this functionality albeit so far not validated in any urban studies integrating mathematical optimisation with the multiscale integrated model for ecosystem services mimes r boumans et al 2015 which is already effective at the urban level r j boumans et al 2014 may allow for spatio temporal optimisation of ues at multiple scales one of the main advantages of sd ecosystem models such as the mimes is their capacity for coupling human nature system interactions grêt regamey et al 2017 turner et al 2016 mathematical optimisation based models such as the one presented in this paper could be integrated with sd modelling by adopting a multi stage optimisation approach facilitating the integration of dynamic human nature system interactions sd derived spatio temporal parameters can be used to predict future constraints for optimising future scenarios jin et al 2017 a model that can reveal optimal solutions according to spatio temporal urban dynamics may have significant benefits in the assessment and valorisation of ues bundles or nature based solutions elliot et al 2019 holland et al 2018 such an advancement has the potential to provide decision support for long run urban planning interventions addressing future sustainability challenges elliot et al 2018 5 2 participatory approaches by using participatory approaches from social sciences we incorporated knowledge across disciplines in each stage of the model this created an innovative intersection between ecological economics and mathematical modelling firstly an exercise in participatory modelling approach was put in place to qualify and benchmark the relative importance of ues which later defined the order of epsilon constraints that we optimised this was fundamental in optimising with multiple objectives and while the values of the stakeholders may not necessarily reflect the socio economic demand for these ues to lisbon s citizens it is nonetheless indicative of lisbon s sustainable development priorities secondly we used a panel of experts to derive the qualitative cost of lulc conversions matrix this markov type square matrix defined the cascade of conversion from each lulc to each other lulc and from this we defined semi qualitative economic budget constraints the advantage of such a semi qualitative approach is that the data lay on a unitless scale as with the ues performance scores allowing for easy integration with the ues data and replicability and comparability of the approach on other geographical contexts the use of participatory modelling is uncommon in mathematical optimisation and is more common in social sciences participatory modelling can add value to modelling by acknowledging the perceptions of stakeholders and experts across different scientific expertise van den belt 2004 for example the inclusion of the preservation of the cultural heritage as a model constraint is a good example of how the model could account for stakeholders preferences which is very important when addressing sustainable urban planning campbell 1996 the lisbon green surge report santos et al 2015 emphasises the importance of integrating local knowledge by engaging stakeholders in a participatory urban planning processes looking to increase the supply of lisbon s ues this is becoming more utilised in ecological economics and environmental science research due to the emphasis on consensus building across specialised research fields and because of the drive to valorise non marketed socio ecological phenomena such as ues that are often difficult to quantify in geobiophysical units camps calvet et al 2016 de groot et al 2010 hewitt et al 2014 van den belt 2004 however participatory modelling has both benefits and drawbacks for instance it relies entirely on the expertise and perception of stakeholders who may have conflicting objectives van den belt 2004 nevertheless the democratic nature of participatory modelling is a real advantage for framing decision support models especially in cases of limited or poor data quality this makes the model easily transferable to other cities regardless of local data availability and allows for any locally specific conditions to be reflected which might stem from local heritage history and place making pendlebury and porfyriou 2017 5 3 generation of scenario results to support decisions the results from our protected heritage and open scenarios pointed out the trade off between urban residential density and the provision of ues we accounted for this trade off in terms of forgone ues supplies due to preserving the cultural heritage for lisbon this cost was rather low in percentage terms but the model accounts only impacts occurring within the study area and not global impacts the debate between compact versus sprawl cities has been going on for almost twenty years and involved key issues as residential density preferences energy resource savings the efficiency gains from compactness and social equity among others ewing and hamidi 2015 the densification of urban housing seen in our results seems to add an additional argument in favour of compact city planning however the compact city design has to be carefully outlined introducing the necessary measures to improve ues in dense urban fabric through nature based solutions jim 2004 2012 larondelle et al 2014 larondelle and lauf 2016 the model assumes an urban planner with full control over the changes in lulc but this is generally not the case the willingness of certain agents e g residents dwelling in heritage areas to accept the proposed changes may act as a major barrier in the implementation of such a drastic redesign of the city although the model considers conversion costs for the lulc changes the agreements on housing property rights e g relocation of households are not guaranteed and the transaction costs may be extremely high social justice problems for instance concerning unequal access to open space and recreation and the preservation of cultural values should also be accounted for campbell 1996 would the population of lisbon be willing to accept the removal of their historic city centre to make place for natural landscapes as suggested by the open scenario probably not therefore we accounted for this aspect by including the heritage constraint in the optimiser this is a good example of how the model could account for stakeholders preferences which is very important when addressing sustainable urban planning campbell 1996 6 conclusions this paper has illustrated a proof of concept on a combined use of participatory optimisation models to deliver spatial solutions that maximise urban ecosystem services ues through reconfiguration of land use land cover lulc an integrated model has been built for the city of lisbon portugal using a multi objective integer linear programming moilp and involving the participation of key stakeholders to validate and benchmark the selection of optimisation constraints results from the moilp largely allocated shrubland habitats among the grid cells to optimise multiple ues meanwhile the moilp mostly converted those lulc types that are less relevant for ues to continuous urban fabric to maintain sufficient housing capacity the outcome was a landscape mosaic dominated by natural habitats that provide multiple ues and continuous urban fabric with a reduction of commercial agricultural and artificial green urban areas using an optimisation approach has the advantage to identify the lulc allocation that assures the highest ues supply given the defined constraints as illustrated by our case study the optimal landscape pattern may be far off from its actual form and hence difficult to determine without optimisation tools such as the one presented in this paper while this model s constraints are over simplified our results demonstrate that value can be added from such an approach consequently spatial optimisation applied to ues is a valuable tool to explore the landscape design spectrum and stimulate the decision making process in cities additionally the model is simple to use by non modelling experts and the results in the form of maps are easy to communicate to a broad audience the method allows for the evaluation and testing of different scenarios in particular explorative ones which can stimulate the discussion during urban planning decision making these characteristics make the model attractive for its use as part of participatory urban planning processes anywhere in the world including stakeholders in the modelling process helped to understand the specific challenges of the lisbon case study thereby validating the model s benchmarking of objectives and definition of the modelling constraints participatory modelling is recommended as both a way of reaping local expert knowledge while simultaneously engaging stakeholders in the modelling process future work should include a quantitative determination of the economic costs associated with those lulc conversions and optimisations this could be combined with the development of an ues relevance matrix specific to the urban level similar to the burkhard et al 2009 s matrix such an advancement would generate more site specific frames to measure ues quantitatively using physical values meanwhile this would require a more demanding phase of data collection by the model users and thus lose its user friendly and transferable attractiveness eventually such a spatially heterogeneous ues impact matrix would allow for these types of mathematical model to give more meaningful results and allow for robust statistical analysis of the results and lead to more confident ues optimisation modelling results model complexity was balanced to meet the needs of stakeholders and their urban planning objectives while retaining a relevant decision space and constraints furthermore non linearities such as coupled human nature systems and spatio temporal dynamics were not addressed in this study non linear feedbacks between agglomerations of ues supplying lulc configurations may be relevant thus potentially weakening the reliability of applications outside the scope of this study however in highly fragmented artificial landscapes such as lisbon these interactions might be less relevant that in wild landscapes assessing the importance of these spatio temporal dynamics is a future research opportunity which may be illuminated through the coupling of this approach with system dynamics modelling the main innovation of this method is the integration of participatory data collection in a fine resolution spatial optimiser which is highly transferable and user friendly while retaining a certain level of model complexity this can add value to urban planning decision making and stimulate discussion across their various value systems the model can be replicated easily by using an existing lookup table of ues and lulc performance scores and carrying out a delphi survey with local experts to determine a qualitative lulc cost of conversion matrix

25000,urban ecosystem services ues are the benefits supplied by nature to people in urban systems the supply of ues is threatened because of widespread increasing urbanisation modelling scenarios that optimise ues supplies can support sustainable urban planning processes ues are linked to land use land cover lulc types which enables the optimisation of ues supply to be based on lulc configurations however current modelling approaches are not suitably adapted to the link between ues optimisation and lulc configurations one possibility to target ues optimal supply is to use mathematical optimisation methods the objective of this study is to test the combined use of participatory modelling and optimisation models to deliver spatial solutions that maximise ues by optimal urban lulc configurations an integrated model is built using a multi objective integer linear programming moilp model along with lulc performance scores to maximise a set of locally supplied ues this is illustrated with a case study of lisbon portugal involving the participation of key stakeholders to validate and benchmark the selection of optimisation constraints results show land optimally allocated to land cover types with high ues functions combined with a reshuffling and densification of residential land thus the new lulc configuration increased multiple ues supplies while maintaining a level of housing capacity the model shows clear implications of increasing land cover types whose ues functions are high compared to most other lulc classes moreover incorporating stakeholder participatory modelling offers a transdisciplinary and interdisciplinary scientific contribution intersecting mathematical optimisation ues and urban planning keywords ecosystem services participatory modelling spatial optimisation biodiversity 1 introduction in 2015 the united nations published its agenda for a sustainable development of our society undp 2015 this agenda is composed of 17 sustainability goals of which goal 11 targets sustainable cities and goals 6 13 14 and 15 target the preservation of biodiversity and the provided ecosystem services folke et al 2016 ecosystem services are the contributions from natural capital that enhance human well being boyd and banzhaf 2007 haines young and potschin young 2018 while ecosystem services are often provided by large natural ecosystems mountains forests rivers etc they are also supplied in urban ecosystems calderón contreras and quiroz rosas 2017 luederitz et al 2015 the key challenge is to enhance the supply of urban ecosystem services ues which are constrained by the concentration of a growing population in urban systems tobias 2012 the goal of this study is to understand the potential for alternative land use land cover lulc arrangements in cities which can maximise the local supply of ecosystem services in this study we consider the ues that are supplied locally within the urban system as the supply of ues is linked to the type of urban lulc burkhard et al 2009 jin et al 2017 kontogianni et al 2010 adequate urban planning approaches should therefore be deployed to address the abovementioned challenges on top of this the supply of multiple ues must be considered to support a more holistic and more resilient configuration of the lulc seppelt et al 2013 accordingly the numerous potential lulc configurations and economic and environmental constraints that must be considered reid et al 2005 make the task of reaching an adequate let alone optimal solution very complex herzig et al 2014 kaim et al 2018 this paper tackles this goal by developing a model to identify spatially specific optimal ues supply according to different lulc configurations this model can be useful to support the draft of urban plans and strategies that consider multiple potentially conflicting constraints in this regard several optimisation approaches targeting ecosystem services have already been deployed mostly for the improved management of agricultural landscapes kaim et al 2018 and forests castro et al 2018 chen et al 2016 due to the multiple objectives and non linear relations to consider models based on heuristic algorithms are frequently proposed as they allow for reasonable resolution time and limited computational memory usage bierlaire 2015 heuristic methods have been applied to optimising multiple ecosystem services based on lulc cao et al 2012 haque and asami 2014 hu et al 2014 li et al 2018 masoomi et al 2013 verhagen et al 2018 however heuristic approaches do not necessarily lead to globally optimal solutions groot et al 2018 moilanen 2008 global optima can however be determined using mathematical optimisation modelling mathematical optimisation is a branch of applied mathematics that uses rigorous methods to determine the best solution to quantitatively defined complex problems snyman and wilke 2018 such as the supply of ecosystem services epa 2012 mathematical optimisation methods have been applied to ecosystem services both with single wang et al 2014 xue and ma 2018 and multiple objective problems there are various ways of dealing with multi objective optimisation problems such as objective weighting and epsilon constraints herzig et al 2014 a multi objective linear programming model using epsilon constraints was developed to optimise rural lulc configurations and thereby associated ecosystem services herzig et al 2014 this model considered constraints of maximal lulc allocation to avoid monocultures and of performance to ensure certain levels of multiple ecosystem services supply in new zealand herzig et al 2014 and south korea herzig et al 2018 moreover a multi objective mixed integer linear programming model targeting fire hazard reduction in forests was introduced by schroder et al 2016 which integrated budget constraints and area limitations with the exception of pribadi and xu 2017 mathematical optimisation of ecosystem services supplied in urban areas have so far not been addressed pribadi and xu 2017 proposed a mixed integer non linear programming model constrained by minimal targets of new green spaces and the impracticability of using high density settlements areas for such lulc conversions in these optimisation methods various authors included economic aspects in their models however they all focused specifically on operating costs or revenues stemming from the different land uses the above literature synthesis reveals two relevant shortcomings 1 lulc conversion costs have so far not been comprehensively integrated into models and 2 urban level mathematical optimisation still needs to be developed because of the complex ecosystem demands and competition between artificial and natural lulc functions in cities therefore the main scientific contribution of this work is the novel development of an ues optimisation method based on a multi objective integer linear programming moilp model formulation combined with a qualitative economic assessment of lulc conversion costs accordingly a participatory modelling approach is proposed to characterise these conversion costs more specifically we deliberated with relevant experts to understand local context via surveys participatory approaches which we borrow from social sciences is a term for including inputs from stakeholders such as community members or other researchers to consider a range of viewpoints this can be used to reach consensus when problems are wicked van den belt 2004 while realistic lulc conversion economics should consider land acquisition costs revenue losses direct costs of conversion and maintenance herzig et al 2014 and transaction costs such a detailed quantitative approach implies considerable effort in data acquisition reflecting specific local conditions gourevitch et al 2016 hence with the purpose of developing a proof of concept integrated model a qualitative valuation approach based on expert opinion is presented which aims to reflect the potential economic effort related to lulc change this approach allowed us to identify areas that are perceived as unlikely to undergo lulc change in addition there are areas that are legally protected for their heritage value or ecological role where lulc changes are not permitted acknowledging these legally protected areas is more realistic and aids to inform more plausible futures however it constrains optimal solutions and investigation of less realistic futures which could be also relevant to explore more radical alternatives as a consequence together with participatory modelling approaches we have also worked with the development of different scenarios optimisation models are a common technique to support the development of scenarios including urban developments börjeson et al 2006 scenarios can be conceptualised as consistent and plausible pictures of possible future states even if they are unlikely eea 2009 2011 börjeson et al 2006 defined three types of scenarios predictive normative and explorative their characteristics and parallelisms the first type investigates what will happen under likely conditions or if we alter them the second type looks at how a specific target could be reached the third one explores situations that are regarded as possible to happen if we act in a certain way the first and third types have some similarities but explorative scenarios are more adequate to investigate the consequences of alternative developments with respect to strategic issues and focus on long time horizons since deep changes are usually required moreover unlike predictive scenarios explorative scenarios are often interested in the investigation of visionary or unlikely options as possible future states eea 2011 the purpose of this type of scenarios is less focused on the plausibility and more on to obtain a further understanding on alternatives to trigger discussions or ideas of interested parties such as ngos policy analysists or researchers börjeson et al 2006 eea 2011 the following section describes the methodological steps of the modelling approach which is later tested in a case study involving the city of lisbon portugal in section 3 the case study poses two scenarios one predictive and one explorative the predictive scenario considers known political lulc constraints while the explorative scenario disregards those political constraints the results from these two scenarios are compared and contrasted in section 4 these developments are then discussed with respect to relevant state of the art literature in section 5 and conclusions are drawn in the last section 2 methodology 2 1 model structure the structure equations constraints and assumptions are presented for an ues optimiser based on lulc fig 1 shows the structure of the integrated multi objective optimisation model for urban areas this is formulated as a moilp model whose objective is to maximise ues supplies through land use change while considering 1 ues constraints and 2 socio economic constraints ues constraints reflect the requirements that at city level the considered ecosystem services should not be degraded compared to the as is situation moreover considering that ues are enjoyed at local level lulc changes should not lead to deterioration of ues associated with local recreation the cultural recreation ues is selected here to represent the importance of nature based urban recreation supplied locally cortinovis et al 2018 which can be more relevant to urban residents than the ecological functions relating local supplies of provisioning and regulating ues camps calvet et al 2016 the economic constraints instead reflect budget limitations and the inappropriateness of changing areas with relevant infrastructures sets and their elements are represented in bold parameters are represented in normal font while dependent and independent variables are indicated with italics the constraints imposed on the model are defined in sections 2 2 2 6 three types of sets were considered in this problem es the set of ecosystem services es being modelled e g flood protection local climate regulation biodiversity p the set of parcels representing geographical areas p1 p2 pp here delimited as grid cells l the set of lulc classes l e g urban park industries transport the following parameters were required as fixed inputs to the model a p area of parcel p ha i e s l specific impact of an es related to a lulc l ha 1 x e s p 0 the initial value of an es in a parcel p qualitative c l 0 l the conversion cost from land type l0 to land type l qualitative c constraining factor limiting change costs at parcel level qualitative b constraining

variable allocating 1 or not 0 an optimised land use l to parcel p 0 or 1 2 2 objective function and variable definition the objective of the model was to maximise one ecosystem service type es in a landscape composed of parcels p 1 max p i n p x e s p the performance score x es p of an ecosystem service es in a parcel p with an area ap was quantified as follows 2 x e s p a p l i n l i e s l y p

be selected per cell which is enforced by the following equation 3 l i n l y p l 1 p i n p 2 3 ecosystem service constraints when dealing with the constraints related to the supply of ues we assumed that the selection of new lulc should not lead to a loss of ecosystem service supplying potential x e s p 0 in the whole region 4 p i n p a p l i n l i e s l y p l p i n p x e s p 0 e s i n e s

use l0 to a lulc type l and c the constraining factor limiting the conversion cost this approach can help to reflect the constraint that certain lulc e g industries or transport should not be considered as the change would imply the removal of large and or relevant infrastructures see supplementary information conversion cost scores furthermore lulc changes were also constrained by limited budget b at city scale in the quantitative assessment underpinning the proposed model this represented the willingness to invest more or less in the overall improvement of ues supply 7 p i n p a p l i

ecosystem services being maximised the optimisation of these services implies a multi objective optimisation approach while several methods to multi objective optimisation are used in the literature an epsilon constraints approach was used in this work as it helped to preserve the moilp model while reflecting the priorities of the users in their decision process the epsilon constraints approach ranks the multiple objectives the highest rank is optimised first this result then becomes an addition constraint in the subsequent optimisation of the next highest rank and so on for each objective the number of epsilon constraints is therefore one fewer than the number of objectives in the context of multiple ecosystem services the multiple ecosystem services were benchmarked by importance as was also the case in the work of herzig et al 2014 the most relevant es was then used for the objective function of the first optimisation run see further details on the selection of relevant ues in section 3 2 in a second run the second most important es was used as objective function while the value of the first es x e s 1 r u n 1 was used as constrain in the model such as 9 x e s 1 r u n 2 x e s 1 r u n 1 3 case study lisbon 3 1 scope and system boundary the implementation of the method described in section 2 is illustrated through a case study of the city of lisbon portugal we took the 2018 corine land cover clc raster map from copernicus land monitoring https land copernicus eu pan european corine land cover clc2018 which has a spatial resolution of 100 m and a minimum mapping unit of 25 ha lulc are classified using the clc land classes classification system https www eea europa eu publications cor0 landcover within this study area there are 14 unique lulc classes over an area of 8562 ha see fig 2 each parcel grid cell is 1 ha in area and is characterised by one of the 14 lulc classes 3 2 selected ecosystem services to determine which ues were most relevant for lisbon we conducted a participatory workshop with representatives of three lisbon stakeholder groups belonging to the lisbon municipality câmara municipal de lisboa the directorate general for the territorial development direcção geral do território and the university of lisbon on 16th of march 2018 a main goal of the workshop was to benchmark the importance of selected ues with respect to addressing urban challenges more specifically respondents were asked to benchmark urban challenges relating to ues using categorical interval scales of high importance 3 medium importance 2 and low importance 1 the average results showed that flood protection local climate regulation and biodiversity were the three most important ues accordingly these three ues were selected in order of their importance for use in the optimisation model see table 1 3 3 ues indicators the lulc relevance functions described by burkhard et al 2009 and burkhard et al 2014 were used as proxy indicators in lieu of measured ues values the ecosystem services matrix approach developed by burkhard et al 2009 and burkhard kandziora hou and müller 2014 links lulc to ecosystem services relevance on a normalised linear scale for the full matrix see supplementary information performance scores no relevance is given by 0 and very high relevance is given by 5 these scores do not quantify the physical flows so the results are limited to the maximisation of relevance rather than the maximisation of physical quantities or flows 3 4 economic constraints to understand the feasibility of lulc conversions an expert survey was conducted online between september and october 2018 the survey used the delphi method with two rounds to reach consensus on which lulc conversions should be considered in the model constraints the survey invited 30 urban systems and land economics experts to rank the elasticity of lulc demand from 1 inelastic readily changed to 3 highly elastic with a 4th option of infeasible the survey results were aggregated with anonymity between respondents before a second round of the same questions but with the added information of the group average in this second round the participants were given the choice of changing their answer according to the group average ten of the original 30 participants completed the second round the responses from the second round converged towards consensus and the mean average scores were used to divide lulc into two categories feasible or infeasible these constraints are tabulated in supplementary information conversion cost scores lisbon has some heritage and conservation sites which are legally protected and the social cultural value of preserving these sites may be in conflict with maximising ues the question of whether to consider these protected sites as fixed as they are in reality or explore hypothetical outcomes depends on the scope of the decisions being supported by the model accordingly we developed two scenarios by which to explore the impact of fixing certain heritage sites see section 3 5 the map of protected areas is shown in fig 3 3 5 scenario development in this paper both a predictive scenario and an explorative scenario were developed following which in our case study pertain to two alternative lulc conversion constraints the explorative scenario preserves transport infrastructure land open scenario explorative while the predictive scenario additionally preserves areas that are legally protected for nature and heritage reasons protected heritage scenario predictive for the protected heritage scenario cells that were unfeasible to be converted because legal protection of a significant part of their area were identified this required the mapping of legally protected cultural and natural heritage and protected natural areas over our cell structure for this we used the databases of the epic webgis http epic webgis portugal isa ulisboa pt of the university of lisbon and the open gis database http data cml opendata arcgis com of the lisbon municipal chamber which included spatial layers with protected natural areas and heritage shown in supplementary information heritage features from the set of legally protected heritage recorded statues sculptures and mobile objects were removed since those are objects that could be easily re located in some cases the databases recorded the protected heritage in the form of point that indicate the centre of the protected areas to associate these points with specific surfaces we overlapped them onto the lulc maps used in this study this allowed us to calculate the amount of surface protected even if in some cases this was not completely accurate since we could not be sure that all the area of each individual lulc polygon selected was protected any cell containing a part of a protected area was marked as unfeasible for conversion to another lulc 3 6 epsilon approach following the moilp ε approach three single objectives were defined for the three ues to be maximised the order of the single objective optimisations was based on the ranking of importance determined by our stakeholders preferences see table 1 each successive objective function was more constrained by respecting the optimised result of the previous result as an additional constraint table 2 4 results in this section we show the results from our two case study scenarios of lisbon the open scenario explorative and the protected heritage scenario predictive this demonstrates how the mathematical method was used to optimise selected ues indirectly by way of lulc conversions observing two differently constrained models 4 1 ues supply the three ues were optimised iteratively using the ε constraint method each iteration added one more constraint that the es optimised in the previous iteration should not decrease the first iteration ε0 maximised flood protection the resulting supply of flood protection in ε0 was then observed as a minimum threshold in the next iteration ε1 which maximised local climate regulation the optimised local climate regulation and flood protection were both observed as minimum thresholds in the final iteration ε2 which maximised biodiversity thus the moilp became increasingly constrained and the incremental changes became progressively smaller at each iteration under the open scenario the potential of each specific ues supply increased based on the lulc changes flood protection potential increased 851 which was a larger relative increase than the other ues local climate regulation potential increased by 278 and biodiversity potential increased by 65 meanwhile recreation which was preserved as a constraint increased 159 incidentally ues supplies were lower in the protected heritage scenario compared to the open scenario the potential of each specific ues supply increased flood protection increased 695 which was a larger relative increase than the other ues local climate regulation increased 222 biodiversity increased 51 and recreation increased 125 these results are shown in fig 4 note however that these results are necessarily affected by the characteristics of the input data in our case the clc map provides open access and validated test data which is adequate to test the methodological approach but suffers from a lack of thematic detail especially in large green urban areas for instance the larger green area in lisbon the parque florestal de monsanto located west in the map in fig 2 is described by a single patch classified under the green urban area class while this is overall true it lacks thematic detail that affects the final outputs because it underestimated the ues that are currently delivered by this green urban area notably it disregards its high diversity of habitats including forest shrubland and grassland dominated habitats arranged in a landscape mosaic in the open scenario the ues supplies increased mostly due to conversions to shrubland habitats i e clc class of moors and heathland this happened largely in areas that were initial green urban areas commercial and industrial or sports and leisure facilities similarly the ues supplies from the protected heritage scenario as with the open scenario mostly increased due to conversions to shrubland habitats as with the open scenario this happened largely in areas that were formerly green urban areas and commercial or industrial or sports and leisure facilities however in the heritage scenario fewer urban fabric area was converted due to the prevalence of protected sites in the older central neighbourhoods these changes in landscape patterns correspond to spatial variation in the potential to supply the modelled ues the spatial pattern of ues supplies for both scenarios is shown in fig 5 while the central areas of lisbon did not see increases in ues as shown by the large grey spaces dominated by very consolidated continuous urban fabric landscape in fig 5 there were increases in the modelled ues in the margins of this consolidated area most increases in ues supply potential are linked to changes in the northern parts of the city which were initially less consolidated landscapes with large agricultural and recreational open spaces these landscapes were largely converted to shrubland habitats in both scenarios due to the low cost of converting between these land cover classes and due to the multi functional potential of this type of land cover to supply the selected ues simultaneously 4 2 lulc allocation in both scenarios the lulc pattern became more homogenous as ues were optimised meaning lulc classes characterised as relevant for multiple ues became more widespread substituting lulc that were less relevant this resulted in a decrease in lulc diversity the trade offs between lulc classes is shown in supplementary information lulc maps the optimiser selected widespread shrubland class due to its high relevance to ues and relatively low cost of conversion as a consequence the optimal lulc allocation in both scenarios was dominated by conversions to shrubland habitats especially from commercial and industrial units and urban parks and due to the housing constraint there was a complete conversion from discontinuous urban fabric to continuous urban fabric this concentrated the housing areas and freed up other areas for conversions to moors and heathland the main lulc allocation differences in the protected scenario compared to the open scenario were the retention of more industrial and commercial units discontinuous urban fabric and some central green urban areas which also meant a higher diversity of lulc both in absolute terms and in terms of spatial distribution both scenarios saw a densification of urban fabrics while it was more noticeable in the open scenario in the protected heritage scenario housing capacity was less spatially efficient due to the preservation of discontinuous urban fabric in some protected areas which meant more area was required in other areas to satisfy the housing capacity constraint these were mostly the conversion of discontinuous urban fabric in the newer northern neighbourhoods to continuous urban fabric and consequently fewer of those northern cells were converted to ues rich lulc classes continuous urban fabric featured heavily in the initial land pattern of lisbon however it supplies few ues as shown by its low relevance in the matrix of performance scores burkhard et al 2009 nevertheless it provides an essential social service housing in a more spatially efficiency way than other lulc due to the constraint on protecting a certain level of housing capacity the optimiser replaced less spatially efficient housing land covers such as discontinuous urban fabrics with continuous urban fabric the result was a complete loss of discontinuous urban fabric land and a slight increase in continuous urban fabric because this freed up more spatial units for lulc that supply ues 4 3 trade offs overall the two optimised scenarios resulted in a concentration of the residential area in dense continuous urban fabric to free the land for the supply of ues in fig 6 we compare the two scenarios with the initial situation in terms of population density in residential areas normalised with respect to the initial situation and supply potential for each analysed ues including recreation expressed as the ratio between current and the maximum score of the burkhard et al 2009 scale across all cells in the open scenario the population density increased by 17 which translated into a higher ues provision for all services flood protection raised from the initial 2 of the maximum potential to 17 local climate regulation improved from 8 to 31 biodiversity from 22 to 37 and recreation from 16 to 40 of the maximum potential in the protected heritage scenario the population density in the urban area increased by 12 because of the inclusion of the constraint preventing the conversion of heritage areas into land cover types with a higher ues performance this resulted in a 3 5 loss in the ues provision potential compared to the open scenario 5 discussion 5 1 optimisation strategy the optimisation strategy was successful insofar as we engaged stakeholders and experts in deliberating over a complex local problem and consequently generated results for urban ecosystem service ues supplies with respect to land use optimisation notwithstanding the generally successful integration of approaches we identify four main limitations in our proof of concept model 1 a lack of thematic detail in the lucl map for urban areas 2 lack of temporal details 3 lack of consideration of non linear trends and consideration of synergies between ues and 4 missing interaction between human and natural systems in the work of burkhard et al 2009 the clc class of moors and heathlands i e shrubland cover are scored as highly relevant for recreation while green urban areas were characterised with only medium relevance see supplementary information performance scores burkhard et al 2009 however green urban areas in a city could be very different from each other being more or less artificialised to split green urban areas into more classes would help to better differentiate their variable supply of difference services this conjecture calls into question the need for an urban specific lulc ues matrix equivalent to that developed by burkhard et al 2009 with a higher categorical detail of lulc classes temporal details are relevant for understanding how lulc will need to change over time to accommodate the needs of a changing population and economy additionally there is a time lag between the conversion of a lulc class and the ues supplied by that lulc which hampers depicting a more complex although closer to the reality cause effect modelling of ues supplies additionally the set of ues supplied by that lulc will not have the same life cycle for example a landscape with shrubland cover can immediately supply recreation but the regeneration of biodiversity supplied by that landscape may take much longer our model assumes the set of supplied ues occur simultaneously and indefinitely in other words the model compares the actual situation with two steady states open and protected heritage but is not capable of capturing the transition phase from the former to the latter the performance scores used in this model burkhard et al 2009 are useful for communicating scales of relevance for ues however they are limited in explaining non linear trends in ues such as biodiversity r boumans et al 2015 ideally the use of quantitative biophysical e g tonnes of biomass yield year ha for valuing energy provision could help on this however direct and indirect measurements are difficult to obtain and would need to be converted into a common unit system e g ha to make the equations comparable and easily communicable for policy makers and lay stakeholders this type of standardisation has been achieved in well regarded ecosystem assessments r boumans et al 2002 costanza et al 1997 2017 reid et al 2005 strand et al 2018 but not at the spatial detail considered in this model monetary units and standard indices nonetheless monetarisation of ecological values introduces other challenges such as statistical robustness and avoiding subjectivity adamowicz et al 1997 daily 1997 hence the quantification of ues sensitivity to near optimal lulc configurations is still an open research questions exist since there are still no universally accepted indicator metric burkhard and maes 2017 regarding consideration of ues mutual effects the model lacks the capacity to account for ues synergies due to spatial continuity of lulc functions as discussed by garcía nieto garcía nieto et al 2013 this makes it difficult to understand how the fragmentation of landscapes found in the optimal lulc configuration may in reality supply ues to value synergistic properties of ues the model should have considered the neighbourhood of each grid cell research in landscape ecology tells us that patterns between lulc types and also between synergistic bundles of ues may often be non linear this is not acknowledged in the model we presented nor in previous studies which inspired the present paper e g herzig et al 2014 however this might not be so problematic for ues assessments compared to non urban es assessments because of high degree of fragmentation in cities which in reality may limit the potential for synergies between neighbouring types of landscapes nevertheless research is progressing in the valorisation of these synergies with the application of cellular automata and heuristic methods for ues accounting for example the large neighbourhood cellular automata of liao et al 2016 can give a performance score variation based on the sum of the performances a grid cells cellular neighbourhood examples like this one are still not considering links to mathematical optimisation which could be an interesting space for future integrated modelling research furthermore our model does not consider causal relationships linking human and natural systems for example the model does not account for competition between demand for ecosystem services and built capital and how these competing demands can affect the urban landscape these interactions may involve feedback loops between human and natural elements and processes system dynamics sd may be a useful modelling framework to overcome this limitation of our model in not considering quantitative causal relationships generated by the interaction between lulc and ues as well as the abovementioned limitations relating to neighbourhood and of non linearity effects fügenschuh and vierhaus 2014 herzig and rutledge 2013 sd is used extensively in ecosystem modelling to map and assess the supply of ecosystem services r boumans et al 2002 r boumans et al 2015 r j boumans et al 2014 the lumass model herzig et al 2014 has this functionality albeit so far not validated in any urban studies integrating mathematical optimisation with the multiscale integrated model for ecosystem services mimes r boumans et al 2015 which is already effective at the urban level r j boumans et al 2014 may allow for spatio temporal optimisation of ues at multiple scales one of the main advantages of sd ecosystem models such as the mimes is their capacity for coupling human nature system interactions grêt regamey et al 2017 turner et al 2016 mathematical optimisation based models such as the one presented in this paper could be integrated with sd modelling by adopting a multi stage optimisation approach facilitating the integration of dynamic human nature system interactions sd derived spatio temporal parameters can be used to predict future constraints for optimising future scenarios jin et al 2017 a model that can reveal optimal solutions according to spatio temporal urban dynamics may have significant benefits in the assessment and valorisation of ues bundles or nature based solutions elliot et al 2019 holland et al 2018 such an advancement has the potential to provide decision support for long run urban planning interventions addressing future sustainability challenges elliot et al 2018 5 2 participatory approaches by using participatory approaches from social sciences we incorporated knowledge across disciplines in each stage of the model this created an innovative intersection between ecological economics and mathematical modelling firstly an exercise in participatory modelling approach was put in place to qualify and benchmark the relative importance of ues which later defined the order of epsilon constraints that we optimised this was fundamental in optimising with multiple objectives and while the values of the stakeholders may not necessarily reflect the socio economic demand for these ues to lisbon s citizens it is nonetheless indicative of lisbon s sustainable development priorities secondly we used a panel of experts to derive the qualitative cost of lulc conversions matrix this markov type square matrix defined the cascade of conversion from each lulc to each other lulc and from this we defined semi qualitative economic budget constraints the advantage of such a semi qualitative approach is that the data lay on a unitless scale as with the ues performance scores allowing for easy integration with the ues data and replicability and comparability of the approach on other geographical contexts the use of participatory modelling is uncommon in mathematical optimisation and is more common in social sciences participatory modelling can add value to modelling by acknowledging the perceptions of stakeholders and experts across different scientific expertise van den belt 2004 for example the inclusion of the preservation of the cultural heritage as a model constraint is a good example of how the model could account for stakeholders preferences which is very important when addressing sustainable urban planning campbell 1996 the lisbon green surge report santos et al 2015 emphasises the importance of integrating local knowledge by engaging stakeholders in a participatory urban planning processes looking to increase the supply of lisbon s ues this is becoming more utilised in ecological economics and environmental science research due to the emphasis on consensus building across specialised research fields and because of the drive to valorise non marketed socio ecological phenomena such as ues that are often difficult to quantify in geobiophysical units camps calvet et al 2016 de groot et al 2010 hewitt et al 2014 van den belt 2004 however participatory modelling has both benefits and drawbacks for instance it relies entirely on the expertise and perception of stakeholders who may have conflicting objectives van den belt 2004 nevertheless the democratic nature of participatory modelling is a real advantage for framing decision support models especially in cases of limited or poor data quality this makes the model easily transferable to other cities regardless of local data availability and allows for any locally specific conditions to be reflected which might stem from local heritage history and place making pendlebury and porfyriou 2017 5 3 generation of scenario results to support decisions the results from our protected heritage and open scenarios pointed out the trade off between urban residential density and the provision of ues we accounted for this trade off in terms of forgone ues supplies due to preserving the cultural heritage for lisbon this cost was rather low in percentage terms but the model accounts only impacts occurring within the study area and not global impacts the debate between compact versus sprawl cities has been going on for almost twenty years and involved key issues as residential density preferences energy resource savings the efficiency gains from compactness and social equity among others ewing and hamidi 2015 the densification of urban housing seen in our results seems to add an additional argument in favour of compact city planning however the compact city design has to be carefully outlined introducing the necessary measures to improve ues in dense urban fabric through nature based solutions jim 2004 2012 larondelle et al 2014 larondelle and lauf 2016 the model assumes an urban planner with full control over the changes in lulc but this is generally not the case the willingness of certain agents e g residents dwelling in heritage areas to accept the proposed changes may act as a major barrier in the implementation of such a drastic redesign of the city although the model considers conversion costs for the lulc changes the agreements on housing property rights e g relocation of households are not guaranteed and the transaction costs may be extremely high social justice problems for instance concerning unequal access to open space and recreation and the preservation of cultural values should also be accounted for campbell 1996 would the population of lisbon be willing to accept the removal of their historic city centre to make place for natural landscapes as suggested by the open scenario probably not therefore we accounted for this aspect by including the heritage constraint in the optimiser this is a good example of how the model could account for stakeholders preferences which is very important when addressing sustainable urban planning campbell 1996 6 conclusions this paper has illustrated a proof of concept on a combined use of participatory optimisation models to deliver spatial solutions that maximise urban ecosystem services ues through reconfiguration of land use land cover lulc an integrated model has been built for the city of lisbon portugal using a multi objective integer linear programming moilp and involving the participation of key stakeholders to validate and benchmark the selection of optimisation constraints results from the moilp largely allocated shrubland habitats among the grid cells to optimise multiple ues meanwhile the moilp mostly converted those lulc types that are less relevant for ues to continuous urban fabric to maintain sufficient housing capacity the outcome was a landscape mosaic dominated by natural habitats that provide multiple ues and continuous urban fabric with a reduction of commercial agricultural and artificial green urban areas using an optimisation approach has the advantage to identify the lulc allocation that assures the highest ues supply given the defined constraints as illustrated by our case study the optimal landscape pattern may be far off from its actual form and hence difficult to determine without optimisation tools such as the one presented in this paper while this model s constraints are over simplified our results demonstrate that value can be added from such an approach consequently spatial optimisation applied to ues is a valuable tool to explore the landscape design spectrum and stimulate the decision making process in cities additionally the model is simple to use by non modelling experts and the results in the form of maps are easy to communicate to a broad audience the method allows for the evaluation and testing of different scenarios in particular explorative ones which can stimulate the discussion during urban planning decision making these characteristics make the model attractive for its use as part of participatory urban planning processes anywhere in the world including stakeholders in the modelling process helped to understand the specific challenges of the lisbon case study thereby validating the model s benchmarking of objectives and definition of the modelling constraints participatory modelling is recommended as both a way of reaping local expert knowledge while simultaneously engaging stakeholders in the modelling process future work should include a quantitative determination of the economic costs associated with those lulc conversions and optimisations this could be combined with the development of an ues relevance matrix specific to the urban level similar to the burkhard et al 2009 s matrix such an advancement would generate more site specific frames to measure ues quantitatively using physical values meanwhile this would require a more demanding phase of data collection by the model users and thus lose its user friendly and transferable attractiveness eventually such a spatially heterogeneous ues impact matrix would allow for these types of mathematical model to give more meaningful results and allow for robust statistical analysis of the results and lead to more confident ues optimisation modelling results model complexity was balanced to meet the needs of stakeholders and their urban planning objectives while retaining a relevant decision space and constraints furthermore non linearities such as coupled human nature systems and spatio temporal dynamics were not addressed in this study non linear feedbacks between agglomerations of ues supplying lulc configurations may be relevant thus potentially weakening the reliability of applications outside the scope of this study however in highly fragmented artificial landscapes such as lisbon these interactions might be less relevant that in wild landscapes assessing the importance of these spatio temporal dynamics is a future research opportunity which may be illuminated through the coupling of this approach with system dynamics modelling the main innovation of this method is the integration of participatory data collection in a fine resolution spatial optimiser which is highly transferable and user friendly while retaining a certain level of model complexity this can add value to urban planning decision making and stimulate discussion across their various value systems the model can be replicated easily by using an existing lookup table of ues and lulc performance scores and carrying out a delphi survey with local experts to determine a qualitative lulc cost of conversion matrix

25001,the boreal zone of alaska is dominated by interactions between disturbances vegetation and soils these interactions are likely to change in the future through increasing permafrost thaw more frequent and intense wildfires and vegetation change from drought and competition we utilize an individual tree based vegetation model the university of virginia forest model enhanced uvafme to estimate current and future forest conditions across sites within interior alaska we updated uvafme for application within interior alaska including improved simulation of permafrost dynamics litter decay nutrient dynamics fire mortality and post fire regrowth following these updates uvafme output on species specific biomass and stem density was comparable to inventory measurements at various forest types within interior alaska we then simulated forest response to climate change at specific inventory locations and across the tanana valley river basin on a 2 2 km2 grid we derived projected temperature and precipitation from a five model average taken from the cmip5 archive under the rcp 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios results suggest that climate change and the concomitant impacts on wildfire and permafrost dynamics will result in overall decreases in biomass particularly for spruce picea spp within the interior tanana valley despite increases in quaking aspen populus tremuloides biomass and a resulting shift towards higher deciduous fraction simulation results also predict increases in biomass at cold wet locations and at high elevations and decreases in biomass in dry locations under both moderate rcp 4 5 and extreme rcp 8 5 climate change scenarios these simulations demonstrate that a highly detailed species interactive model can be used across a large region within alaska to investigate interactions between vegetation climate wildfire and permafrost the vegetation changes predicted here have the capacity to feed back to broader scale climate forest interactions in the north american boreal forest a region which contributes significantly to the global carbon and energy budgets keywords forest modeling uvafme boreal forest individual based model disturbances climate change 1 introduction high latitude ecosystems account for about 40 of global terrestrial carbon c which is comparable to the global atmospheric c pool bradshaw and warkentin 2015 the fate of these ecosystems is therefore significant for management and monitoring of c stocks and for understanding climate change trajectories surface temperatures in alaska have increased by roughly 2 c in the last 60 years more than twice the rate of warming at lower latitudes chapin et al 2014 melillo et al 2014 overland et al 2016 temperatures in alaska are projected to increase further by as much as 2 6 c in the next 50 years leonawicz et al 2015a this change is dependent however on local scale biophysical interactions and global scale biogeochemical interactions between vegetation disturbances and climate fettig et al 2013 euskirchen et al 2016 providing an imperative to better understand vegetation climate feedback dynamics alaska s boreal forest stores large amounts of c particularly in the soil organic layer and may be especially vulnerable to climate change related disturbances kasischke et al 2010 grosse et al 2011 pastick et al 2017 wildfires are a dominant and integral component of the alaskan boreal zone affecting soil c and the species composition forest age structure and successional state of vegetation viereck et al 1986 climate change within alaska is likely to generate increased drought and longer fire seasons jolly et al 2015 as well as increases in the severity and frequency of fires macias fauria and johnson 2006 kasischke et al 2010 genet et al 2013 vegetation composition structure and biomass within boreal alaska is also highly dependent on soil characteristics such as organic layer depth active layer thickness and plant available nutrients van cleve and viereck 1981 shugart et al 1992 johnstone et al 2010a reciprocally vegetation characteristics influence fire frequency and severity through differences in fuel amount and flammability as well as soil characteristics through species specific effects on litter quality and decomposition rate chapin et al 2006b johnstone et al 2010a combined with uncertainty in the direct impacts of climate change on boreal vegetation barber et al 2000 andreu hayles et al 2011 these interactions between vegetation fire and soils complicate modeling predictions of both current and future vegetation composition and biomass in fact a comparison of 40 terrestrial biosphere models found high uncertainty and variability in both the magnitude and sign of the annual c flux over alaska with some showing the region as a strong sink and others a strong source for c fisher et al 2014 this uncertainty may in part be due to a lack of treatment of individual trees and individual species within these models both of which can be important when considering the interactions between climate fire vegetation and soils kasischke et al 2000 johnstone et al 2010a rogers et al 2015 alexander and mack 2015 a follow on study by fisher et al 2018 cited plant biomass npp gpp and pfts as major missing pieces to the modeling puzzle in the artic boreal region competition between individual trees has also been identified as crucial for understanding vegetation response to climate purves and pacala 2008 as climate and disturbance regimes continue to change these interactive drivers may also result in new species mixtures for boreal alaska that require in turn high resolution species level modeling ecosystem modeling has been used across alaska to investigate the response of vegetation to climate and fire using models such as alfresco tem and ecosys rupp et al 2007 euskirchen et al 2009 genet et al 2013 mekonnen et al 2019 these models represent vegetation as broad vegetation types and may not fully capture the species and tree level interactions between vegetation soil and disturbances or the resulting competitive dynamics at the inherent scale at which they operate i e individual trees individual based forest gap models ibgms which simulate the establishment growth and mortality of individual trees shugart 1984 shugart et al 2018 can aid in predicting these future interactions through explicit simulation of individual tree response to environmental change competition with other trees as well as disturbances such tree level simulation allows for the incorporation of important species and tree size specific interactions with organic layer depth nutrient availability and litter characteristics permafrost depth shading from other trees fire mortality and seedbank seedling response to fires forest gap models include both deterministic processes such as species specific optimal diameter increment growth over time and individual tree growth response to environmental conditions as well as stochastic processes such as stress related mortality and disturbances whereas plot level output represents one potential outcome arising from the incorporation of these processes and interactions the average of several hundred of such plots represents average expected characteristics of a particular forested landscape of indeterminate size similar to a random sampling of forest inventory plots here we define forest landscape as a dynamic mosaic of forest gaps each in its own successional stage at any given simulation year shugart and seagle 1985 which is appropriate for use in the alaskan boreal zone where disturbances result in a mosaic of different vegetation structures and composition across the region payette 1992 through the aggregation of several hundred plots gap models simulate emergent properties of forest landscapes over time such as forest succession cyclical dynamics and forest response to shifting climate and disturbance regimes shugart and woodward 2011 foster et al 2015 shuman et al 2015 shugart et al 2018 when applied at sites spanning large regions or continents they can provide regional estimates of forest characteristics shuman et al 2015 2017 therefore gap models can be used to predict changes in vegetation composition and structure across a wide range of temporal and spatial scales lending themselves to predicting such potential changes within the alaskan boreal zone the university of virginia forest model enhanced uvafme is an individual tree based gap model and is an update and extension of the gap model fareast yan and shugart 2005 uvafme has been successfully applied in the north american rocky mountains foster et al 2015 2017 the eastern us wang et al 2017 as well as boreal russia shuman et al 2015 2017 model output has been validated against inventory data and maps of species composition and vegetation type across all of boreal russia shuman et al 2014 2015 despite its success in simulating boreal russian forests and the relative bioclimatic similarity between boreal russia and alaska initial testing and parameter calibration of uvafme in alaska showed that it did not accurately predict species specific biomass or successional dynamics within the study region in particular the model was unable to adequately distinguish between higher biomass white spruce picea glauca dominated sites and lower biomass black spruce picea mariana dominated sites but rather predicted a mixture of the two spruce species at inventory sites where one was dominant fig a1 a2 in the appendix within boreal alaska the relative dominance of black and white spruce leads to differing and often self perpetuating site and soil conditions johnstone et al 2010a black spruce trees are able to grow and reproduce on thick moist cold soils burns and honkala 1990 viereck and little 2007 and the recalcitrant nature of black spruce litter and resultant buildup of the organic layer leads to the subsistence of wet soils a shallow permafrost layer and black spruce dominance chapin et al 2006b johnstone et al 2010a in contrast white spruce and mixed deciduous sites typically occur on drier warmer sites without permafrost chapin et al 2006b deciduous litter decays more quickly flanagan and van cleve 1983 vance and chapin 2001 leading to a thinner organic layer and thus the persistence of a deep active layer these soil vegetation dynamics additionally impact the fire regime to create lasting legacies of site conditions uvafme did not previously simulate permafrost depth and freeze thaw dynamics dynamic decomposition of different litter classes e g leaves boles branches etc or interactions between litter content and moisture and fire dynamics because the interactions of disturbances moisture permafrost and nutrients are essential to the heterogeneity of species composition and biomass on the landscape van cleve and viereck 1981 chapin et al 2006b johnstone et al 2010b the lack of such relationships likely contributed to the initial inaccuracies in predicting biomass and vegetation type within alaska thus simulation of these interactions is needed in order to predict current forest characteristics as well as forest response to climate change we have updated uvafme to include these crucial relationships and interactions including simulation of daily permafrost depth and interactions with soil moisture and decomposition genus and litter class specific decomposition in response to site and soil conditions as well as impacts and interactions of these drivers with individual tree growth mortality and regeneration we additionally updated the existing fire submodel within uvafme to incorporate the effects of moss and litter characteristics on fire severity and individual tree fire mortality the performance of uvafme following these model updates was tested against data from several locations across boreal alaska the updated model was then used to simulate current and potential future forested conditions across the entire tanana river basin at a 2 2 km2 grid resolution these results highlight the significance of the tree and species scale interactions among important environmental drivers in the alaskan boreal forest and predict the potential future dynamics of this ecosystem 2 methods 2 1 model description uvafme simulates the growth mortality and regeneration of individual trees on independent 500 m2 plots roughly 22 22 m of a forested landscape yan and shugart 2005 shuman et al 2015 foster et al 2017 fig a3 in the appendix while each plot has an area associated with it the plots are not spatially distributed and they do not interact with one another individual tree growth is simulated through annual optimal diameter increment growth calculated using allometric equations with species specific growth parameters table a1 this optimal growth is then decreased according to the current site and climate conditions as well as species specific environmental and resource tolerances i e moisture temperature nutrient shade and now permafrost tolerance trees may die from prolonged low diameter growth or by disturbances trees regenerate via species specific seed and seedling banks which are modified annually based on current site conditions and species specific tolerances daily weather i e mean temperature c cloud cover and precipitation cm is generated via input distributions of monthly minimum and maximum temperatures mean cloud cover and mean monthly precipitation a full description uvafme and all of its equations can be found in foster et al 2017 and on the uvafme website https uvafme github io 2 2 model updates uvafme was updated to improve simulation of forest and ecosystem dynamics within the north american boreal region including updates to the model s climate section 2 2 1 soil moisture section 2 2 3 decomposition section 2 2 4 and fire section 2 2 6 subroutines as well as the development of new permafrost section 2 2 2 and moss section 2 2 5 subroutines 2 2 1 climate uvafme s solar radiation subroutine was initially modified to account for the heightened effects of sun angle slope and aspect at high latitudes rosenberg et al 1983 top of atmosphere radiation is attenuated through the atmosphere and clouds to derive horizontal surface radiation tilt factors based on site topography are then used to calculate the actual solar radiation received at the surface liu and jordan 1962 previously uvafme used extraterrestrial radiation to calculate potential evapotranspiration pet using hargreaves evaporation formula hargreaves and samni 1982 foster et al 2017 however this formula does not account for cloud cover nor does it incorporate the effects of topography on pet rosenberg et al 1983 which is an especially important factor at high latitudes and in areas of complex terrain such as interior alaska the formulation for pet was updated for uvafme to use a modified priestley taylor equation jensen and haise 1963 as in bonan 1989 which uses surface solar radiation rather than extraterrestrial radiation because surface solar radiation depends on elevation slope and aspect liu and jordan 1962 this change additionally allows for topographic effects on pet and thus soil moisture and permafrost dynamics see sections 1 and 2 in supplementary material ii for full description of code updates and equations 2 2 2 permafrost dynamics soil conditions e g moisture n content etc which previously in uvafme were assumed to be equal across all simulated plots at a site were made specific to individual plots in order to incorporate the desired interactions between vegetation soils and wildfire according to this implementation each plot within a site starts with the same initial soil conditions but these values may change from plot to plot as the simulation progresses via differences in vegetation or disturbance occurrences this plot level soil interaction allows the model to more directly capture heterogeneity at the landscape level i e the average of several hundred plots we updated uvafme to include active layer depth and its effect on soil moisture and individual tree growth soil dynamics are modeled as a two layer system consisting of a moss organic layer i e moss decaying litter and soil organic matter representing fibric mesic and humic contents and a mineral a layer for each day in a simulation year the depths of freezing and thawing are calculated using the stefan equation jumikis 1966 which is based on soil moisture depth and bulk density lunardini 1981 bonan 1989 fig 1 eq 1 1 d d r e q q l d s 24 r a b o v e r s 2 where d d r e q is the required number of freezing thawing degree days i e cumulative degrees below above 0 c to completely freeze thaw a layer of depth d s m q l is the latent heat of fusion of the soil layer kcal m 3 and r s and r a b o v e are the thermal resistances of the current and above soil moss layers respectively m2 c hr kcal 1 the latent heat of fusion is calculated based on soil water content and bulk density and thermal resistance is calculated based on soil depth and soil thermal conductivity which in turn is also based on soil moisture fig 1 the required degree days are then compared to simulated freezing thawing degree days modified based on site level topographic characteristics and plot level forest canopy cover to calculate the actual depths of freezing d d f a and thawing d d t a in the soil layer eqs 2 3 2 d d f a d d f c f 2 c s 3 d d t a d d t c t c s where d d f and d d t are cumulative freezing thawing degree days and c f c t and c s are correction factors based on forest canopy cover and topographic characteristics with higher available freezing degree days under dense canopies and north facing slopes and higher available thawing degree days under sparse canopies on south facing slopes supplementary material ii the associated freezing and thawing depths are used to derive the annual maximum depth of thaw i e active layer thickness active layer thickness a l t m is then used to modify individual tree growth by decreasing annual diameter increment growth at varying levels depending on species specific permafrost tolerance bonan 1989 eq 64 in supplementary material ii 2 2 3 soil moisture dynamics as in bonan 1989 active layer depth impacts soil drainage capacity and daily depths of freeze and thaw are used to calculate daily amounts of frozen and liquid water in the organic and mineral layers thus impacting plant available water throughout the year as well as across years via changes in active layer thickness fig 2 as with previous versions of uvafme precipitation inputs either liquid rainfall or snow are partitioned into canopy interception slope runoff r s m and throughfall t f a l l m daily snowpack accumulation and melt s m e l t m are also calculated based on temperature potential water loss via evaporative demand negative or gain via water inputs positive is calculated as p w t f a l l s m e l t r s p e t for each soil layer the amount of water released in soil thawing w t m and water frozen w f m are calculated as eqs 4 5 4 w t z d r a i n d t h a w d t h a w 5 w f w l d t h a w d f r e e z e d f r e e z e where w l is the amount of liquid water in the soil layer m d t h a w and d t h a w are the current and previous days depth of thaw m d f r e e z e and d f r e e z e are the current and previous days depth of freeze m and z d r a i n is a drainage parameter based on the seasonal active layer

daily depth of thaw is also used to modify each layer s saturation and field capacities and wilting point eqs 21 23 in supplementary material ii these values are used to calculate the amount of excess water in each soil layer after accounting for precipitation snowmelt inputs and soil thawing excess water is removed according to a modified equation from botkin 1993 whereby the amount of soil runoff percolation increases as the rainfall water input increases or as the soil layer becomes more saturated eq 24 in supplementary material ii excess water from the moss organic layer is transferred to the mineral layer and excess water from the mineral layer is subtracted as runoff as in previous versions of uvafme if there is a negative water balance i e p w 0 0 from either high pet or low water inputs water is evaporated from the canopy and soil layers until the evaporative demand is satisfied or no more water can be extracted evapotranspiration is dependent on the relative root distribution within each layer eqs 28 31 in supplementary material ii daily soil water contents are used to calculate daily indices of soil dryness and saturation which are aggregated to create annual drought and saturation indices w l m f c w l m p w p used throughout the rest of the simulation in the decomposition moss and tree growth and fire submodels see section 3 in supplementary material ii for a full description of the soil moisture dynamics updates 2 2 4 soil decomposition in order to simulate the interactions between vegetation composition decomposition rate and soil characteristics the existing soil nutrient dynamics submodel was updated based on equations from bonan 1990 and pastor and post 1985 fig 3 previously in the model no distinction was made between different litter types i e branches vs leaves etc and species with the updates made in this version any litter from branch thinning leaf off or tree mortality is added to a litter array depending on its type i e leaf twig small large boles root and moss and or genus for leaf litter each year new litter from each of the types is placed into separate cohorts defined as decaying organic material ranging from initial loose litter to mostly decomposed mesic material that decay until they reach a critical weight at which point they are transferred to either humus for most litter types or well decayed wood for boles cohort decay depends on site conditions e g canopy light level soil moisture permafrost depth and litter characteristics e g initial n and lignin contents see table a2 for example spruce leaf litter has lower initial n concentration and higher initial lignin concentration than does deciduous leaf litter allowing conifer dominated sites to have more recalcitrant litter which decomposes more slowly flanagan and van cleve 1983 vance and chapin 2001 the annual percent weight loss of each decaying cohort is calculated using a combination of equations from bonan 1990 and pastor and post 1985 if the active layer thickness is shallower than 1 5 m the average of eqs 7 and 8 is used otherwise only eq 8 is used 7 p m l o s s b f l a i 0 0052 2 08 p n e 0 898 a l t 8 p m l o s s p p 0 01 f g 0 9804 0

on light availability and leaf litter which act to increase litter decay with increasing light availability and decreasing leaf litter supplementary material ii section 4 this percent weight loss is further modified based on a temperature coefficient q10 relationship and a moisture decay factor that acts to decrease percent weight loss with increasing soil moisture and increasing moss depth supplementary material ii finally as in bonan 1990 weight loss of large boles small boles well decayed wood and twigs are set to 3 10 5 and 20 respectively for all litter types except moss if the percent remaining of a cohort is less than the critical percent remaining calculated as p m c r i t 1 7039 p l i n i t 0 0955 where p l i n i t is the initial percent lignin of the litter cohort table a2 the cohort s weight is transferred to either humus or well decayed wood for moss litter the critical weight loss is calculated as the weight loss required for the current n concentration to equal the critical concentration p n c r i t table a2 eq 48 in supplementary material ii if the cohort is not transferred to humus well decayed wood it remains to decay further the n and lignin concentrations of each decaying cohort are also updated annually as p n g n p n c r i t p m r e m and p l a b m m i n i t where p m r e m is the percent remaining m i n i t is the initial mass of the litter cohort t ha 1 and a and b are input litter parameters table a2 the change in n content as a result of decay δ n tn ha 1 is used to update n immobilization δ n 0 and n mineralization each year δ

routine 2 2 5 moss moss biomass depth and litter amount are also important components of the boreal forest system johnstone et al 2010a moss growth can insulate the soil affecting permafrost depth and can also impact tree regeneration a moss growth subroutine was added to uvafme based on equations from bonan and korzukhin 1989 as in their model moss growth p kg m 2 is simulated as the difference between carbon assimilation and respiration eq 11 11 p s μ m b i o m a r r where s μ is a specific leaf area parameter m b i o m is current moss biomass kg m 2 a r is moss assimilation rate kg kg 2 and r is respiration carbon assimilation is assumed to be proportional to maximum moss biomass productivity reported for interior alaska μ 0 2 kg m 2 van cleve and viereck 1981 and is modified based on plot conditions such as existing moss biomass forest floor light level soil moisture and forest litter eq 12 12 a r μ f s h a d e f c a n f d e c i d f m o i s t f e x t where f s h a d e and f c a

the growth factor f c a n is also based on light availability and acts to simulate the impacts of high light on moss desiccation acting to decrease a r at light levels above 50 the growth factors f m o i s t and f d e c i d are based on soil moisture and deciduous litter amounts with decreasing soil moisture and increasing deciduous litter leading to lower assimilation rates finally f e x t is a light extinction factor which is based on current moss biomass as well as other moss growth and light response parameters see section 6 supplementary material ii respiration is calculated as a

species seedling bank is updated to account for layering and sprouting from species with these abilities see section 8 in supplementary material ii for a complete description of these updates 2 2 6 fire fire in uvafme is probabilistic and based on a site specific fire return interval fri each year any individual plot at a site has a probability i e 1 fri of burning independent of other plots foster et al 2017 shuman et al 2017 when a fire occurs on a plot other plots within the site and other sites are unaffected previously in uvafme fire intensity was also based on an input site specific mean intensity through the explicit tracking of litter type and amount the existing fire subroutine within uvafme was modified such that a proxy for fire intensity is calculated based on litter type and amount and soil dryness bonan 1990 schumacher et al 2006 keane et al 2011 these fire conditions are used to calculate the fire mortality of individual trees as well as to calculate the amount of fire consumption of the litter and humus layers as with previous versions of uvafme foster et al 2017 shuman et al 2017 probability of fire mortality for each individual tree is based on crown scorch c s as well as cambial damage which additionally depends on tree size and bark thickness in this updated version crown scorch is calculated based on schumacher et al 2006 as eq 16 16 c s 100 0 c k 1 c

bole consumption set to 5 fahnestock and agee 1983 schumacher et al 2006 moss leaf branch and bole litter are consumed according to rates used to calculate f a v as in bonan 1990 live roots and root litter well decayed wood and humus are additionally consumed based on soil dryness and moss organic layer depths supplementary material ii for all biomass burned by fire some proportion of n is

by fire and p n is the n concentration of the litter see section 7 of supplementary material ii for a complete description of these updates following code updates we tested these modifications against existing site level observations of solar radiation evapotranspiration permafrost depth soil moisture organic layer depth and snowpack depth at locations across interior alaska see supplementary material ii these tests showed that the model could accurately produce important abiotic drivers within the study region at both annual and daily scales and across a distribution of sites with varying climate topographic and soil conditions 2 3 study area and forest inventory validation sites our study area is defined by the boreal forests within the tanana river basin of interior alaska ak fig 4 as this watershed encompasses most of the field sites used to test the model in this study the tanana river basin is bordered by the alaska range to the south and the mackenzie range to the east it consists primarily of lowland forests of black spruce on poorly drained soils white spruce in well drained areas and upland forests of paper birch and quaking aspen chapin et al 2006b andersen et al 2011 mean annual temperatures vary between 19 c and 1 c with a mean of about 3 c annual precipitation varies between 225 mm in the eastern valley and 2800 mm at the highest elevations with a mean of about 550 mm and with about 35 falling as snow yarie et al 1998 wang et al 2016 inputs to uvafme include climate monthly temperature minima and maxima precipitation and cloud cover site characteristics such as topography and mean fire probability and soil characteristics such as drainage type and soil texture site and climate parameters were derived for 244 testing and forest inventory sites as well as for 28 503 sites within the tanana river basin on a 2 km grid historical temperature and precipitation distributions for these site locations were obtained from climatena v5 50 software wang et al 2016 historical cloud cover distributions were obtained from the climatic research unit cru ts 3 26 dataset harris et al 2014 topographic input data i e elevation slope and aspect for each site were obtained from a 1 km digital elevation model downscaled from gtopo30 data lindgren and kurkowski 2012 at the individual sites soil characteristics i e saturation capacity field capacity and soil texture were obtained from detailed site descriptions and available data on soil texture and drainage conditions yarie 1998 vogel 2007 ruess 2015 at the 28 503 gridded sites these soil characteristics were derived via topography and maps of soil texture from soilgrids and active layer thickness from the alaska landcarbon project see supplementary material i input mean fri was calculated using fire probability maps from alfresco model outputs simulated under historical climate bennett et al 2017 supplementary material i input species characteristics for uvafme include average maximum diameter height and age as well as tolerances to environmental and climate conditions table a1 such input values do not change between simulated sites and thus represent average species characteristics for a simulated domain these input characteristics for the seven main tree species of interior alaska i e betula kenaica b neoalaskana larix laricina picea glauca p mariana populus balsamifera and p tremuloides were determined based on information in the scientific literature botkin et al 1972 burns and honkala 1990 nikolov and helmisaari 1992 chapin et al 2006a viereck and little 2007 keane et al 2011 species range maps were obtained from viereck and little 2007 and used to determine which species were eligible for colonization and growth at each site supplementary material i to assess the ability of the updated version of uvafme to accurately simulate forest dynamics within interior alaska model output was compared to forest inventory datasets within the region fig 4 the cooperative forest alaska inventory cafi dataset contains 227 405 m2 permanent sample plots psps on 77 sites within interior alaska initial sampling date in 1994 all of which have been resampled once and many of which have been resampled two and three times 61 and 42 respectively malone et al 2009 the individual psps represent replicate plots for the sites with each site typically containing three psps spaced 30 63 m apart most of the locations are comprised of mature stands of white spruce p glauca 41 of total biomass across all sites alaska birch b neoalaskana 31 and quaking aspen p tremuloides 19 with some black spruce p mariana 6 balsam poplar p balsamifera 3 and tamarack l laricina 0 01 fig a4 the 67 bonanza creek sites fig 4 are from the bonanza creek long term ecological research station s extended site network between 2008 and 2011 these sites were surveyed to study post fire successional pathways and above and belowground c and n pools alexander et al 2012 alexander and mack 2015 within each site five 20 m sub transects along a 100 m transect were established and within a 5 10 m portion of each transect the dbh of trees taller than 1 4 m and the basal diameter for trees 1 4 m were measured within a 1 m section on either side of each sub transect alexander and mack 2015 most of the sites consist of alaska birch 55 of total biomass across all sites quaking aspen 27 and black spruce 15 with some white spruce 3 balsam poplar 0 3 and tamarack 0 05 fig a5 the 30 gilles creek sites fig 4 were sampled for studies focusing on the effects of wildfires on carbon budgets rogers et al 2014 and microbial communities holden et al 2016 the sites comprised 22 stands which burned in the 2010 gilles creek fire 64 20 n 145 45 w and eight which did not burn species and dbh were recorded for every tree inside a 2 m 30 m transect within each site in late august 2012 in the burned plots pre fire conditions were estimated using the dbh and species of burned trees as is common in wildfire studies e g boby et al 2010 rogers et al 2014 the sites were dominated by black spruce 50 of total biomass across all sites and white spruce 39 with some quaking aspen 11 and alaska birch 1 fig a6 for comparison with uvafme the raw cafi and gilles creek inventory data were processed as in rogers et al 2018 only simulated and inventory trees greater than 0 5 cm dbh for gilles creek and 3 8 cm for the cafi dataset were considered to account for the minimum tree size measured in the inventory data aboveground dry biomass kg was calculated for each measured tree using allometric relationships from alexander et al 2012 for white spruce 3 7 cm dbh balsam poplar 4 1 cm dbh and alaska birch quaking aspen and black spruce ung et al 2008 for white spruce and quaking aspen and lambert et al 2005 for balsam poplar and tamarack for each tree if multiple allometric relationships were applicable the average biomass from the relevant equations was used rogers et al 2018 the relevant allometric equations were chosen for each tree species and tree size based on the philosophy within rogers et al 2018 2014 where the available equations for each tree species were assessed for their biases consistencies and representativeness i e number of samples and geographic location for the cafi sites total species specific biomass was summed for each psp and then averaged across psps for each site for the gilles creek sites total species specific biomass was summed for each site total stem density trees ha 1 was also determined for the gilles creek sites the gilles creek sites were also grouped into white spruce and black spruce dominated stands as in rogers et al 2014 to calculate average species specific biomass and stem density for the two different site types for the bonanza creek sites aboveground biomass for each tree was calculated via allometric equations from bond lamberty et al 2002 and yarie et al 2007 see alexander et al 2012 average stand level biomass was then calculated for each species on each of the sites tree cores had been taken between 2009 and 2011 at 32 of the cafi sites with between two and six tree cores per site mean of four j yarie unpublished data stand ages for these sites were estimated using the age of the oldest tree cored as in johnstone and kasischke 2005 stand age was also estimated from plot scale information and fire history polygons from the alaska large fire database kasischke et al 2002 where the polygons intersected with the cafi plots tree cores were also taken from a random sample of 10 trees at each bonanza creek site these cores were used to estimate the stand age of each site as the average of the ring counts of the 10 cores alexander and mack 2015 no stand age information was available for the gilles creek sites 2 4 model calibration and validation during an initial calibration phase uvafme was applied at 14 cafi inventory sites where stand age was known based on the available tree core data we ran uvafme from bare ground initiation to the estimated stand age and compared modeled species specific biomass to inventory data input species characteristics were modified to maximize agreement between the model output and the inventory data while maintaining realistic values for the input species parameters based on the previous literature review burns and honkala 1990 nikolov and helmisaari 1992 chapin et al 2006a viereck and little 2007 following this calibration phase uvafme output on species specific biomass tc ha 1 was compared to the cafi at the first sampling date bonanza creek and gilles creek sites which included the 14 calibration sites as well as 160 independent validation sites where a stand age estimate was available model output at that age was used to compare to the inventory data and otherwise model output at year 200 was used at individual inventory sites the variance in species specific biomass within each site i e across the site specific psps sub transects site types was quite high average coefficient of variation of biomass ranged from 0 90 to 1 75 fig a7 likely due to the low sample size typically three to five psps sub transects and the heterogeneity of the interior alaskan landscape at a local scale i e 500 m2 forest conditions are impacted by land history and stochastic factors such as seed rain treefall herbivory and other random events shugart 1984 bugmann et al 1996 although uvafme does incorporate stochasticity into the mortality and regeneration processes land history human disturbance and specific stochastic events and their fine scale repercussions cannot be predicted on an individual basis keane et al 2001 hurtt et al 2016 thus the landscape scale output from gap models like uvafme i e the average of several hundred simulated plots at a site represents average expected forested conditions over time similar to an average of a large sampling of replicate forest inventory plots bugmann et al 1996 we therefore compared average species specific biomass across all inventory sites to average model simulated biomass rather than comparing biomass on a site by site basis additionally to determine if uvafme could accurately represent different forest types within alaska we compared average model output at the gilles creek sites to average measured conditions at the black spruce and white spruce site types to account for the lack of site to site comparisons we additionally ran an initialization comparison test at the cafi sites where multiple remeasurements were available we first initialized the model to the first sample date of each individual cafi site using site specific distributions of tree species and site and species specific distributions of stand structure trees dbh size class 1 derived from the cafi data sample year 0 model output was then compared to subsequent cafi remeasurements on a site by site basis this allowed us to incorporate land history effects on species composition and size structure while also testing uvafme s prediction of forest dynamics over time 2 5 climate change application following these model tests we performed a climate change application to predict how forests of interior alaska are likely to change in coming decades future climate data mean monthly temperature and precipitation were obtained from a 771 m resolution cmip 5 five model average for the rcp 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios leonawicz et al 2015a 2015b this climate change prediction covered years 2006 to 2100 and resulted in an average increase in temperatures of about 2 6 c rcp 4 5 and 5 9 c rcp 8 5 and an increase in precipitation of about 119 mm rcp 4 5 and 166 mm rcp 8 5 fig a8 for the tanana valley and the inventory sites for this application we ran uvafme at the inventory sites as well as across the tanana river basin in a gridded wall to wall fashion at 2 km grid cell resolution n 28 503 at each site we simulated uvafme from bare ground initiation each with 200 plots each at 500 m2 to the estimated stand age in 2006 or to year 200 if no stand age information was available and subsequently initiated the climate change application 3 results 3 1 model performance at inventory sites uvafme performed well at predicting species specific biomass across the inventory sites fig 5 and at the black spruce and white spruce dominated gilles creek sites fig 6 a9 across the inventory sites uvafme predicted mostly white spruce picea glauca and alaska ak birch betula neoalaskana a moderate amount of quaking aspen populus tremuloides and black spruce picea mariana and some balsam poplar populus balsamifera uvafme slightly overpredicted black spruce and balsam poplar biomass at these sites though still accurately represented relative species dominance the root mean square error across all species specific biomass was 12 17 tc ha 1 and t tests showed significant differences p 0 05 between inventory and model derived biomass of kenai birch difference 0 99 tc ha 1 tamarack difference 0 054 tc ha 1 black spruce difference 2 83 tc ha 1 and balsam poplar difference 2 51 tc ha 1 before updates were made to the model section 2 2 uvafme could not accurately differentiate between the black and white spruce site types at the gilles creek locations fig a1 a2 however following the addition of soil vegetation wildfire feedbacks the model was able to accurately predict forest succession and vegetation composition at black spruce and white spruce site types at the eight white spruce dominated gilles creek sites uvafme predicted higher biomass of white spruce with lower biomass of ak birch quaking aspen and black spruce comparable to the inventory data though with a fairly high rmse fig 6 rmse 21 48 tc ha 1 however t tests across all species only showed significant differences between inventory and model simulated biomass of ak birch p 0 001 difference 4 84 tc ha 1 uvafme output on stem density at the eight gilles creek white spruce sites was also comparable to the inventory measurements though with some variation showing higher black spruce stem density and lower white spruce stem density rmse 1307 stems ha 1 than was measured t tests did show significant differences between modeled and measured stem density for white spruce p 0 037 difference 1532 stems ha 1 and ak birch p 0 001 difference 717 stems ha 1 at the 22 black spruce dominant gilles creek sites uvafme output on species specific biomass was comparable to inventory derived biomass fig a9 rmse 6 14 tc ha 1 with a slight but statistically significant overprediction of white spruce biomass p 0 0022 difference 6 6 tc ha 1 uvafme output on species specific stem density at the gilles creek black spruce sites fig a9 was overall comparable to the inventory data showing a high density of black spruce stems and a very low density of all other species stems the rmse was fairly high however at 2452 stems ha 1 and t tests showed significant differences between black spruce stem density p 0 027 difference 2131 stems ha 1 and ak birch stem density p 0 025 difference 68 stems ha 1 in general however uvafme predicted a very high number of black spruce stems at the black spruce site types fig a9 and more moderate numbers of stems overall at the white spruce site types fig 6 which is comparable to the inventory measurements at those locations as well as to descriptions of black and white spruce dominated forest stands within the region viereck et al 1983 when initialized to the first cafi sampling date uvafme predicted subsequent remeasurements of species specific biomass rmse 5 33 tc ha 1 and basal area rmse 1 82 m2 ha 1 with high accuracy fig 7 though predicted biomass less well especially white spruce biomass site level comparisons with initialized uvafme output and subsequent cafi resampling e g site 1003 fig a10 showed that uvafme was able to predict species specific biomass dynamics over time these results indicate that the model is able to accurately represent the successional dynamics over time across a wide variety of sites as a result of individual tree interactions with the environment as well as tree tree competition 3 2 climate change with increasing temperatures and precipitation uvafme predicted changes in biomass and species composition both at the inventory locations fig 8 and across the tanana river basin figs 9 and 10 for both climate change scenarios with rcp 8 5 resulting in more extreme change at a broad scale uvafme predicted decreases in biomass particularly for spruce in dryer interior sites fig 9 a11 a14 with a shift towards higher deciduous fraction fig 10 in contrast uvafme predicted increases in biomass at wetter colder sites as well as at high elevation sites these changes in biomass and species composition coincided with increases in atmospheric demand for rcp 8 5 fig a17 soil dryness for both rcp scenarios fig a18 and decreases in soil organic c fig a19 uvafme also predicted a shift in the main growth limiting factor from mainly shade and low temperature stress prior to climate change fig a20 to mainly drought and nutrient stress following climate change fig a21 a22 under extreme climate change i e rcp 8 5 drought stress was the main growth stress for most trees fig a22 however under more moderate climate change i e rcp 4 5 nutrient and drought stress increased for trees over 10 m in height fig a21 these areas of elevated nutrient stress occurred in areas with declining biomass fig 9 indicating that at more moderate levels of temperature increases tree tree competition for nutrients or other resources may play a major role in driving forest change at a local scale forest response to climate change depended on site conditions such as soil moisture active layer depth and organic layer depth as well as species composition fig a23 a30 for example at pre climate change black spruce sites soil moisture tended to be high and active layer depth was fairly shallow fig a24 a25 as is typical for this forest type viereck et al 1983 at these sites the main stressor on black spruce trees was cold temperatures and to a lesser extent low moisture stress fig a26 once temperatures increased cold temperatures were no longer a major stressor for black spruce trees and stress from low moisture also decreased due to increases in precipitation and previously frozen water released from thawing permafrost these site and soil changes resulted in an increase in the growth rate of black spruce individuals and subsequently an increase in overall biomass fig a11 a12 a24 thus at these sites increases in moisture from precipitation and thawing permafrost were able to outpace the increases in temperature and evaporative demand at dryer white spruce dominated sites active layer depth was already quite high i e 1 m and soils were moderately dry fig a27 a28 under historical conditions at these sites the main stressors were already low soil moisture and low nutrients fig a29 thus when climate change occurred increasing temperatures only acted to further increase drought stress via increasing evaporative demand and thus mortality of white spruce and birch eventually occurred fig a27 a29 at many of these sites the trajectories were not linear fig a27 a30 some such as in white spruce dominated and mixed white spruce black spruce sites saw increases in spruce and birch biomass initially as increasing temperatures resulted in increasing vegetation productivity however eventually the increases in evaporative demand and decreases in soil moisture caused decreasing productivity under both scenarios and the eventual mortality of these more drought intolerant species under the rcp 8 5 scenario burns and honkala 1990 nikolov and helmisaari 1992 this shift in biomass trajectories indicates a potential threshold for temperature rise after which moisture stress becomes predominant in contrast quaking aspen a characteristically drought tolerant species was able to grow and thrive in the gaps created by the dying birch and spruce fig a15 a16 a27 a30 4 discussion 4 1 model validation it is clear based on previous field and modeling based studies that interactions between climate vegetation soils and wildfire and any potential future changes to these drivers are crucial components to include in predictions of future forest state in the boreal zone camill et al 2001 hogg et al 2008 trugman et al 2017 fisher et al 2018 rogers et al 2018 indeed it was only until all code updates were finalized that uvafme was able to accurately simulate forest dynamics and characteristics within interior alaska fig a1 a2 even intermediate testing between major updates e g after permafrost soil water updates but before soil nutrient and fire updates still resulted in poor agreement with inventory measurements and expected successional pathways once incorporated into the model however detailed interactions between vegetation soil characteristics and wildfire at the stand and tree level fig a31 lead to realistic successional dynamics and forest characteristics and improved model comparisons to data on forest characteristics figs 5 7 a9 and abiotic drivers supplementary material ii some slight though statistically significant dissimilarities did arise between inventory data and uvafme output fig 5 6 a9 though this existed primarily where the species biomass stem density was low and variability was high in general the inventory measured stem density was quite variable with species specific standard errors ranging from 0 24 to 2 3 times the mean species specific stem density thus lowering the statistical power of these comparisons overall type ii error was 93 for the white spruce and 38 for the black spruce site stem density comparisons this high variability is skewed towards the smaller stems e g mean se stem density of measured black spruce trees between 0 5 and 5 cm dbh at the black spruce sites was 4179 1848 stems ha 1 as a result of the stochastic nature of regeneration and mortality of young trees shugart 1984 shugart et al 2018 regeneration and survival of small stems in interior alaska is influenced by the temporal cycle of seed production zasada et al 1992 fire history johnstone and kasischke 2005 soil characteristics johnstone et al 2010a alexander and mack 2015 and browsing by hares and other animals olnes and kielland 2016 uvafme does include deterministic and stochastic processes to simulate these factors foster et al 2017 yan and shugart 2005 however at a very local scale i e with only an average of 8 22 sites it is not possible to simulate the exact events that lead to the specific number of small stems at a specific location shugart 1984 hurtt et al 2016 additional differences may have occurred due to discrepancies in the input versus the actual fri site level fire probability is a site specific input parameter based on outputs from the alfresco model bennett et al 2017 though in this updated model fire intensity does depend on fuel conditions and moisture and fire probability is tied to climate via an aridity index foster et al 2018 fire occurrence does not interact with site level fuel characteristics i e moisture content geometry flammability etc rothermel 1972 this potential mismatch between input and actual fire probability would have impacted the mortality and regeneration processes at each site as vegetation dynamics and deciduous fraction are tightly linked to wildfire and fuels consumption fig a31 johnstone et al 2010b bernier et al 2016 thus leading to slightly differing biomass and stem density between modeled and actual values future work with uvafme will include prognostic fire occurrence based on fire weather and fuel conditions rather than based on input probabilities the moderate differences between modeled and observed white spruce biomass but not basal area for the initialization test even at year 0 when trees were first initialized fig 7 may be due to the different methods of estimating biomass while the inventory biomass measurements were based on allometric equations only using tree dbh uvafme uses dbh height and canopy depth to estimate biomass yan and shugart 2005 because canopy depth in uvafme is not calculated allometrically but rather decreased based on tree stress throughout its lifetime i e via lower branch thinning initialized trees are given a default value of canopy depth as 30 of initialized tree height as in thonicke et al 2010 this use of a default value when initializing may give rise to discrepancies between inventory and model estimated biomass as opposed to when trees are simulated from bare ground regeneration future work with uvafme will include initialization to current stand conditions via high resolution lidar data foster et al 2019 which will give estimates of current tree height as well as canopy depth wasser et al 2013 alleviating some of these discrepancies uvafme s ability to reliably predict site and forest characteristics at a local scale when confronted with various types of inventory and field data increases confidence in its predictions of forest climate soils interactions under current and future climate scenarios these interactions which are principal drivers of forest dynamics and characteristics within interior alaska johnstone et al 2010a are able to be simulated in a fine scale process based manner due to the tree and species level resolution of uvafme without such fine scale connectivity the individual tree interactions with surrounding trees and their environment cannot be completely represented and important biotic abiotic interactions are not captured fig a1 a2 in the north american boreal zone where such biotic abiotic feedbacks are integral to ecosystem dynamics it is even more crucial that such interactions are included in modeling endeavors within the region additionally following modification of species level parameters based on initial results at the 14 calibration sites see section 2 4 uvafme was not tuned to specific site climate or stand conditions the model was thus able to reproduce accurate local and regional scale vegetation and site soil characteristics with a fairly general parameterization scheme and only a moderate number of parameters such broad applicability of uvafme combined with its fine scale i e tree level detail make it ideal for application across large regions with important multi scale drivers and interactions 4 2 forest response to climate change the future biomass and species composition trajectories predicted by uvafme agree with other broader scale modeling studies in this region for example the state transition ecosystem model alfresco tem similarly predicted overall decreases in spruce forests and increases in deciduous forests euskirchen et al 2016 fig 8 a11 a16 as well as local increases in biomass and coverage of spruce forests with increasing growing season length near cold range boundaries euskirchen et al 2009 fig 9 these results also agree with a recent modeling study using ecosys mekonnen et al 2019 a broad scale ecosystem model which found that nutrient dynamics along with precipitation and fire regime changes were key driving factors of increasing deciduous fraction across alaska under an rcp 8 5 climate change scenario uvafme results highlight the importance of fine scale interactions between site and soil characteristics fig a23 a30 a32 the response of individual trees and individual stands to climate change in these simulations was dependent not only on pre climate change conditions but also on the ongoing successional and competitive dynamics during the climate change application following mortality of drought intolerant spruce trees at interior drier sites fig a11 a14 a27 a30 from increasing evaporative demand a17 declining soil moisture a18 and subsequently increasing drought stress a21 a22 a29 the more drought tolerant and faster growing deciduous species e g ak birch and quaking aspen burns and honkala 1990 chapin et al 2006a were able to grow and reproduce successfully in the gaps created by the dying spruce trees fig a16 a29 under the rcp 8 5 scenario shade stress for ak birch and quaking aspen at these sites decreased indicating that these trees were released from competition as the spruce trees died fig a29 in addition these results show that under moderate temperature increases i e rcp 4 5 tree tree competition for light and nutrients along with drought stress may be a main cause for future tree mortality and species shifts in alaska fig a21 as these resource dependent stressors became more important as climate change progressed such changes in species composition due to shifting environmental conditions were furthered through feedbacks to soil conditions fig a32 following increases in deciduous fraction litter decay occurred more rapidly due to the shift towards deciduous rather than recalcitrant spruce litter resulting in a decrease in the soil organic layer an increase in the active layer and an increase in plant available n fig a32 thus the demographic changes predicted by uvafme fed back to the soil vegetation system leading to lasting changes in vegetation type rather than models that represent plants as groups of vegetation i e pfts a model like uvafme which can simulate these interactions at their inherent scale i e individual trees species is able to represent in detail the structural and demographic changes associated with changing environmental and climate conditions such changes have the capacity to influence further climate change through evapotranspiration albedo surface roughness and other biophysical feedbacks liu et al 2006 beck et al 2011a thus it is important for global land surface models to consider the implications of simulating plants at only a broad pft big leaf scale the initial increase and eventual decrease in spruce biomass in some areas predicted by uvafme fig a27 a30 is also comparable to results from alfresco tem simulations for interior ak zhu and mcguire 2016 which predicted increases in spruce forest area until about 2080 after which sharp declines occur under the a2 climate scenario climate forcing from the canadian centre for climate modelling and analysis coupled global climate model cgcm3 1 in contrast the same simulation with a2 climate forcing from the echam5 the max planck institute s european center hamburg model model which predicted greater temperature increases and smaller precipitation increases compared to the cgcm model as well as to the gcm forcing used in our study showed spruce declines throughout the 2020 2100 time period these results suggest that there is likely a tipping point for increasing temperatures after which the higher atmospheric demand and drying soils outstrip the potential benefits from increased productivity and competition for nutrients light and moisture with more drought tolerant faster growing species increases fig a29 a32 juday et al 2015 climate change results from uvafme are also in agreement with trends predicted by recent remote sensing forest inventory and dendrochronology studies in alaska beck et al 2011b juday et al 2015 ju and masek 2016 trugman et al 2017 pastick et al 2019 remote sensing and dendrochronology records show increasing productivity in cooler more mesic areas and at cold temperature range boundaries beck et al 2011b juday et al 2015 ju and masek 2016 pastick et al 2019 which is consistent with uvafme predictions of increases in biomass at higher elevations fig 9 and in areas with ample soil moisture and shallow permafrost layers fig a18 a25 dendrochronological records however indicate sensitivity of individuals to increasing evaporative demand beck et al 2011b walker and johnstone 2014 juday et al 2015 especially for those at warmer dryer sites uvafme predictions and remote sensing studies show such areas of vegetation decline as a result of drought and fire mortality ju and masek 2016 pastick et al 2019 fig 9 a11 a14 a21 a22 a dendrochronology study by sullivan et al 2017 found that tree response to moisture availability was dependent in part on site conditions such as topography moss cover and organic layer depth uvafme likewise predicted differing vegetation response to climate change based on elevation and site conditions fig a23 a30 these observation based studies along with our results indicate that forest response to climate change will not be linear or homogenous across interior alaska but instead will depend on pre climate change species composition and site conditions a fine scaled model such as uvafme allows for these impacts to be realized and incorporated into simulations across a large domain the uvafme predicted shifts towards higher deciduous fraction figs 8 10 could have implications for climate feedbacks deciduous forests have a higher albedo than do spruce forests beck et al 2011b and thus a shift towards higher deciduous fraction could have a net cooling effect on the landscape liu et al 2006 rogers et al 2013 2015 it is also likely that deciduous forests will store less carbon in the soil due to rapid decomposition and nutrient turnover johnstone et al 2010a alexander and mack 2015 fig a19 thus further interacting with permafrost vegetation and wildfire dynamics additionally because deciduous trees and litter are also less flammable than is black spruce litter johnson 1992 hely et al 2009 this vegetation shift could also modify the fire regime resulting in fewer less severe fires however uvafme also predicted soil drying throughout the region especially under the rcp 8 5 scenario fig a18 which could lead to increases in fire frequency and intensity simulations with alfresco investigating this deciduous fraction fire severity feedback did find a negative feedback between deciduous cover and fire severity though this effect was not strong enough to overcome the climate induced increase in fire frequency when also considering climate warming johnstone et al 2011 future work with uvafme will relate fire ignition and spread directly to litter and fire weather conditions allowing for further interactions between vegetation soils fire and climate the simulations presented here did not include the potential co2 fertilization effect on tree growth it is possible that some amount of drought stress caused by increasing evaporative demand may be alleviated by increased water use efficiency provided by elevated co2 levels sullivan et al 2017 however it is unclear how this mechanism may actually occur in trees and it has been shown that existing models which do incorporate a co2 fertilization effect overestimate biomass albani et al 2006 stemming from a lack of simulation of acclimation to elevated co2 levels thus without a full understanding of how rising co2 levels will impact individual tree growth we chose to leave out this potential vegetation driver future work with uvafme will test methods for incorporating co2 fertilization into the model and will investigate how this additional factor may interact with other drivers of forest change in these simulations with uvafme insect infestation and forest pathogens were also not included studies have shown links between declining quaking aspen growth moisture deficit and insect defoliation michaelian et al 2011 trugman et al 2017 cahoon et al 2018 boyd et al 2019 additionally data on quaking aspen fungal canker infection show that much of the documented quaking aspen mortality can also be attributed to this pathogen r ruess pers comm an ongoing outbreak of the spruce beetle dendroctonus rufipennis kirby in southcentral alaska has caused widespread spruce mortality and carbon losses usfs 2016 the spruce beetle infestations are occurring at a rapidly increasing and northward expanding rate and could potentially move north into interior alaska thus simulations with uvafme presented here must be considered with these important mortality agents in mind uvafme has an existing bark beetle submodel that was applied in the spruce forests of the us rocky mountains foster et al 2018 with results showing strong combined effects of climate and insect infestation future work with the model in alaska will include the effects of the spruce beetle as well as other important insects and pathogens one of the main benefits of using a model like uvafme to study such complex systems is its ability to simulate individual tree and individual stand response to shifting climate and disturbance regimes as well as the landscape scale emergent properties of such responses across large regions bugmann et al 1996 foster et al 2015 shuman et al 2017 shugart et al 2018 5 conclusions because the high latitudes are experiencing an accelerated rate of warming relative to the rest of the globe the boreal zone of alaska is particularly vulnerable to the interacting effects of fire climate soils and vegetation these forests contain a heterogenous mix of climates soil conditions and fire regimes resulting in a mosaic of forest types across the region alternative stable forest types arise as a result of the legacy effects of these interacting forest drivers which are reinforced by species specific tolerances litter characteristics and regeneration strategies climate change however has the capacity to break these legacy effects resulting in novel site conditions and species compositions our results show that these site and species specific conditions are important to consider at an individual tree and stand scale in order to accurately predict both current and future forest dynamics and trajectories we found evidence for declining black and white spruce biomass and increasing quaking aspen biomass as a result of increasing temperatures throughout interior alaska in cool moist areas or at high elevation range boundaries however we found evidence for increasing spruce biomass thus it is likely that the mosaic of forest types within alaska will be altered in the future as a result of changing climate and wildfire regimes and may lead to prolonged biome shifts as these forests are a major component of the global c budget and provide ecosystem service functions such changes will have significant ecological and climate feedback implications regionally and even globally conflict of interest statement the authors declare no

25001,the boreal zone of alaska is dominated by interactions between disturbances vegetation and soils these interactions are likely to change in the future through increasing permafrost thaw more frequent and intense wildfires and vegetation change from drought and competition we utilize an individual tree based vegetation model the university of virginia forest model enhanced uvafme to estimate current and future forest conditions across sites within interior alaska we updated uvafme for application within interior alaska including improved simulation of permafrost dynamics litter decay nutrient dynamics fire mortality and post fire regrowth following these updates uvafme output on species specific biomass and stem density was comparable to inventory measurements at various forest types within interior alaska we then simulated forest response to climate change at specific inventory locations and across the tanana valley river basin on a 2 2 km2 grid we derived projected temperature and precipitation from a five model average taken from the cmip5 archive under the rcp 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios results suggest that climate change and the concomitant impacts on wildfire and permafrost dynamics will result in overall decreases in biomass particularly for spruce picea spp within the interior tanana valley despite increases in quaking aspen populus tremuloides biomass and a resulting shift towards higher deciduous fraction simulation results also predict increases in biomass at cold wet locations and at high elevations and decreases in biomass in dry locations under both moderate rcp 4 5 and extreme rcp 8 5 climate change scenarios these simulations demonstrate that a highly detailed species interactive model can be used across a large region within alaska to investigate interactions between vegetation climate wildfire and permafrost the vegetation changes predicted here have the capacity to feed back to broader scale climate forest interactions in the north american boreal forest a region which contributes significantly to the global carbon and energy budgets keywords forest modeling uvafme boreal forest individual based model disturbances climate change 1 introduction high latitude ecosystems account for about 40 of global terrestrial carbon c which is comparable to the global atmospheric c pool bradshaw and warkentin 2015 the fate of these ecosystems is therefore significant for management and monitoring of c stocks and for understanding climate change trajectories surface temperatures in alaska have increased by roughly 2 c in the last 60 years more than twice the rate of warming at lower latitudes chapin et al 2014 melillo et al 2014 overland et al 2016 temperatures in alaska are projected to increase further by as much as 2 6 c in the next 50 years leonawicz et al 2015a this change is dependent however on local scale biophysical interactions and global scale biogeochemical interactions between vegetation disturbances and climate fettig et al 2013 euskirchen et al 2016 providing an imperative to better understand vegetation climate feedback dynamics alaska s boreal forest stores large amounts of c particularly in the soil organic layer and may be especially vulnerable to climate change related disturbances kasischke et al 2010 grosse et al 2011 pastick et al 2017 wildfires are a dominant and integral component of the alaskan boreal zone affecting soil c and the species composition forest age structure and successional state of vegetation viereck et al 1986 climate change within alaska is likely to generate increased drought and longer fire seasons jolly et al 2015 as well as increases in the severity and frequency of fires macias fauria and johnson 2006 kasischke et al 2010 genet et al 2013 vegetation composition structure and biomass within boreal alaska is also highly dependent on soil characteristics such as organic layer depth active layer thickness and plant available nutrients van cleve and viereck 1981 shugart et al 1992 johnstone et al 2010a reciprocally vegetation characteristics influence fire frequency and severity through differences in fuel amount and flammability as well as soil characteristics through species specific effects on litter quality and decomposition rate chapin et al 2006b johnstone et al 2010a combined with uncertainty in the direct impacts of climate change on boreal vegetation barber et al 2000 andreu hayles et al 2011 these interactions between vegetation fire and soils complicate modeling predictions of both current and future vegetation composition and biomass in fact a comparison of 40 terrestrial biosphere models found high uncertainty and variability in both the magnitude and sign of the annual c flux over alaska with some showing the region as a strong sink and others a strong source for c fisher et al 2014 this uncertainty may in part be due to a lack of treatment of individual trees and individual species within these models both of which can be important when considering the interactions between climate fire vegetation and soils kasischke et al 2000 johnstone et al 2010a rogers et al 2015 alexander and mack 2015 a follow on study by fisher et al 2018 cited plant biomass npp gpp and pfts as major missing pieces to the modeling puzzle in the artic boreal region competition between individual trees has also been identified as crucial for understanding vegetation response to climate purves and pacala 2008 as climate and disturbance regimes continue to change these interactive drivers may also result in new species mixtures for boreal alaska that require in turn high resolution species level modeling ecosystem modeling has been used across alaska to investigate the response of vegetation to climate and fire using models such as alfresco tem and ecosys rupp et al 2007 euskirchen et al 2009 genet et al 2013 mekonnen et al 2019 these models represent vegetation as broad vegetation types and may not fully capture the species and tree level interactions between vegetation soil and disturbances or the resulting competitive dynamics at the inherent scale at which they operate i e individual trees individual based forest gap models ibgms which simulate the establishment growth and mortality of individual trees shugart 1984 shugart et al 2018 can aid in predicting these future interactions through explicit simulation of individual tree response to environmental change competition with other trees as well as disturbances such tree level simulation allows for the incorporation of important species and tree size specific interactions with organic layer depth nutrient availability and litter characteristics permafrost depth shading from other trees fire mortality and seedbank seedling response to fires forest gap models include both deterministic processes such as species specific optimal diameter increment growth over time and individual tree growth response to environmental conditions as well as stochastic processes such as stress related mortality and disturbances whereas plot level output represents one potential outcome arising from the incorporation of these processes and interactions the average of several hundred of such plots represents average expected characteristics of a particular forested landscape of indeterminate size similar to a random sampling of forest inventory plots here we define forest landscape as a dynamic mosaic of forest gaps each in its own successional stage at any given simulation year shugart and seagle 1985 which is appropriate for use in the alaskan boreal zone where disturbances result in a mosaic of different vegetation structures and composition across the region payette 1992 through the aggregation of several hundred plots gap models simulate emergent properties of forest landscapes over time such as forest succession cyclical dynamics and forest response to shifting climate and disturbance regimes shugart and woodward 2011 foster et al 2015 shuman et al 2015 shugart et al 2018 when applied at sites spanning large regions or continents they can provide regional estimates of forest characteristics shuman et al 2015 2017 therefore gap models can be used to predict changes in vegetation composition and structure across a wide range of temporal and spatial scales lending themselves to predicting such potential changes within the alaskan boreal zone the university of virginia forest model enhanced uvafme is an individual tree based gap model and is an update and extension of the gap model fareast yan and shugart 2005 uvafme has been successfully applied in the north american rocky mountains foster et al 2015 2017 the eastern us wang et al 2017 as well as boreal russia shuman et al 2015 2017 model output has been validated against inventory data and maps of species composition and vegetation type across all of boreal russia shuman et al 2014 2015 despite its success in simulating boreal russian forests and the relative bioclimatic similarity between boreal russia and alaska initial testing and parameter calibration of uvafme in alaska showed that it did not accurately predict species specific biomass or successional dynamics within the study region in particular the model was unable to adequately distinguish between higher biomass white spruce picea glauca dominated sites and lower biomass black spruce picea mariana dominated sites but rather predicted a mixture of the two spruce species at inventory sites where one was dominant fig a1 a2 in the appendix within boreal alaska the relative dominance of black and white spruce leads to differing and often self perpetuating site and soil conditions johnstone et al 2010a black spruce trees are able to grow and reproduce on thick moist cold soils burns and honkala 1990 viereck and little 2007 and the recalcitrant nature of black spruce litter and resultant buildup of the organic layer leads to the subsistence of wet soils a shallow permafrost layer and black spruce dominance chapin et al 2006b johnstone et al 2010a in contrast white spruce and mixed deciduous sites typically occur on drier warmer sites without permafrost chapin et al 2006b deciduous litter decays more quickly flanagan and van cleve 1983 vance and chapin 2001 leading to a thinner organic layer and thus the persistence of a deep active layer these soil vegetation dynamics additionally impact the fire regime to create lasting legacies of site conditions uvafme did not previously simulate permafrost depth and freeze thaw dynamics dynamic decomposition of different litter classes e g leaves boles branches etc or interactions between litter content and moisture and fire dynamics because the interactions of disturbances moisture permafrost and nutrients are essential to the heterogeneity of species composition and biomass on the landscape van cleve and viereck 1981 chapin et al 2006b johnstone et al 2010b the lack of such relationships likely contributed to the initial inaccuracies in predicting biomass and vegetation type within alaska thus simulation of these interactions is needed in order to predict current forest characteristics as well as forest response to climate change we have updated uvafme to include these crucial relationships and interactions including simulation of daily permafrost depth and interactions with soil moisture and decomposition genus and litter class specific decomposition in response to site and soil conditions as well as impacts and interactions of these drivers with individual tree growth mortality and regeneration we additionally updated the existing fire submodel within uvafme to incorporate the effects of moss and litter characteristics on fire severity and individual tree fire mortality the performance of uvafme following these model updates was tested against data from several locations across boreal alaska the updated model was then used to simulate current and potential future forested conditions across the entire tanana river basin at a 2 2 km2 grid resolution these results highlight the significance of the tree and species scale interactions among important environmental drivers in the alaskan boreal forest and predict the potential future dynamics of this ecosystem 2 methods 2 1 model description uvafme simulates the growth mortality and regeneration of individual trees on independent 500 m2 plots roughly 22 22 m of a forested landscape yan and shugart 2005 shuman et al 2015 foster et al 2017 fig a3 in the appendix while each plot has an area associated with it the plots are not spatially distributed and they do not interact with one another individual tree growth is simulated through annual optimal diameter increment growth calculated using allometric equations with species specific growth parameters table a1 this optimal growth is then decreased according to the current site and climate conditions as well as species specific environmental and resource tolerances i e moisture temperature nutrient shade and now permafrost tolerance trees may die from prolonged low diameter growth or by disturbances trees regenerate via species specific seed and seedling banks which are modified annually based on current site conditions and species specific tolerances daily weather i e mean temperature c cloud cover and precipitation cm is generated via input distributions of monthly minimum and maximum temperatures mean cloud cover and mean monthly precipitation a full description uvafme and all of its equations can be found in foster et al 2017 and on the uvafme website https uvafme github io 2 2 model updates uvafme was updated to improve simulation of forest and ecosystem dynamics within the north american boreal region including updates to the model s climate section 2 2 1 soil moisture section 2 2 3 decomposition section 2 2 4 and fire section 2 2 6 subroutines as well as the development of new permafrost section 2 2 2 and moss section 2 2 5 subroutines 2 2 1 climate uvafme s solar radiation subroutine was initially modified to account for the heightened effects of sun angle slope and aspect at high latitudes rosenberg et al 1983 top of atmosphere radiation is attenuated through the atmosphere and clouds to derive horizontal surface radiation tilt factors based on site topography are then used to calculate the actual solar radiation received at the surface liu and jordan 1962 previously uvafme used extraterrestrial radiation to calculate potential evapotranspiration pet using hargreaves evaporation formula hargreaves and samni 1982 foster et al 2017 however this formula does not account for cloud cover nor does it incorporate the effects of topography on pet rosenberg et al 1983 which is an especially important factor at high latitudes and in areas of complex terrain such as interior alaska the formulation for pet was updated for uvafme to use a modified priestley taylor equation jensen and haise 1963 as in bonan 1989 which uses surface solar radiation rather than extraterrestrial radiation because surface solar radiation depends on elevation slope and aspect liu and jordan 1962 this change additionally allows for topographic effects on pet and thus soil moisture and permafrost dynamics see sections 1 and 2 in supplementary material ii for full description of code updates and equations 2 2 2 permafrost dynamics soil conditions e g moisture n content etc which previously in uvafme were assumed to be equal across all simulated plots at a site were made specific to individual plots in order to incorporate the desired interactions between vegetation soils and wildfire according to this implementation each plot within a site starts with the same initial soil conditions but these values may change from plot to plot as the simulation progresses via differences in vegetation or disturbance occurrences this plot level soil interaction allows the model to more directly capture heterogeneity at the landscape level i e the average of several hundred plots we updated uvafme to include active layer depth and its effect on soil moisture and individual tree growth soil dynamics are modeled as a two layer system consisting of a moss organic layer i e moss decaying litter and soil organic matter representing fibric mesic and humic contents and a mineral a layer for each day in a simulation year the depths of freezing and thawing are calculated using the stefan equation jumikis 1966 which is based on soil moisture depth and bulk density lunardini 1981 bonan 1989 fig 1 eq 1 1 d d r e q q l d s 24 r a b o v e r s 2 where d d r e q is the required number of freezing thawing degree days i e cumulative degrees below above 0 c to completely freeze thaw a layer of depth d s m q l is the latent heat of fusion of the soil layer kcal m 3 and r s and r a b o v e are the thermal resistances of the current and above soil moss layers respectively m2 c hr kcal 1 the latent heat of fusion is calculated based on soil water content and bulk density and thermal resistance is calculated based on soil depth and soil thermal conductivity which in turn is also based on soil moisture fig 1 the required degree days are then compared to simulated freezing thawing degree days modified based on site level topographic characteristics and plot level forest canopy cover to calculate the actual depths of freezing d d f a and thawing d d t a in the soil layer eqs 2 3 2 d d f a d d f c f 2 c s 3 d d t a d d t c t c s where d d f and d d t are cumulative freezing thawing degree days and c f c t and c s are correction factors based on forest canopy cover and topographic characteristics with higher available freezing degree days under dense canopies and north facing slopes and higher available thawing degree days under sparse canopies on south facing slopes supplementary material ii the associated freezing and thawing depths are used to derive the annual maximum depth of thaw i e active layer thickness active layer thickness a l t m is then used to modify individual tree growth by decreasing annual diameter increment growth at varying levels depending on species specific permafrost tolerance bonan 1989 eq 64 in supplementary material ii 2 2 3 soil moisture dynamics as in bonan 1989 active layer depth impacts soil drainage capacity and daily depths of freeze and thaw are used to calculate daily amounts of frozen and liquid water in the organic and mineral layers thus impacting plant available water throughout the year as well as across years via changes in active layer thickness fig 2 as with previous versions of uvafme precipitation inputs either liquid rainfall or snow are partitioned into canopy interception slope runoff r s m and throughfall t f a l l m daily snowpack accumulation and melt s m e l t m are also calculated based on temperature potential water loss via evaporative demand negative or gain via water inputs positive is calculated as p w t f a l l s m e l t r s p e t for each soil layer the amount of water released in soil thawing w t m and water frozen w f m are calculated as eqs 4 5 4 w t z d r a i n d t h a w d t h a w 5 w f w l d t h a w d f r e e z e d f r e e z e where w l is the amount of liquid water in the soil layer m d t h a w and d t h a w are the current and previous days depth of thaw m d f r e e z e and d f r e e z e are the current and previous days depth of freeze m and z d r a i n is a drainage parameter based on the seasonal active layer

daily depth of thaw is also used to modify each layer s saturation and field capacities and wilting point eqs 21 23 in supplementary material ii these values are used to calculate the amount of excess water in each soil layer after accounting for precipitation snowmelt inputs and soil thawing excess water is removed according to a modified equation from botkin 1993 whereby the amount of soil runoff percolation increases as the rainfall water input increases or as the soil layer becomes more saturated eq 24 in supplementary material ii excess water from the moss organic layer is transferred to the mineral layer and excess water from the mineral layer is subtracted as runoff as in previous versions of uvafme if there is a negative water balance i e p w 0 0 from either high pet or low water inputs water is evaporated from the canopy and soil layers until the evaporative demand is satisfied or no more water can be extracted evapotranspiration is dependent on the relative root distribution within each layer eqs 28 31 in supplementary material ii daily soil water contents are used to calculate daily indices of soil dryness and saturation which are aggregated to create annual drought and saturation indices w l m f c w l m p w p used throughout the rest of the simulation in the decomposition moss and tree growth and fire submodels see section 3 in supplementary material ii for a full description of the soil moisture dynamics updates 2 2 4 soil decomposition in order to simulate the interactions between vegetation composition decomposition rate and soil characteristics the existing soil nutrient dynamics submodel was updated based on equations from bonan 1990 and pastor and post 1985 fig 3 previously in the model no distinction was made between different litter types i e branches vs leaves etc and species with the updates made in this version any litter from branch thinning leaf off or tree mortality is added to a litter array depending on its type i e leaf twig small large boles root and moss and or genus for leaf litter each year new litter from each of the types is placed into separate cohorts defined as decaying organic material ranging from initial loose litter to mostly decomposed mesic material that decay until they reach a critical weight at which point they are transferred to either humus for most litter types or well decayed wood for boles cohort decay depends on site conditions e g canopy light level soil moisture permafrost depth and litter characteristics e g initial n and lignin contents see table a2 for example spruce leaf litter has lower initial n concentration and higher initial lignin concentration than does deciduous leaf litter allowing conifer dominated sites to have more recalcitrant litter which decomposes more slowly flanagan and van cleve 1983 vance and chapin 2001 the annual percent weight loss of each decaying cohort is calculated using a combination of equations from bonan 1990 and pastor and post 1985 if the active layer thickness is shallower than 1 5 m the average of eqs 7 and 8 is used otherwise only eq 8 is used 7 p m l o s s b f l a i 0 0052 2 08 p n e 0 898 a l t 8 p m l o s s p p 0 01 f g 0 9804 0

on light availability and leaf litter which act to increase litter decay with increasing light availability and decreasing leaf litter supplementary material ii section 4 this percent weight loss is further modified based on a temperature coefficient q10 relationship and a moisture decay factor that acts to decrease percent weight loss with increasing soil moisture and increasing moss depth supplementary material ii finally as in bonan 1990 weight loss of large boles small boles well decayed wood and twigs are set to 3 10 5 and 20 respectively for all litter types except moss if the percent remaining of a cohort is less than the critical percent remaining calculated as p m c r i t 1 7039 p l i n i t 0 0955 where p l i n i t is the initial percent lignin of the litter cohort table a2 the cohort s weight is transferred to either humus or well decayed wood for moss litter the critical weight loss is calculated as the weight loss required for the current n concentration to equal the critical concentration p n c r i t table a2 eq 48 in supplementary material ii if the cohort is not transferred to humus well decayed wood it remains to decay further the n and lignin concentrations of each decaying cohort are also updated annually as p n g n p n c r i t p m r e m and p l a b m m i n i t where p m r e m is the percent remaining m i n i t is the initial mass of the litter cohort t ha 1 and a and b are input litter parameters table a2 the change in n content as a result of decay δ n tn ha 1 is used to update n immobilization δ n 0 and n mineralization each year δ n 0 humus decomposition occurs similarly to litter decay using a combination of equations from pastor and post 1985 and bonan 1990 eq 9 9 p m l o s s f m o s t f t e m p f l a i 0 0052 2 08 p n e 0

from fires and n t f a l l is n mineralized from throughfall calculated as 16 of leaf litterfall pastor and post 1985 bonan 1990 the annual organic layer depth m is then updated as the combined weights of leaf twig and moss litter and humus divided by cohort specific bulk density values see section 4 in supplementary material ii for a complete description of the updated soil decomposition routine 2 2 5 moss moss biomass depth and litter amount are also important components of the boreal forest system johnstone et al 2010a moss growth can insulate the soil affecting permafrost depth and can also impact tree regeneration a moss growth subroutine was added to uvafme based on equations from bonan and korzukhin 1989 as in their model moss growth p kg m 2 is simulated as the difference

fire fire in uvafme is probabilistic and based on a site specific fire return interval fri each year any individual plot at a site has a probability i e 1 fri of burning independent of other plots foster et al 2017 shuman et al 2017 when a fire occurs on a plot other plots within the site and other sites are unaffected previously in uvafme fire intensity was also based on an input site specific mean intensity through the explicit tracking of litter type and amount the existing fire subroutine within uvafme was modified such that a proxy for fire intensity is calculated based on litter type and amount and soil dryness bonan 1990 schumacher et al 2006 keane et al 2011 these fire conditions are used to calculate the fire mortality of individual trees as well as to calculate the amount of fire consumption of the litter and humus layers as with previous versions of uvafme foster et al 2017 shuman et al 2017 probability of fire mortality for each individual tree is based on crown scorch c s as well as cambial damage which additionally depends on tree size and bark thickness in this updated version crown scorch is calculated based on schumacher et al 2006 as eq 16 16 c s 100 0 c k 1 c

existing site level observations of solar radiation evapotranspiration permafrost depth soil moisture organic layer depth and snowpack depth at locations across interior alaska see supplementary material ii these tests showed that the model could accurately produce important abiotic drivers within the study region at both annual and daily scales and across a distribution of sites with varying climate topographic and soil conditions 2 3 study area and forest inventory validation sites our study area is defined by the boreal forests within the tanana river basin of interior alaska ak fig 4 as this watershed encompasses most of the field sites used to test the model in this study the tanana river basin is bordered by the alaska range to the south and the mackenzie range to the east it consists primarily of lowland forests of black spruce on poorly drained soils white spruce in well drained areas and upland forests of paper birch and quaking aspen chapin et al 2006b andersen et al 2011 mean annual temperatures vary between 19 c and 1 c with a mean of about 3 c annual precipitation varies between 225 mm in the eastern valley and 2800 mm at the highest elevations with a mean of about 550 mm and with about 35 falling as snow yarie et al 1998 wang et al 2016 inputs to uvafme include climate monthly temperature minima and maxima precipitation and cloud cover site characteristics such as topography and mean fire probability and soil characteristics such as drainage type and soil texture site and climate parameters were derived for 244 testing and forest inventory sites as well as for 28 503 sites within the tanana river basin on a 2 km grid historical temperature and precipitation distributions for these site locations were obtained from climatena v5

aspect for each site were obtained from a 1 km digital elevation model downscaled from gtopo30 data lindgren and kurkowski 2012 at the individual sites soil characteristics i e saturation capacity field capacity and soil texture were obtained from detailed site descriptions and available data on soil texture and drainage conditions yarie 1998 vogel 2007 ruess 2015 at the 28 503 gridded sites these soil characteristics were derived via topography and maps of soil texture from soilgrids and active layer thickness from the alaska landcarbon project see supplementary material i input mean fri was calculated using fire probability maps from alfresco model outputs simulated under historical climate bennett et al 2017 supplementary material i input species characteristics for uvafme include average maximum diameter height and age as well as tolerances to environmental and climate conditions table a1 such input values do not change between simulated sites and thus represent average species characteristics for a simulated domain these input characteristics for the seven main tree species of interior alaska i e betula kenaica b neoalaskana larix laricina picea glauca p mariana populus balsamifera and p tremuloides were determined based on information in the scientific literature botkin et al 1972 burns and honkala 1990 nikolov and helmisaari 1992 chapin et al 2006a viereck and little 2007 keane et al 2011 species range maps were obtained from viereck and little 2007 and used to determine which species were eligible for colonization and growth at each site supplementary material i to assess the ability of the updated version of uvafme to accurately simulate forest dynamics within interior alaska model output was compared to forest inventory datasets within the region fig 4 the cooperative forest alaska inventory cafi dataset contains 227 405 m2 permanent sample plots psps on 77 sites within interior alaska initial sampling date in 1994 all of which have been resampled once and many of which have been resampled two and three times 61 and 42 respectively malone et al 2009 the individual psps represent replicate plots for the sites with each site typically containing three psps spaced 30 63 m apart most of the locations are comprised of mature stands of white spruce p glauca 41 of total biomass across all sites alaska birch b neoalaskana 31 and quaking aspen p tremuloides 19 with some black spruce p mariana 6 balsam poplar p balsamifera 3 and tamarack l laricina 0 01 fig a4 the 67 bonanza creek sites fig 4 are from the bonanza creek long term ecological research station s extended site network between 2008 and 2011 these sites were surveyed to study post fire successional pathways and above and belowground c and n pools alexander et al 2012 alexander and mack 2015 within each site five 20 m sub transects along a 100 m transect were established and within a 5 10 m portion of each transect the dbh of trees taller than 1 4 m and the basal diameter for trees 1 4 m were measured within a 1 m section on either side of each sub transect alexander and mack 2015 most of the sites consist of alaska birch 55 of total biomass across all sites quaking aspen 27 and black spruce 15 with some white spruce 3 balsam poplar 0 3 and tamarack 0 05 fig a5 the 30 gilles creek sites fig 4 were sampled for studies focusing on the effects of wildfires on carbon budgets rogers et al 2014 and microbial communities holden et al 2016 the sites comprised 22 stands which burned in the 2010 gilles creek fire 64 20 n 145 45 w and eight which did not burn species and dbh were recorded for every tree inside a 2 m 30 m transect within each site in late august 2012 in the burned plots pre fire conditions were estimated using the dbh and species of burned trees as is common in wildfire studies e g boby et al 2010 rogers et al 2014 the sites were dominated by black spruce 50 of total biomass across all sites and white spruce 39 with some quaking aspen 11 and alaska birch 1 fig a6 for comparison with uvafme the raw cafi and gilles creek inventory data were processed as in rogers et al 2018 only simulated and inventory trees greater than 0 5 cm dbh for gilles creek and 3 8 cm for the cafi dataset were considered to account for the minimum tree size measured in the inventory data aboveground dry biomass kg was calculated for each measured tree using allometric relationships from alexander et al 2012 for white spruce 3 7 cm dbh balsam poplar 4 1 cm dbh and alaska birch quaking aspen and black spruce ung et al 2008 for white spruce and quaking aspen and lambert et al 2005 for balsam poplar and tamarack for each tree if multiple allometric relationships were applicable the average biomass from the relevant equations was used rogers et al 2018 the relevant allometric equations were chosen for each tree species and tree size based on the philosophy within rogers et al 2018 2014 where the available equations for each tree species were assessed for their biases consistencies and representativeness i e number of samples and geographic location for the cafi sites total species specific biomass was summed for each psp and then averaged across psps for each site for the gilles creek sites total species specific biomass was summed for each site total stem density trees ha 1 was also determined for the gilles creek sites the gilles creek sites were also grouped into white spruce and black spruce dominated stands as in rogers et al 2014 to calculate average species specific biomass and stem density for the two different site types for the bonanza creek sites aboveground biomass for each tree was calculated via allometric equations from bond lamberty et al 2002 and yarie et al 2007 see alexander et al 2012 average stand level biomass was then calculated for each species on each of the sites tree cores had been taken between 2009 and 2011 at 32 of the cafi sites with between two and six tree cores per site mean of four j yarie unpublished data stand ages for these sites were estimated using the age of the oldest tree cored as in johnstone and kasischke 2005 stand age was also estimated from plot scale information and fire history polygons from the alaska large fire database kasischke et al 2002 where the polygons intersected with the cafi plots tree cores were also taken from a random sample of 10 trees at each bonanza creek site these cores were used to estimate the stand age of each site as the average of the ring counts of the 10 cores alexander and mack 2015 no stand age information was available for the gilles creek sites 2 4 model calibration and validation during an initial calibration phase uvafme was applied at 14 cafi inventory sites where stand age was known based on the available tree core data we ran uvafme from bare ground initiation to the estimated stand age and compared modeled species specific biomass to inventory data input species characteristics were modified to maximize agreement between the model output and the inventory data while maintaining realistic values for the input species parameters based on the previous literature review burns and honkala 1990 nikolov and helmisaari 1992 chapin et al 2006a viereck and little 2007 following this calibration phase uvafme output on species specific biomass tc ha 1 was compared to the cafi at the first sampling date bonanza creek and gilles creek sites which included the 14 calibration sites as well as 160 independent validation sites where a stand age estimate was available model output at that age was used to compare to the inventory data and otherwise model output at year 200 was used at individual inventory sites the variance in species specific biomass within each site i e across the site specific psps sub transects site types was quite high average coefficient of variation of biomass ranged from 0 90 to 1 75 fig a7 likely due to the low sample size typically three to five psps sub transects and the heterogeneity of the interior alaskan landscape at a local scale i e 500 m2 forest conditions are impacted by land history and stochastic factors such as seed rain treefall herbivory and other random events shugart 1984 bugmann et al 1996 although uvafme does incorporate stochasticity into the mortality and regeneration processes land history human disturbance and specific stochastic events and their fine scale repercussions cannot be predicted on an individual basis keane et al 2001 hurtt et al 2016 thus the landscape scale output from gap models like uvafme i e the average of several hundred simulated plots at a site represents average expected forested conditions over time similar to an average of a large sampling of replicate forest inventory plots bugmann et al 1996 we therefore compared average species specific biomass across all inventory sites to average model simulated biomass rather than comparing biomass on a site by site basis additionally to determine if uvafme could accurately represent different forest types within alaska we compared average model output at the gilles creek sites to average measured conditions at the black spruce and white spruce site types to account for the lack of site to site comparisons we additionally ran an initialization comparison test at the cafi sites where multiple remeasurements were available we first initialized the model to the first sample date of each individual cafi site using site specific distributions of tree species and site and species specific distributions of stand structure trees dbh size class 1 derived from the cafi data sample year 0 model output was then compared to subsequent cafi remeasurements on a site by site basis this allowed us to incorporate land history effects on species composition and size structure while also testing uvafme s prediction of forest dynamics over time 2 5 climate change application following these model tests we performed a climate change application to predict how forests of interior alaska are likely to change in coming decades future climate data mean monthly temperature and precipitation were obtained from a 771 m resolution cmip 5 five model average for the rcp 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios leonawicz et al 2015a 2015b this climate change prediction covered years 2006 to 2100 and resulted in an average increase in temperatures of about 2 6 c rcp 4 5 and 5 9 c rcp 8 5 and an increase in precipitation of about 119 mm rcp 4 5 and 166 mm rcp 8 5 fig a8 for the tanana valley and the inventory sites for this application we ran uvafme at the inventory sites as well as across the tanana river basin in a gridded wall to wall fashion at 2 km grid cell resolution n 28 503 at each site we simulated uvafme from bare ground initiation each with 200 plots each at 500 m2 to the estimated stand age in 2006 or to year 200 if no stand age information was available and subsequently initiated the climate change application 3 results 3 1 model performance at inventory sites uvafme performed well at predicting species specific biomass across the inventory sites fig 5 and at the black spruce and white spruce dominated gilles creek sites fig 6 a9 across the inventory sites uvafme predicted mostly white spruce picea glauca and alaska ak birch betula neoalaskana a moderate amount of quaking aspen populus tremuloides and black spruce picea mariana and some balsam poplar populus balsamifera uvafme slightly overpredicted black spruce and balsam poplar biomass at these sites though still accurately represented relative species dominance the root mean square error across all species specific biomass was 12 17 tc ha 1 and t tests showed significant differences p 0 05 between inventory and model derived biomass of kenai birch difference 0 99 tc ha 1 tamarack difference 0 054 tc ha 1 black spruce difference 2 83 tc ha 1 and balsam poplar difference 2 51 tc ha 1 before updates were made to the model section 2 2 uvafme could not accurately differentiate between the black and white spruce site types at the gilles creek locations fig a1 a2 however following the addition of soil vegetation wildfire feedbacks the model was able to accurately predict forest succession and vegetation composition at black spruce and white spruce site types at the eight white spruce dominated gilles creek sites uvafme predicted higher biomass of white spruce with lower biomass of ak birch quaking aspen and black spruce comparable to the inventory data though with a fairly high rmse fig 6 rmse 21 48 tc ha 1 however t tests across all species only showed significant differences between inventory and model simulated biomass of ak birch p 0 001 difference 4 84 tc ha 1 uvafme output on stem density at the eight gilles creek white spruce sites was also comparable to the inventory measurements though with some variation showing higher black spruce stem density and lower white spruce stem density rmse 1307 stems ha 1 than was measured t tests did show significant differences between modeled and measured stem density for white spruce p 0 037 difference 1532 stems ha 1 and ak birch p 0 001 difference 717 stems ha 1 at the 22 black spruce dominant gilles creek sites uvafme output on species specific biomass was comparable to inventory derived biomass fig a9 rmse 6 14 tc ha 1 with a slight but statistically significant overprediction of white spruce biomass p 0 0022 difference 6 6 tc ha 1 uvafme output on species specific stem density at the gilles creek black spruce sites fig a9 was overall comparable to the inventory data showing a high density of black spruce stems and a very low density of all other species stems the rmse was fairly high however at 2452 stems ha 1 and t tests showed significant differences between black spruce stem density p 0 027 difference 2131 stems ha 1 and ak birch stem density p 0 025 difference 68 stems ha 1 in general however uvafme predicted a very high number of black spruce stems at the black spruce site types fig a9 and more moderate numbers of stems overall at the white spruce site types fig 6 which is comparable to the inventory measurements at those locations as well as to descriptions of black and white spruce dominated forest stands within the region viereck et al 1983 when initialized to the first cafi sampling date uvafme predicted subsequent remeasurements of species specific biomass rmse 5 33 tc ha 1 and basal area rmse 1 82 m2 ha 1 with high accuracy fig 7 though predicted biomass less well especially white spruce biomass site level comparisons with initialized uvafme output and subsequent cafi resampling e g site 1003 fig a10 showed that uvafme was able to predict species specific biomass dynamics over time these results indicate that the model is able to accurately represent the successional dynamics over time across a wide variety of sites as a result of individual tree interactions with the environment as well as tree tree competition 3 2 climate change with increasing temperatures and precipitation uvafme predicted changes in biomass and species composition both at the inventory locations fig 8 and across the tanana river basin figs 9 and 10 for both climate change scenarios with rcp 8 5 resulting in more extreme change at a broad scale uvafme predicted decreases in biomass particularly for spruce in dryer interior sites fig 9 a11 a14 with a shift towards higher deciduous fraction fig 10 in contrast uvafme predicted increases in biomass at wetter colder sites as well as at high elevation sites these changes in biomass and species composition coincided with increases in atmospheric demand for rcp 8 5 fig a17 soil dryness for both rcp scenarios fig a18 and decreases in soil organic c fig a19 uvafme also predicted a shift in the main growth limiting factor from mainly shade and low temperature stress prior to climate change fig a20 to mainly drought and nutrient stress following climate change fig a21 a22 under extreme climate change i e rcp 8 5 drought stress was the main growth stress for most trees fig a22 however under more moderate climate change i e rcp 4 5 nutrient and drought stress increased for trees over 10 m in height fig a21 these areas of elevated nutrient stress occurred in areas with declining biomass fig 9 indicating that at more moderate levels of temperature increases tree tree competition for nutrients or other resources may play a major role in driving forest change at a local scale forest response to climate change depended on site conditions such as soil moisture active layer depth and organic layer depth as well as species composition fig a23 a30 for example at pre climate change black spruce sites soil moisture tended to be high and active layer depth was fairly shallow fig a24 a25 as is typical for this forest type viereck et al 1983 at these sites the main stressor on black spruce trees was cold temperatures and to a lesser extent low moisture stress fig a26 once temperatures increased cold temperatures were no longer a major stressor for black spruce trees and stress from low moisture also decreased due to increases in precipitation and previously frozen water released from thawing permafrost these site and soil changes resulted in an increase in the growth rate of black spruce individuals and subsequently an increase in overall biomass fig a11 a12 a24 thus at these sites increases in moisture from precipitation and thawing permafrost were able to outpace the increases in temperature and evaporative demand at dryer white spruce dominated sites active layer depth was already quite high i e 1 m and soils were moderately dry fig a27 a28 under historical conditions at these sites the main stressors were already low soil moisture and low nutrients fig a29 thus when climate change occurred increasing temperatures only acted to further increase drought stress via increasing evaporative demand and thus mortality of white spruce and birch eventually occurred fig a27 a29 at many of these sites the trajectories were not linear fig a27 a30 some such as in white spruce dominated and mixed white spruce black spruce sites saw increases in spruce and birch biomass initially as increasing temperatures resulted in increasing vegetation productivity however eventually the increases in evaporative demand and decreases in soil moisture caused decreasing productivity under both scenarios and the eventual mortality of these more drought intolerant species under the rcp 8 5 scenario burns and honkala 1990 nikolov and helmisaari 1992 this shift in biomass trajectories indicates a potential threshold for temperature rise after which moisture stress becomes predominant in contrast quaking aspen a characteristically drought tolerant species was able to grow and thrive in the gaps created by the dying birch and spruce fig a15 a16 a27 a30 4 discussion 4 1 model validation it is clear based on previous field and modeling based studies that interactions between climate vegetation soils and wildfire and any potential future changes to these drivers are crucial components to include in predictions of future forest state in the boreal zone camill et al 2001 hogg et al 2008 trugman et al 2017 fisher et al 2018 rogers et al 2018 indeed it was only until all code updates were finalized that uvafme was able to accurately simulate forest dynamics and characteristics within interior alaska fig a1 a2 even intermediate testing between major updates e g after permafrost soil water updates but before soil nutrient and fire updates still resulted in poor agreement with inventory measurements and expected successional pathways once incorporated into the model however detailed interactions between vegetation soil characteristics and wildfire at the stand and tree level fig a31 lead to realistic successional dynamics and forest characteristics and improved model comparisons to data on forest characteristics figs 5 7 a9 and abiotic drivers supplementary material ii some slight though statistically significant dissimilarities did arise between inventory data and uvafme output fig 5 6 a9 though this existed primarily where the species biomass stem density was low and variability was high in general the inventory measured stem density was quite variable with species specific standard errors ranging from 0 24 to 2 3 times the mean species specific stem density thus lowering the statistical power of these comparisons overall type ii error was 93 for the white spruce and 38 for the black spruce site stem density comparisons this high variability is skewed towards the smaller stems e g mean se stem density of measured black spruce trees between 0 5 and 5 cm dbh at the black spruce sites was 4179 1848 stems ha 1 as a result of the stochastic nature of regeneration and mortality of young trees shugart 1984 shugart et al 2018 regeneration and survival of small stems in interior alaska is influenced by the temporal cycle of seed production zasada et al 1992 fire history johnstone and kasischke 2005 soil characteristics johnstone et al 2010a alexander and mack 2015 and browsing by hares and other animals olnes and kielland 2016 uvafme does include deterministic and stochastic processes to simulate these factors foster et al 2017 yan and shugart 2005 however at a very local scale i e with only an average of 8 22 sites it is not possible to simulate the exact events that lead to the specific number of small stems at a specific location shugart 1984 hurtt et al 2016 additional differences may have occurred due to discrepancies in the input versus the actual fri site level fire probability is a site specific input parameter based on outputs from the alfresco model bennett et al 2017 though in this updated model fire intensity does depend on fuel conditions and moisture and fire probability is tied to climate via an aridity index foster et al 2018 fire occurrence does not interact with site level fuel characteristics i e moisture content geometry flammability etc rothermel 1972 this potential mismatch between input and actual fire probability would have impacted the mortality and regeneration processes at each site as vegetation dynamics and deciduous fraction are tightly linked to wildfire and fuels consumption fig a31 johnstone et al 2010b bernier et al 2016 thus leading to slightly differing biomass and stem density between modeled and actual values future work with uvafme will include prognostic fire occurrence based on fire weather and fuel conditions rather than based on input probabilities the moderate differences between modeled and observed white spruce biomass but not basal area for the initialization test even at year 0 when trees were first initialized fig 7 may be due to the different methods of estimating biomass while the inventory biomass measurements were based on allometric equations only using tree dbh uvafme uses dbh height and canopy depth to estimate biomass yan and shugart 2005 because canopy depth in uvafme is not calculated allometrically but rather decreased based on tree stress throughout its lifetime i e via lower branch thinning initialized trees are given a default value of canopy depth as 30 of initialized tree height as in thonicke et al 2010 this use of a default value when initializing may give rise to discrepancies between inventory and model estimated biomass as opposed to when trees are simulated from bare ground regeneration future work with uvafme will include initialization to current stand conditions via high resolution lidar data foster et al 2019 which will give estimates of current tree height as well as canopy depth wasser et al 2013 alleviating some of these discrepancies uvafme s ability to reliably predict site and forest characteristics at a local scale when confronted with various types of inventory and field data increases confidence in its predictions of forest climate soils interactions under current and future climate scenarios these interactions which are principal drivers of forest dynamics and characteristics within interior alaska johnstone et al 2010a are able to be simulated in a fine scale process based manner due to the tree and species level resolution of uvafme without such fine scale connectivity the individual tree interactions with surrounding trees and their environment cannot be completely represented and important biotic abiotic interactions are not captured fig a1 a2 in the north american boreal zone where such biotic abiotic feedbacks are integral to ecosystem dynamics it is even more crucial that such interactions are included in modeling endeavors within the region additionally following modification of species level parameters based on initial results at the 14 calibration sites see section 2 4 uvafme was not tuned to specific site climate or stand conditions the model was thus able to reproduce accurate local and regional scale vegetation and site soil characteristics with a fairly general parameterization scheme and only a moderate number of parameters such broad applicability of uvafme combined with its fine scale i e tree level detail make it ideal for application across large regions with important multi scale drivers and interactions 4 2 forest response to climate change the future biomass and species composition trajectories predicted by uvafme agree with other broader scale modeling studies in this region for example the state transition ecosystem model alfresco tem similarly predicted overall decreases in spruce forests and increases in deciduous forests euskirchen et al 2016 fig 8 a11 a16 as well as local increases in biomass and coverage of spruce forests with increasing growing season length near cold range boundaries euskirchen et al 2009 fig 9 these results also agree with a recent modeling study using ecosys mekonnen et al 2019 a broad scale ecosystem model which found that nutrient dynamics along with precipitation and fire regime changes were key driving factors of increasing deciduous fraction across alaska under an rcp 8 5 climate change scenario uvafme results highlight the importance of fine scale interactions between site and soil characteristics fig a23 a30 a32 the response of individual trees and individual stands to climate change in these simulations was dependent not only on pre climate change conditions but also on the ongoing successional and competitive dynamics during the climate change application following mortality of drought intolerant spruce trees at interior drier sites fig a11 a14 a27 a30 from increasing evaporative demand a17 declining soil moisture a18 and subsequently increasing drought stress a21 a22 a29 the more drought tolerant and faster growing deciduous species e g ak birch and quaking aspen burns and honkala 1990 chapin et al 2006a were able to grow and reproduce successfully in the gaps created by the dying spruce trees fig a16 a29 under the rcp 8 5 scenario shade stress for ak birch and quaking aspen at these sites decreased indicating that these trees were released from competition as the spruce trees died fig a29 in addition these results show that under moderate temperature increases i e rcp 4 5 tree tree competition for light and nutrients along with drought stress may be a main cause for future tree mortality and species shifts in alaska fig a21 as these resource dependent stressors became more important as climate change progressed such changes in species composition due to shifting environmental conditions were furthered through feedbacks to soil conditions fig a32 following increases in deciduous fraction litter decay occurred more rapidly due to the shift towards deciduous rather than recalcitrant spruce litter resulting in a decrease in the soil organic layer an increase in the active layer and an increase in plant available n fig a32 thus the demographic changes predicted by uvafme fed back to the soil vegetation system leading to lasting changes in vegetation type rather than models that represent plants as groups of vegetation i e pfts a model like uvafme which can simulate these interactions at their inherent scale i e individual trees species is able to represent in detail the structural and demographic changes associated with changing environmental and climate conditions such changes have the capacity to influence further climate change through evapotranspiration albedo surface roughness and other biophysical feedbacks liu et al 2006 beck et al 2011a thus it is important for global land surface models to consider the implications of simulating plants at only a broad pft big leaf scale the initial increase and eventual decrease in spruce biomass in some areas predicted by uvafme fig a27 a30 is also comparable to results from alfresco tem simulations for interior ak zhu and mcguire 2016 which predicted increases in spruce forest area until about 2080 after which sharp declines occur under the a2 climate scenario climate forcing from the canadian centre for climate modelling and analysis coupled global climate model cgcm3 1 in contrast the same simulation with a2 climate forcing from the echam5 the max planck institute s european center hamburg model model which predicted greater temperature increases and smaller precipitation increases compared to the cgcm model as well as to the gcm forcing used in our study showed spruce declines throughout the 2020 2100 time period these results suggest that there is likely a tipping point for increasing temperatures after which the higher atmospheric demand and drying soils outstrip the potential benefits from increased productivity and competition for nutrients light and moisture with more drought tolerant faster growing species increases fig a29 a32 juday et al 2015 climate change results from uvafme are also in agreement with trends predicted by recent remote sensing forest inventory and dendrochronology studies in alaska beck et al 2011b juday et al 2015 ju and masek 2016 trugman et al 2017 pastick et al 2019 remote sensing and dendrochronology records show increasing productivity in cooler more mesic areas and at cold temperature range boundaries beck et al 2011b juday et al 2015 ju and masek 2016 pastick et al 2019 which is consistent with uvafme predictions of increases in biomass at higher elevations fig 9 and in areas with ample soil moisture and shallow permafrost layers fig a18 a25 dendrochronological records however indicate sensitivity of individuals to increasing evaporative demand beck et al 2011b walker and johnstone 2014 juday et al 2015 especially for those at warmer dryer sites uvafme predictions and remote sensing studies show such areas of vegetation decline as a result of drought and fire mortality ju and masek 2016 pastick et al 2019 fig 9 a11 a14 a21 a22 a dendrochronology study by sullivan et al 2017 found that tree response to moisture availability was dependent in part on site conditions such as topography moss cover and organic layer depth uvafme likewise predicted differing vegetation response to climate change based on elevation and site conditions fig a23 a30 these observation based studies along with our results indicate that forest response to climate change will not be linear or homogenous across interior alaska but instead will depend on pre climate change species composition and site conditions a fine scaled model such as uvafme allows for these impacts to be realized and incorporated into simulations across a large domain the uvafme predicted shifts towards higher deciduous fraction figs 8 10 could have implications for climate feedbacks deciduous forests have a higher albedo than do spruce forests beck et al 2011b and thus a shift towards higher deciduous fraction could have a net cooling effect on the landscape liu et al 2006 rogers et al 2013 2015 it is also likely that deciduous forests will store less carbon in the soil due to rapid decomposition and nutrient turnover johnstone et al 2010a alexander and mack 2015 fig a19 thus further interacting with permafrost vegetation and wildfire dynamics additionally because deciduous trees and litter are also less flammable than is black spruce litter johnson 1992 hely et al 2009 this vegetation shift could also modify the fire regime resulting in fewer less severe fires however uvafme also predicted soil drying throughout the region especially under the rcp 8 5 scenario fig a18 which could lead to increases in fire frequency and intensity simulations with alfresco investigating this deciduous fraction fire severity feedback did find a negative feedback between deciduous cover and fire severity though this effect was not strong enough to overcome the climate induced increase in fire frequency when also considering climate warming johnstone et al 2011 future work with uvafme will relate fire ignition and spread directly to litter and fire weather conditions allowing for further interactions between vegetation soils fire and climate the simulations presented here did not include the potential co2 fertilization effect on tree growth it is possible that some amount of drought stress caused by increasing evaporative demand may be alleviated by increased water use efficiency provided by elevated co2 levels sullivan et al 2017 however it is unclear how this mechanism may actually occur in trees and it has been shown that existing models which do incorporate a co2 fertilization effect overestimate biomass albani et al 2006 stemming from a lack of simulation of acclimation to elevated co2 levels thus without a full understanding of how rising co2 levels will impact individual tree growth we chose to leave out this potential vegetation driver future work with uvafme will test methods for incorporating co2 fertilization into the model and will investigate how this additional factor may interact with other drivers of forest change in these simulations with uvafme insect infestation and forest pathogens were also not included studies have shown links between declining quaking aspen growth moisture deficit and insect defoliation michaelian et al 2011 trugman et al 2017 cahoon et al 2018 boyd et al 2019 additionally data on quaking aspen fungal canker infection show that much of the documented quaking aspen mortality can also be attributed to this pathogen r ruess pers comm an ongoing outbreak of the spruce beetle dendroctonus rufipennis kirby in southcentral alaska has caused widespread spruce mortality and carbon losses usfs 2016 the spruce beetle infestations are occurring at a rapidly increasing and northward expanding rate and could potentially move north into interior alaska thus simulations with uvafme presented here must be considered with these important mortality agents in mind uvafme has an existing bark beetle submodel that was applied in the spruce forests of the us rocky mountains foster et al 2018 with results showing strong combined effects of climate and insect infestation future work with the model in alaska will include the effects of the spruce beetle as well as other important insects and pathogens one of the main benefits of using a model like uvafme to study such complex systems is its ability to simulate individual tree and individual stand response to shifting climate and disturbance regimes as well as the landscape scale emergent properties of such responses across large regions bugmann et al 1996 foster et al 2015 shuman et al 2017 shugart et al 2018 5 conclusions because the high latitudes are experiencing an accelerated rate of warming relative to the rest of the globe the boreal zone of alaska is particularly vulnerable to the interacting effects of fire climate soils and vegetation these forests contain a heterogenous mix of climates soil conditions and fire regimes resulting in a mosaic of forest types across the region alternative stable forest types arise as a result of the legacy effects of these interacting forest drivers which are reinforced by species specific tolerances litter characteristics and regeneration strategies climate change however has the capacity to break these legacy effects resulting in novel site conditions and species compositions our results show that these site and species specific conditions are important to consider at an individual tree and stand scale in order to accurately predict both current and future forest dynamics and trajectories we found evidence for declining black and white spruce biomass and increasing quaking aspen biomass as a result of increasing temperatures throughout interior alaska in cool moist areas or at high elevation range boundaries however we found evidence for increasing spruce biomass thus it is likely that the mosaic of forest types within alaska will be altered in the future as a result of changing climate and wildfire regimes and may lead to prolonged biome shifts as these forests are a major component of the global c budget and provide ecosystem service functions such changes will have significant ecological and climate feedback implications regionally and even globally conflict of interest statement the authors declare no

25002,this paper emphasizes the integration of ecology and ecotoxicology the main objective is to present the development of an early warning tool for environmental risk assessment first a reference ecological network of a plankton community was built from in situ flow cytometry data next a set of fuzzy ecotoxicological rules to explain impacts from three pollutants were constructed from the scientific literature and expert knowledge these rules were applied to the plankton network to simulate disturbance and produce an impacted network network indices were used to assess the consequences of this simulated disturbance and a regime shift in the planktonic system was noted coastal zone ecosystem managers could use this type of model to anticipate early warnings in disturbance scenarios allowing estimates of possible impacts to the marine ecosystem keywords environmental management ecological networks simulation ecotoxicological rules risk assessment 1 introduction degradation of natural resources is currently a critical issue and aquatic ecosystems are the fate of many pollutants societies have become increasingly concerned about the possible impacts of chemicals to which humans and organisms are exposed it led the world health organization to publish guidelines and recommendations unesco who unep 1996 to integrate health risk assessment and management into strategies and programs for nature conservation and biological diversity promotion therefore the term ecological health has been used to describe both human health and environmental conditions and is inextricably tied to concepts of biological diversity and ecosystem integrity de leo and levin 1997 ulanowicz 1995 karr 1993 the maintenance and protection of ecological health depend on the use of ecologically robust approaches in environmental management programs borja et al 2008 in coastal ecosystems for instance a wide range of pollutants has been identified islam and tanaka 2004 and efforts have been taken worldwide to achieve an integrated coastal zone management sorensen 1993 some methods based on a large variety of bioindicators carignan and villard 2002 holt and miller 2010 and biotic indices abbasi and abbasi 2011 are used to evaluate water quality while the former ranges from the biochemistry of an organism to emergent properties of complex communities the latter summarizes features of different elements of the ecosystem into a single value all species or assemblages tolerate a limited range of chemical physical and biological conditions thereby used as bioindicators in this way singh et al 2013 has reported planktonic indicators as a promising tool for early warning signals plankton is a huge complex dynamic system for which all mechanisms are not completely understood yet their components are important as they play critical roles providing ecosystem processes and services e g primary productivity nutrient cycling decomposition etc through a tricky network of diverse interactions according to their life strategies worden et al 2015 detrimental effects of many xenobiotics may affect these organisms interactions and processes and it is complex and time consuming to get a clear perception of the potential risk or impact of chemicals in the environment since the 1970s when scientific modelling arises as a tool for environmental management at least three main types emerged namely dynamic population models may 1974 dynamic biogeochemical models jørgensen 1986 and static models jørgensen and bendoricchio 2001 however due to the complexity of natural systems and inherent uncertainties in ecosystem management decision makers combine ecological expertise and site specific data therefore artificial intelligence approaches such as inductive logic programming srinivasana et al 1996 support vector inductive logic programming amini et al 2007 qualitative or quantitative structure activity relationships cronin et al 2003 oecd 2007 artificial neural network devillers 2008 toxicogenomic prediction by association rule mining nagata et al 2014 and expert systems raies and bajic 2016 have been developed this paper emphasizes the integration of the knowledges coming from ecotoxicology and ecology studies initially a planktonic ecological network was built from in situ flow cytometry data secondly ecotoxicological data were compiled from laboratory in situ microcosm and mesocosms bioassays from literature and public databases to make a fuzzy knowledge base specifically this work aims i to apply fuzzy ecotoxicological rules to prune the ecological network ii to simulate disturbances of three pollutants on the network and iii to evaluate such disturbances using general ecological network analysis ena indexes in order to help decision making process in coastal zone ecosystem management for simplicity mortality is the single endpoint used which implies a decrease in abundance of individual groups within the network sub lethal effects are not considered therefore the novelty of this paper is the proposal of an integrative approach to environmental analysis and management of aquatic systems in general by means of complex network modelling and fuzzy logic a planktonic trophic network is generated and pruned to perform realistic simulations and interpretations 2 material and methods 2 1 study site description the ilha grande bay fig 1 is a major tourist hub in the southern of rio de janeiro state brazil with a large number of coves beaches and islands its shores are mountainous with a dense rainforest whose slopes plunge into the sea along with streams coming from distant agricultural areas the bottom of the bay consists mainly of sludge with more than 50 of clay and silt and a gradual contact with fine and coarse sands ceccopieri 2001 although this estuary is considered as a biodiversity hotspot and includes high number of protected areas creed et al 2007 the port of itaguaí many marinas an oil terminal tebig a shipyard two nuclear power plants for electricity generation an expanding industrial park and cluttered urban occupation are installed around the bay therefore pollution has increased significantly in the region over the last decades molisani et al 2004 worsening the degradation scenario this area cannot be treated as pristine neither as site of reference indeed all similar environments present different but high degree of anthropic influence in the brazilian southeastern coast 2 2 overall ecological risk assessment a conceptual framework for potential ecological risk assessment era in aquatic ecosystem is presented in fig 2 it first identifies flow cytometry signatures of planktonic organisms by means of artificial neural networks ann pereira and ebecken 2011 next a search for toxicity data related to the organisms identified are performed in literature vera et al 2010 stachowski haberkorna et al 2008 pérez et al 2007 hjorth et al 2006 and 2007 and public databases ecotox https cfpub epa gov ecotox and ecetoc http www ecetoc org links ecotox database these data are compared to the maximum permissible concentration according to brazilian regulatory standards conama 2005 to build a fuzzy ecotoxicological rules base in the meantime an algorithm andrade et al 2016 uses the categorized data of identified organisms to develop a complex ecological network cen further in order to perform a simulation of disturbance on the cen the fuzzy ecotoxicological rules are applied as pruning criteria which leads the network to assume a new topology due to changes in abundances of their groups these changes increases or decreases are interpreted as growth partial mortality or elimination of such populations finally both network topologies were characterized and compared by structural and functional indexes kones et al 2009 it should be clear that the choice of pollutant concentrations to perform simulation is empirical rather than measuring them in water this approach allows simulations and comparisons of a single pollutant or a mixture of them cumulative effect since they do not occur alone in nature 2 3 data acquisition 2 3 1 field monitoring data the choice of the sampling location 23 01 59 9 s 44 21 25 8 w as indicated in fig 1 has considered i its strategic position and ii the hydrodynamic pattern as reported by the sisbahia base system of environmental hydrodynamics sisbahia 2019 to evaluate physical and chemical characteristics of seawater in situ measurements of temperature 24 50c salinity 33 ph 8 5 and oxygen concentration 6 6 mg l were performed and a sample was also obtained to set nutrients no3 no2 nh4 and po3 as 1 79 mg l 1 0 15 mg l 1 0 21 mg l 1 and 0 12 mg l 1 respectively strickland and parsons 1968 all these parameters are in accordance with patterns established by the conama act 357 2005 for class 5 marine conama 2005 plankton data were acquired from in situ monitoring three samples with 10 min interval using the high frequency submersible cytosence scanning flow cytometry cytobuoy bv woerden the netherlands which includes suspended cells tiny organisms and non biological elements ranging in size from 0 2 μm to 900 μm as particles cross a laser beam 488 nm they are characterized by individual pulse shape profiles and 45 descriptors the pulse shape profiles are formed by the forward scatter fws and the side scatter sws signals which provide information about size and shape of each particle and three in vivo fluorescences fl red flr 668 734 nm

as indicated by the hydrodynamic model sisbahia 2 3 2 toxicants and toxicity data this work analyzes the potential effects of three chemical products with different uses and physical chemical properties of great environmental interest the first pollutant is the anti fouling zinc pyrithione zpt recently introduced into the marine environment it is a lipophilic organo metal complex in which the zinc ion is complex bound to two pyrithione groups it has been found to be highly toxic to aquatic organisms especially algae onduka et al 2007 at low concentrations and rapidly photodegraded in the water column zhou et al 2018 even though seasonal effects of zpt have also been reported maraldo and dahllöfa 2004 here the combined effects of cpt copper pyrithione are not considered the second stressor is the pyrene a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon pah since it constitutes one of the most toxic components of oil in the marine biota and may persist in the water column yamada et al 2003 yu 2002 coming from point sources such as oil spills and diffuse sources such as atmospheric deposition the third toxicant is the herbicide glyphosate monsanto saint louis mo usa an organophosphorus compound extensively used in agriculture as a broad spectrum systemic herbicide which kills plants by inhibiting epsps enzyme synthesis in the shikimate pathway gomes et al 2014 and which can also persist in seawater mercurio et al 2014 the values concerning to pnecs lc5 ec5 u s environmental protection agency epa 2005 and lc50 ec50 of the above chemicals were collected or calculated to build fuzzy ecotoxicological rules in the case of field data in situ microcosm or mesocosm toxicity which are obviously preferred the magnitude of the assessment factor is specific and has followed the recommendations of the technical guidance document on risk assessment european commission 2003 and the environmental risk assessment unep ipcs 1999 2 4 models generation 2 4 1 species sensitivity distributions ssd almost all species or assemblages tolerate a limited range of chemical physical and biological conditions the species sensitivity distribution ssd became an important tool to assess ecotoxicological threats to biodiversity king et al 2015 despite demanding high quality data to deal with sensitivity variability among individuals and species and to extend it to a more comprehensive form specific ssd values are calculated for each group belonging to the ecological network an ssd curve establishes a function between the concentration of a chemical and the effects it causes on organisms garner et al 2015 as reported by wheele et al 2002 an ssd typically follows a log normal or log logistic model in which the hc5 endpoint is extrapolated in this paper the ssd generator provided by the us epa is used and its toxicity data fits to a commonly log probit i e linearized log normal distribution each species exhibits a different response to a stressor 2 4 2 fuzzy ecotoxicological rule based model due to the different modes of pollutant actions and the non linear sensitivity among and between individuals and groups of species a knowledge representation scheme is crucial to simulate the effect of chemicals on plankton to deal with the uncertainties related to the understanding of how relevant the concentration of a pollutant is and its impact on the studied groups fuzzy modeling is suited ross 2017 because it provides tools to cope with subjective concepts like high concentration or moderately toxic in fuzzy modeling a variable of a problem is partitioned into sets which are characterized by fuzzy membership functions fig 3 these functions inform the degrees of membership between 0 and 1 for each possible value of the variable thus the fuzzy approach allows the interpretation that the concentration of a given pollutant is as low medium or high for example for each pair of pollutant species group a ssd curve is generated and it yields a table with two variables the proportion of species affected and the estimated log scaled concentrations of a pollutant for each pollutant the concentration variable is partitioned into three fuzzy sets low medium and high and the mortality variable into five fuzzy sets nontoxic slightly toxic marginally toxic moderately toxic and highly toxic these partitions are presented in fig 3a and 3b in which values a b and c are defined as the minima of lc5 ec5 lc50 ec50 and lc95 ec95 for the studied groups affected by a given pollutant respectively the mortality values d h were defined empirically in this work from these fuzzy sets a rule base is obtained using wang and mendel 1992 algorithm these fuzzy rules are very simple since they have only one condition the concentration of a pollutant and one action the mortality of a group of species as presented in the complementary material appendix a at the simulation task these rules are applied observing mamdani s fuzzy inference mamdani and assilian 1975 as they produce a mortality percentage of a group of species given one pollutant concentration or all together in an integrated way because of the different sources of ecotoxicological data each rule type has an extra weight value to differentiate its application strength 1 for data from laboratory bioassays 2 for in situ microcosms and 3 for mesocosms 2 5 ecological network analysis ena details of how to build the ecological network topology of this paper can be found in andrade et al 2016 and pereira et al 2016 in this work nodes represents groups of species with similar traits identified cytometrically and connected by fuzzy directed edges representing flows of energy matter to assess networks states this work applies structural and functional indexes as following first determines the number of nodes n and the number of links l latham 2006 between them l 1 2 i 1 n j 1 j i n 1 next the trophic level tl lindeman and raymond 1942 of a node j is calculated as the weighted sum of the trophic levels of its preys by their proportion in the diet of species j christensen and pauly 1992 t l j 1 i 1 n t i j t j t l i in which t i j is a flow matrix excluding flows to and from the outside and t j is the total inflows to a compartment j to estimate how fast information can spread through the network with the minimum number of connections global efficiency ge is defined as the ratio between the number of individuals n and the product of the number of connections i by the network diameter d pasquaretta et al 2014 it ranges from 0 to 1 and the higher its value the more efficient a network is g e n i d connectance c latham 2006 in food webs is related to the statistical distribution of the links per species and it measures the proportion of possible links between species that are noticed c l n 2 in which l is the number of links in the network and n is the number of compartments total system throughflow tst fath et al 2013 is the sum which represents the total flow into or out of each compartment in practice the throughflow of any compartment will be the greater of its total inflow or outflow the difference is essentially balanced by its storage t s t i 1 n j 1 n t i j z i 0 x i i 1 n j 1 n t j i y 0 i x i in which t i j is the flow from compartment j to compartment i z i 0 is the flow into compartment i from outside the network y 0 i is the flow out of the network for compartment i x i is the negative state derivative for compartment i and x i is the positive state derivative for compartment i three measures were considered to evaluate the development and the growth of the network systems the ascendency a development capacity dc and overhead φ ascendency a ulanowicz 2004 is a measure of organization and size growth and development of ecosystems ulanowicz 1997 latham 2006 it also estimates the amount of complexity e g high ascendency high organization a i 1 n 2 j 0 n t i j log 2 t i j t t i t j in which t is the total system throughput ti is the total inflow for compartment i and t j is the total outflow for compartment j development capacity dc ulanowicz 2000 is the upper bound on ascendency and it can be interpreted as a measure of the diversity of energy matter movement through the system d c i 1 n 2 j 0 n t i j log 2 t i j t overhead φ ulanowicz and norden 1990 is the difference between development capacity and ascendency which reflects the multiplicity of pathways in the network and assigns a value to the residual flexibility that the system retains φ d c a according to ulanowicz 2000 overhead signifies the potential for the system to recover from novel perturbation 3 results 3 1 dataset characterization in this work the cytometric dataset consists of about 100 000 readings detected particles normalized to its standard deviation and the correlations among features were analyzed the feature space 45 cytometric descriptors was reduced to 20 variables through dispersion analysis fisher 1970 rather than showing how data are similar it shows how data differs the most significant traits were sws length particle size total detected fill factor inertia asymmetry and number of humps different amounts of these particles belong to autotrophs mixotrophs and heterotrophs in addition to a large number of mineral particles and organic detritus four groups of cyanobacteria were identified table 1 reference column in this dataset pico free living cells are discriminated by chlorophyll to separate autotrophs from similarly sized heterotrophs and fluorescences yellow and or orange some of these with phycocyanin pc containing have been named cyanobacteria 53 and others with phycoerythrin pe containing as synechococcus 64 their well known side scatter and red fluorescence patterns identify both groups pereira and ebecken 2011 it was possible to discriminate one cell aggregate and two filaments of cyanobacteria by the number of humps number of cells size and shapes unlikely non pigmented heterotrophic bacteria 913 were discriminated from mineral particles and detritus by their refractive index however among the 312 picoeukaryotes detected 194 have been labelled as prasinophyceae like cells according to their sizes 1 6 3 0 μm side scatter and chlorophyll patterns large 20 μm and highly pigmented cells with orange and yellow fluorescences are typical signatures of dinoflagellates 401 while diatoms 110 usually have high side scatter and red fluorescence values and an average forward scatter nano ciliated protozoa signatures 1136 identification followed reports from pereira et al 2018 in addition it was also possible to detect two copepodites zooplankton due to their larger size and the green yellow fluorescences characteristic of decay ingested pigments both ciliates and dinoflagellates are consumers of phytoplankton and important contributors to the diet of zooplankton 3 2 the ecological networks the hierarchical organization and interactions of the plankton community can be represented in a complex network model to unveil their functioning this cen here aggregate model follow cytometric counts abundances displayed as fuzzy graphs based on a size grazing perspective each particle pulse shape profile was assigned to one of the twelve functional groups fig 4 discriminated as below green et al 2003 pereira and ebecken 2011 jonker et al 2000 there are two quite different networks the reference one which was not disturbed fig 4a and the impacted network which is able to show the differences as community responses to the potential changes in the trophic structure fig 4b both figures show functional groups arranged according to their trophic level tl and total node throughflow tst the thickness of the arcs or linkages corresponds to interaction strength one can also see two disconnected groups because they are larger primary producers cyano aggregates and filaments 3 3 disturbance assessment the aforementioned ecotoxicological rules associate pollutant concentrations with mortalities following a fuzzy inference mamdani and assilian 1975 thus showing species or groups sensitivities while some rules can reduce the abundances of groups due to sensibilities and toxicity levels others increase specific groups since some species or groups can use certain pollutants as resources the rules base is presented in appendix a while the effects of each pollutant on the structure and flows of the ecological network are presented separately in appendix b see electronic supplementary material all mortalities are automatically placed into the detritus pool that in turn could further promote the growth of other groups the abundances of both networks and variations among the groups are numerically depicted in table 1 as well we apply conversion factors on abundances and flows to produce specific carbon maps all figures of pg c μm 3 m 2day 1 3 3 1 primary impacts numbers and structure at first sight five non varying functional groups in both networks are shown in table 1 due to the lack of specific ecotoxicology information on such groups therefore as in this work the rules base does not cover any effect upon them they were excluded from analysis still in table 1 the relevance of picoplankton can be noticed despite the dominance of heterotrophic bacteria 913 in the reference network a roughly balanced primary production between autotrophic prokaryotes 117 cyanobacteria and synechococcus and eukaryotes 194 prasinophyceae like is present as well however the impacted network present a significant increase of all prokaryotes cyanobacteria 583 synechococcus 365 and heterotrophic bacteria 5215 became 1000 470 and 471 more abundant respectively at the same time there are relevant decreases of diatoms 56 prasinophyceae like 99 cells and zooplankton 1 which means 49 and 50 variations respectively the main general properties of these networks are presented in table 2 both networks remain with twelve functional groups and while the total number of individuals in the impacted network is almost four fold higher comparing to the reference network from 3545 to 13 845 the amount of material energy flowing through the trophic links increased ninefold from 3 652 348 to 33 319 189 despite this great growth the ge index shows the impacted network losing efficiency almost 3 5 folds that ranged from 4 9e 4 to 1 4e 4 and connectance decreasing from 0 29 to 0 17 however from a more functional point of view the total system throughflow the sum of magnitudes of all flows occurring in the system ranged from 11 667 912 to 21 303 305 mainly because of the detritus pool inputs and the consequent increases of the abundance and node throughflow from detritus to heterotrophic bacteria from 5 93e 6 to 3 63e 2 as depicted in table 3 from table 2 yet computed values of ascendency development capacity and overhead were higher in the impacted network ranging from 6298 to 125 130 from 16 658 022 to 24 177 418 and from 16 651 724 to 24 052 288 respectively 3 3 2 secondary impacts flows increasing or decreasing abundances results in flow changes the more material energy is flowing through a group in the system the larger is its node throughflow value therefore significant differences in bold among and between nodes throughflows of the reference and the impacted networks are presented in table 3 the growth of cyanobacterial pool increased one order of magnitude as a resource for dinoflagellates from 2 56e 4 to 2 82e 3 such expansion was observed with synechococcus as resource to dinoflagellates from 3 11e 4 to 1 86e 3 and to nano ciliates from 8 80e 4 to 5 28e 3 however little change was observed from those to zooplankton from 1 56e 6 to 4 72e 6 and from dinoflagellates to zooplankton from 3 79e 5 to 3 61e 5 flows from nano ciliates 3 17e 2 and picoeukaryotes 1 08e 3 remain unchanged since there are no rules to deal with their mortalities observing diatom flows they have reduced a little to dinoflagellates from 3 07e 3 to 1 36e 3 but varied significantly to nano ciliates from 1 03e 2 to 4 92e 3 and to zooplankton from 2 01e 6 to 2 03e 9 flows from prasinophyceae like as resources to dinoflagellates and to zooplankton were also reduced from 1 16e 2 to 3 80e 3 and from 5 22e 06 to 0 respectively significant increases were also observed from cyanobacteria to nano ciliates from 7 27e 4 to 8 00e 3 and to pico eukaryotes 1 84e 6 to 2 02e 5 as seen from heterotrophic bacteria to nano ciliates 3 92e 4 to 2 35e 3 4 discussion the observed prokaryotic growth was possible since they can use glyphosate at low concentration as phosphate source zhan et al 2018 wang et al 2017 hove jensen et al 2014 forlani et al 2008 and may even modulate the uptake of inorganic phosphate drzyzga and lipok 2018 in fact glyphosate belongs to a chemical class known as phosphonates which is a refractory form of phosphorus that can represent 25 of the high molecular weight of dissolved organic phosphorus pool in marine systems throughout the oceans kolowith et al 2001 it is also known that lots of heterotrophs bacterial stains are capable of growing by degrading pah compounds okai et al 2015 such as pyrene depending on the nutrient status hjorth et al 2008 a significant decrease of eukaryotic phytoplankton is also observed which could lead to later effect on zooplankton however it is worth to note that the fuzzy rules base here does not consider interactions between pollutants and abiotic factors nor the top down control by zooplankton as reported in hjorth et al 2008 since other specific toxicity rules act upon their population echeveste et al 2010 in turn highlights the importance of toxicity thresholds dependent of cell sizes in determining the phytoplankton sensitivity to pah compounds such thresholds should cause a decrease in the tiny picoplankton cells but it can be seen an effect due to the prevalence of rules promoting prokaryotic growth therefore the higher the number of individuals of the impacted network the higher the amount of material energy flowing in its trophic links in light of ulanowicz s theory ascendency a is a product of tst and average mutual information ami it is a key index to estimate the degree of the system development maturity and the self organization ability of the system at the same time it incorporates growth and development to inform how well the system has developed as a self regulated one the development capacity dc is the upper bound on the ascendency and gives a good idea of the complexity level of the system metabolism within its own boundaries indicating the complexity of all its activity capacity means the diversity of flows representing the scope of the system for further development overhead φ in turn indicates the multiplicity of the system s pathways which may be closely related to its buffer capacity against disturbances and it is how much the capacity exceeds ascendency a overhead arises from structural exchanges in the system inputs outputs and internal functional redundancy and quantifies its residual freedom representing its potential for recovery the specific overhead φ tst which is the total flexibility of the system calculated on a per unit flow basis is 1 42 in the reference network and 1 12 for the impacted one this ratio explains the decreasing of connectance and ge in the impacted network based on ﬂow analysis the node throughflow values as presented in table 3 are indicators of the relative contribution of each component to the whole system activity so that functionally important actors can be accessed and the quantities flowing by the primary production and decomposition pathways are shown thus it is essential to know the relative functional importance of species or groups and exchanges among them for conservation ecosystem management and understand the consequences of biodiversity loss analyzing the diversity of groups abundance and flows ratios between autotrophs and heterotrophs a regime shift can be seen from the changes in the structure and function of the system for instance in table 1 the abundance ratio roughly changed from 1 2 in the reference network to 1 47 in the impacted network this means that prokaryotic organisms dominated the impacted network consequently increasing the internal flows of the system from table 3 the ratios of the sum of all the autotrophic flows to the heterotrophic ones are 14 1 and 1544 1 for the reference and impacted networks respectively it is worth noting that by analyzing chlorophyll increase only the impact can be seen as beneficial however the change and prevalence of heterotrophic flows shifted the system functioning another expected change on the environment is in species composition with mortality of the most sensitive species within groups as ascendency scales the flows in the system the heterotrophic pathways dominate the impacted network although not shown the cycling structure should has changed dramatically between the two networks in aquatic ecosystems regime shifts can happen by environmental forcing and variability or by human activities with implications on their predictability which may be detectable earlier in plankton than in upper trophic levels for management purposes our approach is able to investigate possible scenarios and thresholds to identify the responsible mechanisms for ecosystem changes in an integrated way and to serve as a decision support tool for policy formation however one of the greatest difficulties was the lack of chemical field data so far as it is known ignácio 2007 found pyrene concentrations ranging from 6 41 to 8 23 ng ml 1 in paranaguá bay and stachowski haberkorna et al 2008 reported glyphosate concentrations ranging from several tens to hundreds of ng l 1 levin and möllmann 2015 reports an increasing number of regime shift around the globe nevertheless several ecosystem based management schemes largely ignore regime shifts mostly caused by multiple interacting stressors accounting for regime shifts in management of both marine and freshwater environments clearly requires integrative approaches as shown here to evaluate cumulative impacts 5 conclusions the primary role of decision makers is to make decisions based on available information under time and resources constraints for this reason computational models are essential tools for estimating a variety of relevant characteristics such as pollution and environmental conditions or when direct observation is time consuming infeasible or unethical in spite of the challenges the use of these models within the regulatory decision process is a continually growing practice in response to greater demands for quantitative assessment including analysis of how well environmental regulatory activities fulfill their objectives and at what cost therefore these models are within an environment of regulatory revisions legislative requirements and critical evaluation by agencies and interest group which is a different scenario from the non regulatory models of academia and private sectors in brazil models are not currently used in the decision making process thus our approach can be considered as a great advance in environmental management of aquatic systems in general if adopted integrating fuzzy ecotoxicological rules and cen to simulate possible and or cumulative impacts of chemicals on coastal zone proved to be effective and a breakthrough since it is able to demonstrate significant effects on the structure and functioning of marine ecosystem apart from its regime shift the impacted network displays new properties that have emerged from the new assemblage however there is a plethora of important and time dependent phenomena concerning to the entrance of pollutants into the aquatic ecosystems the methodology used in the present work is still in its infancy we must improve the rule based model to be able to cope with interactions of pollutants with nutrients sorption transformations etc the use of fuzzy logic and in situ flow cytometry in mesocosm experiments the increasing of the ecotoxicological database with non standardized species or groups and the searching for higher sensitivities are essential to develop studies of greater reliability they work together dealing with uncertainties of the observations data heterogeneity one challenge in building quasi real time complex ecological network models for environmental assessment is to establish its resolution and sensitivity which often embody specific expert knowledge the spatial connection of benthic and pelagic multilayer

25002,this paper emphasizes the integration of ecology and ecotoxicology the main objective is to present the development of an early warning tool for environmental risk assessment first a reference ecological network of a plankton community was built from in situ flow cytometry data next a set of fuzzy ecotoxicological rules to explain impacts from three pollutants were constructed from the scientific literature and expert knowledge these rules were applied to the plankton network to simulate disturbance and produce an impacted network network indices were used to assess the consequences of this simulated disturbance and a regime shift in the planktonic system was noted coastal zone ecosystem managers could use this type of model to anticipate early warnings in disturbance scenarios allowing estimates of possible impacts to the marine ecosystem keywords environmental management ecological networks simulation ecotoxicological rules risk assessment 1 introduction degradation of natural resources is currently a critical issue and aquatic ecosystems are the fate of many pollutants societies have become increasingly concerned about the possible impacts of chemicals to which humans and organisms are exposed it led the world health organization to publish guidelines and recommendations unesco who unep 1996 to integrate health risk assessment and management into strategies and programs for nature conservation and biological diversity promotion therefore the term ecological health has been used to describe both human health and environmental conditions and is inextricably tied to concepts of biological diversity and ecosystem integrity de leo and levin 1997 ulanowicz 1995 karr 1993 the maintenance and protection of ecological health depend on the use of ecologically robust approaches in environmental management programs borja et al 2008 in coastal ecosystems for instance a wide range of pollutants has been identified islam and tanaka 2004 and efforts have been taken worldwide to achieve an integrated coastal zone management sorensen 1993 some methods based on a large variety of bioindicators carignan and villard 2002 holt and miller 2010 and biotic indices abbasi and abbasi 2011 are used to evaluate water quality while the former ranges from the biochemistry of an organism to emergent properties of complex communities the latter summarizes features of different elements of the ecosystem into a single value all species or assemblages tolerate a limited range of chemical physical and biological conditions thereby used as bioindicators in this way singh et al 2013 has reported planktonic indicators as a promising tool for early warning signals plankton is a huge complex dynamic system for which all mechanisms are not completely understood yet their components are important as they play critical roles providing ecosystem processes and services e g primary productivity nutrient cycling decomposition etc through a tricky network of diverse interactions according to their life strategies worden et al 2015 detrimental effects of many xenobiotics may affect these organisms interactions and processes and it is complex and time consuming to get a clear perception of the potential risk or impact of chemicals in the environment since the 1970s when scientific modelling arises as a tool for environmental management at least three main types emerged namely dynamic population models may 1974 dynamic biogeochemical models jørgensen 1986 and static models jørgensen and bendoricchio 2001 however due to the complexity of natural systems and inherent uncertainties in ecosystem management decision makers combine ecological expertise and site specific data therefore artificial intelligence approaches such as inductive logic programming srinivasana et al 1996 support vector inductive logic programming amini et al 2007 qualitative or quantitative structure activity relationships cronin et al 2003 oecd 2007 artificial neural network devillers 2008 toxicogenomic prediction by association rule mining nagata et al 2014 and expert systems raies and bajic 2016 have been developed this paper emphasizes the integration of the knowledges coming from ecotoxicology and ecology studies initially a planktonic ecological network was built from in situ flow cytometry data secondly ecotoxicological data were compiled from laboratory in situ microcosm and mesocosms bioassays from literature and public databases to make a fuzzy knowledge base specifically this work aims i to apply fuzzy ecotoxicological rules to prune the ecological network ii to simulate disturbances of three pollutants on the network and iii to evaluate such disturbances using general ecological network analysis ena indexes in order to help decision making process in coastal zone ecosystem management for simplicity mortality is the single endpoint used which implies a decrease in abundance of individual groups within the network sub lethal effects are not considered therefore the novelty of this paper is the proposal of an integrative approach to environmental analysis and management of aquatic systems in general by means of complex network modelling and fuzzy logic a planktonic trophic network is generated and pruned to perform realistic simulations and interpretations 2 material and methods 2 1 study site description the ilha grande bay fig 1 is a major tourist hub in the southern of rio de janeiro state brazil with a large number of coves beaches and islands its shores are mountainous with a dense rainforest whose slopes plunge into the sea along with streams coming from distant agricultural areas the bottom of the bay consists mainly of sludge with more than 50 of clay and silt and a gradual contact with fine and coarse sands ceccopieri 2001 although this estuary is considered as a biodiversity hotspot and includes high number of protected areas creed et al 2007 the port of itaguaí many marinas an oil terminal tebig a shipyard two nuclear power plants for electricity generation an expanding industrial park and cluttered urban occupation are installed around the bay therefore pollution has increased significantly in the region over the last decades molisani et al 2004 worsening the degradation scenario this area cannot be treated as pristine neither as site of reference indeed all similar environments present different but high degree of anthropic influence in the brazilian southeastern coast 2 2 overall ecological risk assessment a conceptual framework for potential ecological risk assessment era in aquatic ecosystem is presented in fig 2 it first identifies flow cytometry signatures of planktonic organisms by means of artificial neural networks ann pereira and ebecken 2011 next a search for toxicity data related to the organisms identified are performed in literature vera et al 2010 stachowski haberkorna et al 2008 pérez et al 2007 hjorth et al 2006 and 2007 and public databases ecotox https cfpub epa gov ecotox and ecetoc http www ecetoc org links ecotox database these data are compared to the maximum permissible concentration according to brazilian regulatory standards conama 2005 to build a fuzzy ecotoxicological rules base in the meantime an algorithm andrade et al 2016 uses the categorized data of identified organisms to develop a complex ecological network cen further in order to perform a simulation of disturbance on the cen the fuzzy ecotoxicological rules are applied as pruning criteria which leads the network to assume a new topology due to changes in abundances of their groups these changes increases or decreases are interpreted as growth partial mortality or elimination of such populations finally both network topologies were characterized and compared by structural and functional indexes kones et al 2009 it should be clear that the choice of pollutant concentrations to perform simulation is empirical rather than measuring them in water this approach allows simulations and comparisons of a single pollutant or a mixture of them cumulative effect since they do not occur alone in nature 2 3 data acquisition 2 3 1 field monitoring data the choice of the sampling location 23 01 59 9 s 44 21 25 8 w as indicated in fig 1 has considered i its strategic position and ii the hydrodynamic pattern as reported by the sisbahia base system of environmental hydrodynamics sisbahia 2019 to evaluate physical and chemical characteristics of seawater in situ measurements of temperature 24 50c salinity 33 ph 8 5 and oxygen concentration 6 6 mg l were performed and a sample was also obtained to set nutrients no3 no2 nh4 and po3 as 1 79 mg l 1 0 15 mg l 1 0 21 mg l 1 and 0 12 mg l 1 respectively strickland and parsons 1968 all these parameters are in accordance with patterns established by the conama act 357 2005 for class 5 marine conama 2005 plankton data were acquired from in situ monitoring three samples with 10 min interval using the high frequency submersible cytosence scanning flow cytometry cytobuoy bv woerden the netherlands which includes suspended cells tiny organisms and non biological elements ranging in size from 0 2 μm to 900 μm as particles cross a laser beam 488 nm they are characterized by individual pulse shape profiles and 45 descriptors the pulse shape profiles are formed by the forward scatter fws and the side scatter sws signals which provide information about size and shape of each particle and three in vivo fluorescences fl red flr 668 734 nm

as indicated by the hydrodynamic model sisbahia 2 3 2 toxicants and toxicity data this work analyzes the potential effects of three chemical products with different uses and physical chemical properties of great environmental interest the first pollutant is the anti fouling zinc pyrithione zpt recently introduced into the marine environment it is a lipophilic organo metal complex in which the zinc ion is complex bound to two pyrithione groups it has been found to be highly toxic to aquatic organisms especially algae onduka et al 2007 at low concentrations and rapidly photodegraded in the water column zhou et al 2018 even though seasonal effects of zpt have also been reported maraldo and dahllöfa 2004 here the combined effects of cpt copper pyrithione are not considered the second stressor is the pyrene a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon pah since it constitutes one of the most toxic components of oil in the marine biota and may persist in the water column yamada et al 2003 yu 2002 coming from point sources such as oil spills and diffuse sources such as atmospheric deposition the third toxicant is the herbicide glyphosate monsanto saint louis mo usa an organophosphorus compound extensively used in agriculture as a broad spectrum systemic herbicide which kills plants by inhibiting epsps enzyme synthesis in the shikimate pathway gomes et al 2014 and which can also persist in seawater mercurio et al 2014 the values concerning to pnecs lc5 ec5 u s environmental protection agency epa 2005 and lc50 ec50 of the above chemicals were collected or calculated to build fuzzy ecotoxicological rules in the case of field data in situ microcosm or mesocosm toxicity which are obviously preferred the magnitude of the assessment factor is specific and has followed the recommendations of the technical guidance document on risk assessment european commission 2003 and the environmental risk assessment unep ipcs 1999 2 4 models generation 2 4 1 species sensitivity distributions ssd almost all species or assemblages tolerate a limited range of chemical physical and biological conditions the species sensitivity distribution ssd became an important tool to assess ecotoxicological threats to biodiversity king et al 2015 despite demanding high quality data to deal with sensitivity variability among individuals and species and to extend it to a more comprehensive form specific ssd values are calculated for each group belonging to the ecological network an ssd curve establishes a function between the concentration of a chemical and the effects it causes on organisms garner et al 2015 as reported by wheele et al 2002 an ssd typically follows a log normal or log logistic model in which the hc5 endpoint is extrapolated in this paper the ssd generator provided by the us epa is used and its toxicity data fits to a commonly log probit i e linearized log normal distribution each species exhibits a different response to a stressor 2 4 2 fuzzy ecotoxicological rule based model due to the different modes of pollutant actions and the non linear sensitivity among and between individuals and groups of species a knowledge representation scheme is crucial to simulate the effect of chemicals on plankton to deal with the uncertainties related to the understanding of how relevant the concentration of a pollutant is and its impact on the studied groups fuzzy modeling is suited ross 2017 because it provides tools to cope with subjective concepts like high concentration or moderately toxic in fuzzy modeling a variable of a problem is partitioned into sets which are characterized by fuzzy membership functions fig 3 these functions inform the degrees of membership between 0 and 1 for each possible value of the variable thus the fuzzy approach allows the interpretation that the concentration of a given pollutant is as low medium or high for example for each pair of pollutant species group a ssd curve is generated and it yields a table with two variables the proportion of species affected and the estimated log scaled concentrations of a pollutant for each pollutant the concentration variable is partitioned into three fuzzy sets low medium and high and the mortality variable into five fuzzy sets nontoxic slightly toxic marginally toxic moderately toxic and highly toxic these partitions are presented in fig 3a and 3b in which values a b and c are defined as the minima of lc5 ec5 lc50 ec50 and lc95 ec95 for the studied groups affected by a given pollutant respectively the mortality values d h were defined empirically in this work from these fuzzy sets a rule base is obtained using wang and mendel 1992 algorithm these fuzzy rules are very simple since they have only one condition the concentration of a pollutant and one action the mortality of a group of species as presented in the complementary material appendix a at the simulation task these rules are applied observing mamdani s fuzzy inference mamdani and assilian 1975 as they produce a mortality percentage of a group of species given one pollutant concentration or all together in an integrated way because of the different sources of ecotoxicological data each rule type has an extra weight value to differentiate its application strength 1 for data from laboratory bioassays 2 for in situ microcosms and 3 for mesocosms 2 5 ecological network analysis ena details of how to build the ecological network topology of this paper can be found in andrade et al 2016 and pereira et al 2016 in this work nodes represents groups of species with similar traits identified cytometrically and connected by fuzzy directed edges representing flows of energy matter to assess networks states this work applies structural and functional indexes as following first determines the number of nodes n and the number of links l latham 2006 between them l 1 2 i 1 n j 1 j i n 1 next the trophic level tl lindeman and raymond 1942 of a node j is calculated as the weighted sum of the trophic levels of its preys by their proportion in the diet of species j christensen and pauly 1992 t l j 1 i 1 n t i j t j t l i in which t i j is a flow matrix excluding flows to and from the outside and t j is the total inflows to a compartment j to estimate how fast information can spread through the network with the minimum number of connections global efficiency ge is defined as the ratio between the number of individuals n and the product of the number of connections i by the network diameter d pasquaretta et al 2014 it ranges from 0 to 1 and the higher its value the more efficient a network is g e n i d connectance c latham 2006 in food webs is related to the statistical distribution of the links per species and it measures the proportion of possible links between species that are noticed c l n 2 in which l is the number of links in the network and n is the number of compartments total system throughflow tst fath et al 2013 is the sum which represents the total flow into or out of each compartment in practice the throughflow of any compartment will be the greater of its total inflow or outflow the difference is essentially balanced by its storage t s t i 1 n j 1 n t i j z i 0 x i i 1 n j 1 n t j i y 0 i x i in which t i j is the flow from compartment j to compartment i z i 0 is the flow into compartment i from outside the network y 0 i is the flow out of the network for compartment i x i is the negative state derivative for compartment i and x i is the positive state derivative for compartment i three measures were considered to evaluate the development and the growth of the network systems the ascendency a development capacity dc and overhead φ ascendency a ulanowicz 2004 is a measure of organization and size growth and development of ecosystems ulanowicz 1997 latham 2006 it also estimates the amount of complexity e g high ascendency high organization a i 1 n 2 j 0 n t i j log 2 t i j t t i t j in which t is the total system throughput ti is the total inflow for compartment i and t j is the total outflow for compartment j development capacity dc ulanowicz 2000 is the upper bound on ascendency and it can be interpreted as a measure of the diversity of energy matter movement through the system d c i 1 n 2 j 0 n t i j log 2 t i j t overhead φ ulanowicz and norden 1990 is the difference between development capacity and ascendency which reflects the multiplicity of pathways in the network and assigns a value to the residual flexibility that the system retains φ d c a according to ulanowicz 2000 overhead signifies the potential for the system to recover from novel perturbation 3 results 3 1 dataset characterization in this work the cytometric dataset consists of about 100 000 readings detected particles normalized to its standard deviation and the correlations among features were analyzed the feature space 45 cytometric descriptors was reduced to 20 variables through dispersion analysis fisher 1970 rather than showing how data are similar it shows how data differs the most significant traits were sws length particle size total detected fill factor inertia asymmetry and number of humps different amounts of these particles belong to autotrophs mixotrophs and heterotrophs in addition to a large number of mineral particles and organic detritus four groups of cyanobacteria were identified table 1 reference column in this dataset pico free living cells are discriminated by chlorophyll to separate autotrophs from similarly sized heterotrophs and fluorescences yellow and or orange some of these with phycocyanin pc containing have been named cyanobacteria 53 and others with phycoerythrin pe containing as synechococcus 64 their well known side scatter and red fluorescence patterns identify both groups pereira and ebecken 2011 it was possible to discriminate one cell aggregate and two filaments of cyanobacteria by the number of humps number of cells size and shapes unlikely non pigmented heterotrophic bacteria 913 were discriminated from mineral particles and detritus by their refractive index however among the 312 picoeukaryotes detected 194 have been labelled as prasinophyceae like cells according to their sizes 1 6 3 0 μm side scatter and chlorophyll patterns large 20 μm and highly pigmented cells with orange and yellow fluorescences are typical signatures of dinoflagellates 401 while diatoms 110 usually have high side scatter and red fluorescence values and an average forward scatter nano ciliated protozoa signatures 1136 identification followed reports from pereira et al 2018 in addition it was also possible to detect two copepodites zooplankton due to their larger size and the green yellow fluorescences characteristic of decay ingested pigments both ciliates and dinoflagellates are consumers of phytoplankton and important contributors to the diet of zooplankton 3 2 the ecological networks the hierarchical organization and interactions of the plankton community can be represented in a complex network model to unveil their functioning this cen here aggregate model follow cytometric counts abundances displayed as fuzzy graphs based on a size grazing perspective each particle pulse shape profile was assigned to one of the twelve functional groups fig 4 discriminated as below green et al 2003 pereira and ebecken 2011 jonker et al 2000 there are two quite different networks the reference one which was not disturbed fig 4a and the impacted network which is able to show the differences as community responses to the potential changes in the trophic structure fig 4b both figures show functional groups arranged according to their trophic level tl and total node throughflow tst the thickness of the arcs or linkages corresponds to interaction strength one can also see two disconnected groups because they are larger primary producers cyano aggregates and filaments 3 3 disturbance assessment the aforementioned ecotoxicological rules associate pollutant concentrations with mortalities following a fuzzy inference mamdani and assilian 1975 thus showing species or groups sensitivities while some rules can reduce the abundances of groups due to sensibilities and toxicity levels others increase specific groups since some species or groups can use certain pollutants as resources the rules base is presented in appendix a while the effects of each pollutant on the structure and flows of the ecological network are presented separately in appendix b see electronic supplementary material all mortalities are automatically placed into the detritus pool that in turn could further promote the growth of other groups the abundances of both networks and variations among the groups are numerically depicted in table 1 as well we apply conversion factors on abundances and flows to produce specific carbon maps all figures of pg c μm 3 m 2day 1 3 3 1 primary impacts numbers and structure at first sight five non varying functional groups in both networks are shown in table 1 due to the lack of specific ecotoxicology information on such groups therefore as in this work the rules base does not cover any effect upon them they were excluded from analysis still in table 1 the relevance of picoplankton can be noticed despite the dominance of heterotrophic bacteria 913 in the reference network a roughly balanced primary production between autotrophic prokaryotes 117 cyanobacteria and synechococcus and eukaryotes 194 prasinophyceae like is present as well however the impacted network present a significant increase of all prokaryotes cyanobacteria 583 synechococcus 365 and heterotrophic bacteria 5215 became 1000 470 and 471 more abundant respectively at the same time there are relevant decreases of diatoms 56 prasinophyceae like 99 cells and zooplankton 1 which means 49 and 50 variations respectively the main general properties of these networks are presented in table 2 both networks remain with twelve functional groups and while the total number of individuals in the impacted network is almost four fold higher comparing to the reference network from 3545 to 13 845 the amount of material energy flowing through the trophic links increased ninefold from 3 652 348 to 33 319 189 despite this great growth the ge index shows the impacted network losing efficiency almost 3 5 folds that ranged from 4 9e 4 to 1 4e 4 and connectance decreasing from 0 29 to 0 17 however from a more functional point of view the total system throughflow the sum of magnitudes of all flows occurring in the system ranged from 11 667 912 to 21 303 305 mainly because of the detritus pool inputs and the consequent increases of the abundance and node throughflow from detritus to heterotrophic bacteria from 5 93e 6 to 3 63e 2 as depicted in table 3 from table 2 yet computed values of ascendency development capacity and overhead were higher in the impacted network ranging from 6298 to 125 130 from 16 658 022 to 24 177 418 and from 16 651 724 to 24 052 288 respectively 3 3 2 secondary impacts flows increasing or decreasing abundances results in flow changes the more material energy is flowing through a group in the system the larger is its node throughflow value therefore significant differences in bold among and between nodes throughflows of the reference and the impacted networks are presented in table 3 the growth of cyanobacterial pool increased one order of magnitude as a resource for dinoflagellates from 2 56e 4 to 2 82e 3 such expansion was observed with synechococcus as resource to dinoflagellates from 3 11e 4 to 1 86e 3 and to nano ciliates from 8 80e 4 to 5 28e 3 however little change was observed from those to zooplankton from 1 56e 6 to 4 72e 6 and from dinoflagellates to zooplankton from 3 79e 5 to 3 61e 5 flows from nano ciliates 3 17e 2 and picoeukaryotes 1 08e 3 remain unchanged since there are no rules to deal with their mortalities observing diatom flows they have reduced a little to dinoflagellates from 3 07e 3 to 1 36e 3 but varied significantly to nano ciliates from 1 03e 2 to 4 92e 3 and to zooplankton from 2 01e 6 to 2 03e 9 flows from prasinophyceae like as resources to dinoflagellates and to zooplankton were also reduced from 1 16e 2 to 3 80e 3 and from 5 22e 06 to 0 respectively significant increases were also observed from cyanobacteria to nano ciliates from 7 27e 4 to 8 00e 3 and to pico eukaryotes 1 84e 6 to 2 02e 5 as seen from heterotrophic bacteria to nano ciliates 3 92e 4 to 2 35e 3 4 discussion the observed prokaryotic growth was possible since they can use glyphosate at low concentration as phosphate source zhan et al 2018 wang et al 2017 hove jensen et al 2014 forlani et al 2008 and may even modulate the uptake of inorganic phosphate drzyzga and lipok 2018 in fact glyphosate belongs to a chemical class known as phosphonates which is a refractory form of phosphorus that can represent 25 of the high molecular weight of dissolved organic phosphorus pool in marine systems throughout the oceans kolowith et al 2001 it is also known that lots of heterotrophs bacterial stains are capable of growing by degrading pah compounds okai et al 2015 such as pyrene depending on the nutrient status hjorth et al 2008 a significant decrease of eukaryotic phytoplankton is also observed which could lead to later effect on zooplankton however it is worth to note that the fuzzy rules base here does not consider interactions between pollutants and abiotic factors nor the top down control by zooplankton as reported in hjorth et al 2008 since other specific toxicity rules act upon their population echeveste et al 2010 in turn highlights the importance of toxicity thresholds dependent of cell sizes in determining the phytoplankton sensitivity to pah compounds such thresholds should cause a decrease in the tiny picoplankton cells but it can be seen an effect due to the prevalence of rules promoting prokaryotic growth therefore the higher the number of individuals of the impacted network the higher the amount of material energy flowing in its trophic links in light of ulanowicz s theory ascendency a is a product of tst and average mutual information ami it is a key index to estimate the degree of the system development maturity and the self organization ability of the system at the same time it incorporates growth and development to inform how well the system has developed as a self regulated one the development capacity dc is the upper bound on the ascendency and gives a good idea of the complexity level of the system metabolism within its own boundaries indicating the complexity of all its activity capacity means the diversity of flows representing the scope of the system for further development overhead φ in turn indicates the multiplicity of the system s pathways which may be closely related to its buffer capacity against disturbances and it is how much the capacity exceeds ascendency a overhead arises from structural exchanges in the system inputs outputs and internal functional redundancy and quantifies its residual freedom representing its potential for recovery the specific overhead φ tst which is the total flexibility of the system calculated on a per unit flow basis is 1 42 in the reference network and 1 12 for the impacted one this ratio explains the decreasing of connectance and ge in the impacted network based on ﬂow analysis the node throughflow values as presented in table 3 are indicators of the relative contribution of each component to the whole system activity so that functionally important actors can be accessed and the quantities flowing by the primary production and decomposition pathways are shown thus it is essential to know the relative functional importance of species or groups and exchanges among them for conservation ecosystem management and understand the consequences of biodiversity loss analyzing the diversity of groups abundance and flows ratios between autotrophs and heterotrophs a regime shift can be seen from the changes in the structure and function of the system for instance in table 1 the abundance ratio roughly changed from 1 2 in the reference network to 1 47 in the impacted network this means that prokaryotic organisms dominated the impacted network consequently increasing the internal flows of the system from table 3 the ratios of the sum of all the autotrophic flows to the heterotrophic ones are 14 1 and 1544 1 for the reference and impacted networks respectively it is worth noting that by analyzing chlorophyll increase only the impact can be seen as beneficial however the change and prevalence of heterotrophic flows shifted the system functioning another expected change on the environment is in species composition with mortality of the most sensitive species within groups as ascendency scales the flows in the system the heterotrophic pathways dominate the impacted network although not shown the cycling structure should has changed dramatically between the two networks in aquatic ecosystems regime shifts can happen by environmental forcing and variability or by human activities with implications on their predictability which may be detectable earlier in plankton than in upper trophic levels for management purposes our approach is able to investigate possible scenarios and thresholds to identify the responsible mechanisms for ecosystem changes in an integrated way and to serve as a decision support tool for policy formation however one of the greatest difficulties was the lack of chemical field data so far as it is known ignácio 2007 found pyrene concentrations ranging from 6 41 to 8 23 ng ml 1 in paranaguá bay and stachowski haberkorna et al 2008 reported glyphosate concentrations ranging from several tens to hundreds of ng l 1 levin and möllmann 2015 reports an increasing number of regime shift around the globe nevertheless several ecosystem based management schemes largely ignore regime shifts mostly caused by multiple interacting stressors accounting for regime shifts in management of both marine and freshwater environments clearly requires integrative approaches as shown here to evaluate cumulative impacts 5 conclusions the primary role of decision makers is to make decisions based on available information under time and resources constraints for this reason computational models are essential tools for estimating a variety of relevant characteristics such as pollution and environmental conditions or when direct observation is time consuming infeasible or unethical in spite of the challenges the use of these models within the regulatory decision process is a continually growing practice in response to greater demands for quantitative assessment including analysis of how well environmental regulatory activities fulfill their objectives and at what cost therefore these models are within an environment of regulatory revisions legislative requirements and critical evaluation by agencies and interest group which is a different scenario from the non regulatory models of academia and private sectors in brazil models are not currently used in the decision making process thus our approach can be considered as a great advance in environmental management of aquatic systems in general if adopted integrating fuzzy ecotoxicological rules and cen to simulate possible and or cumulative impacts of chemicals on coastal zone proved to be effective and a breakthrough since it is able to demonstrate significant effects on the structure and functioning of marine ecosystem apart from its regime shift the impacted network displays new properties that have emerged from the new assemblage however there is a plethora of important and time dependent phenomena concerning to the entrance of pollutants into the aquatic ecosystems the methodology used in the present work is still in its infancy we must improve the rule based model to be able to cope with interactions of pollutants with nutrients sorption transformations etc the use of fuzzy logic and in situ flow cytometry in mesocosm experiments the increasing of the ecotoxicological database with non standardized species or groups and the searching for higher sensitivities are essential to develop studies of greater reliability they work together dealing with uncertainties of the observations data heterogeneity one challenge in building quasi real time complex ecological network models for environmental assessment is to establish its resolution and sensitivity which often embody specific expert knowledge the spatial connection of benthic and pelagic multilayer

25003,ecological niche models are powerful tools in ecology factors operating at different spatial scales are known to jointly influence species distributions but their integration in meaningful and reliable niche models is still methodologically complex and requires further research and validation here we compare six different hierarchical niche models hnms two ensemble two bayesian and two penalized logistic regression approaches the six hnms were applied to produce high resolution 25 m predictions for five tree species in a biosphere reserve in central spain combining information from two spatial scales at the regional scale mainland spain climatic variables were used as predictors and presence absence data were derived from the spanish forest inventory 76 347 plots at the landscape scale biosphere reserve environmental variables were used as predictors while presence absence data were derived from a local vegetation sampling 346 plots we compared and evaluated the six hnms using the auc maxkappa and maxtss statistics and the pearson s correlation coefficient we obtained reliable high resolution hnms at the landscape scale auc values were greater than 0 8 although with variable performance and scope of application ensemble approaches delivered reliable models particularly when the sample size was not a limiting modelling factor however bayesian modelling allowed considering a spatially correlated random effect that outperformed the results of all other approaches for species with a low sample size possibly derived from a strong spatial structure in their distribution hnms succeeded in generating high resolution predictions and manage to identify a significantly greater part of the climatic niche of the species than non hierarchical models this allows more accurate projections both in space and time which is essential in climate change and invasive species modelling projections the usefulness of these models for decision support in local conservation programs is therefore highlighted our methodological comparison is valuable to inform modellers and decision makers of the performance and implications of these approaches regarding the support they can provide for the implementation of conservation management measures at the landscape scale abbreviations hnm hierarchical niche model enm ecological niche models dem digital elevation model keywords ecological niche models ensemble ecological models hierarchical bayesian modelling multiscale approach penalized logistic regression species distribution models 1 introduction the early developments and initial applications of species distribution models more specifically ecological niche models enms started in the 1980s see booth et al 2014 and references therein interest in enms and associated niche analyses has increased dramatically in recent years and they have become essential tools in different fields such as ecology biogeography or conservation see guisan et al 2017 however hierarchical niche modelling hnm at different ecological and spatial scales is vital to produce reliable applicable and ecologically meaningful results diez and pulliam 2007 mateo et al 2017 this is particularly the case when enms are required at detailed spatial resolutions less than 100 m and at a landscape scale mateo et al 2019 in order to anticipate the potential effects of climate change on the distribution of species del barrio et al 2006 hattab et al 2014 petitpierre et al 2016 this includes aspects such as modelling potential microrefugia areas lenoir et al 2017 or guiding local conservation measures mateo et al 2019 given that the complete niche of the species might not be captured thuiller et al 2004 by models trained at small geographic scales petitpierre et al 2016 accurate climate change impact forecasts might ultimately be hampered barbet massin et al 2010 guisan et al 2017 pearson et al 2004 thuiller et al 2004 however few studies have addressed conceptual and methodological questions regarding hnm mateo et al 2019 2017 mcpherson et al 2006 pearson et al 2004 different hierarchical modelling approaches statistical and mathematical have been developed see below but their conceptual and practical differences as well as their relative performance remain largely unexplored therefore it is of high interest to compare the results from these different approaches el gabbas and dormann 2018 and their applicability on local conservation and management assessments mateo et al 2019 conservation management at the landscape scale requires local species distribution data maréchaux et al 2017 and high spatial resolution enms lenoir et al 2017 mateo et al 2019 mccullough et al 2016 mcpherson et al 2006 three different methodological options may be used with the aim of obtaining precise enms at the landscape scale the first option is downscaling models fitted at a lower spatial resolution araújo et al 2005 barbosa et al 2010 bombi and d amen 2012 keil et al 2013 the second option consists of using data gathered directly at the landscape scale d amen et al 2018 mateo et al 2018 scherrer et al 2017 finally the third option consists in using information at different ecological and spatial scales integrating them in a hierarchical modelling framework gallien et al 2012 gastón and garcía viñas 2010 hattab et al 2014 magliozzi et al 2019 mateo et al 2019 pearson et al 2004 petitpierre et al 2016 it is acknowledged that both species and biodiversity spatial distribution patterns are driven by different processes acting at different scales mateo et al 2017 mcgill 2010 wiens 1989 therefore models fitted at coarse resolutions first option do not account for the local ecological processes responsible for the landscape species distribution e g microtopography illán et al 2010 this means that these models can not predict species distributions successfully at the landscape scale collingham et al 2000 on the other hand models fitted with data exclusively gathered at the landscape scale second option ignore macroecological drivers of species distributions mateo et al 2017 they do not include the whole range of climatic conditions suitable for the species climatic niche guisan et al 2017 pearson and dawson 2003 thuiller et al 2004 which makes them of little use to project the impacts of climate change on species distributions petitpierre et al 2016 therefore there is a gap between these two approaches and a need to improve existing models or develop new ones that account for all these drivers acting at different scales third option mateo et al 2017 a well conducted hierarchical modelling framework can apply the concept of hierarchical filters in community ecology bello et al 2013 hattab et al 2014 and can integrate the different scale dependent drivers of species distributions gallien et al 2012 hattab et al 2014 mateo et al 2016 2019 mateo et al 2017 pearson et al 2004 such improvements may allow more realistic projections and reliable conservation and management strategies mateo et al 2019 delivering hnms at the landscape scale and high spatial resolution less than 100 m requires the solution of different conceptual and methodological questions some of these aspects have been considered recently gallien et al 2012 hattab et al 2014 magliozzi et al 2019 mateo et al 2019 2017 pearson et al 2004 but others remain unresolved first one of the significant bottlenecks for producing reliable hnms relies on the fact that landscape scale models require suitable environmental data at detailed spatial resolution mackey and lindenmayer 2001 which are usually scarce remote sensing rocchini et al 2017 could help to deliver the required environmental variables at this fine scale complemented with the downscaling of macroecological variables such as macroclimate mateo et al 2019 here we combine these two tools by 1 using lidar active sensors to deliver data on tree canopy cover fraction of ground area covered by the vertical projection of tree crown perimeters which is related to vegetation structure mateo et al 2018 and understory light availability and 2 implementing a recently proposed method to downscale climatic variables temperature and precipitation from one kilometer to 25 m resolution mateo et al 2019 second hierarchical models could be fitted by different mathematical or statistical approaches as for example 1 combination of ensemble niche models trained at different scales lomba et al 2010 mateo et al 2019 petitpierre et al 2016 2 occupancy bayesian models dorazio 2014 kéry and andrew royle 2010 3 bayesian niche models golding and purse 2016 talluto et al 2016 4 hierarchical update of penalized logistic regression models gastón and garcía viñas 2010 5 joint models of multivariate generalized linear mixed and latent variable models warton et al 2015 as the different statistical approaches have different conceptual procedures and they can offer different results norberg et al 2019 a comparison and a revision of their applicability on local conservation programs are urgent in the present study using as a case study a biosphere reserve in central spain and five tree species we compare three statistical modelling hierarchical approaches and two parametrization options for each approach in their ability to generate reliable hnms and more precise conservation strategies based on their predictions at the landscape scale 2 methods 2 1 species distribution data and scales this study was developed in the sierra del rincón biosphere reserve 41 03 n 3 29 w central spain fig 1 tree species with a minimum of 15 presences papeş and gaubert 2007 in plots sampled in the biosphere reserve were selected see next section five tree species met this requirement holly tree ilex aquifolium l common juniper juniperus communis l scots pine pinus sylvestris l pyrenean oak quercus pyrenaica wild and holm oak q ilex l subsp ballota desf samp the five species represent plant species with different ecological requirements costa tenorio et al 1998 sample size table s1 and distribution areas castroviejo 2012 for each species two datasets were separately compiled at the landscape and the regional scales which are described in the sections below these two scale levels are not arbitrary but represent important scale dependent drivers on the distribution on plant species distribution mateo et al 2019 2017 mcgill 2010 wiens 1989 the regional scale database is expected to characterize the ecological tolerances of plant species to drivers acting at large scales e g macroclimate the landscape scale database is expected to capture important local drivers for plant species distribution e g landscape features microtopography the two databases were employed to derive hnms under three different hierarchical modelling frameworks ensemble niche modelling bayesian and penalized logistic regression see below 2 1 1 regional data we considered the distribution of the five tree species in continental spain as the regional scale here we use regional sensu el gabbas and dormann 2018 i e a geographic extent smaller than the whole range of the species but of much coarser grain than the landscape dataset for the five tree species presences and absences were gathered from the third spanish forest inventory 76 347 circular plots of 25 m radius http www mapama gob es es desarrollo rural temas politica forestal inventario cartografia inventario forestal nacional this inventory follows a grid with nodes separated by 1000 m 2 1 2 landscape data a total of 434 circular plots 10 m radius were locally sampled at the sierra del rincón biosphere reserve presence and absence of tree species were recorded in each plot mateo et al 2019 2018 a minimum distance of 300 m between plots was imposed to prevent spatial autocorrelation dormann et al 2007 the 300 m distance was selected based on the analysis of semi variograms of the species present in the study area the final number of plots considered after this minimum distance constraint was 346 the database was randomly split four times i e split sample cross validation supporting information table s1 into a 70 dataset to fit the models training dataset and a 30 dataset to estimate their predictive accuracy testing dataset the four datasets to fit and validate the models were generated with the function ecospat caleval from the ecospat r package di cola et al 2017 2 2 independent variables we used different independent variables predictors and different spatial resolutions at the two considered scales at the regional scale we used climatic variables from worldclim 2 0 http worldclim org version2 fick and hijmans 2017 at a resolution of 30 arc seconds approximately one kilometer in the equator we run a pearson correlation analysis for all the pairs of variables available in woldclim 2 0 monthly precipitation and monthly minimum maximum and average temperatures we discarded the variables expected to be the least essential for the species distribution in any of the pairs that had a correlation coefficient above 0 7 francis and currie 2003 dormann et al 2013 as a result we selected five physiologically meaningful variables for plants in mediterranean climates which we used to calibrate the models at the regional scale precipitation in april precipitation in august average temperature in october minimum temperature in january and maximum temperature in august at the landscape scale we generated a set of 13 different environmental variables at 25 m resolution for details see mateo et al 2018 to avoid multicollinearity we used the same approach as for the regional predictors pearson s pairwise correlation analysis finally we selected six uncorrelated and ecologically meaningful variables for plant species which we used to calibrate the models at the local scale see mateo et al 2018 1 distance to streams for each pixel we calculated the least surface distance meters to any stream fleming and doan 2013 2 forest canopy cover above 3 m derived from a lidar image centro nacional de información geográfica http centrodedescargas cnig es centrodescargas index jsp canopy cover is the fraction of ground area covered by the vertical projection of tree crown perimeter 3 heat load index which we used to account for the fact that southwest facing slopes have warmer temperatures than southeast facing slopes we quantified this index using the mccune and keon 2002 method which obtains the index values by folding the aspect and by considering the steepness of the slope 4 elevation derived from a 25 m resolution digital elevation model dem centro nacional de información geográfica https www cnig es 5 slope derived from the dem 6 linear aspect orientation derived from the dem the circular aspect was transformed into a linear variable evans et al 2014 the five climatic variables at the regional scale and one kilometer resolution were downscaled in the study area to 25 meters resolution employing a recently proposed methodology see mateo et al 2019 all the independent variables were generated and projected at etrs89 utm 30 n using arcgis 10 3 esri 2015 and r 3 3 2 r core team 2018 software 2 3 hierarchical modelling approaches the two databases were employed to derive hnms under three statistical hierarchical modelling approaches fig 2 for the five selected species as described below 2 3 1 hierarchical ensemble niche modelling approach for each species we generated four ensemble niche models fig 2 araújo and new 2007 marmion et al 2009 one model at the regional scale based on the regional data and climatic variables one model at the landscape scale based on the landscape data and local environmental variables and two hierarchical combinations of regional and landscape models mateo et al 2019 referred to as ensemble1 and ensemble2 ensemble1 was fitted using the local environmental variables plus the suitability predicted by the regional ensemble model originally trained for mainland spain at 30 arc seconds when projected over the local study area biosphere reserve at 25 m resolution using the five climatic variables ensemble2 model was generated by averaging rescaled landscape and regional enms predictions to develop the regional local and hierarchical1 ensemble models we used three statistical techniques generalized linear models glm mccullagh and nelder 1989 boosted regression trees brt friedman 2001 and random forests rf breiman 2001 all the models were generated using the biomod2 thuiller et al 2009 r package with default parameters parameters fine tuning is not needed as we are making a comparison and they remained constant across species and scales for each scale species and modelling technique the corresponding dataset was randomly split ten times into an 80 dataset to generate the models and a 20 dataset to estimate their predictive accuracy i e split sample cross validation after elimination of all the replicates with an auc 0 8 we created for each species an ensemble model consisting of the weighted mean of the different model predictions 2 3 2 hierarchical bayesian approach hierarchical bayesian models gelman et al 2013 are particularly well suited to handle models with complex structure in which covariates have been measured at different scales see for example banerjee et al 2014 in particular two models were considered in the present work the first model bayesian1 considered a logistic regression on the regional and landscape datasets the coefficients on the common environmental variables were shared between both models so that estimation of these coefficients used both datasets hence the regional level model included five covariates climatic variables whilst the landscape model included 11 covariates altogether five downscaled climatic variables and six environmental landscape variables the coefficients of the five common climatic variables were assumed to be the same in both models for this reason this model ensures that the effects of the covariates available at both levels are the same and that they are estimated by considering regional and landscape datasets the prior distributions on the model intercepts and the covariate coefficients were vague gaussian priors with zero mean and precision of 0 001 this model was implemented using the jags software plummer 2017 by means of the rjags plummer 2016 package for the r programming language r core team 2018 the second model bayesian2 was similar to the previous one but included a spatially correlated random effect to account for spatial trends that were not explained by the effects of the covariates the spatial random effect was the same in both models so that it was estimated using both datasets and it was assumed to be gaussian with a matérn covariance diggle and ribeiro 2007 it was implemented using the spde approximation lindgren et al 2011 and the integrated nested laplace approximation rue et al 2009 implemented in the r package inla lindgren and rue 2015 owing to the high computational demand of this technique the regional dataset was reduced norberg et al 2019 by considering 5000 observations obtained by simple random sampling the same 5000 observations were employed to fit all the different models the model can be stated as follows the actual model in the bayesian2 framework is y i b e r n p i l o g i t p i η i η i α x i β u i where y i is the observation 0 1 p i the abundance expressed as a proportion and η i a linear predictor on the covariates and other spatially structured random effects α is the model intercept and x i the matrix of covariates local and regional for observation i with coefficients β finally u i is a spatially structured random effect the spatial effect is modelled using a gaussian process with zero mean and matérn covariance and it is fitted using the spde approximation krainski et al 2018 the model is fit to the regional data and the local data used for calibration to obtain the posterior distribution of the model parameters and spatial effects note that regional data is only used to inform about the regional covariates i e there are no observations of local covariates but that local data includes both the regional and local covariates in this way the regional data is used to estimate the regional effects and the spatial variation while the local data is used to inform about the regional and local effects as well as the spatial variation then a sample from that distribution of the parameters is obtained which is then used to provide the distribution of the presence at the points of the grid used for prediction using the covariates their coefficients and the estimates of the spatial random effects 2 3 3 hierarchical penalized logistic regression approach following gastón and garcía viñas 2010 the third proposed approach for developing hierarchical models consisted in updating logistic regional scale models continental spain to landscape scale biosphere reserve both by re calibration and by the inclusion of new locally meaningful predictors firstly regional models were constructed based on the regional dataset for the five selected species secondly local models were developed based on the landscape dataset including the climatic suitability predicted by the previous regional model as an extra predictor we considered two variants of the hierarchical penalized logistic regression for penalized1 hnms all the models both regional and updated ones were constructed by penalized logistic regression according to harrell 2001 and steyerberg 2009 recommendations functions lrm and pentrace of the r package rms harrell 2018 were employed we propose and use a different modelling methodology penalized2 for the regional model updating step which aims to improve logistic regression regularization for those species with a low number of presences per predictor within the local sample number of presences 10 number of predictors with this aim we developed the updating process in the penalized2 models through the generalized additive model selection approach proposed by chouldechova and hastie 2015 this method is expected to combine the flexibility of gam models hastie and tibshirani 1986 to describe linear and no linear effects and the regularization power of the lasso tibshirani 1996 that reasonably handle with penalization when the number of predictors is high relative to the number of observations hastie et al 2009 we used the r package gamsel chouldechova et al 2018 for this analysis 2 4 comparison and evaluation of the hierarchical approaches all the generated hierarchical models were validated by a four split sample cross validation procedure we randomly divided the original landscape data into two partitions with a repeated four times procedure using the 70 partition for training the models and the other 30 for an independent evaluation for the four split samples replicates of each species and approach we calculated the area under the roc curve auc the maximum value of kappa maxkappa and the maximum value of tss maxtss di cola et al 2017 we generated the mean values and the standard deviation of these statistics among the four samples the general trend for the three statistics is the same for the five species see fig s1 therefore henceforth we will show only auc values additionally we calculated a final consensus model per species and approach by averaging the predictions of the four models previously fitted mateo and muñoz 2010 we assessed the auc statistic value with the data available in the 346 locally sampled plots simple validation finally we compared the consensus models generated for each species among approaches applying the pearson correlation coefficient mateo and muñoz 2010 3 results ensemble2 bayesian2 and penalized2 hierarchical models showed mean auc values cross validation higher than 0 8 swets 1988 whereas ensemble1 bayesian1 and penalized1 performed worst mean values lower than 0 8 table 1 regarding species we found the greatest mean overall auc values in the two species with the highest sample sizes at the local scale scots pine 106 presences and pyrenean oak 161 presences table s1 whereas the worst performance was for the species with the smallest number of presences holly tree 20 presences and holm oak 47 presences the generated final consensus models showed higher aucs simple validation for the ensemble models than for the rest of the approaches table 2 the final consensus hnms obtained through the six proposed approaches are different fig s2 for example the mean value of the pearson correlation coefficient table 3 when comparing ensemble1 and ensemble2 models with bayesian2 model is lower than 0 70 on the contrary penalized1 and penalized2 penalized1 and bayesian1 or ensemble2 with bayesian1 and penalized2 were more similar showing pearson correlation coefficients higher than 0 83 table 3 comparing the predictions maps of the different approaches by species fig s2 we found that the differences among approaches substantially vary among species all prediction sets were rather similar among methods for scots pine and pyrenean oak higher number of presences available table s1 whereas they showed rather dissimilar for the holly tree the holm oak and the common juniper lower number of presences available table s1 4 discussion 4 1 importance of the conceptual and methodological framework in hierarchical niche modelling we have shown that hierarchical niche models obtained at the landscape scale are reliable mean auc values higher than 0 80 table 1 furthermore hierarchical models have been shown to consider a more significant part of the climatic niche of the species than non hierarchical landscape enms mateo et al 2019 this allows more accurate projections both in space and time which is essential in climate change petitpierre et al 2016 invasive species coro et al 2018 gallien et al 2012 mateo et al 2015 and local conservation mateo et al 2019 applied studies in our opinion regardless of the employed hierarchical modelling approach there are three key requirements to obtain reliable results 1 consistent sources quantity and quality of information on the distribution of the species at the different scales 2 a downscaling approach suitable for the available data and the aim of the project lembrechts et al 2018 mateo et al 2019 to convert the regional climatic variables to the landscape resolution meters 3 the generation of the appropriate variables at the landscape scale to explain the distribution of the species at this scale in this regard variables generated from lidar or other remote sensing technologies rocchini et al 2017 stenzel et al 2017 have a crucial role in landscape scale modelling we employed tree species to develop this comparison although hnms could be easily applied and generalized for other taxa i e hattab et al 2014 if we consider the own ecological requirements of the taxa considered guisan et al 2017 in the present study we clearly met these requirements for two scots pine and pyrenean oak of the five species and high auc values were obtained for them independent auc values higher than 0 8 table 1 lower auc values were however obtained for two species holly tree and holm oak the distribution of these two species showed low dependence on the selected local variables and had a low holm oak or very low holly tree local sample size table s1 steyerberg et al 2004 found parsimonious updating methods preferable to more extensive model revisions which should only be attempted with relatively large validation samples in combination with shrinkage however when the proper local factors were considered such as spatial correlation in bayesian2 for the holly tree and the holm oak the effect of the low sample size could be counteracted hierarchical models consider the regional climatic niche of the species so they should be interpreted at the landscape scale as the suitable climatic distribution area of the species the generated hnms were evaluated with current landscape data that represent the current vegetation in the reserve not the suitable climatic distribution therefore the species with a current distribution comparable to their suitable climatic distribution area should obtain higher auc values than species with a current distribution that considerably differs from their suitable climatic distribution area land use practices have intensively modified the vegetation in the biosphere reserve mateo et al 2019 promoting the presence of some species like the scots pine reforestation of the 1970 s and the pyrenean oak livestock and timber importance it can resprout after environmental disturbances as wildland fires etc on the other hand species like the holly tree the common juniper and the holm oak were not used in the reforestation programs and they have not been favoured by disturbances because their capacity to resprout is much lower than for the pyrenean oak therefore their current distribution is significantly smaller than its suitable climatic distribution area auc values are hence expected to be lower when evaluating hnms with real distribution data this does not mean however that the models are less appropriate for local conservation measures for example the hnms could provide useful information in a program for restoration of the natural vegetation see mateo et al 2019 if working with low sample size datasets mateo and muñoz 2010 wisz et al 2008 it is advisable to generate several replicate models by partitioning the initial data and generate a final consensus model it could improve final reliability mateo and muñoz 2010 here the generated consensus model obtained reliable models table 2 for most of the species and modelling approaches other approaches could be applied as the ensemble of small models proposed by breiner et al 2015 4 2 advantages and disadvantages of the different statistical approaches as expected the different statistical approaches showed different results table 1 figs s1 s2 additionally they have intrinsic limitations and advantages which should be known before their application and which we here contribute to clarify hierarchical ensemble niche techniques derived reliable models particularly when the sample size was not limiting nevertheless this improvement in discrimination could involve a risk of overfitting fernandes et al 2018 regarding the computational process they showed intermediate characteristics not as fast and easy to program in r as penalized logistic models but easier and quicker than bayesian as the latter are sometimes based on monte carlo methods that slow down computation and may require to write the model using different program languages i e winbugs or jags in this regard it should be noted that recent developments include inla rue et al 2009 and stan carpenter et al 2017 which provide a flexible model building and also a faster model fitting for bayesian methods however bayesian modelling allowed considering a spatially correlated random effect that leads to reliable models for low sample size species table 1 furthermore bayesian inference admits using prior information and assumptions regarding how species respond to the environment norberg et al 2019 finally penalized logistic hierarchical models have shown to provide reliable results for the well represented species adequate sample adequate dependence of local predictors but not as good as those derived from ensemble techniques on the other hand regularization via lasso managed to derive a reliable model for the holly tree despite its small local sample size therefore highlighting the importance of regularization techniques moreno amat et al 2015 within the updating process the bayesian1 model was fitted employing all the available data so that all available information is used to build models at the landscape scale however unexplained factors were not accounted for meanwhile the bayesian2 model aimed at modelling unexplained factors by including spatially correlated random effects but due to the computational complexity it was not able to handle the complete dataset at the regional level however this is not necessarily a drawback since 5000 observations may be enough to estimate the effect of the environmental variables and the spatial random effect will account for unmeasured factors the results showed that this seems to be the case as predictions with the second model outperform those of the first one table 1 the differences exposed here emphasize the importance of establishing clear aims with policymakers and researchers before undertaking an analogous study in other local areas it is vital to select the appropriate statistical technique predictors and sources of information the ensemble and the penalized approaches are easier to implement and both methods provided similar results an additional comparison is needed with other bayesian approaches i e golding and purse 2016 hefley and hooten 2016 in order to improve the results obtained with this approach however bayesian approaches should be favoured to support future climate change studies and projections due to their model building flexibility 4 3 spatial structure at the landscape scale ecological models trained at the landscape scale are expected to capture important local drivers for plant species and biodiversity distribution patterns lortie et al 2004 mateo et al 2017 such as landscape features microtopography biotic interactions with other species land use or dispersal capacity these drivers can be expected to be spatially explicit predictors and the estimation of the importance of local environment vs spatial structuring is an important research topic in community ecology monteiro et al 2017 therefore an approach controlling the spatial structure at the landscape scale should be considered peres neto and legendre 2010 however ecological models frequently do not consider spatial autocorrelation assumptions or the spatial structure of the variables during the process mateo et al 2011 miller 2012 although it is possible to do so i e record et al 2013 the bayesian2 model with a spatially correlated random effect outperforms the bayesian1 model without a spatially correlated random effect for the five species table 1 this is more evident in the case of the holly tree where the auc value obtained with the bayesian1 model was 0 658 whereas that of the bayesian2 model was 0 835 table 1 furthermore the bayesian2 model for this species obtained the highest auc value in comparison with all the model trained here table 1 these results show that the distribution of the holly tree in the study area clearly follows a spatial distribution pattern therefore for a proper modelling framework for this species an ecological model considering the spatial structure should be employed 4 4 future research we here showed that hierarchical niche modelling is a promising approach to obtain reliable and applicable ecological models at the landscape scale however this study is the first step in the near future studies should investigate other additional methodological and conceptual considerations as for example 1 the integration of different and more complex remote sensing predictors 2 the inclusion of a third scale continental in order to consider the whole climatic niche of the species 3 the projection of hnms to future climatic scenarios 4 the application of hnms in biodiversity modelling see mateo et al 2017 5 the comparison of these results in different study areas and with other hierarchical approaches for example mechanistic or those that integrate physiological models talluto et al 2016 or other bayesian approaches golding and purse 2016 hefley and hooten 2016 6 the application of virtual species during the verification processes fernandes et al 2019 4 5 conclusions our results emphasize the importance of selecting the appropriate modelling approach to generate reliable hierarchical niche models for decision support in local conservation programs here we compared for the first time to our knowledge three statistical approaches of hierarchical ecological niche models that consider different drivers of species distribution at two spatial and ecological scales this comparison gave important insights for the further potential of application of hnms given that the reliability of the three statistical approaches was found to be notably different our approach and comparison are valuable to inform regional stakeholders and decision makers of the implications of these approaches regarding the related conservation and management measures that may be proposed for implementation

25003,ecological niche models are powerful tools in ecology factors operating at different spatial scales are known to jointly influence species distributions but their integration in meaningful and reliable niche models is still methodologically complex and requires further research and validation here we compare six different hierarchical niche models hnms two ensemble two bayesian and two penalized logistic regression approaches the six hnms were applied to produce high resolution 25 m predictions for five tree species in a biosphere reserve in central spain combining information from two spatial scales at the regional scale mainland spain climatic variables were used as predictors and presence absence data were derived from the spanish forest inventory 76 347 plots at the landscape scale biosphere reserve environmental variables were used as predictors while presence absence data were derived from a local vegetation sampling 346 plots we compared and evaluated the six hnms using the auc maxkappa and maxtss statistics and the pearson s correlation coefficient we obtained reliable high resolution hnms at the landscape scale auc values were greater than 0 8 although with variable performance and scope of application ensemble approaches delivered reliable models particularly when the sample size was not a limiting modelling factor however bayesian modelling allowed considering a spatially correlated random effect that outperformed the results of all other approaches for species with a low sample size possibly derived from a strong spatial structure in their distribution hnms succeeded in generating high resolution predictions and manage to identify a significantly greater part of the climatic niche of the species than non hierarchical models this allows more accurate projections both in space and time which is essential in climate change and invasive species modelling projections the usefulness of these models for decision support in local conservation programs is therefore highlighted our methodological comparison is valuable to inform modellers and decision makers of the performance and implications of these approaches regarding the support they can provide for the implementation of conservation management measures at the landscape scale abbreviations hnm hierarchical niche model enm ecological niche models dem digital elevation model keywords ecological niche models ensemble ecological models hierarchical bayesian modelling multiscale approach penalized logistic regression species distribution models 1 introduction the early developments and initial applications of species distribution models more specifically ecological niche models enms started in the 1980s see booth et al 2014 and references therein interest in enms and associated niche analyses has increased dramatically in recent years and they have become essential tools in different fields such as ecology biogeography or conservation see guisan et al 2017 however hierarchical niche modelling hnm at different ecological and spatial scales is vital to produce reliable applicable and ecologically meaningful results diez and pulliam 2007 mateo et al 2017 this is particularly the case when enms are required at detailed spatial resolutions less than 100 m and at a landscape scale mateo et al 2019 in order to anticipate the potential effects of climate change on the distribution of species del barrio et al 2006 hattab et al 2014 petitpierre et al 2016 this includes aspects such as modelling potential microrefugia areas lenoir et al 2017 or guiding local conservation measures mateo et al 2019 given that the complete niche of the species might not be captured thuiller et al 2004 by models trained at small geographic scales petitpierre et al 2016 accurate climate change impact forecasts might ultimately be hampered barbet massin et al 2010 guisan et al 2017 pearson et al 2004 thuiller et al 2004 however few studies have addressed conceptual and methodological questions regarding hnm mateo et al 2019 2017 mcpherson et al 2006 pearson et al 2004 different hierarchical modelling approaches statistical and mathematical have been developed see below but their conceptual and practical differences as well as their relative performance remain largely unexplored therefore it is of high interest to compare the results from these different approaches el gabbas and dormann 2018 and their applicability on local conservation and management assessments mateo et al 2019 conservation management at the landscape scale requires local species distribution data maréchaux et al 2017 and high spatial resolution enms lenoir et al 2017 mateo et al 2019 mccullough et al 2016 mcpherson et al 2006 three different methodological options may be used with the aim of obtaining precise enms at the landscape scale the first option is downscaling models fitted at a lower spatial resolution araújo et al 2005 barbosa et al 2010 bombi and d amen 2012 keil et al 2013 the second option consists of using data gathered directly at the landscape scale d amen et al 2018 mateo et al 2018 scherrer et al 2017 finally the third option consists in using information at different ecological and spatial scales integrating them in a hierarchical modelling framework gallien et al 2012 gastón and garcía viñas 2010 hattab et al 2014 magliozzi et al 2019 mateo et al 2019 pearson et al 2004 petitpierre et al 2016 it is acknowledged that both species and biodiversity spatial distribution patterns are driven by different processes acting at different scales mateo et al 2017 mcgill 2010 wiens 1989 therefore models fitted at coarse resolutions first option do not account for the local ecological processes responsible for the landscape species distribution e g microtopography illán et al 2010 this means that these models can not predict species distributions successfully at the landscape scale collingham et al 2000 on the other hand models fitted with data exclusively gathered at the landscape scale second option ignore macroecological drivers of species distributions mateo et al 2017 they do not include the whole range of climatic conditions suitable for the species climatic niche guisan et al 2017 pearson and dawson 2003 thuiller et al 2004 which makes them of little use to project the impacts of climate change on species distributions petitpierre et al 2016 therefore there is a gap between these two approaches and a need to improve existing models or develop new ones that account for all these drivers acting at different scales third option mateo et al 2017 a well conducted hierarchical modelling framework can apply the concept of hierarchical filters in community ecology bello et al 2013 hattab et al 2014 and can integrate the different scale dependent drivers of species distributions gallien et al 2012 hattab et al 2014 mateo et al 2016 2019 mateo et al 2017 pearson et al 2004 such improvements may allow more realistic projections and reliable conservation and management strategies mateo et al 2019 delivering hnms at the landscape scale and high spatial resolution less than 100 m requires the solution of different conceptual and methodological questions some of these aspects have been considered recently gallien et al 2012 hattab et al 2014 magliozzi et al 2019 mateo et al 2019 2017 pearson et al 2004 but others remain unresolved first one of the significant bottlenecks for producing reliable hnms relies on the fact that landscape scale models require suitable environmental data at detailed spatial resolution mackey and lindenmayer 2001 which are usually scarce remote sensing rocchini et al 2017 could help to deliver the required environmental variables at this fine scale complemented with the downscaling of macroecological variables such as macroclimate mateo et al 2019 here we combine these two tools by 1 using lidar active sensors to deliver data on tree canopy cover fraction of ground area covered by the vertical projection of tree crown perimeters which is related to vegetation structure mateo et al 2018 and understory light availability and 2 implementing a recently proposed method to downscale climatic variables temperature and precipitation from one kilometer to 25 m resolution mateo et al 2019 second hierarchical models could be fitted by different mathematical or statistical approaches as for example 1 combination of ensemble niche models trained at different scales lomba et al 2010 mateo et al 2019 petitpierre et al 2016 2 occupancy bayesian models dorazio 2014 kéry and andrew royle 2010 3 bayesian niche models golding and purse 2016 talluto et al 2016 4 hierarchical update of penalized logistic regression models gastón and garcía viñas 2010 5 joint models of multivariate generalized linear mixed and latent variable models warton et al 2015 as the different statistical approaches have different conceptual procedures and they can offer different results norberg et al 2019 a comparison and a revision of their applicability on local conservation programs are urgent in the present study using as a case study a biosphere reserve in central spain and five tree species we compare three statistical modelling hierarchical approaches and two parametrization options for each approach in their ability to generate reliable hnms and more precise conservation strategies based on their predictions at the landscape scale 2 methods 2 1 species distribution data and scales this study was developed in the sierra del rincón biosphere reserve 41 03 n 3 29 w central spain fig 1 tree species with a minimum of 15 presences papeş and gaubert 2007 in plots sampled in the biosphere reserve were selected see next section five tree species met this requirement holly tree ilex aquifolium l common juniper juniperus communis l scots pine pinus sylvestris l pyrenean oak quercus pyrenaica wild and holm oak q ilex l subsp ballota desf samp the five species represent plant species with different ecological requirements costa tenorio et al 1998 sample size table s1 and distribution areas castroviejo 2012 for each species two datasets were separately compiled at the landscape and the regional scales which are described in the sections below these two scale levels are not arbitrary but represent important scale dependent drivers on the distribution on plant species distribution mateo et al 2019 2017 mcgill 2010 wiens 1989 the regional scale database is expected to characterize the ecological tolerances of plant species to drivers acting at large scales e g macroclimate the landscape scale database is expected to capture important local drivers for plant species distribution e g landscape features microtopography the two databases were employed to derive hnms under three different hierarchical modelling frameworks ensemble niche modelling bayesian and penalized logistic regression see below 2 1 1 regional data we considered the distribution of the five tree species in continental spain as the regional scale here we use regional sensu el gabbas and dormann 2018 i e a geographic extent smaller than the whole range of the species but of much coarser grain than the landscape dataset for the five tree species presences and absences were gathered from the third spanish forest inventory 76 347 circular plots of 25 m radius http www mapama gob es es desarrollo rural temas politica forestal inventario cartografia inventario forestal nacional this inventory follows a grid with nodes separated by 1000 m 2 1 2 landscape data a total of 434 circular plots 10 m radius were locally sampled at the sierra del rincón biosphere reserve presence and absence of tree species were recorded in each plot mateo et al 2019 2018 a minimum distance of 300 m between plots was imposed to prevent spatial autocorrelation dormann et al 2007 the 300 m distance was selected based on the analysis of semi variograms of the species present in the study area the final number of plots considered after this minimum distance constraint was 346 the database was randomly split four times i e split sample cross validation supporting information table s1 into a 70 dataset to fit the models training dataset and a 30 dataset to estimate their predictive accuracy testing dataset the four datasets to fit and validate the models were generated with the function ecospat caleval from the ecospat r package di cola et al 2017 2 2 independent variables we used different independent variables predictors and different spatial resolutions at the two considered scales at the regional scale we used climatic variables from worldclim 2 0 http worldclim org version2 fick and hijmans 2017 at a resolution of 30 arc seconds approximately one kilometer in the equator we run a pearson correlation analysis for all the pairs of variables available in woldclim 2 0 monthly precipitation and monthly minimum maximum and average temperatures we discarded the variables expected to be the least essential for the species distribution in any of the pairs that had a correlation coefficient above 0 7 francis and currie 2003 dormann et al 2013 as a result we selected five physiologically meaningful variables for plants in mediterranean climates which we used to calibrate the models at the regional scale precipitation in april precipitation in august average temperature in october minimum temperature in january and maximum temperature in august at the landscape scale we generated a set of 13 different environmental variables at 25 m resolution for details see mateo et al 2018 to avoid multicollinearity we used the same approach as for the regional predictors pearson s pairwise correlation analysis finally we selected six uncorrelated and ecologically meaningful variables for plant species which we used to calibrate the models at the local scale see mateo et al 2018 1 distance to streams for each pixel we calculated the least surface distance meters to any stream fleming and doan 2013 2 forest canopy cover above 3 m derived from a lidar image centro nacional de información geográfica http centrodedescargas cnig es centrodescargas index jsp canopy cover is the fraction of ground area covered by the vertical projection of tree crown perimeter 3 heat load index which we used to account for the fact that southwest facing slopes have warmer temperatures than southeast facing slopes we quantified this index using the mccune and keon 2002 method which obtains the index values by folding the aspect and by considering the steepness of the slope 4 elevation derived from a 25 m resolution digital elevation model dem centro nacional de información geográfica https www cnig es 5 slope derived from the dem 6 linear aspect orientation derived from the dem the circular aspect was transformed into a linear variable evans et al 2014 the five climatic variables at the regional scale and one kilometer resolution were downscaled in the study area to 25 meters resolution employing a recently proposed methodology see mateo et al 2019 all the independent variables were generated and projected at etrs89 utm 30 n using arcgis 10 3 esri 2015 and r 3 3 2 r core team 2018 software 2 3 hierarchical modelling approaches the two databases were employed to derive hnms under three statistical hierarchical modelling approaches fig 2 for the five selected species as described below 2 3 1 hierarchical ensemble niche modelling approach for each species we generated four ensemble niche models fig 2 araújo and new 2007 marmion et al 2009 one model at the regional scale based on the regional data and climatic variables one model at the landscape scale based on the landscape data and local environmental variables and two hierarchical combinations of regional and landscape models mateo et al 2019 referred to as ensemble1 and ensemble2 ensemble1 was fitted using the local environmental variables plus the suitability predicted by the regional ensemble model originally trained for mainland spain at 30 arc seconds when projected over the local study area biosphere reserve at 25 m resolution using the five climatic variables ensemble2 model was generated by averaging rescaled landscape and regional enms predictions to develop the regional local and hierarchical1 ensemble models we used three statistical techniques generalized linear models glm mccullagh and nelder 1989 boosted regression trees brt friedman 2001 and random forests rf breiman 2001 all the models were generated using the biomod2 thuiller et al 2009 r package with default parameters parameters fine tuning is not needed as we are making a comparison and they remained constant across species and scales for each scale species and modelling technique the corresponding dataset was randomly split ten times into an 80 dataset to generate the models and a 20 dataset to estimate their predictive accuracy i e split sample cross validation after elimination of all the replicates with an auc 0 8 we created for each species an ensemble model consisting of the weighted mean of the different model predictions 2 3 2 hierarchical bayesian approach hierarchical bayesian models gelman et al 2013 are particularly well suited to handle models with complex structure in which covariates have been measured at different scales see for example banerjee et al 2014 in particular two models were considered in the present work the first model bayesian1 considered a logistic regression on the regional and landscape datasets the coefficients on the common environmental variables were shared between both models so that estimation of these coefficients used both datasets hence the regional level model included five covariates climatic variables whilst the landscape model included 11 covariates altogether five downscaled climatic variables and six environmental landscape variables the coefficients of the five common climatic variables were assumed to be the same in both models for this reason this model ensures that the effects of the covariates available at both levels are the same and that they are estimated by considering regional and landscape datasets the prior distributions on the model intercepts and the covariate coefficients were vague gaussian priors with zero mean and precision of 0 001 this model was implemented using the jags software plummer 2017 by means of the rjags plummer 2016 package for the r programming language r core team 2018 the second model bayesian2 was similar to the previous one but included a spatially correlated random effect to account for spatial trends that were not explained by the effects of the covariates the spatial random effect was the same in both models so that it was estimated using both datasets and it was assumed to be gaussian with a matérn covariance diggle and ribeiro 2007 it was implemented using the spde approximation lindgren et al 2011 and the integrated nested laplace approximation rue et al 2009 implemented in the r package inla lindgren and rue 2015 owing to the high computational demand of this technique the regional dataset was reduced norberg et al 2019 by considering 5000 observations obtained by simple random sampling the same 5000 observations were employed to fit all the different models the model can be stated as follows the actual model in the bayesian2 framework is y i b e r n p i l o g i t p i η i η i α x i β u i where y i is the observation 0 1 p i the abundance expressed as a proportion and η i a linear predictor on the covariates and other spatially structured random effects α is the model intercept and x i the matrix of covariates local and regional for observation i with coefficients β finally u i is a spatially structured random effect the spatial effect is modelled using a gaussian process with zero mean and matérn covariance and it is fitted using the spde approximation krainski et al 2018 the model is fit to the regional data and the local data used for calibration to obtain the posterior distribution of the model parameters and spatial effects note that regional data is only used to inform about the regional covariates i e there are no observations of local covariates but that local data includes both the regional and local covariates in this way the regional data is used to estimate the regional effects and the spatial variation while the local data is used to inform about the regional and local effects as well as the spatial variation then a sample from that distribution of the parameters is obtained which is then used to provide the distribution of the presence at the points of the grid used for prediction using the covariates their coefficients and the estimates of the spatial random effects 2 3 3 hierarchical penalized logistic regression approach following gastón and garcía viñas 2010 the third proposed approach for developing hierarchical models consisted in updating logistic regional scale models continental spain to landscape scale biosphere reserve both by re calibration and by the inclusion of new locally meaningful predictors firstly regional models were constructed based on the regional dataset for the five selected species secondly local models were developed based on the landscape dataset including the climatic suitability predicted by the previous regional model as an extra predictor we considered two variants of the hierarchical penalized logistic regression for penalized1 hnms all the models both regional and updated ones were constructed by penalized logistic regression according to harrell 2001 and steyerberg 2009 recommendations functions lrm and pentrace of the r package rms harrell 2018 were employed we propose and use a different modelling methodology penalized2 for the regional model updating step which aims to improve logistic regression regularization for those species with a low number of presences per predictor within the local sample number of presences 10 number of predictors with this aim we developed the updating process in the penalized2 models through the generalized additive model selection approach proposed by chouldechova and hastie 2015 this method is expected to combine the flexibility of gam models hastie and tibshirani 1986 to describe linear and no linear effects and the regularization power of the lasso tibshirani 1996 that reasonably handle with penalization when the number of predictors is high relative to the number of observations hastie et al 2009 we used the r package gamsel chouldechova et al 2018 for this analysis 2 4 comparison and evaluation of the hierarchical approaches all the generated hierarchical models were validated by a four split sample cross validation procedure we randomly divided the original landscape data into two partitions with a repeated four times procedure using the 70 partition for training the models and the other 30 for an independent evaluation for the four split samples replicates of each species and approach we calculated the area under the roc curve auc the maximum value of kappa maxkappa and the maximum value of tss maxtss di cola et al 2017 we generated the mean values and the standard deviation of these statistics among the four samples the general trend for the three statistics is the same for the five species see fig s1 therefore henceforth we will show only auc values additionally we calculated a final consensus model per species and approach by averaging the predictions of the four models previously fitted mateo and muñoz 2010 we assessed the auc statistic value with the data available in the 346 locally sampled plots simple validation finally we compared the consensus models generated for each species among approaches applying the pearson correlation coefficient mateo and muñoz 2010 3 results ensemble2 bayesian2 and penalized2 hierarchical models showed mean auc values cross validation higher than 0 8 swets 1988 whereas ensemble1 bayesian1 and penalized1 performed worst mean values lower than 0 8 table 1 regarding species we found the greatest mean overall auc values in the two species with the highest sample sizes at the local scale scots pine 106 presences and pyrenean oak 161 presences table s1 whereas the worst performance was for the species with the smallest number of presences holly tree 20 presences and holm oak 47 presences the generated final consensus models showed higher aucs simple validation for the ensemble models than for the rest of the approaches table 2 the final consensus hnms obtained through the six proposed approaches are different fig s2 for example the mean value of the pearson correlation coefficient table 3 when comparing ensemble1 and ensemble2 models with bayesian2 model is lower than 0 70 on the contrary penalized1 and penalized2 penalized1 and bayesian1 or ensemble2 with bayesian1 and penalized2 were more similar showing pearson correlation coefficients higher than 0 83 table 3 comparing the predictions maps of the different approaches by species fig s2 we found that the differences among approaches substantially vary among species all prediction sets were rather similar among methods for scots pine and pyrenean oak higher number of presences available table s1 whereas they showed rather dissimilar for the holly tree the holm oak and the common juniper lower number of presences available table s1 4 discussion 4 1 importance of the conceptual and methodological framework in hierarchical niche modelling we have shown that hierarchical niche models obtained at the landscape scale are reliable mean auc values higher than 0 80 table 1 furthermore hierarchical models have been shown to consider a more significant part of the climatic niche of the species than non hierarchical landscape enms mateo et al 2019 this allows more accurate projections both in space and time which is essential in climate change petitpierre et al 2016 invasive species coro et al 2018 gallien et al 2012 mateo et al 2015 and local conservation mateo et al 2019 applied studies in our opinion regardless of the employed hierarchical modelling approach there are three key requirements to obtain reliable results 1 consistent sources quantity and quality of information on the distribution of the species at the different scales 2 a downscaling approach suitable for the available data and the aim of the project lembrechts et al 2018 mateo et al 2019 to convert the regional climatic variables to the landscape resolution meters 3 the generation of the appropriate variables at the landscape scale to explain the distribution of the species at this scale in this regard variables generated from lidar or other remote sensing technologies rocchini et al 2017 stenzel et al 2017 have a crucial role in landscape scale modelling we employed tree species to develop this comparison although hnms could be easily applied and generalized for other taxa i e hattab et al 2014 if we consider the own ecological requirements of the taxa considered guisan et al 2017 in the present study we clearly met these requirements for two scots pine and pyrenean oak of the five species and high auc values were obtained for them independent auc values higher than 0 8 table 1 lower auc values were however obtained for two species holly tree and holm oak the distribution of these two species showed low dependence on the selected local variables and had a low holm oak or very low holly tree local sample size table s1 steyerberg et al 2004 found parsimonious updating methods preferable to more extensive model revisions which should only be attempted with relatively large validation samples in combination with shrinkage however when the proper local factors were considered such as spatial correlation in bayesian2 for the holly tree and the holm oak the effect of the low sample size could be counteracted hierarchical models consider the regional climatic niche of the species so they should be interpreted at the landscape scale as the suitable climatic distribution area of the species the generated hnms were evaluated with current landscape data that represent the current vegetation in the reserve not the suitable climatic distribution therefore the species with a current distribution comparable to their suitable climatic distribution area should obtain higher auc values than species with a current distribution that considerably differs from their suitable climatic distribution area land use practices have intensively modified the vegetation in the biosphere reserve mateo et al 2019 promoting the presence of some species like the scots pine reforestation of the 1970 s and the pyrenean oak livestock and timber importance it can resprout after environmental disturbances as wildland fires etc on the other hand species like the holly tree the common juniper and the holm oak were not used in the reforestation programs and they have not been favoured by disturbances because their capacity to resprout is much lower than for the pyrenean oak therefore their current distribution is significantly smaller than its suitable climatic distribution area auc values are hence expected to be lower when evaluating hnms with real distribution data this does not mean however that the models are less appropriate for local conservation measures for example the hnms could provide useful information in a program for restoration of the natural vegetation see mateo et al 2019 if working with low sample size datasets mateo and muñoz 2010 wisz et al 2008 it is advisable to generate several replicate models by partitioning the initial data and generate a final consensus model it could improve final reliability mateo and muñoz 2010 here the generated consensus model obtained reliable models table 2 for most of the species and modelling approaches other approaches could be applied as the ensemble of small models proposed by breiner et al 2015 4 2 advantages and disadvantages of the different statistical approaches as expected the different statistical approaches showed different results table 1 figs s1 s2 additionally they have intrinsic limitations and advantages which should be known before their application and which we here contribute to clarify hierarchical ensemble niche techniques derived reliable models particularly when the sample size was not limiting nevertheless this improvement in discrimination could involve a risk of overfitting fernandes et al 2018 regarding the computational process they showed intermediate characteristics not as fast and easy to program in r as penalized logistic models but easier and quicker than bayesian as the latter are sometimes based on monte carlo methods that slow down computation and may require to write the model using different program languages i e winbugs or jags in this regard it should be noted that recent developments include inla rue et al 2009 and stan carpenter et al 2017 which provide a flexible model building and also a faster model fitting for bayesian methods however bayesian modelling allowed considering a spatially correlated random effect that leads to reliable models for low sample size species table 1 furthermore bayesian inference admits using prior information and assumptions regarding how species respond to the environment norberg et al 2019 finally penalized logistic hierarchical models have shown to provide reliable results for the well represented species adequate sample adequate dependence of local predictors but not as good as those derived from ensemble techniques on the other hand regularization via lasso managed to derive a reliable model for the holly tree despite its small local sample size therefore highlighting the importance of regularization techniques moreno amat et al 2015 within the updating process the bayesian1 model was fitted employing all the available data so that all available information is used to build models at the landscape scale however unexplained factors were not accounted for meanwhile the bayesian2 model aimed at modelling unexplained factors by including spatially correlated random effects but due to the computational complexity it was not able to handle the complete dataset at the regional level however this is not necessarily a drawback since 5000 observations may be enough to estimate the effect of the environmental variables and the spatial random effect will account for unmeasured factors the results showed that this seems to be the case as predictions with the second model outperform those of the first one table 1 the differences exposed here emphasize the importance of establishing clear aims with policymakers and researchers before undertaking an analogous study in other local areas it is vital to select the appropriate statistical technique predictors and sources of information the ensemble and the penalized approaches are easier to implement and both methods provided similar results an additional comparison is needed with other bayesian approaches i e golding and purse 2016 hefley and hooten 2016 in order to improve the results obtained with this approach however bayesian approaches should be favoured to support future climate change studies and projections due to their model building flexibility 4 3 spatial structure at the landscape scale ecological models trained at the landscape scale are expected to capture important local drivers for plant species and biodiversity distribution patterns lortie et al 2004 mateo et al 2017 such as landscape features microtopography biotic interactions with other species land use or dispersal capacity these drivers can be expected to be spatially explicit predictors and the estimation of the importance of local environment vs spatial structuring is an important research topic in community ecology monteiro et al 2017 therefore an approach controlling the spatial structure at the landscape scale should be considered peres neto and legendre 2010 however ecological models frequently do not consider spatial autocorrelation assumptions or the spatial structure of the variables during the process mateo et al 2011 miller 2012 although it is possible to do so i e record et al 2013 the bayesian2 model with a spatially correlated random effect outperforms the bayesian1 model without a spatially correlated random effect for the five species table 1 this is more evident in the case of the holly tree where the auc value obtained with the bayesian1 model was 0 658 whereas that of the bayesian2 model was 0 835 table 1 furthermore the bayesian2 model for this species obtained the highest auc value in comparison with all the model trained here table 1 these results show that the distribution of the holly tree in the study area clearly follows a spatial distribution pattern therefore for a proper modelling framework for this species an ecological model considering the spatial structure should be employed 4 4 future research we here showed that hierarchical niche modelling is a promising approach to obtain reliable and applicable ecological models at the landscape scale however this study is the first step in the near future studies should investigate other additional methodological and conceptual considerations as for example 1 the integration of different and more complex remote sensing predictors 2 the inclusion of a third scale continental in order to consider the whole climatic niche of the species 3 the projection of hnms to future climatic scenarios 4 the application of hnms in biodiversity modelling see mateo et al 2017 5 the comparison of these results in different study areas and with other hierarchical approaches for example mechanistic or those that integrate physiological models talluto et al 2016 or other bayesian approaches golding and purse 2016 hefley and hooten 2016 6 the application of virtual species during the verification processes fernandes et al 2019 4 5 conclusions our results emphasize the importance of selecting the appropriate modelling approach to generate reliable hierarchical niche models for decision support in local conservation programs here we compared for the first time to our knowledge three statistical approaches of hierarchical ecological niche models that consider different drivers of species distribution at two spatial and ecological scales this comparison gave important insights for the further potential of application of hnms given that the reliability of the three statistical approaches was found to be notably different our approach and comparison are valuable to inform regional stakeholders and decision makers of the implications of these approaches regarding the related conservation and management measures that may be proposed for implementation

25004,the tuta absoluta meyrick lepidoptera gelechiidae commonly known as the tomato leaf miner is arousing interest throughout the scientific community because of its aggressiveness against lycopersicon spp capsicum spp and solanum spp significant economic losses surrounding the tomato plant have been reported in different parts of the world and these are above all the result of the immense capacity of the tomato leaf miner to reproduce within its life cycle which spans an average of 30 days the aim of this paper is the demonstration of a novel mathematical model capable to describe ectotherms life cycle and to test it in the case of t absoluta a mathematical description can help farmers and stakeholders to forecast when the stages at which the insect is most susceptible to control strategies will be reached this will allow timely planning for the performance of the most efficient and environmentally friendly control strategy the model is based on a first order partial differential equation which can describe the density of population in function of the time t and physiological age x and which is driven by the environmental parameters and fundamental conditions for poikilothermic organisms the result is a simulation of the life cycle which depicts that the development of the insect is largely due to daily average temperature this study is strengthened by double validation with semi field data collected in an experimental greenhouse keywords physiological based models von foerster s equation root integrated pest management alien species 1 introduction tuta absoluta meyrick lepidoptera gelechiidae is one of the most prominent pests in tomato farms its origins are found in south america luna et al 2012 where it has been responsible for economic loss for many decades in recent years however the presence of the tomato leaf miner has been reported in other countries in europe the first reporting was in spain in 2007 followed by italy in 2008 biondi et al 2018 eppo global database 2019 speranza and sannino 2012 the most affected plant genera from the solanaceae family belong mainly to the lycopersicon genus but t absoluta becomes increasingly threatening when aggressively infests other genera such as capsicum and solanum cocco et al 2015 tonnang et al 2015 in italy susceptible target zones are areas cultivated with tomatoes potatoes and peppers such as the fondi area in the lazio region this area provides an example of how the combined action of two aggressive alien species namely anthonomus eugenii cano speranza et al 2014a and t absoluta speranza and sannino 2012 can cause a transformation of the agricultural landscape and in turn economic loss biondi et al 2018 marchioro et al 2017 currently the cost of traditional control strategies against phytophagous agents has a significant impact on the total production costs and this is not compatible with sustainable agriculture ideologies for this reason entomologists and integrated pest management scientists have found a series of alternative control strategies that allow for organic agricultural practices that are in line with national and regional directives one of the main challenges to control strategies is the biological structure of the tomato leaf miner its life cycle begins with an egg as reported by biondi et al 2018 around 260 eggs are laid typically by the female on the underside of the leaves with a hatching time of 4 5 days after the eggs hatch larvae penetrate the leaves mesophyll and start their feeding activity the larval stage represents the longest stage experienced in the total life span its duration is approximately 20 days in optimal conditions 30 c biondi et al 2018 or 60 70 of the total life cycle this stage comprises of 4 instars at the end of which the pupa stage takes over pupation has an average duration of 4 7 days after which the adults fly sannino 2012 speranza and sannino 2012 the tendency for a life cycle to end within 30 days together with high fertility rates means that t absoluta can produce up to 9 or 10 generations in a single year biondi et al 2018 cocco et al 2015 sannino 2012 speranza and sannino 2012 damage is concentrated mainly on the leaves and can cause the total loss of the cultivated surfaces if not controlled in more advanced cases feeding activity can affect fruits and flowers as well biondi et al 2018 as regards control strategies chemical pesticides have been the only solution for decades nevertheless several recent studies have focused on the use of alternative products scientific literature has recorded examples of the use of predators speranza et al 2014b and parasitoids or entomopathogenic fungi and bacteria alsaedi et al 2017 biondi et al 2018 gonzález cabrera et al 2011 ruiu 2018 the role of modelling is crucial in this context a forecast of the pest population dynamic based on environmental parameters helps to plan a strategy that can maximise efficiency alilla et al 2007 mannu et al 2017 schaub et al 2017 severini et al 2006 2005 1990 the aim of this study is to develop a new mathematical description of the poikilothermic organisms life cycle by using a modified version of the von foerster s equation trucco 1965 vansickle 1977a von foerster 1959 and then to test the resulting model in the tomato leaf miner case of study the main reason for reformulating an age structured model is to mathematically represent all the life cycle stages for poikilothermic organisms but also to establish a link between their developmental stages more in general the physiological age and environmental factors this condition is fundamental for a correct description in the case of poikilothermic organisms the mathematical description laid out in the next sections involved the division of the study into four phases the formulation of the model the tomato leaf miner parameters estimation the simulation and validation with data collected in an experimental greenhouse in order to ensure the reliability of the work the validation process was performed twice and the results are reported in the conclusive part of this article to perform all the calculations required the new model has been inserted in a specialised software using the c programming language rossini et al 2019 and libraries from the open source software root were incorporated cern 2019 brun and rademakers 1997 2 materials and methods the mathematical description of a poikilothermic organism life cycle can be divided conceptually in two parts the interaction between the environment and the species and the population density in function of time t and physiological age x this last represents the main focus of this work but before an introduction about the most common models used to mathematically describe the effect of the environmental parameters temperature mainly on ectotherm organisms is summarized 2 1 development rate functions temperature humidity and photoperiod play a crucial role in the insect s development humidity and photoperiod in particular become more influential when environmental conditions become critical such as happens with the change of the seasons from hot season to cold season and vice versa however in absence of extreme thermal conditions changes it can be postulated that temperature is the main driving variable the dependence of the mean development time from the temperature can be examined with in laboratory experiments in which the so called life tables are built harcourt 1969 the procedure to estimate the life tables involves a series of constant temperature rearing in a climatic chamber a cohort of eggs laid in the same day is positioned in a climatic cell each egg is kept in a petri dish to maintain the individuality of the cohort s members after this positioning each insect is followed for the duration of the life cycle at the end of the life cycle the mean value of the development time at a specific temperature is recorded marchioro et al 2017 the mathematical translation of the data damos and savopoulou soultani 2012 ikemoto and kiritani 2019 severini and gilioli 2002 is based on a conversion of the mean development times d t i in mean development rates r t i by the use of the expression 1 1 r t i 1 d t i the reason for this conversion is the advantage of obtaining a typical profile from the experimental data reported in fig 1 temperatures start to influence development above the lower threshold point t l below which the life of the insect is theoretically impossible beyond this critical point there is a phase of quasi linear increasing that is often associated with the optimum development temperature range for the species which continues up to a maximum peak this peak corresponds to the optimal temperature t at which the species moves rapidly towards the end of its life cycle a decreasing range in the development rate function due to high temperatures follows until a maximum threshold t m is reached after this point the life is once again theoretically not possible the experimental mean development time d t i presents an associated experimental error usually obtained with a standard deviation σ d t i by using this uncertainty formula it is possible to calculate the associated error for the mean development rates σ r t i the result is the eq 2 2 σ r t i σ d t i d t i 2 the most common expressions used in mathematical descriptions of life tables are formulated mainly by empirical assumptions except in one case which will be discussed further on to finalise the application in the case of the tomato leaf miner the following development rate functions have been considered the linear rate function damos and savopoulou soultani 2012 severini and gilioli 2002 3 r t 1 s t t l where s is the thermal summation t is the daily average temperature and t l is the lower temperature threshold although this expression may be unable to describe the typical decreasing trend in the life tables it has been tested in this study for the purpose of comparison with the following one the briére rate function briere et al 1999 4 r t a t t l t m t 1 m where a and m are empirical parameters t is the daily average temperature and t l and t m are the lower and upper temperature thresholds respectively the briére development rate function has the feature to provide information about the thermal life spectrum of the species despite its formulation on empirical assumptions the logan rate function logan and hilbert 1983 5 r t ψ exp ρ t exp ρ t m t m t δ t where ψ and ρ are empirical parameters t m is the upper temperature threshold beyond which development is not possible and δ t is the interval width between the maximum peak of the function and t m with respect to the briére expression this development rate function does not provide information about the lower threshold but has the advantage of providing other important information located in the parameter δ t δ t describes the width of the decreasing trend starting from the optimum temperature and this helps to understand the capability of the insect to react in the case of increasing temperatures sharpe and de michele rate function ikemoto and kiritani 2019 liu et al 1995 schoolfield et al 1981 sharpe and demichele 1977 6 r t t exp ϕ δ h a t r 1 exp δ s l δ h l t r exp δ s h δ h h t r where t is the temperature in kelvin k r is the universal gas constant 1 987 c a l k 1 m o l 1 ϕ is a conversion factor with no thermodynamic meaning with the aim of rendering the exponential dimensionless δ h a is the enthalpy of activation of the reaction that is catalysed by the enzyme c a l m o l 1 δ s l is the change in entropy associated with low temperature inactivation of the enzyme c a l k 1 m o l 1 δ h l is the change in enthalpy associated with low temperature inactivation of the enzyme c a l m o l 1 δ s h is the change in entropy associated with high temperature inactivation of the enzyme c a l k 1 m o l 1 δ h h is the change in enthalpy associated with high temperature inactivation of the enzyme c a l m o l 1 the advantage of this expression is its formulaic foundation on physical chemical and biological hypotheses on the other hand the calculation effort required for the parameter estimation is higher than that required in the briére and logan expression the main difference is due to the presence of six parameters to be estimated instead of the four contained in the other expressions despite this difficulty when the life tables contain a sufficient number of points they form the most representative expression to link the function of temperature to the biology of the species to perform the calculation the expression can be reformulated 6 with the introduction of new variables if we reformulated in the following way 7 ϕ r a δ h a r b δ s l r c δ h l r d δ s h r e δ h h r f expression 6 becomes 8 r t t exp a b t 1 exp c d t exp e f t expression 8 will be used in this form and applied in the case of the tomato leaf miner we can t choose a priori which is the best development rate function to use and the strategy followed in this study is the estimation of all the parameters related to the expressions 3 5 8 along with a cross check of the r 2 and χ 2 values to isolate the optimal performing function 2 2 the population density model let us now introduce the population density model the main focus of this article there are several models widely used to describe a population as it evolves through life stages and across time the distributed delay model introduced by manetsch and performed with the addition of a mortality coefficient by vansickle manetsch 1976 vansickle 1977b has been applied in numerous case studies in entomology i e allen and byrd 2000 galeano vasco et al 2013 limonta et al 2009 wang et al 1977 and not only i e sipahi et al 2007 spolia 1980 this model is linked to the well known von foerster equation keyfitz and keyfitz 1997 mckendrick 1926 von foerster 1959 as shown by plant and wilson 1986 but both present some problem areas in the conceptual description of age in the case of poikilothermic organisms development is driven by environmental parameters which conceptually means that age is a quantity that accumulates over time the assumption of the cited models is that the growth of the cohort s individuals increases linearly with the time diekmann et al 1983 in other words age is considered similar to time the formulation of the model is founded on considerations in the work of vansickle vansickle 1977a and further discussed and developed by other authors bellagamba et al 1987 buffoni et al 1990 cappio borlino et al 1991 di cola et al 1989 a life cycle could be represented in a schematic way as shown in fig 2 with a series of chained stages each stage has an entering flux of individuals and an exit flux of individuals after maturation the individuals move onto the next stage this flux is ruled by a development rate function which considers in the most general case both the interaction between the species and the environment and the reduction of the rate due to aging in a practical context the development rate functions inserted in the model will be one between the expressions 3 5 8 but theoretically it can be extended to a more general case the reason is that once a population dynamics model has been formulated which takes into account age as being driven by a general development rate function it is possible to focus on the development of this kind of expression this improves the reliability of the model and the integrity of the phenomena described each stage also contains an exit flux indicating mortality which is ruled by a mortality rate function with similar aspects to the described development rate function a state function is introduced to count the number of individuals presents in the life stages considering an infinitesimal stage as represented in fig 3 it is possible to write a balance equation which considers the temporal variation of the number of individuals n t related to the entering flux r x δ x t the exit flux r x t due to maturation and to the exit flux d x t due to mortality 9 d d t n t r x δ x t r x t d x t let us introduce the function of two variables which describes the density of a population that evolves across time and through different stages t x the terms of the eq 9 can be reformulated considering that the number of individuals in the current stage n t corresponds to the following integration 10 n t x δ x x n t x d x the entering flux is ruled by a generalised development rate function g t x which acts as a filter for the population density 11 r x δ x t g t x δ x n t x δ x the exit flux due to the maturation of individuals is also ruled by the development rate function g t x 12 r x t g t x n t x the mortality flux is ruled by a mortality rate function m t x 13 d x t m t x n t x substituting the new form 10 13 in the balance eq 9 and dividing both the members for the stage duration δ x 14 d d t 1 δ x x δ x x n t x d x g t x δ x n t x δ x g t x n t x δ x m t x n t x δ x expression 14 is now divided in three terms and each of them can be rewritten in a different way the hypothesis expressed on the size of the stage described in fig 3 allows the mean value theorem for integrals to be applied to the left term 15 d d t 1 δ x x δ x x n t x d x d d t n t x concerning the first term on the right of the 14 it is possible to approximate the fraction considering the taylor series expansion of the function g t x n t x truncating on the first order 16 g t x δ x n t x δ x g t x n t x δ x x g t x n t x the last term on the right of the 14 represents mortality in the stage assuming that into every single stage mortality is equiprobable the fraction m t x δ x represents an estimation of the average mortality m i t x in line with these considerations 17 m t x n t x δ x m i t x n t x let us substitute the expressions 15 17 into the eq 14 considering the derivative of the time variable a partial derivative has been obtained a generalized von foerster equation in which the development across all stages is ruled by the development rate function 18 t n t x x g t x n t x m i t x n t x von foerster s considerations on the initial and boundary conditions sinko and streifer 1967 von foerster 1959 can be maintained also for the eq 18 using the notation β t x for the fertility rate function the boundary condition provides the new borns profile on the basis of the density of population 19 n t 0 0 β t x n t x d x the initial condition instead represents the starting population s profile in such a way that it indicates the initial division of the individuals through the stages 20 n 0 x n 0 x expressions 18 20 together represent a well posed problem one of the problems that obstructs practical application is the daily average temperature profile in a real context the daily average temperature changes over time and there is not a specific mathematical rule to describe the profile over the course of any given year this means that this is a quantity that should be measured every day in the place of interest by a meteorological station or a data logger in order to use the model it is necessary to have a numerical solution and to use a calculation software programme a discretization technique usually applied to partial differential equations as 18 provides to combine the upwind scheme and the finite difference method bellagamba et al 1987 buffoni et al 1990 di cola et al 1989 di cola and gilioli 1996 more specifically once the discrete variables are introduced the partial derivative on age x g t x n t x is approximated backward while t n t x forward continuous variables t and x in eq 18 can be represented with a sequence of values t n x n with the condition t n t n 1 and x n x n 1 respectively accordingly the discrete variables i t n 1 t n for time and h x n x n 1 for age are defined furthermore the method provides also the discretization of development mortality and fertility rate functions they are indicated as g h i m h i and β h i respectively as result the corresponding discrete form of the eq 18 is represented by 21 n h i 1 i h g h i n h 1 i n h i 1 2 i h g h i i h g h 1 i i m h i n 0 i i 0 β h i n h i h n h 0 n 0 before moving on to the next section a clarification of how temperature is inserted into the model is needed one of the novelties introduced into the model is the generalised development rate function t x in a wider scenario this latter expresses the relationship between species and environment and the effect of aging on the growth it can be considered as a bridge to insert other physiological models into an age structured model because of the paucity of literature on this side an obliged choice is to use one between the expression 3 5 8 in other words the simplification is that the function g t x is dependent only on t and more specifically it is assumed that 22 g t r t t expression 22 in its discrete version become r t i where t i is the daily average temperature measured in poikilothermic organisms development environment following these assumptions the expression 21 is now reduced to 23 n h i 1 i h r t i n h 1 i n h i 1 i h r t i i m h i n 0 i i 0 β h i n h i h n h 0 n 0 expression 23 is now ready to be inserted into a specialised software which receives in input the daily average temperature and the specific parameters for the tomato leaf miner these lasts correspond to the development rate function chosen the output is a representation of the life cycle for all the stages given in function of the time 2 3 the simulator in this section we will introduce a schematic representation of the simulator built to manage all the calculations required by the process of application of the model the basic idea can be found in a previous work by the authors rossini et al 2019 to maintain the same logic scheme described in the previous section the simulator called entosim is divided in two parts the first part has been named fittasso and its task is to follow the users in the phase of parameters estimation more specifically after the laboratory session in which the life tables have been estimated scientists need to estimate the parameters of the development rate functions 3 5 8 that will be a feature for the species examined this part of the software includes in a c program the root libraries related to the non linear fits at the beginning the user has to report the experimental life tables and their errors in a txt file then the program can be launched once the fitting function has been chosen a starting point for each parameter is required for estimation and potential necessity to restrict them within a particular range this operation has been added to increase the integrity of the results together with a calculation of the r 2 and χ 2 values another tool inserted is the calculation of the maximum of the rate functions which corresponds to the thermal optimum t for the development of the species the results are provided in graphical fig 1 and textual formats which can be useful for further calculations in particular the parameter results with their associated errors r 2 and χ 2 values initial values inserted to start the fitting operations and the coordinates t r t of the maximum are recorded to simply explain the decision process surrounding the identification of the best representative expression to be used for the simulation a plot with experimental data and fitted function is provided fig 4 the second part of entosim is called simulatore and it is the tool responsible for providing the final results of the simulations in a c code and with the support of the root s libraries the discrete form of the model 23 was inserted in which the development rate function is dependent only on the external daily average temperature and hence on time the dependence of the rate on aging has not been considered before the launch the user has to insert in specific txt files a vector containing the daily average temperature measured by a data logger or a meteorological station the fertility and mortality rates for all the life stages and finally the initial profile of the population once it is possible to be estimated if this final piece of information is missing a predefined setting considers a cohort of eggs that means all the stages are empty except the first all the parameters estimated in fittasso are automatically absorbed by simulatore after the launch the user is requested to select which kind of development rate function he or she wishes to use it is possible to use more than one expression between 3 5 8 but in different ranges that need to be specified before the simulation if the tool records two or more functions selected for the same range it cancels the operation with a warning message the results of this tool are provided in graphical format see supplementary material and stored in txt files these files can be archived or managed with other software programmes and their content considers the temporal evolution of the density of population in each stage of the life cycle 2 4 experimental design for validation the validation process involves a double semi field experiment in a greenhouse isolated from the external environment to avoid the dispersal of t absoluta adults from the moment flight is possible for the first experiment 35 lycopersicon esculentum mill cv roma tomato plants were placed in a greenhouse box that was labelled box 1 in the second experiment 21 tomato plants were placed in a second box labelled box 2 the plants were sown in pots with a diameter of 22 cm and placed on tables at 90 cm from the ground each greenhouse box had a 3 3 3 m dimension 70 adults were obtained from università della tuscia s plant protection laboratory 24 h old then 35 unsexed adults were released into each box containing the tomato plants which were at an advanced phase of blossoming adults oviposited on the leaves starting new generations the experiment was conducted between the 5th of september 2018 the day of the adults release and the 18th of october 2018 the day of last capture from the point of initial release the temperature was measured using a data logger with a sensitivity of 0 1 c the daily average temperature was calculated with 24 readings for each day one per hour the activity of hatched larvae in each box was monitored daily until the first report of the new adults from this moment the daily number of new adults was counted after the count each adult was removed manually from the box to prevent future days counts from being affected this operation allowed the creation of the experimental population density to be used in the validation of the model 3 results and discussion the experimental life tables for the tomato leaf miner can be found in the literature of marchioro et al 2017 and özgököe et al 2016 both articles report the experimental data as well as an estimation of all the parameters related to various development rate functions in this study we estimated the parameters of the expressions mentioned in materials and methods section taking into account data provided by özgökçe all the calculations were worked out using the fittasso tool contained in entosim and the study by marchioro et al was used for a first comparison all the results are reported in table 1 additionally the chart reported in fig 5 shows a graphical representation comparing the starting points of the experiment with the results a cross check between the r 2 and χ 2 values reported in table 1 suggests that the best development function to be used in the simulation is the sharpe and de michele as indicated in the work of ikemoto and kiritani 2019 to evaluate the goodness of this kind of non linear regression the choice lies between the adjusted coefficient of determination r 2 the residual sum of squares rss or the root mean square error rmse instead of the last two for this work we have also considered the χ 2 test examining only the r 2 value the preference is the sharpe and de michele but χ 2 test reverses the situation in favor of the briére in fact despite the lower χ 2 value belongs to the sharpe and de michele in this last the number of degrees of freedom is lower accordingly the results are p 0 73 for the briére against p 0 60 for the sharpe and de michele notwithstanding the latter expression lies its formulation on physical chemical and biological considerations as discussed in the materials and methods section this aspect increases the reliability of the simulations results despite the non linear fit operation for parameters estimation that required more attention this is due to the strong correlation between the parameters schoolfield et al 1981 to reduce as much as possible inconveniences during the parameters estimation process a series of restriction and controls were inserted into the fittasso tool such as the inserction of starting values and interval limits for each parameter the use of a non empirical rate function constitutes one of the main results of this study since it is not a common practice in simulations of pest populations however despite the reliable value for r 2 and χ 2 the difficulties implied by the use of the sharpe and de michele function left their trace in the estimation of the errors associated with the parameters as shown in table 1 an alternative choice could be the use of the briére function which also displayed reliable results from the cross check between r 2 and χ 2 but with lower values for the errors associated with the parameters more details to motivate the choice of the sharpe and de michele are provided as supplementary material together with an analysis of the simulation outputs varying the expression in input notwithstanding this result is significant because it is not common to find experimental life tables with a sufficient number of points to apply the sharpe and de michele function a first comparison with marchioro et al work confirmed the realiability of the results hence it allowed us to proceed to the simulation step and the results are shown in fig 6 for box 1 and fig 7 for box 2 along with the simulations results the respective validation data was also reported the comparison between simulations and semi field data showed a good accordance in the description of the maximum population dynamic s peak the main differences are the width of the two shapes and the total number of individuals in the populations the integral of the two numerical solutions proceeding by order figs 6 and 7 both show how the prediction has a tendency to anticipate the increase of the population density while the right hand side of the plots the results are in agreement with the experimental population the disagreement between the predicted and experimental population at the beginning of the cohort s development could be due to the combined effect of photoperiod and temperature which both decreased during the period of the validation september october this particular environmental condition could be responsible for a temporal shift in the preimaginal stage development causing a delay in the adult emerging saunders and lewis 1987 the differences between the total number of individuals of the population in box 1 and box 2 can be justified by the number of adults released at the beginning of the experimentation 35 for each box despite in literature a sex ratio female biased is reported silva et al 2015 this condition could not be mantained for low numbers of individuals this means that in box 1 a higher proportion of males could be released and accordingly the progeny was less than box 2 otherwise the release of a higher number of adults at the beginning of the experimentation might produce a highest population density introducing stress factors such as the competition for the choice of oviposition sites or for nutrition sources furthermore other environmental parameters time dependent could be inserted into the development rate function it should also be noted that the age factor has not yet been explored sufficiently by the scientific community and more efforts should be made to understand how aging slows down growth the general theory on development rate function hypothesises that time and physiological age are the determiners of the development through the life stages for this reason it is common practice e g in the works of ainseba et al 2011 gilioli2016 limonta et al 2009 to use the described expressions 3 5 8 with no dependence on g t x by the variable x other possible reasons for the disagreement at the beginning and at the end of the development could be due to the growth condition of a semi field environment despite the temperature constituting a variable both in open field and semi field scenarios in the latter there is an absence of stress factors such as natural enemies or competitors this aspect could increase the width of the experimental population in addition to a corrected balance in the number of plants and the population size in fact the number of adults released in each box to start the monitored generation was individuated considering the potential fertility of each female around 260 eggs as reported by biondi et al 2018 and the probability of each egg hatching and the total life cycle survivor rate the result is a low density population in contact with a significant number of plants to be infested and this ultimately means low stress levels during the growth period of the new insect generations 4 conclusions in conclusion it is possible to notice that the population dynamics represented by the first order partial differential equation effectively represents the development of a cohort of individuals as they evolve through the stages of their life cycle and in function of the time nevertheless one of the aspects to improve upon in future works with a view to making the model presented more reliable is the development rate function in fact this represents the kernel of the model because it is responsible for the mathematical description of the interaction between the species and the environment the development of this argument is not only helpful for making predictions in agricultural and environmental sciences but also can help us to understand biological mechanisms and describe these mathematically mathematical models in biology tend to be simplified and based on empirical assumptions or on experiments and the lack of basic laws ageno 1986 forces model scientists to calibrate and tune models after the validation this operation has undertaken to introduce other sistematic errors derived from calibration experiments which will allow for future works to analyse biological mechanisms in greater depth another interesting aspect could be explored by explicating the derivative on the age variable in the eq 18 24 x g t x n t x g t x x n t x n t x x g t x the explicit expression 24 details how the knowledge of dependence between the development rate function and the age provides a term n t x x g t x similar to a mortality rate this aspect could simplify the understanding of mortality rate which is usually based on coefficients estimated during the construction of life tables in other words one of the advantages when shifting from a chronological age to a physiological age in the most complete form of the development rate function is that it allows us to divide the contribution of the mortality rate in two parts features of the species and behaviour as a response to progress through life stages and external factors the advantages of using predictive models in agricultural and forest management merge with the aim to apply more suistanable control methods for pest populations and plant diseases an application of this type is helpful in several contexts as discussed in the introduction organic farms agricultural suburbs and protected areas such as national parks can benefit from plans for alternative treatments against natural enemies such as predators parasitoids and entomopathogenic fungi and bacteria furthermore an increasing problem in pest and disease management is the introduction of harmful alien species such as t absoluta described in this paper prompt circumscription action of the introduced species is crucial for eradication programmes allowing agronomists farmers and technicians to plan the best strategy in other cases a modelling approach is helpful for territorial programmes in preparation for climate changes studies about this theme are widespread across current literature i e castex et al 2018 nemani et al 2001 pavan et al 2013 pureswaran et al 2018 and most of them have been enriched with the incorporation of simulations therefore the comprehension of biological mechanisms and their translation into mathematical language is fundamental if we are to improve the reliability of predictive results acknowledgments the authors are grateful to the referees for their comments and

25004,the tuta absoluta meyrick lepidoptera gelechiidae commonly known as the tomato leaf miner is arousing interest throughout the scientific community because of its aggressiveness against lycopersicon spp capsicum spp and solanum spp significant economic losses surrounding the tomato plant have been reported in different parts of the world and these are above all the result of the immense capacity of the tomato leaf miner to reproduce within its life cycle which spans an average of 30 days the aim of this paper is the demonstration of a novel mathematical model capable to describe ectotherms life cycle and to test it in the case of t absoluta a mathematical description can help farmers and stakeholders to forecast when the stages at which the insect is most susceptible to control strategies will be reached this will allow timely planning for the performance of the most efficient and environmentally friendly control strategy the model is based on a first order partial differential equation which can describe the density of population in function of the time t and physiological age x and which is driven by the environmental parameters and fundamental conditions for poikilothermic organisms the result is a simulation of the life cycle which depicts that the development of the insect is largely due to daily average temperature this study is strengthened by double validation with semi field data collected in an experimental greenhouse keywords physiological based models von foerster s equation root integrated pest management alien species 1 introduction tuta absoluta meyrick lepidoptera gelechiidae is one of the most prominent pests in tomato farms its origins are found in south america luna et al 2012 where it has been responsible for economic loss for many decades in recent years however the presence of the tomato leaf miner has been reported in other countries in europe the first reporting was in spain in 2007 followed by italy in 2008 biondi et al 2018 eppo global database 2019 speranza and sannino 2012 the most affected plant genera from the solanaceae family belong mainly to the lycopersicon genus but t absoluta becomes increasingly threatening when aggressively infests other genera such as capsicum and solanum cocco et al 2015 tonnang et al 2015 in italy susceptible target zones are areas cultivated with tomatoes potatoes and peppers such as the fondi area in the lazio region this area provides an example of how the combined action of two aggressive alien species namely anthonomus eugenii cano speranza et al 2014a and t absoluta speranza and sannino 2012 can cause a transformation of the agricultural landscape and in turn economic loss biondi et al 2018 marchioro et al 2017 currently the cost of traditional control strategies against phytophagous agents has a significant impact on the total production costs and this is not compatible with sustainable agriculture ideologies for this reason entomologists and integrated pest management scientists have found a series of alternative control strategies that allow for organic agricultural practices that are in line with national and regional directives one of the main challenges to control strategies is the biological structure of the tomato leaf miner its life cycle begins with an egg as reported by biondi et al 2018 around 260 eggs are laid typically by the female on the underside of the leaves with a hatching time of 4 5 days after the eggs hatch larvae penetrate the leaves mesophyll and start their feeding activity the larval stage represents the longest stage experienced in the total life span its duration is approximately 20 days in optimal conditions 30 c biondi et al 2018 or 60 70 of the total life cycle this stage comprises of 4 instars at the end of which the pupa stage takes over pupation has an average duration of 4 7 days after which the adults fly sannino 2012 speranza and sannino 2012 the tendency for a life cycle to end within 30 days together with high fertility rates means that t absoluta can produce up to 9 or 10 generations in a single year biondi et al 2018 cocco et al 2015 sannino 2012 speranza and sannino 2012 damage is concentrated mainly on the leaves and can cause the total loss of the cultivated surfaces if not controlled in more advanced cases feeding activity can affect fruits and flowers as well biondi et al 2018 as regards control strategies chemical pesticides have been the only solution for decades nevertheless several recent studies have focused on the use of alternative products scientific literature has recorded examples of the use of predators speranza et al 2014b and parasitoids or entomopathogenic fungi and bacteria alsaedi et al 2017 biondi et al 2018 gonzález cabrera et al 2011 ruiu 2018 the role of modelling is crucial in this context a forecast of the pest population dynamic based on environmental parameters helps to plan a strategy that can maximise efficiency alilla et al 2007 mannu et al 2017 schaub et al 2017 severini et al 2006 2005 1990 the aim of this study is to develop a new mathematical description of the poikilothermic organisms life cycle by using a modified version of the von foerster s equation trucco 1965 vansickle 1977a von foerster 1959 and then to test the resulting model in the tomato leaf miner case of study the main reason for reformulating an age structured model is to mathematically represent all the life cycle stages for poikilothermic organisms but also to establish a link between their developmental stages more in general the physiological age and environmental factors this condition is fundamental for a correct description in the case of poikilothermic organisms the mathematical description laid out in the next sections involved the division of the study into four phases the formulation of the model the tomato leaf miner parameters estimation the simulation and validation with data collected in an experimental greenhouse in order to ensure the reliability of the work the validation process was performed twice and the results are reported in the conclusive part of this article to perform all the calculations required the new model has been inserted in a specialised software using the c programming language rossini et al 2019 and libraries from the open source software root were incorporated cern 2019 brun and rademakers 1997 2 materials and methods the mathematical description of a poikilothermic organism life cycle can be divided conceptually in two parts the interaction between the environment and the species and the population density in function of time t and physiological age x this last represents the main focus of this work but before an introduction about the most common models used to mathematically describe the effect of the environmental parameters temperature mainly on ectotherm organisms is summarized 2 1 development rate functions temperature humidity and photoperiod play a crucial role in the insect s development humidity and photoperiod in particular become more influential when environmental conditions become critical such as happens with the change of the seasons from hot season to cold season and vice versa however in absence of extreme thermal conditions changes it can be postulated that temperature is the main driving variable the dependence of the mean development time from the temperature can be examined with in laboratory experiments in which the so called life tables are built harcourt 1969 the procedure to estimate the life tables involves a series of constant temperature rearing in a climatic chamber a cohort of eggs laid in the same day is positioned in a climatic cell each egg is kept in a petri dish to maintain the individuality of the cohort s members after this positioning each insect is followed for the duration of the life cycle at the end of the life cycle the mean value of the development time at a specific temperature is recorded marchioro et al 2017 the mathematical translation of the data damos and savopoulou soultani 2012 ikemoto and kiritani 2019 severini and gilioli 2002 is based on a conversion of the mean development times d t i in mean development rates r t i by the use of the expression 1 1 r t i 1 d t i the reason for this conversion is the advantage of obtaining a typical profile from the experimental data reported in fig 1 temperatures start to influence development above the lower threshold point t l below which the life of the insect is theoretically impossible beyond this critical point there is a phase of quasi linear increasing that is often associated with the optimum development temperature range for the species which continues up to a maximum peak this peak corresponds to the optimal temperature t at which the species moves rapidly towards the end of its life cycle a decreasing range in the development rate function due to high temperatures follows until a maximum threshold t m is reached after this point the life is once again theoretically not possible the experimental mean development time d t i presents an associated experimental error usually obtained with a standard deviation σ d t i by using this uncertainty formula it is possible to calculate the associated error for the mean development rates σ r t i the result is the eq 2 2 σ r t i σ d t i d t i 2 the most common expressions used in mathematical descriptions of life tables are formulated mainly by empirical assumptions except in one case which will be discussed further on to finalise the application in the case of the tomato leaf miner the following development rate functions have been considered the linear rate function damos and savopoulou soultani 2012 severini and gilioli 2002 3 r t 1 s t t l where s is the thermal summation t is the daily average temperature and t l is the lower temperature threshold although this expression may be unable to describe the typical decreasing trend in the life tables it has been tested in this study for the purpose of comparison with the following one the briére rate function briere et al 1999 4 r t a t t l t m t 1 m where a and m are empirical parameters t is the daily average temperature and t l and t m are the lower and upper temperature thresholds respectively the briére development rate function has the feature to provide information about the thermal life spectrum of the species despite its formulation on empirical assumptions the logan rate function logan and hilbert 1983 5 r t ψ exp ρ t exp ρ t m t m t δ t where ψ and ρ are empirical parameters t m is the upper temperature threshold beyond which development is not possible and δ t is the interval width between the maximum peak of the function and t m with respect to the briére expression this development rate function does not provide information about the lower threshold but has the advantage of providing other important information located in the parameter δ t δ t describes the width of the decreasing trend starting from the optimum temperature and this helps to understand the capability of the insect to react in the case of increasing temperatures sharpe and de michele rate function ikemoto and kiritani 2019 liu et al 1995 schoolfield et al 1981 sharpe and demichele 1977 6 r t t exp ϕ δ h a t r 1 exp δ s l δ h l t r exp δ s h δ h h t r where t is the temperature in kelvin k r is the universal gas constant 1 987 c a l k 1 m o l 1 ϕ is a conversion factor with no thermodynamic meaning with the aim of rendering the exponential dimensionless δ h a is the enthalpy of activation of the reaction that is catalysed by the enzyme c a l m o l 1 δ s l is the change in entropy associated with low temperature inactivation of the enzyme c a l k 1 m o l 1 δ h l is the change in enthalpy associated with low temperature inactivation of the enzyme c a l m o l 1 δ s h is the change in entropy associated with high temperature inactivation of the enzyme c a l k 1 m o l 1 δ h h is the change in enthalpy associated with high temperature inactivation of the enzyme c a l m o l 1 the advantage of this expression is its formulaic foundation on physical chemical and biological hypotheses on the other hand the calculation effort required for the parameter estimation is higher than that required in the briére and logan expression the main difference is due to the presence of six parameters to be estimated instead of the four contained in the other expressions despite this difficulty when the life tables contain a sufficient number of points they form the most representative expression to link the function of temperature to the biology of the species to perform the calculation the expression can be reformulated 6 with the introduction of new variables if we reformulated in the following way 7 ϕ r a δ h a r b δ s l r c δ h l r d δ s h r e δ h h r f expression 6 becomes 8 r t t exp a b t 1 exp c d t exp e f t expression 8 will be used in this form and applied in the case of the tomato leaf miner we can t choose a priori which is the best development rate function to use and the strategy followed in this study is the estimation of all the parameters related to the expressions 3 5 8 along with a cross check of the r 2 and χ 2 values to isolate the optimal performing function 2 2 the population density model let us now introduce the population density model the main focus of this article there are several models widely used to describe a population as it evolves through life stages and across time the distributed delay model introduced by manetsch and performed with the addition of a mortality coefficient by vansickle manetsch 1976 vansickle 1977b has been applied in numerous case studies in entomology i e allen and byrd 2000 galeano vasco et al 2013 limonta et al 2009 wang et al 1977 and not only i e sipahi et al 2007 spolia 1980 this model is linked to the well known von foerster equation keyfitz and keyfitz 1997 mckendrick 1926 von foerster 1959 as shown by plant and wilson 1986 but both present some problem areas in the conceptual description of age in the case of poikilothermic organisms development is driven by environmental parameters which conceptually means that age is a quantity that accumulates over time the assumption of the cited models is that the growth of the cohort s individuals increases linearly with the time diekmann et al 1983 in other words age is considered similar to time the formulation of the model is founded on considerations in the work of vansickle vansickle 1977a and further discussed and developed by other authors bellagamba et al 1987 buffoni et al 1990 cappio borlino et al 1991 di cola et al 1989 a life cycle could be represented in a schematic way as shown in fig 2 with a series of chained stages each stage has an entering flux of individuals and an exit flux of individuals after maturation the individuals move onto the next stage this flux is ruled by a development rate function which considers in the most general case both the interaction between the species and the environment and the reduction of the rate due to aging in a practical context the development rate functions inserted in the model will be one between the expressions 3 5 8 but theoretically it can be extended to a more general case the reason is that once a population dynamics model has been formulated which takes into account age as being driven by a general development rate function it is possible to focus on the development of this kind of expression this improves the reliability of the model and the integrity of the phenomena described each stage also contains an exit flux indicating mortality which is ruled by a mortality rate function with similar aspects to the described development rate function a state function is introduced to count the number of individuals presents in the life stages considering an infinitesimal stage as represented in fig 3 it is possible to write a balance equation which considers the temporal variation of the number of individuals n t related to the entering flux r x δ x t the exit flux r x t due to maturation and to the exit flux d x t due to mortality 9 d d t n t r x δ x t r x t d x t let us introduce the function of two variables which describes the density of a population that evolves across time and through different stages t x the terms of the eq 9 can be reformulated considering that the number of individuals in the current stage n t corresponds to the following integration 10 n t x δ x x n t x d x the entering flux is ruled by a generalised development rate function g t x which acts as a filter for the population density 11 r x δ x t g t x δ x n t x δ x the exit flux due to the maturation of individuals is also ruled by the development rate function g t x 12 r x t g t x n t x the mortality flux is ruled by a mortality rate function m t x 13 d x t m t x n t x substituting the new form 10 13 in the balance eq 9 and dividing both the members for the stage duration δ x 14 d d t 1 δ x x δ x x n t x d x g t x δ x n t x δ x g t x n t x δ x m t x n t x δ x expression 14 is now divided in three terms and each of them can be rewritten in a different way the hypothesis expressed on the size of the stage described in fig 3 allows the mean value theorem for integrals to be applied to the left term 15 d d t 1 δ x x δ x x n t x d x d d t n t x concerning the first term on the right of the 14 it is possible to approximate the fraction considering the taylor series expansion of the function g t x n t x truncating on the first order 16 g t x δ x n t x δ x g t x n t x δ x x g t x n t x the last term on the right of the 14 represents mortality in the stage assuming that into every single stage mortality is equiprobable the fraction m t x δ x represents an estimation of the average mortality m i t x in line with these considerations 17 m t x n t x δ x m i t x n t x let us substitute the expressions 15 17 into the eq 14 considering the derivative of the time variable a partial derivative has been obtained a generalized von foerster equation in which the development across all stages is ruled by the development rate function 18 t n t x x g t x n t x m i t x n t x von foerster s considerations on the initial and boundary conditions sinko and streifer 1967 von foerster 1959 can be maintained also for the eq 18 using the notation β t x for the fertility rate function the boundary condition provides the new borns profile on the basis of the density of population 19 n t 0 0 β t x n t x d x the initial condition instead represents the starting population s profile in such a way that it indicates the initial division of the individuals through the stages 20 n 0 x n 0 x expressions 18 20 together represent a well posed problem one of the problems that obstructs practical application is the daily average temperature profile in a real context the daily average temperature changes over time and there is not a specific mathematical rule to describe the profile over the course of any given year this means that this is a quantity that should be measured every day in the place of interest by a meteorological station or a data logger in order to use the model it is necessary to have a numerical solution and to use a calculation software programme a discretization technique usually applied to partial differential equations as 18 provides to combine the upwind scheme and the finite difference method bellagamba et al 1987 buffoni et al 1990 di cola et al 1989 di cola and gilioli 1996 more specifically once the discrete variables are introduced the partial derivative on age x g t x n t x is approximated backward while t n t x forward continuous variables t and x in eq 18 can be represented with a sequence of values t n x n with the condition t n t n 1 and x n x n 1 respectively accordingly the discrete variables i t n 1 t n for time and h x n x n 1 for age are defined furthermore the method provides also the discretization of development mortality and fertility rate functions they are indicated as g h i m h i and β h i respectively as result the corresponding discrete form of the eq 18 is represented by 21 n h i 1 i h g h i n h 1 i n h i 1 2 i h g h i i h g h 1 i i m h i n 0 i i 0 β h i n h i h n h 0 n 0 before moving on to the next section a clarification of how temperature is inserted into the model is needed one of the novelties introduced into the model is the generalised development rate function t x in a wider scenario this latter expresses the relationship between species and environment and the effect of aging on the growth it can be considered as a bridge to insert other physiological models into an age structured model because of the paucity of literature on this side an obliged choice is to use one between the expression 3 5 8 in other words the simplification is that the function g t x is dependent only on t and more specifically it is assumed that 22 g t r t t expression 22 in its discrete version become r t i where t i is the daily average temperature measured in poikilothermic organisms development environment following these assumptions the expression 21 is now reduced to 23 n h i 1 i h r t i n h 1 i n h i 1 i h r t i i m h i n 0 i i 0 β h i n h i h n h 0 n 0 expression 23 is now ready to be inserted into a specialised software which receives in input the daily average temperature and the specific parameters for the tomato leaf miner these lasts correspond to the development rate function chosen the output is a representation of the life cycle for all the stages given in function of the time 2 3 the simulator in this section we will introduce a schematic representation of the simulator built to manage all the calculations required by the process of application of the model the basic idea can be found in a previous work by the authors rossini et al 2019 to maintain the same logic scheme described in the previous section the simulator called entosim is divided in two parts the first part has been named fittasso and its task is to follow the users in the phase of parameters estimation more specifically after the laboratory session in which the life tables have been estimated scientists need to estimate the parameters of the development rate functions 3 5 8 that will be a feature for the species examined this part of the software includes in a c program the root libraries related to the non linear fits at the beginning the user has to report the experimental life tables and their errors in a txt file then the program can be launched once the fitting function has been chosen a starting point for each parameter is required for estimation and potential necessity to restrict them within a particular range this operation has been added to increase the integrity of the results together with a calculation of the r 2 and χ 2 values another tool inserted is the calculation of the maximum of the rate functions which corresponds to the thermal optimum t for the development of the species the results are provided in graphical fig 1 and textual formats which can be useful for further calculations in particular the parameter results with their associated errors r 2 and χ 2 values initial values inserted to start the fitting operations and the coordinates t r t of the maximum are recorded to simply explain the decision process surrounding the identification of the best representative expression to be used for the simulation a plot with experimental data and fitted function is provided fig 4 the second part of entosim is called simulatore and it is the tool responsible for providing the final results of the simulations in a c code and with the support of the root s libraries the discrete form of the model 23 was inserted in which the development rate function is dependent only on the external daily average temperature and hence on time the dependence of the rate on aging has not been considered before the launch the user has to insert in specific txt files a vector containing the daily average temperature measured by a data logger or a meteorological station the fertility and mortality rates for all the life stages and finally the initial profile of the population once it is possible to be estimated if this final piece of information is missing a predefined setting considers a cohort of eggs that means all the stages are empty except the first all the parameters estimated in fittasso are automatically absorbed by simulatore after the launch the user is requested to select which kind of development rate function he or she wishes to use it is possible to use more than one expression between 3 5 8 but in different ranges that need to be specified before the simulation if the tool records two or more functions selected for the same range it cancels the operation with a warning message the results of this tool are provided in graphical format see supplementary material and stored in txt files these files can be archived or managed with other software programmes and their content considers the temporal evolution of the density of population in each stage of the life cycle 2 4 experimental design for validation the validation process involves a double semi field experiment in a greenhouse isolated from the external environment to avoid the dispersal of t absoluta adults from the moment flight is possible for the first experiment 35 lycopersicon esculentum mill cv roma tomato plants were placed in a greenhouse box that was labelled box 1 in the second experiment 21 tomato plants were placed in a second box labelled box 2 the plants were sown in pots with a diameter of 22 cm and placed on tables at 90 cm from the ground each greenhouse box had a 3 3 3 m dimension 70 adults were obtained from università della tuscia s plant protection laboratory 24 h old then 35 unsexed adults were released into each box containing the tomato plants which were at an advanced phase of blossoming adults oviposited on the leaves starting new generations the experiment was conducted between the 5th of september 2018 the day of the adults release and the 18th of october 2018 the day of last capture from the point of initial release the temperature was measured using a data logger with a sensitivity of 0 1 c the daily average temperature was calculated with 24 readings for each day one per hour the activity of hatched larvae in each box was monitored daily until the first report of the new adults from this moment the daily number of new adults was counted after the count each adult was removed manually from the box to prevent future days counts from being affected this operation allowed the creation of the experimental population density to be used in the validation of the model 3 results and discussion the experimental life tables for the tomato leaf miner can be found in the literature of marchioro et al 2017 and özgököe et al 2016 both articles report the experimental data as well as an estimation of all the parameters related to various development rate functions in this study we estimated the parameters of the expressions mentioned in materials and methods section taking into account data provided by özgökçe all the calculations were worked out using the fittasso tool contained in entosim and the study by marchioro et al was used for a first comparison all the results are reported in table 1 additionally the chart reported in fig 5 shows a graphical representation comparing the starting points of the experiment with the results a cross check between the r 2 and χ 2 values reported in table 1 suggests that the best development function to be used in the simulation is the sharpe and de michele as indicated in the work of ikemoto and kiritani 2019 to evaluate the goodness of this kind of non linear regression the choice lies between the adjusted coefficient of determination r 2 the residual sum of squares rss or the root mean square error rmse instead of the last two for this work we have also considered the χ 2 test examining only the r 2 value the preference is the sharpe and de michele but χ 2 test reverses the situation in favor of the briére in fact despite the lower χ 2 value belongs to the sharpe and de michele in this last the number of degrees of freedom is lower accordingly the results are p 0 73 for the briére against p 0 60 for the sharpe and de michele notwithstanding the latter expression lies its formulation on physical chemical and biological considerations as discussed in the materials and methods section this aspect increases the reliability of the simulations results despite the non linear fit operation for parameters estimation that required more attention this is due to the strong correlation between the parameters schoolfield et al 1981 to reduce as much as possible inconveniences during the parameters estimation process a series of restriction and controls were inserted into the fittasso tool such as the inserction of starting values and interval limits for each parameter the use of a non empirical rate function constitutes one of the main results of this study since it is not a common practice in simulations of pest populations however despite the reliable value for r 2 and χ 2 the difficulties implied by the use of the sharpe and de michele function left their trace in the estimation of the errors associated with the parameters as shown in table 1 an alternative choice could be the use of the briére function which also displayed reliable results from the cross check between r 2 and χ 2 but with lower values for the errors associated with the parameters more details to motivate the choice of the sharpe and de michele are provided as supplementary material together with an analysis of the simulation outputs varying the expression in input notwithstanding this result is significant because it is not common to find experimental life tables with a sufficient number of points to apply the sharpe and de michele function a first comparison with marchioro et al work confirmed the realiability of the results hence it allowed us to proceed to the simulation step and the results are shown in fig 6 for box 1 and fig 7 for box 2 along with the simulations results the respective validation data was also reported the comparison between simulations and semi field data showed a good accordance in the description of the maximum population dynamic s peak the main differences are the width of the two shapes and the total number of individuals in the populations the integral of the two numerical solutions proceeding by order figs 6 and 7 both show how the prediction has a tendency to anticipate the increase of the population density while the right hand side of the plots the results are in agreement with the experimental population the disagreement between the predicted and experimental population at the beginning of the cohort s development could be due to the combined effect of photoperiod and temperature which both decreased during the period of the validation september october this particular environmental condition could be responsible for a temporal shift in the preimaginal stage development causing a delay in the adult emerging saunders and lewis 1987 the differences between the total number of individuals of the population in box 1 and box 2 can be justified by the number of adults released at the beginning of the experimentation 35 for each box despite in literature a sex ratio female biased is reported silva et al 2015 this condition could not be mantained for low numbers of individuals this means that in box 1 a higher proportion of males could be released and accordingly the progeny was less than box 2 otherwise the release of a higher number of adults at the beginning of the experimentation might produce a highest population density introducing stress factors such as the competition for the choice of oviposition sites or for nutrition sources furthermore other environmental parameters time dependent could be inserted into the development rate function it should also be noted that the age factor has not yet been explored sufficiently by the scientific community and more efforts should be made to understand how aging slows down growth the general theory on development rate function hypothesises that time and physiological age are the determiners of the development through the life stages for this reason it is common practice e g in the works of ainseba et al 2011 gilioli2016 limonta et al 2009 to use the described expressions 3 5 8 with no dependence on g t x by the variable x other possible reasons for the disagreement at the beginning and at the end of the development could be due to the growth condition of a semi field environment despite the temperature constituting a variable both in open field and semi field scenarios in the latter there is an absence of stress factors such as natural enemies or competitors this aspect could increase the width of the experimental population in addition to a corrected balance in the number of plants and the population size in fact the number of adults released in each box to start the monitored generation was individuated considering the potential fertility of each female around 260 eggs as reported by biondi et al 2018 and the probability of each egg hatching and the total life cycle survivor rate the result is a low density population in contact with a significant number of plants to be infested and this ultimately means low stress levels during the growth period of the new insect generations 4 conclusions in conclusion it is possible to notice that the population dynamics represented by the first order partial differential equation effectively represents the development of a cohort of individuals as they evolve through the stages of their life cycle and in function of the time nevertheless one of the aspects to improve upon in future works with a view to making the model presented more reliable is the development rate function in fact this represents the kernel of the model because it is responsible for the mathematical description of the interaction between the species and the environment the development of this argument is not only helpful for making predictions in agricultural and environmental sciences but also can help us to understand biological mechanisms and describe these mathematically mathematical models in biology tend to be simplified and based on empirical assumptions or on experiments and the lack of basic laws ageno 1986 forces model scientists to calibrate and tune models after the validation this operation has undertaken to introduce other sistematic errors derived from calibration experiments which will allow for future works to analyse biological mechanisms in greater depth another interesting aspect could be explored by explicating the derivative on the age variable in the eq 18 24 x g t x n t x g t x x n t x n t x x g t x the explicit expression 24 details how the knowledge of dependence between the development rate function and the age provides a term n t x x g t x similar to a mortality rate this aspect could simplify the understanding of mortality rate which is usually based on coefficients estimated during the construction of life tables in other words one of the advantages when shifting from a chronological age to a physiological age in the most complete form of the development rate function is that it allows us to divide the contribution of the mortality rate in two parts features of the species and behaviour as a response to progress through life stages and external factors the advantages of using predictive models in agricultural and forest management merge with the aim to apply more suistanable control methods for pest populations and plant diseases an application of this type is helpful in several contexts as discussed in the introduction organic farms agricultural suburbs and protected areas such as national parks can benefit from plans for alternative treatments against natural enemies such as predators parasitoids and entomopathogenic fungi and bacteria furthermore an increasing problem in pest and disease management is the introduction of harmful alien species such as t absoluta described in this paper prompt circumscription action of the introduced species is crucial for eradication programmes allowing agronomists farmers and technicians to plan the best strategy in other cases a modelling approach is helpful for territorial programmes in preparation for climate changes studies about this theme are widespread across current literature i e castex et al 2018 nemani et al 2001 pavan et al 2013 pureswaran et al 2018 and most of them have been enriched with the incorporation of simulations therefore the comprehension of biological mechanisms and their translation into mathematical language is fundamental if we are to improve the reliability of predictive results acknowledgments the authors are grateful to the referees for their comments and
