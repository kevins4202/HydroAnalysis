13625,an efficient and cost competitive hybrid cucr2o4 cafe ldo catalyst was successfully synthesized for the decontamination of olive mill wastewater cucr2o4 cafe ldo has a bandgap of 2 56 ev exhibited stable photocurrent response of 4 48 μa cm 2 possesses a wide range of pores with an average size and pore surface area of 12 51 nm and 8 25 m2 g 1 respectively the constituent elements and optical activity of the cucr2o4 cafe ldo were established by an x ray photoelectron spectroscopy and diffuse reflectance uv vis spectroscopy respectively under optimized conditions 50 mg cucr2o4 cafe ldo achieved 54 8 degradation of phenolics after 4 h without an oxidant in the dark while 90 degradation was attained within 40 min with sunlight assisted irradiation in the presence of 0 05 m k2s2o8 under uv assisted system cucr2o4 cafe ldo k2s2o8 consumed 19 22 kw h m 3 0 96 electrical energy with an apparent rate constant kapp 0 00598 min 1 within 120 min which resulted to 99 degradation of the phenolics 95 1 cod removal and 84 6 bod removal efficiency the spent catalyst was rapidly recovered from the bulk solution due to its sufficient saturation magnetization of 54 7 emu g 1 and retained 93 reuse efficiency after four consecutive recycling tests the multiprocess mechanism was established considering the contribution of active species oh so4 h and o2 keywords calcined cafe ldh phenolics mineralization narrow bandgap solar photocatalysis spinel oxide hydrocalumite 1 introduction olive trees plantation and olive oil production are important agro economic activities for several countries based on the recent report by the international olive council ioc 2019 the total global production of olive oil was estimated to reach 3 67 106 tons for the 2019 2020 harvest season which is 17 2 increases compared to previous harvest season the olive oil is predominantly produced in the mediterranean regions greece turkey tunisia spain morocco cyprus italy portugal and among others covering nearly 79 of the world s olive oil production 1 4 the olive oil is largely consumed due to its many health and nutritional benefits however its production generates excessive quantities of wastes 30 solid leftover i e olive pomace or solid olive cakes and olive oil mill wastewater oomw which constitutes 50 of the wastes 1 5 6 the olive oil producing countries face serious environmental issues in managing the wastes generated notably the oomw presents a strong unpleasant odour due to its heavily loaded phytotoxic organic contents generally has a low ph high chemical oxygen demand 3500 85 000 mg l 1 and high biochemical oxygen demand 2000 35 000 mg l 1 depending on the production processes traditional 2 phase or 3 phase decanter oomw is difficult to treat resistant to biodegradation and unusable for irrigation 7 11 the phenolics contained in the oomw can change soil quality and cause serious toxicity to aquatic organisms over long term exposure 12 13 in cyprus the majority of olive mills are small scale factories that generally stored the olive mill wastewater in evaporation ponds lagooning or littered around isolated farmsteads 1 12 although the use of evaporation ponds is an economic management practice of decreasing the oomw however this process contributes to the scarcity of the much needed water in cyprus does not reduce the oomw toxicity nor its unpleasant smell around where the ponds are located littering the oomw on agricultural soils is detrimental to seed germination and growth since the oomw contains several monomeric phenolic compounds long and short chain fatty acids with considerable phytotoxic effects 14 16 therefore there is an urgent need for cost competitive management approach suitable for small scale olive mill operators to decontaminate and reduce the threatening environmental impact of olive mill wastewater research efforts have been intensified towards the development and application of biological membrane separation physical and or chemical treatment technologies as well as various combinations to treat oomw 1 15 17 19 a varying degree of success has been recorded meanwhile low toxicity reduction membrane fouling high capital cost and generation of secondary pollution are some of the drawbacks of these technologies 20 21 among these techniques the photocatalytic process is a highly promising cost competitive technology for the degradation of organic pollutants under suitable light illumination the photocatalyst generates electron e hole h pairs which react with adsorbed species to produce highly oxidizing radicals that can oxidize and mineralized organic pollutants for instance uĝurlu and karaoĝlu 17 applied tio2 supported sepiolite photocatalyst for the degradation of olive mill wastewater in the presence of uv light and oxidant the authors observed that the phenolics were completely removed at high ph 11 00 after 24 h in the presence of 30 mol l 1 h2o2 similarly silva et al 18 studied the photocatalytic degradation of simulated and actual olive mill wastewaters using h2o2 assisted tio2 system they reported that 0 118 mol l 1 h2o2 0 75 g l 1 photocatalyst and 400 w uv irradiation power led to 80 mineralization of the phenolics after 60 min of reaction although tio2 is a remarkable photocatalyst its efficiency is restricted because of its weak visible light absorption ascribed to the wide optical bandgap of 3 ev and sometimes fast recombination rate of photogenerated e h pairs recently researchers have directed their attentions towards the application of a narrow bandgap 1 2 1 5 ev copper chromite cucr2o4 a p type semiconductor which can be activated by uv and solar radiation for the degradation of wide pollutants 22 23 the association of cucr2o4 with multifunctional calcium based layered double hydroxide ldh materials can result in a robust composite with increased photodegradation activity reduced recombination e h larger surface area to trap pollutants and favourable ion exchange ability the cafe ldh used in this study belongs to the hydrocalumite subgroup of the hydrotalcite mineral materials 24 the ca2 is heptacoordinated with fe3 ion thus giving the ca based ldhs higher ion exchange capabilities than other octacoordinated ldhs 25 calcination of ldhs results in ldos layered double oxides which possess more dispersed metals massive active sites and unique memory effect 25 28 thus cucr2o4 cafe ldo photocatalyst was synthesized successfully and characterized via various spectroscopic tools in this work the hybrid catalyst possesses sufficient bandgap that allowed it to be used under uv and sunlight irradiation for the photocatalytic treatment of high strength olive mill wastewater the probable photocatalytic mechanisms were established based on the results of radicals trapping and uv vis absorption spectra this research highlights the powerful synergistic combination of layered double oxide and chromium based spinel oxide for mineralization of toxic phenolics notably the economic performance of the cucr2o4 cafe ldo was further established through the electrical energy consumption analysis regeneration of spent catalyst and recyclability studies 2 experimental 2 1 materials analytical grade of the metallic salts was used to prepare the photocatalysts cu no3 2 6h2o 98 cr no3 3 9h2o 99 citric acid 99 cacl2

merck kgaa darmstadt germany all reagents were used as received without purification 2 2 raw olive mill wastewater sample freshly processed raw olive mill wastewater sample was collected from a three phase olive mill located in the karpaz district of turkish republic of northern cyprus and diluted with distilled water by a ratio of 1 2 the diluted raw sample was filtered by 50 micron stainless wire mesh to remove larger solids and centrifuged then stored at 5 c in a refrigerator for later use the physicochemical properties of the oomw were determined following the procedures reported in the apha awwa wef handbook 2540d c 5220d 5530d 29 the bod and cod of the sample were determined as detailed elsewhere 30 31 and results obtained are presented in table 1 the filtered sample was subjected to photocatalytic treatment as detailed in section 2 5 2 3 synthesis process firstly the synthesis of the cafe ldh was optimized based on recent reports 24 32 typically 44 8 mmol of cacl2 2h2o was mixed with 22 4 mmol of fecl3 6h2o in the presence of 50 ml citric acid 0 05 mm the mixture was added dropwise into 100 ml aqueous solution of 134 4 mmol naoh oh ca2 fe3 2 and stirred at room temperature under n2 atmosphere for 5 h obtained ldh particles were washed with distilled water and ethanol filtered through a buchner funnel dried at 65 c and ground in a laboratory mortar into fine cafe ldh powders secondly cucr2o4 powder was prepared via a sol gel technique 0 3 mol of cu no3 2 6h2o and 0 6 mol cr no3 2 9h2o were mixed in 50 ml of ethanol then 8 5 ml of propylene oxide was slowly added with constant stirring at 60 c a deep green gel formed after 30 min was dried for 24 h at 80 c to produce the hybrid photocatalyst powdered cafe ldh and dried xerogel like cucr2o4 were 1 1 ratio evenly ground in a mortar for 10 min and 5 ml citric acid 0 1 m was added to the composite as a complex and stabilizing agent then mechanically stirred for 60 min the resultant composite was dried at 100 c in a hot air oven for 60 min then calcined at 900 c for 3 h 10 c min 1 to obtain black coloured cucr2o4 cafe ldo powder after cooling the final product was washed with water ethanol mixture severally via filtration method then dried at 80 c overnight and sieved to a uniform size 2 4 characterization methods the magnetic properties of the samples were determined at an applied

spectrophotometer perkin elmer japan the x ray powder diffraction xrd patterns were recorded using x ray diffractometer bruker d8 bruker axs ettlingen germany with a cu kα λ 1 54187 å radiation source at 40 kv the measurement was recorded at 2θ 5 70 at a rate of 2 min 1 and the crystalline phases were clarified using standard jcpds files the sem morphology was acquired by jsm 6390 scanning electron microscope jeol japan the specific surface area was determined by brunauer emmett teller bet method after n2 gas adsorption desorption quantified at 196 c on an autosorb analyzer quantachrome usa and the pore size distributions calculated from the desorption branches through the barrett joyner halenda bjh method hitachi thermal analyzer instrument sta7300 japan was used for the tg dta thermal analysis at a heating rate of 10 c min 1 under nitrogen gas the uv vis diffuse reflectance spectra drs were obtained by uv 2450 spectrometer shimadzu japan and the band energy gap was calculated according to eq 1 where eg is the bandgap hν is the absorption energy α represents the absorption coefficient and y is a parameter associated with the conduction and valence band 1 α h v 1 2 y h v e g 2 5 sunlight and uv assisted photocatalytic studies the photocatalytic experiments were performed in a batch type laboratory scale reactor equipped with a rotating disc fig s1 in the presence of an adjustable uv light irradiations peak power 9 30 w light intensity 200 w m 2 t8 philips and under direct sunlight between 12 pm and 3 pm the sunlight flux density 245 15 w m 2 was measured using apogee pyranometers mp 100 usa 0 25 1 0 g of the catalyst was added to 100 ml of filtered oomw solution without adjusting its initial ph and stirred in a dark place for 30 min to attain the adsorption desorption equilibrium state then the suspension was irradiated under a uv or direct sunlight for 300 min in the presence and absence of 0 025 0 075 m of oxidants h2o2 or k2s2o8 the reaction mixture was continuously homogenized by mechanical agitation and maintained under constant air inlet periodically the catalyst was separated from the reactor by an external magnet and 2 ml samples were withdrawn then the absorbance of residual phenol was measured at λmax 255 nm by a uv vis spectrophotometer perkinelmer usa with a 1 cm path length quartz cell the efficiency of the catalyst was investigated when the oomw ph was adjusted using 0 5 m citric acid and 0 5 m naoh control experiments with light alone or cucr2o4 cafe ldo only were run for comparison the stability of cucr2o4 cafe ldo was checked by determining the leached metal ion concentrations using atomic absorption spectroscopy novaa 400 germany the spent cucr2o4 cafe ldo was separated from the solution by an external magnet then soaked in 0 01 m naoh for 30 min afterwards the reconditioned cucr2o4 cafe ldo was dried at 80 c for 60 min and reused repeatedly radical trapping experiments were performed by adding 3 mm radical scavengers separately into the test solutions as previously described in our recent reports 27 33 ros reactive oxygen species such as superoxide radicals o2 hydroxyl radicals oh sulfate radicals so4 and holes h were captured by 1 4 benzoquinone bq tert butyl alcohol t buoh methanol meoh and sodium iodate naio3 respectively 2 6 data analysis each experiment was performed three times and the average result is reported within experiment errors of 2 the photocatalytic degradation efficiency η of cucr2o4 cafe ldo was calculated by the eq 2 and the reaction kinetics by eq 3 2 η 1 c t

constant v is the volume of oomw l p is the electrical power consumed during the treatment kw and t is reaction time min graphpad prism ver 7 usa was employed for data visualization 3 results and discussion the major characteristics of the raw filtered and treated oomw samples are shown in table 1 olive mill wastewater maintains variable characteristics which are attributed to the extraction process olive seed variety weather conditions and ripeness of the fruits among many other factors as expected the concentration of total solids in the untreated oomw was high 9170 10725 mg l 1 and the oomw has high conductivity acidic ph and remarkably high phenolics typical of olive mill wastewater reported elsewhere 1 3 after the treatment the ph of the treated oomw was slightly above neutral and contained remarkably less content of toxic organic compounds making it usable for irrigation considering the wastewater quality guidelines for agricultural use normal ph range for irrigation water is 6 5 8 4 bod 50 mg l 1 cod 100 mg l 1 and ec 700 μs cm 1 34 35 3 1 magnetic surface area and structural properties of as synthesized materials as depicted in fig 1 a and table 2 cucr2o4 exhibited the least saturation magnetization ms while the combination of cafe ldo and cucr2o4 produced hybrid photocatalyst with improved magnetic properties ms 54 7 emu g 1 remanence mr 88 5 emu g 1 and coercivity hc of 49 5 oe which can be separated from the bulk solution after use by an external magnet in less than 10 s as shown in fig 1b cafe ldo exhibits a type iv adsorption desorption isotherms and h4 hysteresis loop with a large n2 uptake in the relative pressure greater than 0 72 indicating the presence of slit shaped mesopores 2 50 nm typical of ldh based materials 27 28 33 in addition to the hysteresis loop type iv isotherm at higher relative pressure in cucr2o4 cafe ldo the steep uptakes at very low p p0 0 15 are associated with rapid gas fillings within the narrow micropores which is typical of type i 36 note that the average pore size and pore surface area of cucr2o4 were larger than that of cafe ldh upon integration of both pristine materials and calcination the cucr2o4 cafe ldo possesses a wide range of pores with an average size and pore surface area of 12 51 nm and 8 25 m2 g 1 respectively the average particle size of cucr2o4 cafe ldo obtained from the bet and dls camsizer are 0 41 μm and 0 76 μm respectively the xrd patterns are shown in fig 1c cafe ldh exhibits characteristic i e weaker less symmetric lines at high 2θ values and sharp strong lines at low 2θ values diffractions of hydrocalumite like structure with typical planes of 0 0 3 0 0 6 and 1 1 0 which is consistent with the jcpds 43 0480 and jcpds 44 0445 32 37 39 24 the interlamellar distance d003 is 7 71 å which consistent with the value of chlorine intercalated cafe ldh material 40 39 the xrd pattern of the cucr2o4 shows characteristics reflections indexed to crystal planes of the spinel structure phase jcpds 85 2313 and jcpds 88 0110 considering the diffraction peaks at 35 23 and 61 58 the lattice parameters a 6 041 and c 7 782 å were obtained corresponding to 211 and 400 planes 23 respectively for the cucr2o4 cafe ldo the characteristic diffractive peaks of both the cucr2o4 and cafe ldh appeared however some of the peaks of ldh remained weak or disappeared indicating that the layered hydrocalumite structure collapsed with phase transformation to mixed metal oxides after calcination fig 1d shows the ftir spectra of cafe ldh and cucr2o4 cafe ldo for the ldh spectrum the broad peak at 3320 3000 cm 1 and the weak peak at 1625 1400 cm 1 are assigned to the network of stretching vibration of caoh groups in the hydroxide layers and bending vibrations of the interlayered adsorbed water 27 33 28 respectively the distortion of cl in the interlayer of ca fe cl is reflected around 1194 1032 cm 1 the peaks at 800 550 cm 1 are associated with the stretching vibration of ca fe o 33 for the cucr2o4 cafe ldo the peaks in the ldh at 3320 3000 cm 1 disappeared and those at 1625 1400 cm 1 were weakened intense broader bands appeared around 650 530 cm 1 which are assigned to the mixed metal oxide which originated from cucr2o4 ca o and fe o after calcination this observation is in agreement with the xps data 3 2 optical thermal stability and morphological characters of as synthesized materials the light response profiles of the samples during several on off light irradiations are shown in fig 2 a when the irradiation light was turned on for both samples the photocurrent density increased rapidly then decreased to a stable value when the light was turned off the cucr2o4 cafe ldo exhibited a photocurrent response of 4 48 μa cm 2 which is higher than that of cafe ldh 2 74 μa cm 2 the uv vis drs fig 2b shows that the samples can absorb both uv and visible light considering the broad absorption in the range of 200 800 nm 33 the cucr2o4 cafe ldo and cafe ldh had an absorption edge at approximately 500 nm and 415 nm due to the bandgap energy of 2 48 ev and 2 99 ev respectively the tauc plots constructed fig 2b inset assumed direct transitions n 1 in the eq 1 for both samples considering eg 1240 λ the specific absorption band energy eg was estimated at 484 nm and 409 nm for cucr2o4 cafe ldo and cafe ldh with corresponding eg of 2 56 ev and 3 03 ev respectively this confirmed that cucr2o4 cafe ldo can be deployed for both uv and visible light degradation applications the thermograms tg dta are presented in fig 2c cafe ldh exhibited three distinct mass losses at 90 150 c 256 c and 420 c which is consistent with the thermal decomposition of ldh materials 39 24 the first weight loss 8 5 is attributed to the physically adsorbed water 33 the second weight loss 18 7 is due to the evaporation of the interlamellar water and the last weight loss 15 4 is likely due to the elimination of the intercalated chloride ion and formation of metal oxides compared to the cafe ldh cucr2o4 cafe ldo retained 62 8 of the initial mass with two distinct weight losses at 150 c 7 3 and 320 c 29 9 the endothermic peaks of the heat flow dta curves are parallel with the mentioned weight loss sequences which correspond to the removal of interlayer water the collapse of the brucite like layer and formation of mixed metal oxides the cucr2o4 cafe ldo exhibited a plate like morphology with sharp edges which is consistent with other reports 24 37 38 the morphology of the cucr2o4 fig 2d inset shows agglomerated grain like particles common with spinel structured materials 41 the edx elemental mappings revealed that ca fe cu cr cl and o elements are distributed in the cucr2o4 cafe ldo with a weight percentage of 24 7 12 4 8 04 16 33 4 89 and 33 64 respectively the compositions and the element s oxidation state of the samples were examined with xps fig 3 from the full spectra scan survey in fig 3a the cu 2p3 2 1 2 peaks are observed at 936 3 and 955 8 ev which are linked with cu2 species in the tetrahedral state the cr3 oxidation state is reflected with the characteristic splitting of the cr 2p cr 2p3 2 1 2 with 8 8 ev spin orbit separation at 577 4 and 586 2 ev 23 the o 1s peak appeared at 532 3 ev which revealed the existence of o2 species 42 the ca 2p3 2 1 2 peaks are located at 347 6 ev and 351 3 ev in cafe ldh which reflects ca2 oxidation state while the fe 2p3 2 1 2 peaks are located at 711 9 ev and 722 8 ev which indicates fe3 oxidation state a slight negative shift in the binding energies of ca 2p3 2 1 2 and fe 2p3 2 1 2 are noted after coupling cucr2o4 and cafe ldh to produce the hybrid catalyst notably the quantitative xps measurements revealed that the atomic molar ratio of cu cr o is 1 02 2 04 4 11 which is close to 1 2 4 and ca fe 2 02 1 09 which is 2 1 these results are consistent with the edx and confirm that the cucr2o4 cafe ldo was synthesized successfully the high resolution spectra for cu 2p o 1s cr 2p fe 2p and ca 2p are displayed in fig 3b and the satellite peaks are observed between the 2p3 2 and 2p1 2 energy levels for copper and calcium ions 22 23 42 the concentration of constituent elements leached from 2 g cucr2o4 cafe ldo soaked in 1 l acidified water for 7 days was 0 28 mg l 1 and it remained stable afterwards 3 3 preliminary comparison of omw treatment via various photocatalytic processes initially tests were carried out with cucr2o4 and cafe ldh individually but the average performance was 3 5 times lower than that of cucr2o4 cafe ldo therefore subsequent studies were carried out under various scenarios using cucr2o4 cafe ldo here 0 5 g cucr2o4 cafe ldo and 0 025 m oxidants h2o2 and k2s2o8 were used at inherent ph value 4 3 of the filtered olive mill wastewater in fig 4 a remarkably low degradation of the phenolics were recorded in the presence of sunlight 4 and uv light 13 alone without catalyst after 300 min of irradiation in the presence of 0 025 m h2o2 and 0 025 m k2s2o8 without catalyst 25 and 36 degradation efficiencies were recorded after 120 min of uv irradiation and reached 29 and 46 respectively after 300 min reaction the uv light activated the persulfate or the hydrogen peroxide which then generated sulfate so4 so4 2 e 2 5 3 1 ev or oh radicals it is worthy to mention that the so4 radicals are present in higher density and demonstrated greater redox potential than the oh radicals at acidic ph 43 this explains the higher degradation rate of the oomw in uv k2s2o8 system compared to uv h2o2 when cucr2o4 cafe ldo was introduced into the system the degradation rate of the phenolics was 30 in the dark in the first 30 min and increased remarkably to 70 after 30 min uv irradiation then progressed slowly to 74 after 300 min the degradation efficiency of cucr2o4 cafe ldo uv h2o2 and cucr2o4 cafe ldo uv k2s2o8 after 300 min were 1 24 and 1 34 times higher than that of catalyst uv without oxidants respectively note that the cucr2o4 cafe ldo sunlight k2s2o8 reached 98 after 120 min which is 1 14 times faster than in the presence of uv the corresponding degradation rates are represented in fig 4b and c in fig 4b the r2 values ranged from 0 8937 to 0 9453 notably the linearity of the first order reaction for cucr2o4 cafe ldo uv k2s2o8 r2 0 8937 deteriorated across the measured points when compared to the other systems 3 4 performance of cucr2o4 cafe ldo photocatalyst under varying conditions as shown in fig 5 a the degradation efficiency increased from 15 to 50 when the cucr2o4 cafe ldo dosage was increased from 0 25 g to 1 g in the first 30 min in the dark without oxidants upon exposure to uv light the degradation efficiency increased to 60 in the presence of 0 25 g catalyst after 120 min and remained unchanged after 300 min at 120 min the degradation efficiencies were 70 and 75 with 0 5 and 1 g catalyst respectively at 180 min the degradation increased slightly to 72 in the presence of 0 5 g catalyst while it decreased to 72 from 75 in the presence of 1 g catalyst therefore 0 5 g was employed as the optimum dosage for subsequent studies the oomw ph was adjusted from 4 3 to 7 and 12 fig 5b shows the performance of the catalyst after 90 min uv irradiation the degradation efficiency of 0 5 g cucr2o4 cafe ldo decreased from 65 to 60 and 61 when the initial oomw ph was adjusted to 7 and 12 respectively a clear conclusion for the reduction in the degradation efficiency herein cannot be established since actual olive mill wastewater containing a variety of polyphenolic compounds with different pkas was used however as the solution ph increases the quantity of neutral phenol molecules decreases while phenolate anions c6h5o are the dominant species at pka 9 9 which may repulse the negatively charged surface of cucr2o4 cafe ldo in the presence of h2o2 the degradation efficiency of cucr2o4 cafe ldo uv increased from 73 to 88 5 and 93 when the ph was adjusted to 7 and 12 respectively while the final solution ph increased to 6 3 6 9 the increment in the degradation efficiency in the presence of h2o2 is due to increased concentration of hydroxyl radicals at high ph concentration of oh radicals are low at ph 5 moderate between ph 5 and 10 and highly effective at ph 10 43 in the presence of cucr2o4 cafe ldo uv k2s2o8 the degradation of phenolics slightly increased from 89 9 to 92 when the ph was adjusted to 7 then decreased to 80 upon further adjustment of the ph to 12 note that after treatment with cucr2o4 cafe ldo uv k2s2o8 the final solution ph increased to 6 8 8 the so4 radical is efficient at a broad ph predominant at ph 4 moderate at ph 10 unlike the oh radicals which are ph restricted 43 fig 5c shows the performance of the catalyst when the k2s2o8 concentration was varied initially 70 80 and 30 degradation of phenolics were recorded after the first 30 min in the dark when the k2s2o8 concentration was 0 025 0 05 and 0 075 m respectively under uv assisted system the degradation increased to 99 after 90 min when the k2s2o8 concentration was increased from 0 025 to 0 05 m however when the concentration was increased to 0 075 m the degradation efficiency reduced to 90 this is maybe due to so4 quenching eqs 5 and 6 or reaction of excess k2s2o8 with the radical to produce relatively weaker oxidant so5 1 1 ev resulting in a decrease in degradation efficiency 37 38 hence 0 05 m was selected as the optimum k2s2o8 concentration 5 s 2 o 8 2 s o 4 s o 4 2 s 2 o 8 2 6 s o 4 s o 4 s 2 o 8 2 similarly 60 80 phenolics degradation was recorded in the dark mode when 0 025 0 075 m h2o2 was added to the system in the first 30 min after 120 min of uv irradiation 94 degradation was recorded with 0 025 m h2o2 while 98 6 was achieved with 0 05 m concentration note that the degradation rate increased rapidly with increases in h2o2 however beyond 0 05 m the rate decreased which is likely due to the scavenging of the generated oh by an excess amount of h2o2 or the production of relatively less reactive hydroperoxyl radical ooh excess h 2 o 2 h o o o h h 2 o 33 the performance of the cucr2o4 cafe ldo was examined under optimized conditions after considering the results of the preliminary tests 0 05 g catalyst was used in the presence of 0 05 m oxidant in the dark and under light assisted systems fig 6 a shows the results obtained under sunlight degradation efficiency increased from 7 20 and 30 in the first 40 min in dark mode to 75 92 and 98 after 90 min sunlight irradiation in the presence of catalyst alone with h2o2 and k2s2o8 respectively after 120 min sunlight irradiation nearly 100 degradation efficiency was recorded in the cucr2o4 cafe ldo oxidants system while cucr2o4 cafe ldo alone reached 95 degradation after 240 min fig 6a inset shows that the bod and cod removal increases with time and reached 96 and 85 bod and cod removal after 200 min fig 6b shows the pictorial illustration of the performance of the catalyst 95 6 and 79 8 discolouration efficiency was recorded under sunlight and uv induced systems after 90 min compared to the raw oomw 43 9 discolouration efficiency was achieved in the dark mode without oxidant 3 5 degradation kinetics and energy consumption the oomw degradation followed pseudo first order kinetics distinct degradation periods were identified and results summarized in table 3 the direct photolytic decomposition of oomw exhibited a faster degradation rate with kapp 0 00347 min 1 within 0 120 min followed by a slower degradation within 180 300 min considering the uv the electrical energy e consumed after 300 min of the photolytic degradation process was 40 17 kw h m 3 and equivalent to 2 treatment cost per m3 of oomw august 2020 turkish republic of northern cyprus energy cost 0 05 per kwh under optimized conditions cucr2o4 cafe ldo uv k2s2o8 consumed 19 22 kw h m 3 0 96 electrical energy with an apparent rate constant kapp 0 00598 min 1 within 0 120 min which resulted to 99 degradation of the phenolics 95 1 cod removal and 84 6 bod removal efficiency note that the apparent rate constant achieved within 0 40 min under cucr2o4 cafe ldo sunlight k2s2o8 is 1 4 faster than under the uv light 3 6 identification of active radicals and degradation mechanism to confirm the contribution of each radical during the degradation process fig 7 a shows the results of radical trapping tests after 120 min of sunlight irradiation the cucr2o4 cafe ldo degradation efficiency was remarkably hindered by t buoh and meoh resulting in 59 and 40 of phenolics decomposition in the presence of h2o2 and k2s2o8 respectively this confirms that oh and so4 contributed majorly during the photocatalytic reactions relative to the system without the scavenger degradation efficiency decreased by 38 in the presence of naio3 and 18 in the presence of bq revealing that photoinduced holes h and superoxide radicals also contributed during the photocatalytic decomposition processes accordingly the contribution of the radicals and photogenerated carriers follow this order so4 oh h o2 by considering the uv vis drs and radical scavenging results the

were adsorbed onto the cucr2o4 cafe ldo surface via the suitable pore 12 51 nm and sufficient specific surface area 153 5 m2 g 1 of the catalyst after light irradiation the photons of sufficient wavelength excited electrons e from the vb of the catalyst to its cb which resulted in the formation of h in the vb eq 9 due to differences in the potentials of the cb some of the excited electrons are transferred from the cb of cafe ldo to that of cucr2o4 consequently the photogenerated e h pairs are effectively separated the cucr2o4 cafe ldo oxidized water molecules to oh radicals oh h2o 2 10

active species o2 h so4 and oh induced the photooxidation of phenolics in the oomw eq 16 which is consistent with previous reports 1 18 17 9 c u c r 2 o 4 c a f e l d o e g 2 56 e v h v e c b h v b 10

consecutive reuse cycles the catalyst maintained 99 photocatalytic activity after 3 reuse cycles fig 7c in the fourth cycle it exhibited a slight loss in performance and retained 93 degradation efficiency afterwards although the reason for the reduction in the degradation efficiency is not fully known it may be due to the re arrangement of the dispersed metals in the cafe ldo after successive applications considering the excellent photocatalytic efficiency under uv and sunlight assisted systems and satisfactory reusability cucr2o4 cafe ldo could serve as a prominent and cost competitive material for small scale treatment of olive mill wastewater the cucr2o4 cafe ldo outperformed tio2 supported systems reported by uĝurlu and karaoĝlu 17 and silva et al 18 for treatment of olive mill wastewater 4 conclusion hybrid recyclable cucr2o4 cafe ldo catalyst prepared via a simple yet efficient protocol was characterized by various optical and spectroscopic techniques results herein revealed that cucr2o4 cafe ldo possesses sufficient surface area wide pores and stable photoresponse activity the synergistic collaboration between the p type cucr2o4 with a narrow bandgap and the cafe ldo with massive active sites and well dispersed metals provides the hybrid catalyst with the outstanding adsorption and photocatalytic ability for treatment of olive mill wastewater oomw

13625,an efficient and cost competitive hybrid cucr2o4 cafe ldo catalyst was successfully synthesized for the decontamination of olive mill wastewater cucr2o4 cafe ldo has a bandgap of 2 56 ev exhibited stable photocurrent response of 4 48 μa cm 2 possesses a wide range of pores with an average size and pore surface area of 12 51 nm and 8 25 m2 g 1 respectively the constituent elements and optical activity of the cucr2o4 cafe ldo were established by an x ray photoelectron spectroscopy and diffuse reflectance uv vis spectroscopy respectively under optimized conditions 50 mg cucr2o4 cafe ldo achieved 54 8 degradation of phenolics after 4 h without an oxidant in the dark while 90 degradation was attained within 40 min with sunlight assisted irradiation in the presence of 0 05 m k2s2o8 under uv assisted system cucr2o4 cafe ldo k2s2o8 consumed 19 22 kw h m 3 0 96 electrical energy with an apparent rate constant kapp 0 00598 min 1 within 120 min which resulted to 99 degradation of the

phenolics mineralization narrow bandgap solar photocatalysis spinel oxide hydrocalumite 1 introduction olive trees plantation and olive oil production are important agro economic activities for several countries based on the recent report by the international olive council ioc 2019 the total global production of olive oil was estimated to reach 3 67 106 tons for the 2019 2020 harvest season which is 17 2 increases compared to previous harvest season the olive oil is predominantly produced in the mediterranean regions greece turkey tunisia spain morocco cyprus italy portugal and among others covering nearly 79 of the world s olive oil production 1 4 the olive oil is largely consumed due to its many health and nutritional benefits however its production generates excessive quantities of wastes 30 solid leftover i e olive pomace or solid olive cakes and olive oil mill wastewater oomw which constitutes 50 of the wastes 1 5 6 the olive oil producing countries face serious environmental issues in managing the wastes generated notably the oomw presents a strong unpleasant odour due to its heavily loaded phytotoxic organic contents generally has a low ph high chemical oxygen demand 3500 85 000 mg l 1 and high biochemical oxygen demand 2000 35 000 mg l 1 depending on the production processes traditional 2 phase or 3 phase decanter oomw is difficult to treat resistant to biodegradation and unusable for irrigation 7 11 the phenolics contained in the oomw can change soil quality and cause serious toxicity to aquatic organisms over long term exposure 12 13 in cyprus the majority of olive mills are small scale factories that generally stored the olive mill wastewater in evaporation ponds lagooning or littered around isolated farmsteads 1 12 although the use of evaporation ponds is an economic management practice of decreasing the oomw however this process contributes to the scarcity of the much needed water in cyprus does not reduce the oomw toxicity nor its unpleasant smell around where the ponds are located littering the oomw on agricultural soils is detrimental to seed germination and growth since the oomw contains several monomeric phenolic compounds long and short chain fatty acids with considerable phytotoxic effects 14 16 therefore there is an urgent need for cost competitive management approach suitable for small scale olive mill operators to decontaminate and reduce the threatening environmental impact of olive mill wastewater research efforts have been intensified towards the development and application of biological membrane separation physical and or chemical treatment technologies as well as various combinations to treat oomw 1 15 17 19 a varying degree of success has been recorded meanwhile low toxicity reduction membrane fouling high capital cost and generation of secondary pollution are some of the drawbacks of these technologies 20 21 among these techniques the photocatalytic process is a highly promising cost competitive technology for the degradation of organic pollutants under suitable light illumination the photocatalyst generates electron e hole h pairs which react with adsorbed species to produce highly oxidizing radicals that can oxidize and mineralized organic pollutants for instance uĝurlu and karaoĝlu 17 applied tio2 supported sepiolite photocatalyst for the degradation of olive mill wastewater in the presence of uv light and oxidant the authors observed that the phenolics were completely removed at high ph 11 00 after 24 h in the presence of 30 mol l 1 h2o2 similarly silva et al 18 studied the photocatalytic degradation of simulated and actual olive mill wastewaters using h2o2 assisted tio2 system they reported that 0 118 mol l 1 h2o2 0 75 g l 1 photocatalyst and 400 w uv irradiation power led to 80 mineralization of the phenolics after 60 min of reaction although tio2 is a remarkable photocatalyst its efficiency is restricted because of its weak visible light absorption ascribed to the wide optical bandgap of 3 ev and sometimes fast recombination rate of photogenerated e h pairs recently researchers have directed their attentions towards the application of a narrow bandgap 1 2 1 5 ev copper chromite cucr2o4 a p type semiconductor which can be activated by uv and solar radiation for the degradation of wide pollutants 22 23 the association of cucr2o4 with multifunctional calcium based layered double hydroxide ldh materials can result in a robust composite with increased photodegradation activity reduced recombination e h larger surface area to trap pollutants and favourable ion exchange ability the cafe ldh used in this study belongs to the hydrocalumite subgroup of the hydrotalcite mineral materials 24 the ca2 is heptacoordinated with fe3 ion thus giving the ca based ldhs higher ion exchange capabilities than other octacoordinated ldhs 25 calcination of ldhs results in ldos layered double oxides which possess more dispersed metals massive active sites and unique memory effect 25 28 thus cucr2o4 cafe ldo photocatalyst was synthesized successfully and characterized via various spectroscopic tools in this work the hybrid catalyst possesses sufficient bandgap that allowed it to be used under uv and sunlight irradiation for the photocatalytic treatment of high strength olive mill wastewater the probable photocatalytic mechanisms were established based on the results of radicals trapping and uv vis absorption spectra this research highlights the powerful synergistic combination of layered double oxide and chromium based spinel oxide for mineralization of toxic phenolics notably the economic performance of the cucr2o4 cafe ldo was further established through the electrical energy consumption analysis regeneration of spent catalyst and recyclability studies 2 experimental 2 1 materials analytical grade of the metallic salts was used to prepare the photocatalysts cu no3 2 6h2o 98 cr no3 3 9h2o 99 citric acid 99 cacl2

merck kgaa darmstadt germany all reagents were used as received without purification 2 2 raw olive mill wastewater sample freshly processed raw olive mill wastewater sample was collected from a three phase olive mill located in the karpaz district of turkish republic of northern cyprus and diluted with distilled water by a ratio of 1 2 the diluted raw sample was filtered by 50 micron stainless wire mesh to remove larger solids and centrifuged then stored at 5 c in a refrigerator for later use the physicochemical properties of the oomw were determined following the procedures reported in the apha awwa wef handbook 2540d c 5220d 5530d 29 the bod and cod of the sample were determined as detailed elsewhere 30 31 and results obtained are presented in table 1 the filtered sample was subjected to photocatalytic treatment as detailed in section 2 5 2 3 synthesis process firstly the synthesis of the cafe ldh was optimized based on recent reports 24 32 typically 44 8 mmol of cacl2 2h2o was mixed with 22 4 mmol of fecl3 6h2o in the presence of 50 ml citric acid 0 05 mm the mixture was added dropwise into 100 ml aqueous solution of 134 4 mmol naoh oh ca2 fe3 2 and stirred at room temperature under n2 atmosphere for 5 h obtained ldh particles were washed with distilled water and ethanol filtered through a buchner funnel dried at 65 c and ground in a laboratory mortar into fine cafe ldh powders secondly cucr2o4 powder was prepared via a sol gel technique 0 3 mol of cu no3 2 6h2o and 0 6 mol cr no3 2 9h2o were mixed in 50 ml of ethanol then 8 5 ml of propylene oxide was slowly added with constant stirring at 60 c a deep green gel formed after 30 min was dried for 24 h at 80 c to produce the hybrid photocatalyst powdered cafe ldh and dried xerogel like cucr2o4 were 1 1 ratio evenly ground in a mortar for 10 min and 5 ml citric acid 0 1 m was added to the composite as a complex and stabilizing agent then mechanically stirred for 60 min the resultant composite was dried at 100 c in a hot air oven for 60 min then calcined at 900 c for 3 h 10 c min 1 to obtain black coloured cucr2o4 cafe ldo powder after cooling the final product was washed with water ethanol mixture severally via filtration method then dried at 80 c overnight and sieved to a uniform size 2 4 characterization methods the magnetic properties of the samples were determined at an applied

according to eq 1 where eg is the bandgap hν is the absorption energy α represents the absorption coefficient and y is a parameter associated with the conduction and valence band 1 α h v 1 2 y h v e g 2 5 sunlight and uv assisted photocatalytic studies the photocatalytic experiments were performed in a batch type laboratory scale reactor equipped with a rotating disc fig s1 in the presence of an adjustable uv light irradiations peak power 9 30 w light intensity 200 w m 2 t8 philips and under direct sunlight between 12 pm and 3 pm the sunlight flux density 245 15 w m 2 was measured using apogee pyranometers mp 100 usa 0 25 1 0 g of the catalyst was added to 100 ml of filtered oomw solution without adjusting its initial ph and stirred in a dark place for 30 min to attain the adsorption desorption equilibrium state then the suspension was irradiated under a uv or direct sunlight for 300 min in the presence and absence of 0 025 0 075 m of oxidants h2o2 or k2s2o8 the reaction mixture was continuously homogenized by mechanical agitation and maintained under constant air inlet periodically the catalyst was separated from the reactor by an external magnet and 2 ml samples were withdrawn then the absorbance of residual phenol was measured at λmax 255 nm by a uv vis spectrophotometer perkinelmer usa with a 1 cm path length quartz cell the efficiency of the catalyst was investigated when the oomw ph was adjusted using 0 5 m citric acid and 0 5 m naoh control experiments with light alone or cucr2o4 cafe ldo only were run for comparison the stability of cucr2o4 cafe ldo was checked by determining the leached metal ion concentrations using atomic absorption spectroscopy novaa 400 germany the spent cucr2o4 cafe ldo was separated from the solution by an external magnet then soaked in 0 01 m naoh for 30 min afterwards the reconditioned cucr2o4 cafe ldo was dried at 80 c for 60 min and reused repeatedly radical trapping experiments were performed by adding 3 mm radical scavengers separately into the test solutions as previously described in our recent reports 27 33 ros reactive oxygen species such as superoxide radicals o2 hydroxyl radicals oh sulfate radicals so4 and holes h were captured by 1 4 benzoquinone bq tert butyl alcohol t buoh methanol meoh and sodium iodate naio3 respectively 2 6 data analysis each experiment was performed three times and the average result is reported within experiment errors of 2 the photocatalytic degradation efficiency η of cucr2o4 cafe ldo was calculated by the eq 2 and the reaction kinetics by eq 3 2 η 1 c t

constant v is the volume of oomw l p is the electrical power consumed during the treatment kw and t is reaction time min graphpad prism ver 7 usa was employed for data visualization 3 results and discussion the major characteristics of the raw filtered and treated oomw samples are shown in table 1 olive mill wastewater maintains variable characteristics which are attributed to the extraction process olive seed variety weather conditions and ripeness of the fruits among many other factors as expected the concentration of total solids in the untreated oomw was high 9170 10725 mg l 1 and the oomw has high conductivity acidic ph and remarkably high phenolics typical of olive mill wastewater reported elsewhere 1 3 after the treatment the ph of the treated oomw was slightly above neutral and contained remarkably less content of toxic organic compounds making it usable for irrigation considering the wastewater quality guidelines for agricultural use normal ph range for irrigation water is 6 5 8 4 bod 50 mg l 1 cod 100 mg l 1 and ec 700 μs cm 1 34 35 3 1 magnetic surface area and structural properties of as synthesized materials as depicted in fig 1 a and table 2 cucr2o4 exhibited the least saturation magnetization ms while the combination of cafe ldo and cucr2o4 produced hybrid photocatalyst with improved magnetic properties ms 54 7 emu g 1 remanence mr 88 5 emu g 1 and coercivity hc of 49 5 oe which can be separated from the bulk solution after use by an external magnet in less than 10 s as shown in fig 1b cafe ldo exhibits a type iv adsorption desorption isotherms and h4 hysteresis loop with a large n2 uptake in the relative pressure greater than 0 72 indicating the presence of slit shaped mesopores 2 50 nm typical of ldh based materials 27 28 33 in addition to the hysteresis loop type iv isotherm at higher relative pressure in cucr2o4 cafe ldo the steep uptakes at very low p p0 0 15 are associated with rapid gas fillings within the narrow micropores which is typical of type i 36 note that the average pore size and pore surface area of cucr2o4 were larger than that of cafe ldh upon integration of both pristine materials and calcination the cucr2o4 cafe ldo possesses a wide range of pores with an average size and pore surface area of 12 51 nm and 8 25 m2 g 1 respectively the average particle size of cucr2o4 cafe ldo obtained from the bet and dls camsizer are 0 41 μm and 0 76 μm respectively the xrd patterns are shown in fig 1c cafe ldh exhibits characteristic i e weaker less symmetric lines at high 2θ values and sharp strong lines at low 2θ values diffractions of hydrocalumite like structure with typical planes of 0 0 3 0 0 6 and 1 1 0 which is consistent with the jcpds 43 0480 and jcpds 44 0445 32 37 39 24 the interlamellar distance d003 is 7 71 å which consistent with the value of chlorine intercalated cafe ldh material 40 39 the xrd pattern of the cucr2o4 shows characteristics reflections indexed to crystal planes of the spinel structure phase jcpds 85 2313 and jcpds 88 0110 considering the diffraction peaks at 35 23 and 61 58 the lattice parameters a 6 041 and c 7 782 å were obtained corresponding to 211 and 400 planes 23 respectively for the cucr2o4 cafe ldo the characteristic diffractive peaks of both the cucr2o4 and cafe ldh appeared however some of the peaks of ldh remained weak or disappeared indicating that the layered hydrocalumite structure collapsed with phase transformation to mixed metal oxides after calcination fig 1d shows the ftir spectra of cafe ldh and cucr2o4 cafe ldo for the ldh spectrum the broad peak at 3320 3000 cm 1 and the weak peak at 1625 1400 cm 1 are assigned to the network of stretching vibration of caoh groups in the hydroxide layers and bending vibrations of the interlayered adsorbed water 27 33 28 respectively the distortion of cl in the interlayer of ca fe cl is reflected around 1194 1032 cm 1 the peaks at 800 550 cm 1 are associated with the stretching vibration of ca fe o 33 for the cucr2o4 cafe ldo the peaks in the ldh at 3320 3000 cm 1 disappeared and those at 1625 1400 cm 1 were weakened intense broader bands appeared around 650 530 cm 1 which are assigned to the mixed metal oxide which originated from cucr2o4 ca o and fe o after calcination this observation is in agreement with the xps data 3 2 optical thermal stability and morphological characters of as synthesized materials the light response profiles of the samples during several on off light irradiations are shown in fig 2 a when the irradiation light was turned on for both samples the photocurrent density increased rapidly then decreased to a stable value when the light was turned off the cucr2o4 cafe ldo exhibited a photocurrent response of 4 48 μa cm 2 which is higher than that of cafe ldh 2 74 μa cm 2 the uv vis drs fig 2b shows that the samples can absorb both uv and visible light considering the broad absorption in the range of 200 800 nm 33 the cucr2o4 cafe ldo and cafe ldh had an absorption edge at approximately 500 nm and 415 nm due to the bandgap energy of 2 48 ev and 2 99 ev respectively the tauc plots constructed fig 2b inset assumed direct transitions n 1 in the eq 1 for both samples considering eg 1240 λ the specific absorption band energy eg was estimated at 484 nm and 409 nm for cucr2o4 cafe ldo and cafe ldh with corresponding eg of 2 56 ev and 3 03 ev respectively this confirmed that cucr2o4 cafe ldo can be deployed for both uv and visible light degradation applications the thermograms tg dta are presented in fig 2c cafe ldh exhibited three distinct mass losses at 90 150 c 256 c and 420 c which is consistent with the thermal decomposition of ldh materials 39 24 the first weight loss 8 5 is attributed to the physically adsorbed water 33 the second weight loss 18 7 is due to the evaporation of the interlamellar water and the last weight loss 15 4 is likely due to the elimination of the intercalated chloride ion and formation of metal oxides compared to the cafe ldh cucr2o4 cafe ldo retained 62 8 of the initial mass with two distinct weight losses at 150 c 7 3 and 320 c 29 9 the endothermic peaks of the heat flow dta curves are parallel with the mentioned weight loss sequences which correspond to the removal of interlayer water the collapse of the brucite like layer and formation of mixed metal oxides the cucr2o4 cafe ldo exhibited a plate like morphology with sharp edges which is consistent with other reports 24 37 38 the morphology of the cucr2o4 fig 2d inset shows agglomerated grain like particles common with spinel structured materials 41 the edx elemental mappings revealed that ca fe cu cr cl and o elements are distributed in the cucr2o4 cafe ldo with a weight percentage of 24 7 12 4 8 04 16 33 4 89 and 33 64 respectively the compositions and the element s oxidation state of the samples were examined with xps fig 3 from the full spectra scan survey in fig 3a the cu 2p3 2 1 2 peaks are observed at 936 3 and 955 8 ev which are linked with cu2 species in the tetrahedral state the cr3 oxidation state is reflected with the characteristic splitting of the cr 2p cr 2p3 2 1 2 with 8 8 ev spin orbit separation at 577 4 and 586 2 ev 23 the o 1s peak appeared at 532 3 ev which revealed the existence of o2 species 42 the ca 2p3 2 1 2 peaks are located at 347 6 ev and 351 3 ev in cafe ldh which reflects ca2 oxidation state while the fe 2p3 2 1 2 peaks are located at 711 9 ev and 722 8 ev which indicates fe3 oxidation state a slight negative shift in the binding energies of ca 2p3 2 1 2 and fe 2p3 2 1 2 are noted after coupling cucr2o4 and cafe ldh to produce the hybrid catalyst notably the quantitative xps measurements revealed that the atomic molar ratio of cu cr o is 1 02 2 04 4 11 which is close to 1 2 4 and ca fe 2 02 1 09 which is 2 1 these results are consistent with the edx and confirm that the cucr2o4 cafe ldo was synthesized successfully the high resolution spectra for cu 2p o 1s cr 2p fe 2p and ca 2p are displayed in fig 3b and the satellite peaks are observed between the 2p3 2 and 2p1 2 energy levels for copper and calcium ions 22 23 42 the concentration of constituent elements leached from 2 g cucr2o4 cafe ldo soaked in 1 l acidified water for 7 days was 0 28 mg l 1 and it remained stable afterwards 3 3 preliminary comparison of omw treatment via various photocatalytic processes initially tests were carried out with cucr2o4 and cafe ldh individually but the average performance was 3 5 times lower than that of cucr2o4 cafe ldo therefore subsequent studies were carried out under various scenarios using cucr2o4 cafe ldo here 0 5 g cucr2o4 cafe ldo and 0 025 m oxidants h2o2 and k2s2o8 were used at inherent ph value 4 3 of the filtered olive mill wastewater in fig 4 a remarkably low degradation of the phenolics were recorded in the presence of sunlight 4 and uv light 13 alone without catalyst after 300 min of irradiation in the presence of 0 025 m h2o2 and 0 025 m k2s2o8 without catalyst 25 and 36 degradation efficiencies were recorded after 120 min of uv irradiation and reached 29 and 46 respectively after 300 min reaction the uv light activated the persulfate or the hydrogen peroxide which then generated sulfate so4 so4 2 e 2 5 3 1 ev or oh radicals it is worthy to mention that the so4 radicals are present in higher density and demonstrated greater redox potential than the oh radicals at acidic ph 43 this explains the higher degradation rate of the oomw in uv k2s2o8 system compared to uv h2o2 when cucr2o4 cafe ldo was introduced into the system the degradation rate of the phenolics was 30 in the dark in the first 30 min and increased remarkably to 70 after 30 min uv irradiation then progressed slowly to 74 after 300 min the degradation efficiency of cucr2o4 cafe ldo uv h2o2 and cucr2o4 cafe ldo uv k2s2o8 after 300 min were 1 24 and 1 34 times higher than that of catalyst uv without oxidants respectively note that the cucr2o4 cafe ldo sunlight k2s2o8 reached 98 after 120 min which is 1 14 times faster than in the presence of uv the corresponding degradation rates are represented in fig 4b and c in fig 4b the r2 values ranged from 0 8937 to 0 9453 notably the linearity of the first order reaction for cucr2o4 cafe ldo uv k2s2o8 r2 0 8937 deteriorated across the measured points when compared to the other systems 3 4 performance of cucr2o4 cafe ldo photocatalyst under varying conditions as shown in fig 5 a the degradation efficiency increased from 15 to 50 when the cucr2o4 cafe ldo dosage was increased from 0 25 g to 1 g in the first 30 min in the dark without oxidants upon exposure to uv light the degradation efficiency increased to 60 in the presence of 0 25 g catalyst after 120 min and remained unchanged after 300 min at 120 min the degradation efficiencies were 70 and 75 with 0 5 and 1 g catalyst respectively at 180 min the degradation increased slightly to 72 in the presence of 0 5 g catalyst while it decreased to 72 from 75 in the presence of 1 g catalyst therefore 0 5 g was employed as the optimum dosage for subsequent studies the oomw ph was adjusted from 4 3 to 7 and 12 fig 5b shows the performance of the catalyst after 90 min uv irradiation the degradation efficiency of 0 5 g cucr2o4 cafe ldo decreased from 65 to 60 and 61 when the initial oomw ph was adjusted to 7 and 12 respectively a clear conclusion for the reduction in the degradation efficiency herein cannot be established since actual olive mill wastewater containing a variety of polyphenolic compounds with different pkas was used however as the solution ph increases the quantity of neutral phenol molecules decreases while phenolate anions c6h5o are the dominant species at pka 9 9 which may repulse the negatively charged surface of cucr2o4 cafe ldo in the presence of h2o2 the degradation efficiency of cucr2o4 cafe ldo uv increased from 73 to 88 5 and 93 when the ph was adjusted to 7 and 12 respectively while the final solution ph increased to 6 3 6 9 the increment in the degradation efficiency in the presence of h2o2 is due to increased concentration of hydroxyl radicals at high ph concentration of oh radicals are low at ph 5 moderate between ph 5 and 10 and highly effective at ph 10 43 in the presence of cucr2o4 cafe ldo uv k2s2o8 the degradation of phenolics slightly increased from 89 9 to 92 when the ph was adjusted to 7 then decreased to 80 upon further adjustment of the ph to 12 note that after treatment with cucr2o4 cafe ldo uv k2s2o8 the final solution ph increased to 6 8 8 the so4 radical is efficient at a broad ph predominant at ph 4 moderate at ph 10 unlike the oh radicals which are ph restricted 43 fig 5c shows the performance of the catalyst when the k2s2o8 concentration was varied initially 70 80 and 30 degradation of phenolics were recorded after the first 30 min in the dark when the k2s2o8 concentration was 0 025 0 05 and 0 075 m respectively under uv assisted system the degradation increased to 99 after 90 min when the k2s2o8 concentration was increased from 0 025 to 0 05 m however when the concentration was increased to 0 075 m the degradation efficiency reduced to 90 this is maybe due to so4 quenching eqs 5 and 6 or reaction of excess k2s2o8 with the radical to produce relatively weaker oxidant so5 1 1 ev resulting in a decrease in degradation efficiency 37 38 hence 0 05 m was selected as the optimum k2s2o8 concentration 5 s 2 o 8 2 s o 4 s o 4 2 s 2 o 8 2 6 s o 4 s o 4 s 2 o 8 2 similarly 60 80 phenolics degradation was recorded in the dark mode when 0 025 0 075 m h2o2 was added to the system in the first 30 min after 120 min of uv irradiation 94 degradation was recorded with 0 025 m h2o2 while 98 6 was achieved with 0 05 m concentration note that the degradation rate increased rapidly with increases in h2o2 however beyond 0 05 m the rate decreased which is likely due to the scavenging of the generated oh by an excess amount of h2o2 or the production of relatively less reactive hydroperoxyl radical ooh excess h 2 o 2 h o o o h h 2 o 33 the performance of the cucr2o4 cafe ldo was examined under optimized conditions after considering the results of the preliminary tests 0 05 g catalyst was used in the presence of 0 05 m oxidant in the dark and under light assisted systems fig 6 a shows the results obtained under sunlight degradation efficiency increased from 7 20 and 30 in the first 40 min in dark mode to 75 92 and 98 after 90 min sunlight irradiation in the presence of catalyst alone with h2o2 and k2s2o8 respectively after 120 min sunlight irradiation nearly 100 degradation efficiency was recorded in the cucr2o4 cafe ldo oxidants system while cucr2o4 cafe ldo alone reached 95 degradation after 240 min fig 6a inset shows that the bod and cod removal increases with time and reached 96 and 85 bod and cod removal after 200 min fig 6b shows the pictorial illustration of the performance of the catalyst 95 6 and 79 8 discolouration efficiency was recorded under sunlight and uv induced systems after 90 min compared to the raw oomw 43 9 discolouration efficiency was achieved in the dark

which resulted to 99 degradation of the phenolics 95 1 cod removal and 84 6 bod removal efficiency note that the apparent rate constant achieved within 0 40 min under cucr2o4 cafe ldo sunlight k2s2o8 is 1 4 faster than under the uv light 3 6 identification of active radicals and degradation mechanism to confirm the contribution of each radical during the degradation process fig 7 a shows the results of radical trapping tests after 120 min of sunlight irradiation the cucr2o4 cafe ldo degradation efficiency was remarkably hindered by t buoh and meoh resulting in 59 and 40 of phenolics decomposition in the presence of h2o2 and k2s2o8 respectively this confirms that oh and so4 contributed majorly during the photocatalytic reactions relative to the system without the scavenger degradation efficiency decreased by 38 in the presence of naio3 and 18 in the presence of bq revealing that photoinduced holes h and superoxide radicals also contributed during the photocatalytic decomposition processes accordingly the contribution of the radicals and photogenerated carriers follow this order so4 oh h o2 by considering the uv vis drs and radical scavenging results the

consecutive reuse cycles the catalyst maintained 99 photocatalytic activity after 3 reuse cycles fig 7c in the fourth cycle it exhibited a slight loss in performance and retained 93 degradation efficiency afterwards although the reason for the reduction in the degradation efficiency is not fully known it may be due to the re arrangement of the dispersed metals in the cafe ldo after successive applications considering the excellent photocatalytic efficiency under uv and sunlight assisted systems and satisfactory reusability cucr2o4 cafe ldo could serve as a prominent and cost competitive material for small scale treatment of olive mill wastewater the cucr2o4 cafe ldo outperformed tio2 supported systems reported by uĝurlu and karaoĝlu 17 and silva et al 18 for treatment of olive mill wastewater 4 conclusion hybrid recyclable cucr2o4 cafe ldo catalyst prepared via a simple yet efficient protocol was characterized by various optical and spectroscopic techniques results herein revealed that cucr2o4 cafe ldo possesses sufficient surface area wide pores and stable photoresponse activity the synergistic collaboration between the p type cucr2o4 with a narrow bandgap and

13626,chemical cleaning with anionic cationic and non ionic surfactants was studied for polyvinylidene pvdf hollow fiber ultrafiltration uf membranes irreversibly fouled by cutting fluid with anionic emulsifiers the membrane cleaning efficiency of the surfactants was determined by pure water permeability and the results are in agreement with morphological observations of the membrane surfaces and molecular vibrational analyses the anionic surfactants sodium dodecyl sulfate sds and sodium dodecylbenzene sulphonate sdbs showed better cleaning through the combined effect of electrostatic repulsion with emulsified oil particles and re emulsification of the oil layer inclusion of the phenyl group in the dodecyl sulfate anion had a significant role in cleaning molecular vibrational analyses indicated a higher presence of residual surfactant on the membranes after cleaning with cationic cetyltrimethylammonium bromide ctab and non ionic tween 85 t 85 surfactants which also resulted in higher apparent hydrophilicity of the membrane surface alkalizing the anionic surfactant solution improved cleaning efficiency but had no significant effect for cationic and non ionic surfactants the effect of surfactant concentration and ionic strength on cleaning efficacy was analyzed for sdbs as mass transport increased higher cleaning efficacy was observed at higher sdbs concentration the cleaning efficacy of sdbs was also influenced to varying degrees by solution ph and ionic strength keywords chemical cleaning surfactant cutting fluid ultrafiltration fouling 1 introduction oil in water o w emulsions stabilized with surfactants are applied as cutting fluids coolants and lubricants in many industrial processes these emulsions are generally used in the diluted form at concentrations of 3 10 wt in water cutting fluids degrade over time due to exposure to high temperature and variation in pressure requiring spent fluids to be disposed of safely the effectiveness of conventional treatment methods such as coagulation flocculation flotation and sedimentation is limited for oily wastewaters containing stable o w emulsions formed by small oil droplets 1 2 consequently the development of advanced cost effective and environmentally friendly treatment methods for oily wastewaters is required to meet increasingly stringent environmental regulations 1 4 low pressure membrane filtration techniques such as micro and ultra filtration mf uf have recently gained attention in oil water emulsion separation due to their relatively low energy consumption high removal efficiency and environment friendliness compared to conventional techniques 5 in practical applications both ceramic and polymeric membranes are applied for the treatment of oily water although polymeric membranes have been associated with high fouling rates and reduced membrane lifetime 6 nonetheless polymeric membranes can offer a considerable advantage in terms of total operating cost as compared to ceramic membranes 4 polymeric membranes have been widely studied for the removal of organic compounds in oily wastewater treatment 7 8 dairy 9 10 food and beverage 11 12 and pharmaceutical industries 13 14 membrane filtration using mf uf membranes is a size exclusion process wherein particulate colloidal components in the feedwater are separated at the membrane surface fouling due to pore blockage and or cake gel layer formation can result in a loss of membrane hydraulic performance fouling components that are not readily removed by hydraulic backwashing require the use of chemicals to restore membrane performance 7 the chemical agents used for cleaning must be compatible with the membrane material particularly in the case of polymeric membranes as frequent cleaning cycles i e long term exposure to oxidants and high ph can adversely affect membrane integrity thus reducing membrane lifetime 15 membrane cleaning agents are commonly grouped into seven categories acids caustics oxidants enzymatic components surfactants complexing agents and formulated detergents 16 17 caustic agents are effective for removing organic foulants from membranes due to their effectiveness in increasing the negative charge and solubility of organic compounds through hydrolysis and solubilization at higher ph values 18 in oily wastewater treatment caustic agents have been shown to outperform acidic agents for cleaning of polysulphone uf membranes 7 however caustic cleaning may affect the pore size and pore structure of polymeric membranes resulting in increased fouling rates lower permeate quality and reduced mechanical resistance of the membranes 19 20 on the other hand oxidants such as sodium hypochlorite are toxic bio incompatible and corrosive surfactants are organic macromolecules that are commonly used as cleaning agents in both ceramic and polymeric membrane systems 10 21 22 surfactant cleaning takes effect due to electrostatic repulsion or lipophilic hydrophilic interactions 10 thus surfactant cleaning may have less impact on membrane integrity compared to classic acidic or caustic agents moreover the biodegradability of some surfactants is advantageous from an environmental perspective salahi et al 2010 studied the chemical cleaning efficiency of an anionic surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate sds with polyacrylonitrile pan uf membranes used for the treatment of api effluent from a refinery where solution ph cleaning time and temperature were optimized for better removal efficiency 23 investigation of the cleaning potential of sds for organically fouled polyamide nanofiltration nf membranes revealed that surfactant concentration and solution ph were critical factors in overall cleaning efficiency 24 a series of cationic surfactants with different molecular structures have been tested for chemical cleaning of polyethersulphone pes uf membranes fouled by whey where the interaction between the cleaning agents and whey protein changed with the surfactant molecular structure 10 naim et al 2012 studied the cleaning efficiency of a non ionic surfactant for pes and polyvinylidene difluoride pvdf membranes fouled by proteins the results indicated that cleaning was regulated by micelle transport to and partial disassembly at the membrane surface 21 formulated composites of surfactants with caustics and disinfectants are also used for enhanced chemical cleaning of organic foulants 25 the choice of surfactant is affected by membrane characteristics i e surface charge hydrophobicity and roughness specific foulant characteristics and the physical chemical interaction between foulants and membranes 26 as oil is commonly separated at the membrane surface the surfactant has to have the potential to diffuse into the fouling layer and detach the oil from the membrane surface 21 besides cleaning time surfactant concentration temperature and ph of the solution are critical parameters for cleaning efficiency evaluation in this study we tested anionic cationic and non ionic surfactants as cleaning agents for pvdf hollow fiber uf membranes fouled by cutting fluid the effect of alkalization on cleaning efficacy the influence of surfactant concentration ph and ionic strength of the cleaning solution were evaluated to the best of our knowledge this is the first comparative study on anionic cationic and non ionic surfactant cleaning of pvdf uf membranes for the treatment of emulsified cutting oils 2 experimental 2 1 materials commercially available pvdf hollow fiber uf membranes with molecular weight cut off mwco of 150 kda were used in this study a commercial cutting fluid ultracut evo 260 rocol uk comprising concentrated oil emulsions was used as the target contaminant sodium hydroxide 1 m stock solution sodium dodecyl sulfate sds sodium dodecylbenzene sulphonate sdbs cetyltrimethylammonium bromide ctab and tween 85 t 85 were purchased from sigma aldrich and used without further purification among the non ionic surfactants t 85 was chosen because of its hydrophilic lipophilic balance hlb value of 11 which is well suited for oil foulant removal from membranes without de emulsification 2 2 feedwater and chemical cleaning solution preparation feedwater was prepared by adding 5 ml of cutting fluid to 1000 ml of deionized di water and mixing thoroughly using a homogenizer spindles 4 x 1 5 cm at 700 rpm for 2 h the obtained milky dispersion was diluted to a final volume of 50 l targeting a final oil concentration of 100 mg l a typical concentration of machining industry effluent and mixed at 500 rpm using a 40 mm teflon coated magnetic bar feedwater solutions were continuously stirred at 500 rpm throughout filtration experiments cleaning solutions were prepared by adding the required amount of surfactant to deionized water and adjusting the ph to 7 using 1 mm phosphate buffer saline alkalized cleaning solutions were prepared by increasing the ph of the surfactant solution to 12 using 1 m naoh 2 3 instrumentation ultrafiltration experiments were conducted at room temperature 23 2 c using a fully automated bench scale filtration system osmo inspector convergence the netherlands commercial polymeric membrane cutting fluid surfactants and chemicals were used for fouling and cleaning studies membrane modules were fabricated using pvdf hollow fibers of 27 cm length with inner and outer diameters of 0 75 mm and 1 3 mm respectively active surface area of membrane module 7 7 10 3 m2 the modules were operated in outside in filtration mode at maximum transmembrane pressure tmp of 2 1 bar a new module i e virgin hollow fibers was used for each experiment a typical module was fabricated with a unique end to end alignment to avoid clogging of the fiber bundle during filtration and backwashing esi s1 before each experiment membranes were conditioned by filtering deionized water for 5 h until a constant initial permeability of 254 4 l m2h bar was reached 2 4 membrane fouling and cleaning the membranes were fouled by repeated cycles of filtration in dead end mode using feedwater analogous at constant permeate flux of 40 l m2h for 30 min followed by hydraulic backwashing with deionized water at 140 l m2h for 4 min these conditions resulted in a gradual fouling build up throughout the filtration the trigger point for chemical cleaning was set to occur when membrane permeability after hydraulic backwashing reached a value of 50 l m2h bar in a typical cleaning experiment the fouled membranes were first hydraulically backwashed with deionized water at 140 l m2h for 4 min to dislodge all loosely attached particles thereafter chemical cleaning was carried out in a three step process i backwashing at 140 l m2h for 4 min with a chemical solution to bring the cleaning agent to the foulant layer ii soaking for 10 min for the chemicals to react with the foulant layer iii rinsing of the reaction products by backwashing with deionized water at 140 l m2h for 4 min finally all the channels were flushed with deionized water and permeability was measured membrane modules were stored in 1 wt sodium bisulfite solution at 4 c before analyses two structurally similar but chemically different anionic surfactants sds and sdbs were compared with a cationic ctab and a non ionic t 85 surfactant cleaning solutions were prepared at a surfactant concentration of 1 wt with a resulting molar concentration of 34 7 mm 28 7 mm 27 4 mm and 23 4 mm for sds sdbs ctab and t 85 respectively this was to ensure concentrations higher than the critical micelle concentration cmc sds 8 0 mm sdbs 1 25 mm ctab 0 98 mm and t 85 0 01 mm 27 for all surfactant solutions naoh concentration of 0 5 wt was used to alkalize the surfactant solutions blank solutions of 0 5 wt naoh were also tested for reference 3 results and discussion 3 1 feedwater quality the composition of feedwater samples was analyzed esi s2 and the mean values of 5 batches are reported the measured total oil and grease tog concentration was 104 4 6 4 mg l which deviated slightly from the targeted concentration of 100 mg l mainly due to errors in sample preparation and measurement feedwater ph and turbidity values were 7 0 0 05 and 59 4 1 5 ntu respectively particle size analysis showed a narrow distribution of submicron emulsified oil particles in the feed with two distinguishable distributions centered at 62 and 215 nm fig 1 we are aware that the solution may have micron sized particles which may not be measured due to the upper size limit of the instrument app 5 μm to evaluate emulsion stability the zeta potential of the oil particles solution ph 6 9 was measured in triplicate and a representative measurement is given in the inset of fig 1 the gaussian fitting gave a zeta potential of 42 9 0 3 mv indicating that the emulsion is highly stabilized using anionic surfactants 3 2 membrane cleaning efficiency of anionic cationic and non ionic surfactants filtration of cutting fluid through 150 kda pvdf uf membranes resulted in a steady increase in both hydraulically reversible and irreversible resistance development fig 2 resistance development during filtration was linear for the first 7 cycles approx 6 h of operation indicating that cake gel layer filtration was initially dominant further filtration resulted in cake gel filtration with compression as indicated by the substantial deviation of the filtration curves from linear irreversible fouling resistance increased steadily through successive cycles as hydraulic backwashing was progressively less effective in recovering permeability irreversible fouling build up by emulsified cutting oil droplets resulted in permeability loss of approximately 80 after 20 consecutive cycles of filtration and hydraulic backwash the irreversibly fouled membranes were chemically cleaned following the procedure described in section 2 using anionic cationic and non ionic surfactants and cleaning efficiencies were compared fig 3 here the chemical cleaning efficacy is quantified by the percentage of irreversible resistance removal irr and permeability recovery pr calculated using equations 1 and 2 in esi s3 cleaning with 1 wt sdbs removed 99 7 of resistance due to irreversible fouling irr and recovered 98 4 of membrane permeability pr as illustrated in fig 4 the electrostatic interaction between the anionic surfactant and emulsified oil droplets may play a role in the removal of oil droplets from the foulant layer the surfactant molecules are transported to the membrane surface during chemical cleaning where electrostatic repulsion between anionic surfactant molecules and negatively charged emulsified oil droplets fig 4 a at the interface of the membrane and foulant layer could be the driving force of the cleaning action while the backwash flow facilitates foulant transport away from the membrane surface it is also possible that a fraction of the de emulsified oil layer is emulsified as schematically represented in fig 4 b thereby enhancing removal in contrast cleaning with cationic surfactant ctab reduced irr by 73 7 corresponding to a pr value of 35 7 the less effective cleaning can be directly related to the electrostatic attraction between surfactant molecules and emulsified oil droplets fig 4 a hence the obtained cleaning efficacy could be a combined effect of two possible mechanisms first the cationic surfactant may electrostatically deposit on the negatively charged oil particles and make them neutral or weakly positive which could be removed by hydraulic forces and electrostatic repulsion fig 4 c 28 second the surfactant may re emulsify a part of the de emulsified foulant layer and electrostatically remove it as a positively charged particle fig 4 b 23 chemical cleaning with t 85 resulted in irr and pr values of 78 2 and 34 9 respectively although non ionic surfactants attain a surface charge at elevated ph around 5 mv at neutral ph it is relatively weak compared to the zeta potential of sds and sdbs 40 to 60 mv and ctab 30 mv 29 31 therefore an electrostatic effect cannot be predominant the obtained cleaning effect is mainly due to re emulsification of the oily fouling layer formed this observation can also indicate that the main cleaning mechanism of ctab is the re emulsification of the foulant layer the enhanced cleaning efficacy observed with sdbs anionic can therefore be attributed to a combined effect of re emulsification of the oil layer and electrostatic repulsion of emulsified oil particles 3 2 1 effect of surfactant structure the effect of the molecular structure of anionic surfactants was investigated fig 4 both anionic surfactants sdbs and sds are amphiphilic with the same cation however the characteristics of sdbs differ from sds due to the phenyl group between the lipophilic tail and hydrophilic head of the anion 32 the irr and pr of the 1 wt sds solution were 84 6 and 58 5 respectively which are significantly lower than those obtained with sdbs solution 99 7 and 98 4 both sds and sdbs form micelles in water with hydrophobic cores even at very low concentrations the critical behavior of the micelle determines its cleaning efficacy palazzesi et al 2011 investigated the structure and dynamics of sds and sdbs micelles using molecular dynamics 32 sdbs has a higher solvent accessible surface area with more contribution from the hydrophilic anionic head compared to sds although their mean micellar radius is similar the sdbs micelles are more spherical and tightly packed due to the π stacking between the aromatic rings of the anion making the surface of the micelle more hydrophilic moreover phenyl groups in the sdbs anion form h π interactions with h2o and increase penetration of water through the micelle which is important when the surfactants function as micro reactors 32 the tightly packed sulfonic acid group results in high charge density on the surface which can effectively repel the negatively charged emulsified foulants 33 in general there is a good probability for the lipophilic tails of the surfactants to interact strongly with the hydrophobic micro domains of the membranes and leave a significant amount of surfactant residues even after rinsing with water however the unique tightly packed spherical structure of sdbs micelles with negatively charged hydrophilic surface screens the lipophilic tails and hinders their interaction with the membrane surface thereby reducing surfactant residues 3 2 2 effect of alkalization alkaline cleaning agents saponify oils into water soluble soaps and release them into the cleaning solution hence alkalization of surfactant solutions was expected to influence the cleaning efficacy 9 surfactants were dissolved in 0 5 wt 125 mm naoh solution resulting in a solution ph of 12 a blank solution of 0 5 wt naoh ph 12 was also tested for comparison with resulting irr and pr values of 92 8 and 81 0 respectively the cleaning effect observed at elevated ph is assumed to be due to saponification it must be noted that pvdf may be susceptible to degradation in alkaline conditions whereby mechanical strength and membrane integrity can be adversely affected at high ph due to dehydrofluorination 15 as the sdbs solution readily removed 99 7 of the hydraulically irreversible fouling alkalization did not show a significant improvement fig 5 the positive effect of alkalization may be more pronounced at low sdbs concentrations alkalization of sds was observed to have a significant positive effect on cleaning efficiency increasing irr from 84 6 to 99 6 and pr from 58 5 to 97 8 respectively the increased cleaning efficiency can be attributed to the contribution of caustic cleaning through saponification 18 alkalization was found to have a very low effect with the cationic ctab surfactant increasing irr and pr values by 4 5 and 3 4 respectively a similar trend has been reported with polyamide nf membranes where the alkalized anionic surfactant resulted in higher permeability than that of alkalized cationic surfactant 34 it is also important to note that the irr and pr values were much less than those of the blank naoh solution according to simon et al 2013 the functional groups in the membrane materials can further deprotonate and make the surface more negatively charged when exposed to a strong alkaline solution 34 electrostatic interaction between the membrane surface and the cationic surfactant makes a stable layer of surfactant on the surface caustic exposure increases the amount of residual ctab and suppresses cleaning efficacy alkalization was observed to have no significant impact on irr and pr values with the t 85 surfactant the neat t 85 solution was slightly turbid at ph 7 but became clear after alkalization it is well known that polysorbates undergo auto oxidation through cleavage at ethylene oxide sub units and hydrolysis of the fatty acid ester bond particularly in more alkaline or acidic environments further auto oxidation of the byproducts can produce a mixture of higher and lower order hydrocarbons 35 although it is difficult to predict their interaction with deprotonated pvdf surfaces the complex interaction between the auto oxidized polysorbate byproducts and the deprotonated pvdf surface may be the reason for the lower cleaning efficacy 3 3 effect of surfactant cleaning on membrane characteristics this section discusses the morphology molecular vibration spectra and contact angle of the virgin fouled and cleaned membranes to complement the hydraulic performance data presented thus far by the procedure described in esi s4 a visible color change esi s5 was observed when cleaning the membrane with blank 0 5 naoh solution in agreement with the literature 15 3 3 1 surface morphology scanning electron micrographs of the surface and cross sectional morphology of the pvdf hollow fibers used in this study are given in fig 5a b the surface was observed to be highly porous with surface pore size in the range of approximately 30 nm nominal mwco 150 kda the cross sectional view shows that the membrane has a single block of foam like polymer matrix with a gradual decrease in pore size towards the surface the surface active layer has tightly packed small pores to ensure foulant rejection and is supported by a woven layer with wide pores to minimize resistance to permeation the cross sectional electron micrographs of a virgin washed fouled and cleaned membranes are compared in esi s6 due to the deposition of the fouling cake gel layer on the membrane surface surface pores were not visible in sem micrographs of fouled membranes fig 5c chemical cleaning with different surfactant solutions resulted in the apparent removal of the fouling layer to varying degrees fig 5d l residual fouling observed in sem micrographs for all surfactants studied indicated that the fouling layer was not completely removed from the membrane surface even though pr values of close to 100 were observed for sds naoh sdbs and sdbs naoh solutions this observation suggests that complete removal of the fouling layer may not be necessary for high permeability recovery a higher number of surface pores were visible in sem images for cleaning with sdbs fig 5g which is in good agreement with irr and pr values obtained a uniform layer with low surface porosity was observed on membrane surfaces cleaned with cationic ctab and non ionic t 85 surfactants fig 5i k suggesting low removal efficiency a difference in morphology of the membranes cleaned with neat and alkalized surfactant solutions can also be seen in fig 5d l the membranes appeared visually smooth with relatively low surface porosity despite the high irr and pr values obtained for cleaning with alkalized sds and sdbs solutions upon cleaning with alkalized ctab solution a slightly higher surface porosity was observed fig 5j compared to neat ctab solution in line with the trend in irr and pr values following irr and pr values alkalization of t 85 resulted in poor oil removal efficacy the surface appeared fully covered with barely visible pores fig 5l 3 3 2 molecular vibrational spectra analysis ftir spectrum of the hollow fibers fig 6 indicates that the virgin membrane contains α β and γ phases of pvdf molecules 36 the symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations of ch were found at 2975 and 3020 cm 1 respectively whereas the signal at 880 cm 1 can be assigned to cf symmetric stretching vibrations the stretching mode of oh was found at 3430 cm 1 due to absorption of moisture on the membrane 37 ftir spectrum of the cutting fluid showed ch stretching vibrations at 2854 and 2924 cm 1 it is important to note that surfactant residues on the membrane surface also give c h stretching at around the same values as the cutting fluid therefore ch stretching assigned to the foulants obtained at 2854 and 2924 cm 1 may also partly reflect surfactant residues the fouled membranes showed a strong signal similar to the foulant that suppressed the signals corresponding to the membrane the peak values of asymmetric ch stretching modes of the membrane and foulant were considered for comparison after baseline correction in general relative intensity ir values esi s4 were significantly lower after chemical cleaning i e 0 72 0 66 0 79 and 0 98 for sds sdbs ctab and t 85 respectively sdbs had better oil removal efficiency compared to all other surfactants including anionic sds surfactant the ctab solution removed the comparable amount of foulant whereas the t 85 solution showed the lowest foulant removal efficacy this trend is in good agreement with that observed for irr and pr values the ir values of alkalized sds sdbs ctab t 85 and neat naoh solutions were 0 50 0 62 0 94 1 73 and 1 00 respectively alkalized sds gave a significant reduction in relative foulant intensity whereas a significant difference was not observed with alkalized sdbs solution alkalization harmed foulant removal efficacy of ctab and t 85 particularly foulant removal with alkalized t 85 was much lower than that with a neat t 85 solution 3 3 3 contact angle analysis the intercept t 0 and slope obtained from instantaneous measurement of the time dependent evolution of contact angles of water droplets dropped on the membrane are given in fig 7 an intercept value of 83 3 0 5 was obtained for the virgin membrane which is close to the contact angle of pvdf as reported in the literature 38 39 contact angle of the virgin membrane decreased at a rate of 7 4 0 2 s 1 due to dissipation into the porous volume after fouling the contact angle was higher at 95 7 0 7 and the dissipation rate was lower at 0 66 0 06 s 1 the higher contact angle may be attributed to the hydrophobic oil layer formed by coalesced oil particles during fouling which may hinder spontaneous water penetration and reduce water dissipation rate the contact angles measured after cleaning with sds sdbs ctab and t 85 were 87 9 3 4 84 4 1 7 79 9 0 3 and 69 6 4 3 respectively sds cleaning was not completely effective in removing the foulant layer and therefore a higher contact angle was observed chemical cleaning with sdbs restored the wettability of the membrane surface to a considerable extent surprisingly cleaning with ctab and t 85 resulted in a contact angle lower than that of the virgin pvdf surface in contrast with the lower oil removal efficacy observed the lower contact angle may be attributed to surface modification by residual surfactant molecules 21 the ctab micelles may remain on the membrane surface even after thorough rinsing due to the electrostatic attraction with the negatively charged emulsified oil particles kuni et al have reported that t 85 micelles partially disassemble near the membrane surface 40 this may lead to the adsorption of hydrophobic tails of t 85 to the membrane surface while the hydrophilic head groups are oriented towards the solution 41 as a result the hydrophilicity of the membrane is increased cleaning with alkalized ionic surfactant solutions generally resulted in higher contact angles the water dissipation rate through cleaned membranes was lower than that of virgin membranes for all surfactants except for t 85 due to the presence of oil residues water dissipation rate depends on the hydrophilicity and porosity of the membrane as a lower permeability recovery was observed for cleaning with t 85 the relatively higher water dissipation rate after cleaning can be attributed to the presence of residual surfactant on the membrane during cleaning hydrophilic micelles from the bulk are transported towards the membrane surface where they partially disassemble and the released surfactant monomers bind to the foulant layer the large size and low mobility of the surfactant molecules result in partial removal of the oil from the surface and binding of surfactant monomers to the cleaned membrane surface as a result the membrane becomes more hydrophilic and starts to adsorb micelles 21 in general the water dissipation rate was lower after cleaning with alkalized surfactant solutions which is in good agreement with contact angle and sem observations 3 4 effect of process conditions on sdbs cleaning efficacy detailed analysis showed better cleaning efficacy and permeability recovery for sdbs compared to the other surfactants investigated in this study moreover it appeared that sdbs had a less significant effect on membrane surface modification hence sdbs was further studied to determine the effect of surfactant concentration solution ph and ionic strength on cleaning efficacy solution ph can affect cleaning efficacy through modification of the oil surfactant interfacial tension 42 while ionic strength can affect cleaning efficacy by making the membrane surface more lipophobic as well as decreasing the cmc and increasing the aggregation number and micelle size of the anionic surfactant solution 43 44 the concentration of sdbs solution applied thus far was much higher than the cmc value surfactant concentration was expected to influence the cleaning efficiency hence fouled membranes were cleaned with sdbs solutions of various concentrations 0 05 1 wt the irr and pr values fig 8 a were calculated from the corresponding pure water permeability values the cleaning efficacy was higher at higher sdbs concentration with saturation appearing to have been obtained at 1 wt mass transport limitations are likely the main factor limiting the performance at lower concentrations a substantial drop in irr and pr values was observed for cleaning with 0 05 wt sdbs concentration according to cheng et al 1982 the micelle size increases at a lower concentration 10 mm due to mixed micellization or by the higher order alcohols 45 we believe that the cmc and micelle size of sdbs depends on the concentration of impurities as such micelle size could be larger than expected at 0 05 wt as sdbs might have contained impurities an increase in micelle size decreased mobility and limited mass transport thus limiting cleaning efficacy at low concentrations although the tested concentrations were far higher than the cmc the effect of ph on the cleaning efficacy of sdbs was tested for a ph range of 1 13 at a constant surfactant concentration of 0 25 wt the solution ph was adjusted using 1 m hcl and 1 m naoh stock solutions fig 8b shows that the cleaning efficiency increased with ph in the acidic region while no significant change was observed in the basic region this is in good agreement with the literature where the cleaning efficiency increases with decreasing hcl concentration 10 it is reported that the addition of hcl to sds inhibits the micelle formation by protonating a fraction of sds into dodecyl sulfonic acid dsa 46 47 a similar reaction could be expected with sdbs where the addition of hcl protonates sdbs into dodecylbenzene sulfonic acid dbsa and the micelle formation is reduced this directly influences the cleaning efficiency however such cation exchange reactions are not possible with the addition of naoh on the other side there is no increase in cleaning efficiency with an increase in naoh concentration as reported in the literature 10 the irr values already reached 92 at ph 7 with 0 25 wt sdbs concentration thus no improvement in cleaning efficiency was achieved for ph values higher than 7 the ionic strength of 0 25 wt sdbs solution was adjusted using sodium sulfate 1 100 mm and aged for 1 h for equilibration before applying to the fouled membranes the sdbs molecules started flocculating at a sodium sulfate concentration of around 200 mm and produced a turbid white solution therefore the tested range was limited to 100 mm at constant sdbs concentration cleaning efficiency was observed to depend on the ionic strength of the cleaning solution fig 8c the cleaning efficiency of the sdbs solution dropped with the addition of up to 10 mm sodium sulfate this may be due to either an increase in micelle size which reduces the mobility of the micelle blocks the membrane pores and thus limits mass transport or a reduction of repulsive forces at higher ion concentration between the negatively charged surfaces of surfactant micelles and emulsified oil particles 48 further increase in ionic strength was expected to decrease the cleaning efficiency however improved efficiencies were observed for the tested range up to 100 mm according to the literature this phenomenon could be interpreted by the following mechanisms i at ionic strengths beyond a certain threshold limit where inter micellar repulsion and micelle emulsion repulsion are minimum the micelle may behave as non ionic 49 for non ionic surfactants the cleaning efficiency increases with ionic strength 50 ii ionic strength beyond a certain threshold limit may change the shape of the micelle which could improve the cleaning efficiency 51 4 conclusions the chemical cleaning efficiency of surfactant based cleaning solutions has been determined with pvdf hollow fiber membranes fouled by highly stable cutting fluid emulsions with a negative charge anionic surfactants showed better cleaning efficiencies compared to cationic and non ionic surfactants at the same concentration due to the combined effect of electrostatic repulsion of emulsified oil particles and re emulsification of the oil particles in the fouling layer alkalization of the cleaning agent had a positive impact on the anionic surfactants whereas no significant impact was observed with cationic and non ionic surfactants the presence of the phenyl group in dodecyl sulfate anion has a significant role in cleaning as seen by the higher cleaning efficiency of sdbs as compared to sds the anionic surfactants show minimal impact on the surface characteristics of the membrane in terms of contact angle and water dissipation rate whereas a significant impact was observed with the non ionic surfactant the cleaning efficiency of sdbs decreased with concentration due to mass transport limitations while it increases with solution ph values at a constant sdbs concentration ionic strength had a strong impact on the cleaning efficiency with sdbs cleaning efficiency decreased with the addition of sodium sulfate up to 10 mm after which an improvement of the cleaning efficiency was observed declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

13626,chemical cleaning with anionic cationic and non ionic surfactants was studied for polyvinylidene pvdf hollow fiber ultrafiltration uf membranes irreversibly fouled by cutting fluid with anionic emulsifiers the membrane cleaning efficiency of the surfactants was determined by pure water permeability and the results are in agreement with morphological observations of the membrane surfaces and molecular vibrational analyses the anionic surfactants sodium dodecyl sulfate sds and sodium dodecylbenzene sulphonate sdbs showed better cleaning through the combined effect of electrostatic repulsion with emulsified oil particles and re emulsification of the oil layer inclusion of the phenyl group in the dodecyl sulfate anion had a significant role in cleaning molecular vibrational analyses indicated a higher presence of residual surfactant on the membranes after cleaning with cationic cetyltrimethylammonium bromide ctab and non ionic tween 85 t 85 surfactants which also resulted in higher apparent hydrophilicity of the membrane surface alkalizing the anionic surfactant solution improved cleaning efficiency but had no significant effect for cationic and non ionic surfactants the effect of surfactant concentration and ionic strength on cleaning efficacy was analyzed for sdbs as mass transport increased higher cleaning efficacy was observed at higher sdbs concentration the cleaning efficacy of sdbs was also influenced to varying degrees by solution ph and ionic strength keywords chemical cleaning surfactant cutting fluid ultrafiltration fouling 1 introduction oil in water o w emulsions stabilized with surfactants are applied as cutting fluids coolants and lubricants in many industrial processes these emulsions are generally used in the diluted form at concentrations of 3 10 wt in water cutting fluids degrade over time due to exposure to high temperature and variation in pressure requiring spent fluids to be disposed of safely the effectiveness of conventional treatment methods such as coagulation flocculation flotation and sedimentation is limited for oily wastewaters containing stable o w emulsions formed by small oil droplets 1 2 consequently the development of advanced cost effective and environmentally friendly treatment methods for oily wastewaters is required to meet increasingly stringent environmental regulations 1 4 low pressure membrane filtration techniques such as micro and ultra filtration mf uf have recently gained attention in oil water emulsion separation due to their relatively low energy consumption high removal efficiency and environment friendliness compared to conventional techniques 5 in practical applications both ceramic and polymeric membranes are applied for the treatment of oily water although polymeric membranes have been associated with high fouling rates and reduced membrane lifetime 6 nonetheless polymeric membranes can offer a considerable advantage in terms of total operating cost as compared to ceramic membranes 4 polymeric membranes have been widely studied for the removal of organic compounds in oily wastewater treatment 7 8 dairy 9 10 food and beverage 11 12 and pharmaceutical industries 13 14 membrane filtration using mf uf membranes is a size exclusion process wherein particulate colloidal components in the feedwater are separated at the membrane surface fouling due to pore blockage and or cake gel layer formation can result in a loss of membrane hydraulic performance fouling components that are not readily removed by hydraulic backwashing require the use of chemicals to restore membrane performance 7 the chemical agents used for cleaning must be compatible with the membrane material particularly in the case of polymeric membranes as frequent cleaning cycles i e long term exposure to oxidants and high ph can adversely affect membrane integrity thus reducing membrane lifetime 15 membrane cleaning agents are commonly grouped into seven categories acids caustics oxidants enzymatic components surfactants complexing agents and formulated detergents 16 17 caustic agents are effective for removing organic foulants from membranes due to their effectiveness in increasing the negative charge and solubility of organic compounds through hydrolysis and solubilization at higher ph values 18 in oily wastewater treatment caustic agents have been shown to outperform acidic agents for cleaning of polysulphone uf membranes 7 however caustic cleaning may affect the pore size and pore structure of polymeric membranes resulting in increased fouling rates lower permeate quality and reduced mechanical resistance of the membranes 19 20 on the other hand oxidants such as sodium hypochlorite are toxic bio incompatible and corrosive surfactants are organic macromolecules that are commonly used as cleaning agents in both ceramic and polymeric membrane systems 10 21 22 surfactant cleaning takes effect due to electrostatic repulsion or lipophilic hydrophilic interactions 10 thus surfactant cleaning may have less impact on membrane integrity compared to classic acidic or caustic agents moreover the biodegradability of some surfactants is advantageous from an environmental perspective salahi et al 2010 studied the chemical cleaning efficiency of an anionic surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate sds with polyacrylonitrile pan uf membranes used for the treatment of api effluent from a refinery where solution ph cleaning time and temperature were optimized for better removal efficiency 23 investigation of the cleaning potential of sds for organically fouled polyamide nanofiltration nf membranes revealed that surfactant concentration and solution ph were critical factors in overall cleaning efficiency 24 a series of cationic surfactants with different molecular structures have been tested for chemical cleaning of polyethersulphone pes uf membranes fouled by whey where the interaction between the cleaning agents and whey protein changed with the surfactant molecular structure 10 naim et al 2012 studied the cleaning efficiency of a non ionic surfactant for pes and polyvinylidene difluoride pvdf membranes fouled by proteins the results indicated that cleaning was regulated by micelle transport to and partial disassembly at the membrane surface 21 formulated composites of surfactants with caustics and disinfectants are also used for enhanced chemical cleaning of organic foulants 25 the choice of surfactant is affected by membrane characteristics i e surface charge hydrophobicity and roughness specific foulant characteristics and the physical chemical interaction between foulants and membranes 26 as oil is commonly separated at the membrane surface the surfactant has to have the potential to diffuse into the fouling layer and detach the oil from the membrane surface 21 besides cleaning time surfactant concentration temperature and ph of the solution are critical parameters for cleaning efficiency evaluation in this study we tested anionic cationic and non ionic surfactants as cleaning agents for pvdf hollow fiber uf membranes fouled by cutting fluid the effect of alkalization on cleaning efficacy the influence of surfactant concentration ph and ionic strength of the cleaning solution were evaluated to the best of our knowledge this is the first comparative study on anionic cationic and non ionic surfactant cleaning of pvdf uf membranes for the treatment of emulsified cutting oils 2 experimental 2 1 materials commercially available pvdf hollow fiber uf membranes with molecular weight cut off mwco of 150 kda were used in this study a commercial cutting fluid ultracut evo 260 rocol uk comprising concentrated oil emulsions was used as the target contaminant sodium hydroxide 1 m stock solution sodium dodecyl sulfate sds sodium dodecylbenzene sulphonate sdbs cetyltrimethylammonium bromide ctab and tween 85 t 85 were purchased from sigma aldrich and used without further purification among the non ionic surfactants t 85 was chosen because of its hydrophilic lipophilic balance hlb value of 11 which is well suited for oil foulant removal from membranes without de emulsification 2 2 feedwater and chemical cleaning solution preparation feedwater was prepared by adding 5 ml of cutting fluid to 1000 ml of deionized di water and mixing thoroughly using a homogenizer spindles 4 x 1 5 cm at 700 rpm for 2 h the obtained milky dispersion was diluted to a final volume of 50 l targeting a final oil concentration of 100 mg l a typical concentration of machining industry effluent and mixed at 500 rpm using a 40 mm teflon coated magnetic bar feedwater solutions were continuously stirred at 500 rpm throughout filtration experiments cleaning solutions were prepared by adding the required amount of surfactant to deionized water and adjusting the ph to 7 using 1 mm phosphate buffer saline alkalized cleaning solutions were prepared by increasing the ph of the surfactant solution to 12 using 1 m naoh 2 3 instrumentation ultrafiltration experiments were conducted at room temperature 23 2 c using a fully automated bench scale filtration system osmo inspector convergence the netherlands commercial polymeric membrane cutting fluid surfactants and chemicals were used for fouling and cleaning studies membrane modules were fabricated using pvdf hollow fibers of 27 cm length with inner and outer diameters of 0 75 mm and 1 3 mm respectively active surface area of membrane module 7 7 10 3 m2 the modules were operated in outside in filtration mode at maximum transmembrane pressure tmp of 2 1 bar a new module i e virgin hollow fibers was used for each experiment a typical module was fabricated with a unique end to end alignment to avoid clogging of the fiber bundle during filtration and backwashing esi s1 before each experiment membranes were conditioned by filtering deionized water for 5 h until a constant initial permeability of 254 4 l m2h bar was reached 2 4 membrane fouling and cleaning the membranes were fouled by repeated cycles of filtration in dead end mode using feedwater analogous at constant permeate flux of 40 l m2h for 30 min followed by hydraulic backwashing with deionized water at 140 l m2h for 4 min these conditions resulted in a gradual fouling build up throughout the filtration the trigger point for chemical cleaning was set to occur when membrane permeability after hydraulic backwashing reached a value of 50 l m2h bar in a typical cleaning experiment the fouled membranes were first hydraulically backwashed with deionized water at 140 l m2h for 4 min to dislodge all loosely attached particles thereafter chemical cleaning was carried out in a three step process i backwashing at 140 l m2h for 4 min with a chemical solution to bring the cleaning agent to the foulant layer ii soaking for 10 min for the chemicals to react with the foulant layer iii rinsing of the reaction products by backwashing with deionized water at 140 l m2h for 4 min finally all the channels were flushed with deionized water and permeability was measured membrane modules were stored in 1 wt sodium bisulfite solution at 4 c before analyses two structurally similar but chemically different anionic surfactants sds and sdbs were compared with a cationic ctab and a non ionic t 85 surfactant cleaning solutions were prepared at a surfactant concentration of 1 wt with a resulting molar concentration of 34 7 mm 28 7 mm 27 4 mm and 23 4 mm for sds sdbs ctab and t 85 respectively this was to ensure concentrations higher than the critical micelle concentration cmc sds 8 0 mm sdbs 1 25 mm ctab 0 98 mm and t 85 0 01 mm 27 for all surfactant solutions naoh concentration of 0 5 wt was used to alkalize the surfactant solutions blank solutions of 0 5 wt naoh were also tested for reference 3 results and discussion 3 1 feedwater quality the composition of feedwater samples was analyzed esi s2 and the mean values of 5 batches are reported the measured total oil and grease tog concentration was 104 4 6 4 mg l which deviated slightly from the targeted concentration of 100 mg l mainly due to errors in sample preparation and measurement feedwater ph and turbidity values were 7 0 0 05 and 59 4 1 5 ntu respectively particle size analysis showed a narrow distribution of submicron emulsified oil particles in the feed with two distinguishable distributions centered at 62 and 215 nm fig 1 we are aware that the solution may have micron sized particles which may not be measured due to the upper size limit of the instrument app 5 μm to evaluate emulsion stability the zeta potential of the oil particles solution ph 6 9 was measured in triplicate and a representative measurement is given in the inset of fig 1 the gaussian fitting gave a zeta potential of 42 9 0 3 mv indicating that the emulsion is highly stabilized using anionic surfactants 3 2 membrane cleaning efficiency of anionic cationic and non ionic surfactants filtration of cutting fluid through 150 kda pvdf uf membranes resulted in a steady increase in both hydraulically reversible and irreversible resistance development fig 2 resistance development during filtration was linear for the first 7 cycles approx 6 h of operation indicating that cake gel layer filtration was initially dominant further filtration resulted in cake gel filtration with compression as indicated by the substantial deviation of the filtration curves from linear irreversible fouling resistance increased steadily through successive cycles as hydraulic backwashing was progressively less effective in recovering permeability irreversible fouling build up by emulsified cutting oil droplets resulted in permeability loss of approximately 80 after 20 consecutive cycles of filtration and hydraulic backwash the irreversibly fouled membranes were chemically cleaned following the procedure described in section 2 using anionic cationic and non ionic surfactants and cleaning efficiencies were compared fig 3 here the chemical cleaning efficacy is quantified by the percentage of irreversible resistance removal irr and permeability recovery pr calculated using equations 1 and 2 in esi s3 cleaning with 1 wt sdbs removed 99 7 of resistance due to irreversible fouling irr and recovered 98 4 of membrane permeability pr as illustrated in fig 4 the electrostatic interaction between the anionic surfactant and emulsified oil droplets may play a role in the removal of oil droplets from the foulant layer the surfactant molecules are transported to the membrane surface during chemical cleaning where electrostatic repulsion between anionic surfactant molecules and negatively charged emulsified oil droplets fig 4 a at the interface of the membrane and foulant layer could be the driving force of the cleaning action while the backwash flow facilitates foulant transport away from the membrane surface it is also possible that a fraction of the de emulsified oil layer is emulsified as schematically represented in fig 4 b thereby enhancing removal in contrast cleaning with cationic surfactant ctab reduced irr by 73 7 corresponding to a pr value of 35 7 the less effective cleaning can be directly related to the electrostatic attraction between surfactant molecules and emulsified oil droplets fig 4 a hence the obtained cleaning efficacy could be a combined effect of two possible mechanisms first the cationic surfactant may electrostatically deposit on the negatively charged oil particles and make them neutral or weakly positive which could be removed by hydraulic forces and electrostatic repulsion fig 4 c 28 second the surfactant may re emulsify a part of the de emulsified foulant layer and electrostatically remove it as a positively charged particle fig 4 b 23 chemical cleaning with t 85 resulted in irr and pr values of 78 2 and 34 9 respectively although non ionic surfactants attain a surface charge at elevated ph around 5 mv at neutral ph it is relatively weak compared to the zeta potential of sds and sdbs 40 to 60 mv and ctab 30 mv 29 31 therefore an electrostatic effect cannot be predominant the obtained cleaning effect is mainly due to re emulsification of the oily fouling layer formed this observation can also indicate that the main cleaning mechanism of ctab is the re emulsification of the foulant layer the enhanced cleaning efficacy observed with sdbs anionic can therefore be attributed to a combined effect of re emulsification of the oil layer and electrostatic repulsion of emulsified oil particles 3 2 1 effect of surfactant structure the effect of the molecular structure of anionic surfactants was investigated fig 4 both anionic surfactants sdbs and sds are amphiphilic with the same cation however the characteristics of sdbs differ from sds due to the phenyl group between the lipophilic tail and hydrophilic head of the anion 32 the irr and pr of the 1 wt sds solution were 84 6 and 58 5 respectively which are significantly lower than those obtained with sdbs solution 99 7 and 98 4 both sds and sdbs form micelles in water with hydrophobic cores even at very low concentrations the critical behavior of the micelle determines its cleaning efficacy palazzesi et al 2011 investigated the structure and dynamics of sds and sdbs micelles using molecular dynamics 32 sdbs has a higher solvent accessible surface area with more contribution from the hydrophilic anionic head compared to sds although their mean micellar radius is similar the sdbs micelles are more spherical and tightly packed due to the π stacking between the aromatic rings of the anion making the surface of the micelle more hydrophilic moreover phenyl groups in the sdbs anion form h π interactions with h2o and increase penetration of water through the micelle which is important when the surfactants function as micro reactors 32 the tightly packed sulfonic acid group results in high charge density on the surface which can effectively repel the negatively charged emulsified foulants 33 in general there is a good probability for the lipophilic tails of the surfactants to interact strongly with the hydrophobic micro domains of the membranes and leave a significant amount of surfactant residues even after rinsing with water however the unique tightly packed spherical structure of sdbs micelles with negatively charged hydrophilic surface screens the lipophilic tails and hinders their interaction with the membrane surface thereby reducing surfactant residues 3 2 2 effect of alkalization alkaline cleaning agents saponify oils into water soluble soaps and release them into the cleaning solution hence alkalization of surfactant solutions was expected to influence the cleaning efficacy 9 surfactants were dissolved in 0 5 wt 125 mm naoh solution resulting in a solution ph of 12 a blank solution of 0 5 wt naoh ph 12 was also tested for comparison with resulting irr and pr values of 92 8 and 81 0 respectively the cleaning effect observed at elevated ph is assumed to be due to saponification it must be noted that pvdf may be susceptible to degradation in alkaline conditions whereby mechanical strength and membrane integrity can be adversely affected at high ph due to dehydrofluorination 15 as the sdbs solution readily removed 99 7 of the hydraulically irreversible fouling alkalization did not show a significant improvement fig 5 the positive effect of alkalization may be more pronounced at low sdbs concentrations alkalization of sds was observed to have a significant positive effect on cleaning efficiency increasing irr from 84 6 to 99 6 and pr from 58 5 to 97 8 respectively the increased cleaning efficiency can be attributed to the contribution of caustic cleaning through saponification 18 alkalization was found to have a very low effect with the cationic ctab surfactant increasing irr and pr values by 4 5 and 3 4 respectively a similar trend has been reported with polyamide nf membranes where the alkalized anionic surfactant resulted in higher permeability than that of alkalized cationic surfactant 34 it is also important to note that the irr and pr values were much less than those of the blank naoh solution according to simon et al 2013 the functional groups in the membrane materials can further deprotonate and make the surface more negatively charged when exposed to a strong alkaline solution 34 electrostatic interaction between the membrane surface and the cationic surfactant makes a stable layer of surfactant on the surface caustic exposure increases the amount of residual ctab and suppresses cleaning efficacy alkalization was observed to have no significant impact on irr and pr values with the t 85 surfactant the neat t 85 solution was slightly turbid at ph 7 but became clear after alkalization it is well known that polysorbates undergo auto oxidation through cleavage at ethylene oxide sub units and hydrolysis of the fatty acid ester bond particularly in more alkaline or acidic environments further auto oxidation of the byproducts can produce a mixture of higher and lower order hydrocarbons 35 although it is difficult to predict their interaction with deprotonated pvdf surfaces the complex interaction between the auto oxidized polysorbate byproducts and the deprotonated pvdf surface may be the reason for the lower cleaning efficacy 3 3 effect of surfactant cleaning on membrane characteristics this section discusses the morphology molecular vibration spectra and contact angle of the virgin fouled and cleaned membranes to complement the hydraulic performance data presented thus far by the procedure described in esi s4 a visible color change esi s5 was observed when cleaning the membrane with blank 0 5 naoh solution in agreement with the literature 15 3 3 1 surface morphology scanning electron micrographs of the surface and cross sectional morphology of the pvdf hollow fibers used in this study are given in fig 5a b the surface was observed to be highly porous with surface pore size in the range of approximately 30 nm nominal mwco 150 kda the cross sectional view shows that the membrane has a single block of foam like polymer matrix with a gradual decrease in pore size towards the surface the surface active layer has tightly packed small pores to ensure foulant rejection and is supported by a woven layer with wide pores to minimize resistance to permeation the cross sectional electron micrographs of a virgin washed fouled and cleaned membranes are compared in esi s6 due to the deposition of the fouling cake gel layer on the membrane surface surface pores were not visible in sem micrographs of fouled membranes fig 5c chemical cleaning with different surfactant solutions resulted in the apparent removal of the fouling layer to varying degrees fig 5d l residual fouling observed in sem micrographs for all surfactants studied indicated that the fouling layer was not completely removed from the membrane surface even though pr values of close to 100 were observed for sds naoh sdbs and sdbs naoh solutions this observation suggests that complete removal of the fouling layer may not be necessary for high permeability recovery a higher number of surface pores were visible in sem images for cleaning with sdbs fig 5g which is in good agreement with irr and pr values obtained a uniform layer with low surface porosity was observed on membrane surfaces cleaned with cationic ctab and non ionic t 85 surfactants fig 5i k suggesting low removal efficiency a difference in morphology of the membranes cleaned with neat and alkalized surfactant solutions can also be seen in fig 5d l the membranes appeared visually smooth with relatively low surface porosity despite the high irr and pr values obtained for cleaning with alkalized sds and sdbs solutions upon cleaning with alkalized ctab solution a slightly higher surface porosity was observed fig 5j compared to neat ctab solution in line with the trend in irr and pr values following irr and pr values alkalization of t 85 resulted in poor oil removal efficacy the surface appeared fully covered with barely visible pores fig 5l 3 3 2 molecular vibrational spectra analysis ftir spectrum of the hollow fibers fig 6 indicates that the virgin membrane contains α β and γ phases of pvdf molecules 36 the symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations of ch were found at 2975 and 3020 cm 1 respectively whereas the signal at 880 cm 1 can be assigned to cf symmetric stretching vibrations the stretching mode of oh was found at 3430 cm 1 due to absorption of moisture on the membrane 37 ftir spectrum of the cutting fluid showed ch stretching vibrations at 2854 and 2924 cm 1 it is important to note that surfactant residues on the membrane surface also give c h stretching at around the same values as the cutting fluid therefore ch stretching assigned to the foulants obtained at 2854 and 2924 cm 1 may also partly reflect surfactant residues the fouled membranes showed a strong signal similar to the foulant that suppressed the signals corresponding to the membrane the peak values of asymmetric ch stretching modes of the membrane and foulant were considered for comparison after baseline correction in general relative intensity ir values esi s4 were significantly lower after chemical cleaning i e 0 72 0 66 0 79 and 0 98 for sds sdbs ctab and t 85 respectively sdbs had better oil removal efficiency compared to all other surfactants including anionic sds surfactant the ctab solution removed the comparable amount of foulant whereas the t 85 solution showed the lowest foulant removal efficacy this trend is in good agreement with that observed for irr and pr values the ir values of alkalized sds sdbs ctab t 85 and neat naoh solutions were 0 50 0 62 0 94 1 73 and 1 00 respectively alkalized sds gave a significant reduction in relative foulant intensity whereas a significant difference was not observed with alkalized sdbs solution alkalization harmed foulant removal efficacy of ctab and t 85 particularly foulant removal with alkalized t 85 was much lower than that with a neat t 85 solution 3 3 3 contact angle analysis the intercept t 0 and slope obtained from instantaneous measurement of the time dependent evolution of contact angles of water droplets dropped on the membrane are given in fig 7 an intercept value of 83 3 0 5 was obtained for the virgin membrane which is close to the contact angle of pvdf as reported in the literature 38 39 contact angle of the virgin membrane decreased at a rate of 7 4 0 2 s 1 due to dissipation into the porous volume after fouling the contact angle was higher at 95 7 0 7 and the dissipation rate was lower at 0 66 0 06 s 1 the higher contact angle may be attributed to the hydrophobic oil layer formed by coalesced oil particles during fouling which may hinder spontaneous water penetration and reduce water dissipation rate the contact angles measured after cleaning with sds sdbs ctab and t 85 were 87 9 3 4 84 4 1 7 79 9 0 3 and 69 6 4 3 respectively sds cleaning was not completely effective in removing the foulant layer and therefore a higher contact angle was observed chemical cleaning with sdbs restored the wettability of the membrane surface to a considerable extent surprisingly cleaning with ctab and t 85 resulted in a contact angle lower than that of the virgin pvdf surface in contrast with the lower oil removal efficacy observed the lower contact angle may be attributed to surface modification by residual surfactant molecules 21 the ctab micelles may remain on the membrane surface even after thorough rinsing due to the electrostatic attraction with the negatively charged emulsified oil particles kuni et al have reported that t 85 micelles partially disassemble near the membrane surface 40 this may lead to the adsorption of hydrophobic tails of t 85 to the membrane surface while the hydrophilic head groups are oriented towards the solution 41 as a result the hydrophilicity of the membrane is increased cleaning with alkalized ionic surfactant solutions generally resulted in higher contact angles the water dissipation rate through cleaned membranes was lower than that of virgin membranes for all surfactants except for t 85 due to the presence of oil residues water dissipation rate depends on the hydrophilicity and porosity of the membrane as a lower permeability recovery was observed for cleaning with t 85 the relatively higher water dissipation rate after cleaning can be attributed to the presence of residual surfactant on the membrane during cleaning hydrophilic micelles from the bulk are transported towards the membrane surface where they partially disassemble and the released surfactant monomers bind to the foulant layer the large size and low mobility of the surfactant molecules result in partial removal of the oil from the surface and binding of surfactant monomers to the cleaned membrane surface as a result the membrane becomes more hydrophilic and starts to adsorb micelles 21 in general the water dissipation rate was lower after cleaning with alkalized surfactant solutions which is in good agreement with contact angle and sem observations 3 4 effect of process conditions on sdbs cleaning efficacy detailed analysis showed better cleaning efficacy and permeability recovery for sdbs compared to the other surfactants investigated in this study moreover it appeared that sdbs had a less significant effect on membrane surface modification hence sdbs was further studied to determine the effect of surfactant concentration solution ph and ionic strength on cleaning efficacy solution ph can affect cleaning efficacy through modification of the oil surfactant interfacial tension 42 while ionic strength can affect cleaning efficacy by making the membrane surface more lipophobic as well as decreasing the cmc and increasing the aggregation number and micelle size of the anionic surfactant solution 43 44 the concentration of sdbs solution applied thus far was much higher than the cmc value surfactant concentration was expected to influence the cleaning efficiency hence fouled membranes were cleaned with sdbs solutions of various concentrations 0 05 1 wt the irr and pr values fig 8 a were calculated from the corresponding pure water permeability values the cleaning efficacy was higher at higher sdbs concentration with saturation appearing to have been obtained at 1 wt mass transport limitations are likely the main factor limiting the performance at lower concentrations a substantial drop in irr and pr values was observed for cleaning with 0 05 wt sdbs concentration according to cheng et al 1982 the micelle size increases at a lower concentration 10 mm due to mixed micellization or by the higher order alcohols 45 we believe that the cmc and micelle size of sdbs depends on the concentration of impurities as such micelle size could be larger than expected at 0 05 wt as sdbs might have contained impurities an increase in micelle size decreased mobility and limited mass transport thus limiting cleaning efficacy at low concentrations although the tested concentrations were far higher than the cmc the effect of ph on the cleaning efficacy of sdbs was tested for a ph range of 1 13 at a constant surfactant concentration of 0 25 wt the solution ph was adjusted using 1 m hcl and 1 m naoh stock solutions fig 8b shows that the cleaning efficiency increased with ph in the acidic region while no significant change was observed in the basic region this is in good agreement with the literature where the cleaning efficiency increases with decreasing hcl concentration 10 it is reported that the addition of hcl to sds inhibits the micelle formation by protonating a fraction of sds into dodecyl sulfonic acid dsa 46 47 a similar reaction could be expected with sdbs where the addition of hcl protonates sdbs into dodecylbenzene sulfonic acid dbsa and the micelle formation is reduced this directly influences the cleaning efficiency however such cation exchange reactions are not possible with the addition of naoh on the other side there is no increase in cleaning efficiency with an increase in naoh concentration as reported in the literature 10 the irr values already reached 92 at ph 7 with 0 25 wt sdbs concentration thus no improvement in cleaning efficiency was achieved for ph values higher than 7 the ionic strength of 0 25 wt sdbs solution was adjusted using sodium sulfate 1 100 mm and aged for 1 h for equilibration before applying to the fouled membranes the sdbs molecules started flocculating at a sodium sulfate concentration of around 200 mm and produced a turbid white solution therefore the tested range was limited to 100 mm at constant sdbs concentration cleaning efficiency was observed to depend on the ionic strength of the cleaning solution fig 8c the cleaning efficiency of the sdbs solution dropped with the addition of up to 10 mm sodium sulfate this may be due to either an increase in micelle size which reduces the mobility of the micelle blocks the membrane pores and thus limits mass transport or a reduction of repulsive forces at higher ion concentration between the negatively charged surfaces of surfactant micelles and emulsified oil particles 48 further increase in ionic strength was expected to decrease the cleaning efficiency however improved efficiencies were observed for the tested range up to 100 mm according to the literature this phenomenon could be interpreted by the following mechanisms i at ionic strengths beyond a certain threshold limit where inter micellar repulsion and micelle emulsion repulsion are minimum the micelle may behave as non ionic 49 for non ionic surfactants the cleaning efficiency increases with ionic strength 50 ii ionic strength beyond a certain threshold limit may change the shape of the micelle which could improve the cleaning efficiency 51 4 conclusions the chemical cleaning efficiency of surfactant based cleaning solutions has been determined with pvdf hollow fiber membranes fouled by highly stable cutting fluid emulsions with a negative charge anionic surfactants showed better cleaning efficiencies compared to cationic and non ionic surfactants at the same concentration due to the combined effect of electrostatic repulsion of emulsified oil particles and re emulsification of the oil particles in the fouling layer alkalization of the cleaning agent had a positive impact on the anionic surfactants whereas no significant impact was observed with cationic and non ionic surfactants the presence of the phenyl group in dodecyl sulfate anion has a significant role in cleaning as seen by the higher cleaning efficiency of sdbs as compared to sds the anionic surfactants show minimal impact on the surface characteristics of the membrane in terms of contact angle and water dissipation rate whereas a significant impact was observed with the non ionic surfactant the cleaning efficiency of sdbs decreased with concentration due to mass transport limitations while it increases with solution ph values at a constant sdbs concentration ionic strength had a strong impact on the cleaning efficiency with sdbs cleaning efficiency decreased with the addition of sodium sulfate up to 10 mm after which an improvement of the cleaning efficiency was observed declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

13627,a continuous flow electrohydraulic plasma discharge ehpd process characteristic of establishing a stable discharge through the conducting channel of in the center orifice of a dielectric plate was developed and investigated to degrade methylene blue mb in water the effect of three operating parameters i e liquid flow rate 37 94 ml min air flow rate 1 4 l min and initial dye concentration 10 100 mg l on the mb degradation efficiency was evaluated the results indicated that a complete degradation of mb was achieved within 10 min of treatment for all mb concentrations tested the optimum liquid and air flow rates were 68 ml min and 3 l min respectively for the process to remove mb in a circular flow operation the energy efficiency for different operating parameters was in the range of between 0 16 g kwh and 0 81 g kwh at 50 conversion reaction kinetics and the possible mb degradation pathway was analyzed and proposed hydroxyl radicals were found to be the dominant reactive species responsible for the mb degradation mineralization of mb was demonstrated by a 92 5 cod removal within10 min treatment for an initial mb concentration of 100 mg l the overall results indicated that the novel continuous flow ehpd reactor is a robust and highly effective process for degradation and mineralization of mb a potential technology that can overcome the limitations of advanced oxidation processes for wastewater treatment keywords electrohydraulic plasma discharge dye wastewater methylene blue radical scavenging degradation pathway 1 introduction for the past few decades rapid growth in population and industries has led to an increasing demand for energy and clean water all over the world however clean water has been and is being deteriorated by the toxic organic pollutants released from the industries for instance discharge of high concentrations of dyes in wastewater is one of the major problems in the world 1 2 most of the organic dyes in wastewater are highly toxic and considered to be potential carcinogens to humans moreover these dyes have complex and stable structures 3 which make them very resistant and difficult to degrade by conventional biological and physico chemical processes 4 therefore to maintain a clean and sustainable water supply the only possible way is to develop effective treatment technologies to recycle and reuse the wastewater to treat dye wastewater considerable interest has been given to advanced oxidation processes aops as they show specific advantages over other conventional treatments aops can generate highly reactive hydroxyl radicals oxidation potential of 2 8 v which are strong oxidizers and are potent in degrading organic pollutants due to their electrophilic behavior 5 various aop processes have been studied extensively and reported such as fenton uv o3 sonolysis photocatalysis uv h2o2 etc 1 6 although effective the applications of these technologies are limited due to the insufficient concentration of hydroxyl radicals oh high operating cost and high energy consumption thus there exists an urgent need to develop a robust water remediation technology for dye wastewater treatment recently electrical discharge in liquid with non thermal plasma generation is recognized as an effective robust aop approach as it generates many physicochemical effects such as highly reactive oxidative species o3 h2o2 o oh uv light electric field ions electrons and shock waves 1 9 various types of electrical discharge reactors including atmospheric pressure plasma dielectric barrier discharge dbd plasma jet arc discharge and corona discharge have been reported among these models the dbd plasma process has been widely tested for wastewater remediation 10 12 a dbd reactor was investigated by czapka et al 13 with air as the gas medium for decolorization of methylene blue mb in aqueous samples the results showed a complete mb decolorization within 30 min of treatment another dbd reactor 14 was operated with the addition of fe2 for degradation and mineralization of mb in solution the results showed more than 95 mb degradation and 21 total organic carbon toc removal within 25 min of treatment at an initial concentration of 100 ppm currently there are more developments in plasma technology by combining the plasma reactor with other treatment technologies to improve synergistic effects 15 for example wu et al 16 demonstrated a hybrid dbd system coupled with activated carbon supported on polyurethane foam which achieved 97 9 mb removal within 10 min treatment similar degradation efficiency to their plasma alone treatment over 30 min despite the synergistic advantages the hybrid plasma processes significantly increase the complexity of operation and control as well as reduce the feasibility of large scale application generally the effectiveness and energy efficiency of a particular plasma process depends on their reactor configuration and geometry to improve concentration of reactive species and interaction with the targeted contaminants 7 9 moreover the optimization of the current plasma technology toward scale up and application is complex because of the types of reactor designs and materials used discharge types and operational parameters such as gas flow rate liquid flow rate and influent concentration 17 therefore it is important to develop a simple robust and energy efficient plasma process that can further improve the degradation and mineralization efficiency for water pollutants without the addition of chemicals or absorbents in this study a novel ac powered continuous flow electrohydraulic plasma discharge process ehpd was developed to address the above mentioned challenges and comprehensively evaluated for degradation of dye wastewater the degradation efficiency was optimized based on the operational parameters such as liquid flow rate air flow rate and initial dye concentration after the best operational parameters were determined the energy efficiency was compared with those of the other plasma systems in addition mineralization of mb and treated water quality were investigated in terms of changes in chemical oxygen demand cod inorganic ions ph and conductivity during the ehpd treatment process radical scavenging experiments were conducted to determine the role of reactive species involved and the mb degradation mechanism and pathway by ehpd was also briefly discussed 2 methods and materials 2 1 materials methylene blue mb c16h18n3scl purchased from himedia laboratories pvt ltd was used as the target dye pollutant different stock solutions 10 mg l 20 mg l 50 mg l and 100 mg l of mb were prepared by dissolving the chemical in deionized water other chemicals such as ascorbic acid 2 propanol c3h8o and sodium nitrate nano3 used for radical scavengers were purchased from fisher scientific eugene or 2 2 experimental setup the body of the electrohydraulic discharge reactor was made from polycarbonate material the power was supplied by a high voltage transformer catalog 110 llhi10122 d115 plasma technics inc racine wi which was connected to the universal ac power with 60 hz frequency the novel configuration of the electrohydraulic discharge reactor presented in this study was shown in fig 1 two stainless steel electrodes were separated by a dielectric plate with a small opening of 0 8 mm diameter in the middle where the plasma discharge was initiated compared to the most common researched designs pin pin and pin plate electrohydraulic discharge reactors with batch operation this design had a unique feature of establishing a complete discharge through the conducting channel of the orifice instead of between the electrodes and allowed in situ reactive species generated to be concentrated in the vicinity of the opening and the continuity of discharge current could be achieved in the form of mobile electrons to obtain a sheer contact with and breakdown of substrate molecules flowing through the voltage and power applied were adjusted by a variac voltage regulator model tdgc2 2km ise inc cleveland oh the applied voltage and current between the hv electrode and the ground electrode was measured by a high voltage probe tektronix p6015a and a current probe tektronix p6021 connected to an oscilloscope tektronix tbs1052b beaverton or the power applied to the whole system was read from a power consumption watt meter the stable plasma discharge generated at the dielectric opening and typical voltage current waveforms obtained from the oscilloscope were presented in fig 1 in addition the system included a peristaltic pump masterflex l s 7523 60 vernon hills il which allowed a continuous movement of prepared mb solutions through the reactor for treatment this continuous operation design could significantly improve the throughput and capacity of the reactor system therefore potentially reducing the operation cost and reactor size for commercial applications 2 3 experimental design and operation the design of continuous flow ehpd could treat wastewater in either a circular or one pass mode in this study the focus was placed on the circulation mode in which the treated stream was continuously recycled to the influent tank to test the best efficiency of mb degradation by the newly developed ehpd process in each experiment air was used as the carrier gas fed into the reactor through a venturi injector the air flow rate was controlled by a mass flow controller use of a carrier gas was suggested to facilitate the ignition of electric discharge due to the lower ignition electric field strength in gas 30 kv cm in air than in water 1 mv cm and promote the reactive species production at gas water interface during plasma discharge 18 19 air as a low cost gas source was selected to boost the oxidative species desired for organic degradation a total volume of 150 ml mb solution was used for each experimental run once the solution filled the discharge region the power was turned on and the voltage and power were adjusted to the same position on the regulator for all the experiments during the treatment process for each experiment the power was controlled at 250 300 watt and voltage and current were observed to be in the range of 2 5 5 kv and 10 20 ma respectively the treated solution was directed back to the flask to accomplish a continuous mixing and circulating operation to evaluate the mb degradation efficiency of the ehpd reactor three operational parameters i e liquid flow rate air flow rate and initial dye concentration were chosen to conduct circular batch experiments followed a sequencing factorial design four liquid flow rates were investigated i e 37 68 84 and 94 ml min corresponding to 25 50 75 and 100 rpm on the peristaltic pump the liquid flow rates were selected based on the manageable range of the system operability and their actual flow rates mentioned above together with the addition of air flow and plasma discharge four air flow rates i e 1 l min 2 l min 3 l min and 4 l min were investigated under the optimum liquid flow rate determined from the first group of experiments with the initial mb concentration and other parameters such as solution volume and applied power kept unchanged in the third group of experiments the effect of initial concentration of mb i e 10 mg l 20 mg l 50 mg l and 100 mg l on mb degradation efficiency was evaluated using the optimum liquid and air flow rates a total treatment time of 10 min was used for each experiment and samples were taken at 1 min intervals from the influent vessel each experiment was repeated twice and were carried out at atmospheric pressure and ambient temperature 2 4 radical scavenging experiments in order to identify the role of active species produced in the ehpd process for mb degradation ascorbic acid 3 mmol l sodium nitrate 3 mmol l and 10 ml of diluted 2 propanol 100 mg l in distilled water were added to 20 mg l mb in order to scavenge superoxide radical o2 aqueous electrons e aq and hydroxyl radical oh respectively the choice of scavengers and their concentrations was made in order to align with literature on plasma treatment for organic degradation 20 23 the optimum condition found for combined liquid flow rate and air flow rate was used for all radical scavenging tests to compare with the scavenger free running condition for the mb degradation 2 5 sample analysis and data processing the degradation byproduct identification and analysis were conducted with an acquity uplc system coupled with a waters xevo tq mass spectrometer and a tandem quadrupole mass spectrometer for lc ms ms quantification applications using single ion reaction monitoring sir or multiple reaction monitoring mrm methods the column used was 1 mm i d x150 mm length packed with 5 um phenyl hexyl packing from phenomenex torrance ca the method referred to in this study was similar to that used by rauf et al 24 with slight modifications the mass spectroscopy ms system was composed of an electrospray ionization source in a multiple reaction monitoring mode the detector was a low noise off axis and long life photomultiplier detector the signal received from the detector was recorded by the masslynx software the mobile phases for the method consisted of two solvents a and b mobile phase a was made using water and mobile phase b was made of 20 acetonitrile and 80 ammonium acetate 0 1 m the gradient was from 20 to 80 in 25 min with a flow rate of 0 060 ml min and an injection volume of 4 μl the inorganic ions in the degradation products were determined using a dionex ion analyzer dionex sunnyvale ca with a gp40 gradient pump attached an ed40 electrochemical detector and an as40 autosampler 100 mm sodium hydroxide naoh was used as the mobile phase and the injection volume was about 20 μl the anion suppressor current was set to 300 ma and the detector stabilizer temperature was set at 30 c the inorganic ions check standard certiprep was used as reference to compare the products formed in the ion chromatography trace the concentration of each inorganic ion present in the aqueous media was calculated and presented the initial and final ph and conductivity of mb for each experiment run were measured using conductivity and ph probes with a hach hq 440d multi meter cod was measured with hach tntplus vial test tubes read on a hach dr3900 spectrophotometer hydrogen peroxide h2o2 concentration in plasma treated solution was determined based on the reaction with titanium sulfate reagent to form pertitianic acid the concentration of pertitanic acid is directly proportional to the reacted h2o2 concentration and it is determined by measuring the absorbance at 407 nm in uv vis spectrophotometer 25 26 degradation of mb was monitored using a uv vis spectrophotometer biotek synergy ht at 664 nm the degradation efficiency of dyes was measured as follows 1 n c 0 c c 0 100 where c0 initial concentration c final concentration the energy consumption for mb degradation was calculated using eq 2 the consumption value was expressed as the amount of pollutant converted divided by

liquid flow rate under all the preset operational conditions based on the experimental design stable electrical discharge was observed at the dielectric opening in the middle of the reactor where the continuous flow of mb solution is passing throughout the treatment period as shown in fig 1 it was reported that in the electrohydraulic discharge reactors with moving liquid the liquid flow rate often influenced the degradation process and energy efficiency 17 as seen in fig 2 the mb solution with initial concentration of 20 mg l was degraded very rapidly with plasma discharge at different liquid flow rates with 3 l min air injection finally all the liquid flow rates showed almost complete mb degradation within 7 min of ehpd treatment the mb degradation efficiency was not substantially affected by the liquid flow rate except for 37 ml min because the total contact and reaction time of mb molecules with plasma discharge in the continuous circular flow was the same for all liquid flow rates assuming the discharging channel where the reactive species were produced was the thickness of the dielectric plate however the low liquid flow rate at 37 ml min resulted apparently lower degradation rates during the first 7 min than those of the higher flow rates the reason for this might be because the liquid flow rate needs to be high enough to maintain a high treatment frequency and power delivery and to achieve an effective utilization of the reactive species produced with the high air flow rate that said the rapid and complete mb removal within 5 min with liquid flow rate higher than 68 mg l clearly indicated that the ehpd process could enhance the degradation activity by effective production of oxidative radicals from the water and air to be used for organic degradation 1 11 14 12 27 there were only a few reports available on the influence of liquid flow rate on the degradation process for instance one study reported that the phenol degradation rate was not affected by a faster water flow rate in coaxial falling water film reactors with corona discharge 28 another study reported that the energy efficiency of mb degradation decreased with increase in solution flow rate in a pulsed dbd falling water film reactor 29 the liquid flow rate in these studies would be equivalent to that of one pass operation of our ehpd process certainly more research is required to evaluate the influence of liquid flow rate on mb degradation by the electric discharges in continuous flow liquid media based on the results from this study 68 ml min 50 rpm appeared to be the best flow rate for this reactor as it achieved the highest degradation compared to other liquid flow rates and good energy efficiency at 50 conversion with y50 0 27 g kwh table 2 therefore 68 ml min 50 rpm was used as the liquid flow rate for all the following experiment runs 3 1 2 effect of air flow rate four air flow rates 1 2 3 and 4 l min were investigated at the liquid flow rate of 68 ml min controlled at a pump speed of 50 rpm for treating a mb solution at 20 mg l the actual liquid flow rate controlled by the peristaltic pump could slightly vary with the different air flow rates and plasma discharge corresponding to the air flow rates of 1 2 3 and 4 l min the liquid flow rate of the peristaltic pump was 86 78 68 and 60 ml min respectively but wouldn t affect the mb degradation based on the findings in section 3 1 1 as shown in fig 3 the concentration of mb decreased quickly with different air flow rates within 10 min of treatment more than 95 of dye was degraded within 5 min by all air flow rates tested which was mainly due to the effective and stable production of active species during the ehpd treatment 30 16 in fact a trial for mb degradation without air took more than 60 min to show near complete degradation with even higher power consumption the fact that all air flow rates achieved nearly 100 degradation rate clearly indicated that the addition of air flow in ehpd treatment substantially boosted the production of reactive species accounted for mb degradation however our results did not show significant difference in mb degradation efficiency among different air flow rates this was likely due to the sufficient active species that were produced even at the lowest air flow rate employed in this study to degrade mb at a relatively low initial concentration of 20 mg l as such the increase in air flow rate did not cause noticeable changes in mb removal rate however increasing the initial dye concentration appeared to influence the mb degradation efficiency under different air flow rates as smaller air flow rates showed lower degradation efficiencies which was reported by reddy et al 14 based on the results an optimal airflow rate of 3 l min was determined for the later evaluation on different mb concentration however it was observed that air flow rate beyond 3 l min sometimes caused fluctuations in the liquid flow or sparkling effect during the discharge potentially leading to a system shutdown it was thus suggested that the air flow rate should be kept around 2 l min to lower the treatment cost and ensure a satisfactory removal efficiency for mb concentration up to 100 mg l 3 1 3 effect of initial mb concentration fig 4 presented the effect of initial mb concentrations 10 20 50 and 100 mg l on mb degradation by plasma treatment with 68 ml min liquid flow rate and 3 l min airflow rate the 10 mg l initial concentration showed a 100 mb degradation efficiency after 6 min of treatment followed by 20 mg l 99 94 50 mg l 99 67 and 100 mg l 97 69 respectively within 10 min of treatment time it appeared that the initial mb concentration influenced the degradation rate by the ehpd process operated under the given parameters because the mb degradation efficiency at lower concentrations was slightly higher than that at higher concentrations similar phenomenon was observed and reported by various researchers that degradation efficiency decreased with increase in initial mb concentrations 14 31 in addition wu et al 27 studied the mb degradation by dielectric barrier discharge plasma treatment and also observed that mb degradation efficiency was higher at low mb concentrations and would decrease at higher mb concentrations because the amount of plasma active species formed in the discharge process was maintained at a specific concentration level for the constant energy input in this study since the results showed stably high mb degradation efficiency in a short period of time at all tested initial concentrations it could be concluded that the novel ehpd rector system was a highly effective process for mb degradation 3 2 mineralization of mb and water quality change during ehpd process to evaluate the mineralization rate and change of water quality during the ehpd treatment chemical oxygen demand cod as well as physicochemical attributes of the initial and treated solutions including h2o2 inorganic ions nitrate chloride and sulfate ph and electric conductivity were investigated figs 5 and 6 the measured cod concentration was adjusted based on the theoretical hydrogen peroxide interference to the cod measurement 470 6 mg of cod as o2 per 1000 mg h2o2 32 the cod in 100 mg l mb solution was determined as 357 5 mg l and decreased rapidly in the treatment process with liquid flow rate at 68 ml min and air flow rate at 3 l min at 5 min and 10 min the cod level reached down to 51 7 mg l and 26 7 mg l signified a cod removal of 85 5 and 92 5 respectively which should be approximately equivalent to the removal rate of organic matter and the mineralization rate the mb mineralization rate was slightly lower than the overall degradation efficiency of 98 7 which implied that smaller organic molecules from mb degradation still present in the treated solutions however the cod removal obtained in this study during 10 min treatment for 100 mg l initial mb concentration was much faster and higher compared to the results in literature of plasma alone and hybrid systems 14 12 16 27 another major change in the water quality observed with mb treatment is the production of h2o2 fig 5 h2o2 is a common stable compound attributed to the quenching of short lived o h radicals generated with plasma water wastewater treatment reported by a number of studies 33 34 9 in this study h2o2 concentration gradually increased with time and arrived 25 44 mg l at 1 min 66 18 mg l at 5 min and 89 16 mg l at 10 min thus high concentration of h2o2 shows that large amount of hydroxyl radicals generated with air ehpd are excessive and not consumed by the oxidation of mb and nitrogen active species produced with plasma discharge several major inorganic ions were detected in the treated mb solution due to mb mineralization and or plasma discharge changes in concentrations of chloride sulfate and nitrate were shown in fig 5 chloride and sulfate presented low concentrations which were produced with bond breaking of mb while nitrates showed a relatively high concentration of 43 76 mg l at 1 min 188 02 mg l at 5 min and 223 74 mg l at 10 min the elevation of nitrate concentration with treatment time was attributed to not only the mineralization of mb molecule but also the fixation of nitrogen in the gas source of air as the air contains 78 09 of nitrogen n2 20 95 of oxygen o2 35 no and no2 eq 3 4 5 6 7 could be produced from the air due to nitrogen atoms competing with the oxygen atoms these species can react with water molecules and produce no2 and no3 eq 8 no2 was not detected in our experiments possibly due to high oxidation capacity of 3 l min air activated ehpd that converted all nitrogen to its highest valence 3 e o 2 2 o e 4 e n 2 2 n e 5 n o no 6 o no no 2 7 no 2 h 2 o no 3 2h 8 oh no no 2 hno 2 hno 3 these formed ions also explained the increasing acidity in the solution for ph reduction and elevation for conductivity also observed by huang et al 30 and reddy et al 14 research on plasma activated water has reported similar results in nitrogen fixation effect by plasma discharge and the nitrate concentration in this study is the highest among different plasma processes these results indicated that the treated dye wastewater from the ehpd process could be potentially used as a fertilizer 36 39 if used for drinking water the concern of high nitrate concentration could be addressed by substituting the gas source of air with pure oxygen gas the initial ph and conductivity of mb solution at 10 100 mg l ranged in 5 3 4 9 and 5 0 36 7 μs cm 25 c respectively final ph values after 10 min ehpd treatment for all tested parameters for varying liquid flow rates air flow rates and initial mb concentration showed a big fall from the initial point but little variation among different operational conditions ranging from 2 5 to 2 7 apparently due to the acids production discussed earlier on the other hand the final conductivity leaped tremendously to 1000 1750 μs cm and showed a clear decreasing trend with increasing liquid flow rates also increased with higher air flow rate and higher initial mb concentration fig 6 a c this same phenomenon i e decrease in ph and increase in electrical conductivity was observed by many other researchers 31 40 for instance dobrin et al reported that after 15 min of pulsed corona discharge on mb degradation the ph was decreased to 3 2 and the conductivity was increased to 714 μs cm evidence from literature showed that ph and conductivity were strongly related to electrical discharges in liquid media 17 41 3 3 mb degradation kinetics degradation kinetics were investigated to further confirm the effect of different parameters on the mb degradation efficiency the degradation reaction process was fitted to a pseudo first order kinetics by eq 9 42 9 ln ct c 0 kt where ct was concentration of mb for a given treatment time c0 was the initial concentration and k was the first order rate constant min 1 respectively as shown in fig 7 a c the correlation coefficients were obtained using linear regression by plotting ln ct c0 kt at different liquid flow rates air flow rates and initial mb concentrations the correlation coefficients were above 0 98 for all the batch experiments clearly indicating that the first order kinetic model agreed with the experimental data on the mb degradation the results of the first order kinetic constant for degradation of mb at different operational parameters were presented in table 1 3 4 role of reactive species produced by ehpd for mb degradation operating at 20 mg l mb initial concentration under the optimal condition of liquid flow rate of 68 ml min and flow rate of 3 l min air the addition of radical scavengers ascorbic acid sodium nitrate and 2 propanol for aqueous electrons superoxide and hydroxyl radicals respectively to the system had shown different levels of decreases in mb degradation efficiency as compared to the scavenger free trials degradation kinetics were investigated as shown in the fig 8 to further confirm the effect of radical scavengers on the mb degradation efficiency with addition of nano3 the degradation rate constant was 0 4796 the mb degradation was affected during the first few minutes and caught up after that showed that the hydrated electrons played a minimal role in the ehpd process for mb degradation with 10 min treatment on the other hand with the addition of ascorbic acid the degradation rate constant was 0 4219 it showed that mb decreased slightly than that of nano3 indicating minimal involvement of the o2 species in mb degradation on the contrary the mb degradation rate was significantly affected by 2 propanol during the entire treatment with the degradation rate constant reduced to 0 1459 clearly indicating that production of oh radicals among different reactive species in the ehpd process played the major role for mb degradation 3 5 energy efficiency of the mb degradation by ehpd the energy yield g kwh was used to evaluate the energy efficiency of the ehpd reactor during the mb degradation process which was calculated using eq 2 at 50 degradation rate and the input power for all the three operational parameters table 2 based on the energy yield calculation for 50 mb degradation the highest energy yield was 0 27 g kwh at 68 ml min for air flow rate the highest energy yield was 0 27 g kwh at 2 l min and 3 l min and for the initial mb concentration the highest energy yield was 0 81 g kwh at 100 mg l it seemed that the energy yield decreased as the degradation efficiency and treatment time increased the calculated results were obviously in line with the experiments results which showed decreases in energy yield with the increase in treatment time for all the experiments the reason was due to the low collision probability between plasma reactive species and mb molecules 14 27 also the energy yield was proportional with the initial dye concentration because of more reactant molecules present in the solution influenced by the discharge 43 as the mb degradation efficiency increased with respect to the treatment time it led to a reduction in mb removal per unit of energy consumption over a longer treatment time to further investigate the efficiency of the novel electrohydraulic plasma discharge process a comparison was made between the ehpd in this study with other plasma treatment methods honestly it was sometimes difficult to make a comparison about the efficiency and performance among the plasma processes because of the different reactor types experimental conditions and the wide variety of pollutants used for degradation 12 therefore comparisons presented in this paper only focused on the performance of different nonthermal plasma reactors on mb degradation table 3 based on similar parameters such as degradation and energy efficiencies it could be concluded that the novel continuous flow ehpd process showed a faster degradation and relatively high energy efficiency compared to other nonthermal plasma reactor designs in the literature despite that a few methods reported a high energy yield those reactor designs were not considered better than the ehpd process due to much longer treatment time and or lower removal efficiency according to the data collected in table 3 besides the continuous flow ehpd provided flexibility and practicality in terms of potential development for mass treatment of wastewater 3 6 degradation mechanism of methylene blue by ehpd the possible degradation pathway of mb was studied using lc ms and the total ion chromatogram tic was shown in fig 9 the mb molecules at different treatment times were broken down because of the electric plasma discharge in the mb solution after the end of the treatment time 10 min the peaks of mb were not observed clearly indicating that it was completely degraded the retention time for initial mb started to decrease with the discharge and new peaks byproducts were formed at the shorter retention times the possible formation of intermediates and final products were detected by mass spectroscopy and the potential pathway was shown in fig 10 when mb was dissolved in water the mass spectroscopy observed an mb peak at m z 284 due to the cl being ionized and entering the detached state and the mb cation was isomerized into c6h18n3s 30 12 when mb was degraded by the plasma the presence of hydroxyl radicals oh decomposed mb molecules into different products such as azure b m z 270 azure a m z 256 azure c m z 242 and thionin m z 228 these products were formed mainly due to demethylation and hydroxylation from plasma and could further be reduced to aromatic ring compounds which later broke down to various fragments non aromatic compounds and reacted with other reactive species these intermediate products were eventually mineralized into inorganic compounds such as co2 h2o so4 2 and no3 46 30 47 16 27 many previous authors have suggested the similar possible pathway benetoli et al 46 proposed that mb degradation took place due to two main reaction pathways in the non thermal plasma reactor 1 high energy electron impact and 2 successive hydroxylation addition to the benzene ring of the mb molecule they also observed that demethylated mb molecules was blue shifted in the uv vis absorption peak at 664 nm huang et al 30 proposed an mb degradation mechanism based on the bond dissociation energy bde theory for the dielectric barrier discharge dbd reactor they suggested that it was easier for the chemical bonds to break with low bond dissociation energy they also detected phenyl thiophene during the discharge process at the peak intensity of m z 138 due to the production of ozone and hydroxyl radicals from the discharge the mb molecular structure was oxidized and ultimately transformed into inorganic ions such as co2 h2o so4 2 and no3 4 conclusions the results in this study concluded that the novel continuous flow electrohydraulic plasma ehpd reactor developed was a highly efficient method for treating dye wastewater a nearly complete degradation of methylene blue mb was achieved within 10 min of treatment time the optimum running liquid and air flow rates were 68 ml min and 3 l min showed complete degradation and a better energy efficiency y50 0 27 g kwh were achieved for the initial mb concentration of 20 mg l increasing initial mb concentrations could decrease degradation rates however almost 90 of mb was degraded after only 5 min of treatment even at 100 mg l decrease in ph and increase in conductivity in the solution were observed after 10 min ehpd treatment for all experimental cases mb degradation followed the first order kinetics and the energy yield at 50 conversion was ranging from 0 16 g kwh to 0 81 g kwh for different operating parameters the free radical scavenging experiment showed that hydroxyl radicals played a very important role in mb degradation demethylation and hydroxylation were the two main reactions found in degrading mb molecules in addition cod removal was 92 5 after 10 min treatment for 100 mg l initial mb concentration signaling high mineralization rate and major production of nitrate and hydrogen peroxide was found in the treated solution which could be potentially used as a green nitrogen fertilizer and

13627,a continuous flow electrohydraulic plasma discharge ehpd process characteristic of establishing a stable discharge through the conducting channel of in the center orifice of a dielectric plate was developed and investigated to degrade methylene blue mb in water the effect of three operating parameters i e liquid flow rate 37 94 ml min air flow rate 1 4 l min and initial dye concentration 10 100 mg l on the mb degradation efficiency was evaluated the results indicated that a complete degradation of mb was achieved within 10 min of treatment for all mb concentrations tested the optimum liquid and air flow rates were 68 ml min and 3 l min respectively for the process to remove mb in a circular flow operation the energy efficiency for different operating parameters was in the range of between 0 16 g kwh and 0 81 g kwh at 50 conversion reaction kinetics and the possible mb degradation pathway was analyzed and proposed hydroxyl radicals were found to be the dominant reactive species responsible for the mb degradation mineralization of mb was demonstrated by a 92 5 cod removal within10 min treatment for an initial mb concentration of 100 mg l the overall results indicated that the novel continuous flow ehpd reactor is a robust and highly effective process for degradation and mineralization of mb a potential technology that can overcome the limitations of advanced oxidation processes for wastewater treatment keywords electrohydraulic plasma discharge dye wastewater methylene blue radical scavenging degradation pathway 1 introduction for the past few decades rapid growth in population and industries has led to an increasing demand for energy and clean water all over the world however clean water has been and is being deteriorated by the toxic organic pollutants released from the industries for instance discharge of high concentrations of dyes in wastewater is one of the major problems in the world 1 2 most of the organic dyes in wastewater are highly toxic and considered to be potential carcinogens to humans moreover these dyes have complex and stable structures 3 which make them very resistant and difficult to degrade by conventional biological and physico chemical processes 4 therefore to maintain a clean and sustainable water supply the only possible way is to develop effective treatment technologies to recycle and reuse the wastewater to treat dye wastewater considerable interest has been given to advanced oxidation processes aops as they show specific advantages over other conventional treatments aops can generate highly reactive hydroxyl radicals oxidation potential of 2 8 v which are strong oxidizers and are potent in degrading organic pollutants due to their electrophilic behavior 5 various aop processes have been studied extensively and reported such as fenton uv o3 sonolysis photocatalysis uv h2o2 etc 1 6 although effective the applications of these technologies are limited due to the insufficient concentration of hydroxyl radicals oh high operating cost and high energy consumption thus there exists an urgent need to develop a robust water remediation technology for dye wastewater treatment recently electrical discharge in liquid with non thermal plasma generation is recognized as an effective robust aop approach as it generates many physicochemical effects such as highly reactive oxidative species o3 h2o2 o oh uv light electric field ions electrons and shock waves 1 9 various types of electrical discharge reactors including atmospheric pressure plasma dielectric barrier discharge dbd plasma jet arc discharge and corona discharge have been reported among these models the dbd plasma process has been widely tested for wastewater remediation 10 12 a dbd reactor was investigated by czapka et al 13 with air as the gas medium for decolorization of methylene blue mb in aqueous samples the results showed a complete mb decolorization within 30 min of treatment another dbd reactor 14 was operated with the addition of fe2 for degradation and mineralization of mb in solution the results showed more than 95 mb degradation and 21 total organic carbon toc removal within 25 min of treatment at an initial concentration of 100 ppm currently there are more developments in plasma technology by combining the plasma reactor with other treatment technologies to improve synergistic effects 15 for example wu et al 16 demonstrated a hybrid dbd system coupled with activated carbon supported on polyurethane foam which achieved 97 9 mb removal within 10 min treatment similar degradation efficiency to their plasma alone treatment over 30 min despite the synergistic advantages the hybrid plasma processes significantly increase the complexity of operation and control as well as reduce the feasibility of large scale application generally the effectiveness and energy efficiency of a particular plasma process depends on their reactor configuration and geometry to improve concentration of reactive species and interaction with the targeted contaminants 7 9 moreover the optimization of the current plasma technology toward scale up and application is complex because of the types of reactor designs and materials used discharge types and operational parameters such as gas flow rate liquid flow rate and influent concentration 17 therefore it is important to develop a simple robust and energy efficient plasma process that can further improve the degradation and mineralization efficiency for water pollutants without the addition of chemicals or absorbents in this study a novel ac powered continuous flow electrohydraulic plasma discharge process ehpd was developed to address the above mentioned challenges and comprehensively evaluated for degradation of dye wastewater the degradation efficiency was optimized based on the operational parameters such as liquid flow rate air flow rate and initial dye concentration after the best operational parameters were determined the energy efficiency was compared with those of the other plasma systems in addition mineralization of mb and treated water quality were investigated in terms of changes in chemical oxygen demand cod inorganic ions ph and conductivity during the ehpd treatment process radical scavenging experiments were conducted to determine the role of reactive species involved and the mb degradation mechanism and pathway by ehpd was also briefly discussed 2 methods and materials 2 1 materials methylene blue mb c16h18n3scl purchased from himedia laboratories pvt ltd was used as the target dye pollutant different stock solutions 10 mg l 20 mg l 50 mg l and 100 mg l of mb were prepared by dissolving the chemical in deionized water other chemicals such as ascorbic acid 2 propanol c3h8o and sodium nitrate nano3 used for radical scavengers were purchased from fisher scientific eugene or 2 2 experimental setup the body of the electrohydraulic discharge reactor was made from polycarbonate material the power was supplied by a high voltage transformer catalog 110 llhi10122 d115 plasma technics inc racine wi which was connected to the universal ac power with 60 hz frequency the novel configuration of the electrohydraulic discharge reactor presented in this study was shown in fig 1 two stainless steel electrodes were separated by a dielectric plate with a small opening of 0 8 mm diameter in the middle where the plasma discharge was initiated compared to the most common researched designs pin pin and pin plate electrohydraulic discharge reactors with batch operation this design had a unique feature of establishing a complete discharge through the conducting channel of the orifice instead of between the electrodes and allowed in situ reactive species generated to be concentrated in the vicinity of the opening and the continuity of discharge current could be achieved in the form of mobile electrons to obtain a sheer contact with and breakdown of substrate molecules flowing through the voltage and power applied were adjusted by a variac voltage regulator model tdgc2 2km ise inc cleveland oh the applied voltage and current between the hv electrode and the ground electrode was measured by a high voltage probe tektronix p6015a and a current probe tektronix p6021 connected to an oscilloscope tektronix tbs1052b beaverton or the power applied to the whole system was read from a power consumption watt meter the stable plasma discharge generated at the dielectric opening and typical voltage current waveforms obtained from the oscilloscope were presented in fig 1 in addition the system included a peristaltic pump masterflex l s 7523 60 vernon hills il which allowed a continuous movement of prepared mb solutions through the reactor for treatment this continuous operation design could significantly improve the throughput and capacity of the reactor system therefore potentially reducing the operation cost and reactor size for commercial applications 2 3 experimental design and operation the design of continuous flow ehpd could treat wastewater in either a circular or one pass mode in this study the focus was placed on the circulation mode in which the treated stream was continuously recycled to the influent tank to test the best efficiency of mb degradation by the newly developed ehpd process in each experiment air was used as the carrier gas fed into the reactor through a venturi injector the air flow rate was controlled by a mass flow controller use of a carrier gas was suggested to facilitate the ignition of electric discharge due to the lower ignition electric field strength in gas 30 kv cm in air than in water 1 mv cm and promote the reactive species production at gas water interface during plasma discharge 18 19 air as a low cost gas source was selected to boost the oxidative species desired for organic degradation a total volume of 150 ml mb solution was used for each experimental run once the solution filled the discharge region the power was turned on and the voltage and power were adjusted to the same position on the regulator for all the experiments during the treatment process for each experiment the power was controlled at 250 300 watt and voltage and current were observed to be in the range of 2 5 5 kv and 10 20 ma respectively the treated solution was directed back to the flask to accomplish a continuous mixing and circulating operation to evaluate the mb degradation efficiency of the ehpd reactor three operational parameters i e liquid flow rate air flow rate and initial dye concentration were chosen to conduct circular batch experiments followed a sequencing factorial design four liquid flow rates were investigated i e 37 68 84 and 94 ml min corresponding to 25 50 75 and 100 rpm on the peristaltic pump the liquid flow rates were selected based on the manageable range of the system operability and their actual flow rates mentioned above together with the addition of air flow and plasma discharge four air flow rates i e 1 l min 2 l min 3 l min and 4 l min were investigated under the optimum liquid flow rate determined from the first group of experiments with the initial mb concentration and other parameters such as solution volume and applied power kept unchanged in the third group of experiments the effect of initial concentration of mb i e 10 mg l 20 mg l 50 mg l and 100 mg l on mb degradation efficiency was evaluated using the optimum liquid and air flow rates a total treatment time of 10 min was used for each experiment and samples were taken at 1 min intervals from the influent vessel each experiment was repeated twice and were carried out at atmospheric pressure and ambient temperature 2 4 radical scavenging experiments in order to identify the role of active species produced in the ehpd process for mb degradation ascorbic acid 3 mmol l sodium nitrate 3 mmol l and 10 ml of diluted 2 propanol 100 mg l in distilled water were added to 20 mg l mb in order to scavenge superoxide radical o2 aqueous electrons e aq and hydroxyl radical oh respectively the choice of scavengers and their concentrations was made in order to align with literature on plasma treatment for organic degradation 20 23 the optimum condition found for combined liquid flow rate and air flow rate was used for all radical scavenging tests to compare with the scavenger free running condition for the mb degradation 2 5 sample analysis and data processing the degradation byproduct identification and analysis were conducted with an acquity uplc system coupled with a waters xevo tq mass spectrometer and a tandem quadrupole mass spectrometer for lc ms ms quantification applications using single ion reaction monitoring sir or multiple reaction monitoring mrm methods the column used was 1 mm i d x150 mm length packed with 5 um phenyl hexyl packing from phenomenex torrance ca the method referred to in this study was similar to that used by rauf et al 24 with slight modifications the mass spectroscopy ms system was composed of an electrospray ionization source in a multiple reaction monitoring mode the detector was a low noise off axis and long life photomultiplier detector the signal received from the detector was recorded by the masslynx software the mobile phases for the method consisted of two solvents a and b mobile phase a was made using water and mobile phase b was made of 20 acetonitrile and 80 ammonium acetate 0 1 m the gradient was from 20 to 80 in 25 min with a flow rate of 0 060 ml min and an injection volume of 4 μl the inorganic ions in the degradation products were determined using a dionex ion analyzer dionex sunnyvale ca with a gp40 gradient pump attached an ed40 electrochemical detector and an as40 autosampler 100 mm sodium hydroxide naoh was used as the mobile phase and the injection volume was about 20 μl the anion suppressor current was set to 300 ma and the detector stabilizer temperature was set at 30 c the inorganic ions check standard certiprep was used as reference to compare the products formed in the ion chromatography trace the concentration of each inorganic ion present in the aqueous media was calculated and presented the initial and final ph and conductivity of mb for each experiment run were measured using conductivity and ph probes with a hach hq 440d multi meter cod was measured with hach tntplus vial test tubes read on a hach dr3900 spectrophotometer hydrogen peroxide h2o2 concentration in plasma treated solution was determined based on the reaction with titanium sulfate reagent to form pertitianic acid the concentration of pertitanic acid is directly proportional to the reacted h2o2 concentration and it is determined by measuring the absorbance at 407 nm in uv vis spectrophotometer 25 26 degradation of mb was monitored using a uv vis spectrophotometer biotek synergy ht at 664 nm the degradation efficiency of dyes was measured as follows 1 n c 0 c c 0 100 where c0 initial concentration c final concentration the energy consumption for mb degradation was calculated using eq 2 the consumption value was expressed as the amount of pollutant converted divided by

liquid flow rate under all the preset operational conditions based on the experimental design stable electrical discharge was observed at the dielectric opening in the middle of the reactor where the continuous flow of mb solution is passing throughout the treatment period as shown in fig 1 it was reported that in the electrohydraulic discharge reactors with moving liquid the liquid flow rate often influenced the degradation process and energy efficiency 17 as seen in fig 2 the mb solution with initial concentration of 20 mg l was degraded very rapidly with plasma discharge at different liquid flow rates with 3 l min air injection finally all the liquid flow rates showed almost complete mb degradation within 7 min of ehpd treatment the mb degradation efficiency was not substantially affected by the liquid flow rate except for 37 ml min because the total contact and reaction time of mb molecules with plasma discharge in the continuous circular flow was the same for all liquid flow rates assuming the discharging channel where the reactive species were produced was the thickness of the dielectric plate however the low liquid flow rate at 37 ml min resulted apparently lower degradation rates during the first 7 min than those of the higher flow rates the reason for this might be because the liquid flow rate needs to be high enough to maintain a high treatment frequency and power delivery and to achieve an effective utilization of the reactive species produced with the high air flow rate that said the rapid and complete mb removal within 5 min with liquid flow rate higher than 68 mg l clearly indicated that the ehpd process could enhance the degradation activity by effective production of oxidative radicals from the water and air to be used for organic degradation 1 11 14 12 27 there were only a few reports available on the influence of liquid flow rate on the degradation process for instance one study reported that the phenol degradation rate was not affected by a faster water flow rate in coaxial falling water film reactors with corona discharge 28 another study reported that the energy efficiency of mb degradation decreased with increase in solution flow rate in a pulsed dbd falling water film reactor 29 the liquid flow rate in these studies would be equivalent to that of one pass operation of our ehpd process certainly more research is required to evaluate the influence of liquid flow rate on mb degradation by the electric discharges in continuous flow liquid media based on the results from this study 68 ml min 50 rpm appeared to be the best flow rate for this reactor as it achieved the highest degradation compared to other liquid flow rates and good energy efficiency at 50 conversion with y50 0 27 g kwh table 2 therefore 68 ml min 50 rpm was used as the liquid flow rate for all the following experiment runs 3 1 2 effect of air flow rate four air flow rates 1 2 3 and 4 l min were investigated at the liquid flow rate of 68 ml min controlled at a pump speed of 50 rpm for treating a mb solution at 20 mg l the actual liquid flow rate controlled by the peristaltic pump could slightly vary with the different air flow rates and plasma discharge corresponding to the air flow rates of 1 2 3 and 4 l min the liquid flow rate of the peristaltic pump was 86 78 68 and 60 ml min respectively but wouldn t affect the mb degradation based on the findings in section 3 1 1 as shown in fig 3 the concentration of mb decreased quickly with different air flow rates within 10 min of treatment more than 95 of dye was degraded within 5 min by all air flow rates tested which was mainly due to the effective and stable production of active species during the ehpd treatment 30 16 in fact a trial for mb degradation without air took more than 60 min to show near complete degradation with even higher power consumption the fact that all air flow rates achieved nearly 100 degradation rate clearly indicated that the addition of air flow in ehpd treatment substantially boosted the production of reactive species accounted for mb degradation however our results did not show significant difference in mb degradation efficiency among different air flow rates this was likely due to the sufficient active species that were produced even at the lowest air flow rate employed in this study to degrade mb at a relatively low initial concentration of 20 mg l as such the increase in air flow rate did not cause noticeable changes in mb removal rate however increasing the initial dye concentration appeared to influence the mb degradation efficiency under different air flow rates as smaller air flow rates showed lower degradation efficiencies which was reported by reddy et al 14 based on the results an optimal airflow rate of 3 l min was determined for the later evaluation on different mb concentration however it was observed that air flow rate beyond 3 l min sometimes caused fluctuations in the liquid flow or sparkling effect during the discharge potentially leading to a system shutdown it was thus suggested that the air flow rate should be kept around 2 l min to lower the treatment cost and ensure a satisfactory removal efficiency for mb concentration up to 100 mg l 3 1 3 effect of initial mb concentration fig 4 presented the effect of initial mb concentrations 10 20 50 and 100 mg l on mb degradation by plasma treatment with 68 ml min liquid flow rate and 3 l min airflow rate the 10 mg l initial concentration showed a 100 mb degradation efficiency after 6 min of treatment followed by 20 mg l 99 94 50 mg l 99 67 and 100 mg l 97 69 respectively within 10 min of treatment time it appeared that the initial mb concentration influenced the degradation rate by the ehpd process operated under the given parameters because the mb degradation efficiency at lower concentrations was slightly higher than that at higher concentrations similar phenomenon was observed and reported by various researchers that degradation efficiency decreased with increase in initial mb concentrations 14 31 in addition wu et al 27 studied the mb degradation by dielectric barrier discharge plasma treatment and also observed that mb degradation efficiency was higher at low mb concentrations and would decrease at higher mb concentrations because the amount of plasma active species formed in the discharge process was maintained at a specific concentration level for the constant energy input in this study since the results showed stably high mb degradation efficiency in a short period of time at all tested initial concentrations it could be concluded that the novel ehpd rector system was a highly effective process for mb degradation 3 2 mineralization of mb and water quality change during ehpd process to evaluate the mineralization rate and change of water quality during the ehpd treatment chemical oxygen demand cod as well as physicochemical attributes of the initial and treated solutions including h2o2 inorganic ions nitrate chloride and sulfate ph and electric conductivity were investigated figs 5 and 6 the measured cod concentration was adjusted based on the theoretical hydrogen peroxide interference to the cod measurement 470 6 mg of cod as o2 per 1000 mg h2o2 32 the cod in 100 mg l mb solution was determined as 357 5 mg l and decreased rapidly in the treatment process with liquid flow rate at 68 ml min and air flow rate at 3 l min at 5 min and 10 min the cod level reached down to 51 7 mg l and 26 7 mg l signified a cod removal of 85 5 and 92 5 respectively which should be approximately equivalent to the removal rate of organic matter and the mineralization rate the mb mineralization rate was slightly lower than the overall degradation efficiency of 98 7 which implied that smaller organic molecules from mb degradation still present in the treated solutions however the cod removal obtained in this study during 10 min treatment for 100 mg l initial mb concentration was much faster and higher compared to the results in literature of plasma alone and hybrid systems 14 12 16 27 another major change in the water quality observed with mb treatment is the production of h2o2 fig 5 h2o2 is a common stable compound attributed to the quenching of short lived o h radicals generated with plasma water wastewater treatment reported by a number of studies 33 34 9 in this study h2o2 concentration gradually increased with time and arrived 25 44 mg l at 1 min 66 18 mg l at 5 min and 89 16 mg l at 10 min thus high concentration of h2o2 shows that large amount of hydroxyl radicals generated with air ehpd are excessive and not consumed by the oxidation of mb and nitrogen active species produced with plasma discharge several major inorganic ions were detected in the treated mb solution due to mb mineralization and or plasma discharge changes in concentrations of chloride sulfate and nitrate were shown in fig 5 chloride and sulfate presented low concentrations which were produced with bond breaking of mb while nitrates showed a relatively high concentration of 43 76 mg l at 1 min 188 02 mg l at 5 min and 223 74 mg l at 10 min the elevation of nitrate concentration with treatment time was attributed to not only the mineralization of mb molecule but also the fixation of nitrogen in the gas source of air as the air contains 78 09 of nitrogen n2 20 95 of oxygen o2 35 no and no2 eq 3 4 5 6 7 could be produced from the air due to nitrogen atoms competing with the oxygen atoms these species can react with water molecules and produce no2 and no3 eq 8 no2 was not detected in our experiments possibly due to high oxidation capacity of 3 l min air activated ehpd that converted all nitrogen to its highest valence 3 e o 2 2 o e 4 e n 2 2 n e 5 n o no 6 o no no 2 7 no 2 h 2 o no 3 2h 8 oh no no 2 hno 2 hno 3 these formed ions also explained the increasing acidity in the solution for ph reduction and elevation for conductivity also observed by huang et al 30 and reddy et al 14 research on plasma activated water has reported similar results in nitrogen fixation effect by plasma discharge and the nitrate concentration in this study is the highest among different plasma processes these results indicated that the treated dye wastewater from the ehpd process could be potentially used as a fertilizer 36 39 if used for drinking water the concern of high nitrate concentration could be addressed by substituting the gas source of air with pure oxygen gas the initial ph and conductivity of mb solution at 10 100 mg l ranged in 5 3 4 9 and 5 0 36 7 μs cm 25 c respectively final ph values after 10 min ehpd treatment for all tested parameters for varying liquid flow rates air flow rates and initial mb concentration showed a big fall from the initial point but little variation among different operational conditions ranging from 2 5 to 2 7 apparently due to the acids production discussed earlier on the other hand the final conductivity leaped tremendously to 1000 1750 μs cm and showed a clear decreasing trend with increasing liquid flow rates also increased with higher air flow rate and higher initial mb concentration fig 6 a c this same phenomenon i e decrease in ph and increase in electrical conductivity was observed by many other researchers 31 40 for instance dobrin et al reported that after 15 min of pulsed corona discharge on mb degradation the ph was decreased to 3 2 and the conductivity was increased to 714 μs cm evidence from literature showed that ph and conductivity were strongly related to electrical discharges in liquid media 17 41 3 3 mb degradation kinetics degradation kinetics were investigated to further confirm the effect of different parameters on the mb degradation efficiency the degradation reaction process was fitted to a pseudo first order kinetics by eq 9 42 9 ln ct c 0 kt where ct was concentration of mb for a given treatment time c0 was the initial concentration and k was the first order rate constant min 1 respectively as shown in fig 7 a c the correlation coefficients were obtained using linear regression by plotting ln ct c0 kt at different liquid flow rates air flow rates and initial mb concentrations the correlation coefficients were above 0 98 for all the batch experiments clearly indicating that the first order kinetic model agreed with the experimental data on the mb degradation the results of the first order kinetic constant for degradation of mb at different operational parameters were presented in table 1 3 4 role of reactive species produced by ehpd for mb degradation operating at 20 mg l mb initial concentration under the optimal condition of liquid flow rate of 68 ml min and flow rate of 3 l min air the addition of radical scavengers ascorbic acid sodium nitrate and 2 propanol for aqueous electrons superoxide and hydroxyl radicals respectively to the system had shown different levels of decreases in mb degradation efficiency as compared to the scavenger free trials degradation kinetics were investigated as shown in the fig 8 to further confirm the effect of radical scavengers on the mb degradation efficiency with addition of nano3 the degradation rate constant was 0 4796 the mb degradation was affected during the first few minutes and caught up after that showed that the hydrated electrons played a minimal role in the ehpd process for mb degradation with 10 min treatment on the other hand with the addition of ascorbic acid the degradation rate constant was 0 4219 it showed that mb decreased slightly than that of nano3 indicating minimal involvement of the o2 species in mb degradation on the contrary the mb degradation rate was significantly affected by 2 propanol during the entire treatment with the degradation rate constant reduced to 0 1459 clearly indicating that production of oh radicals among different reactive species in the ehpd process played the major role for mb degradation 3 5 energy efficiency of the mb degradation by ehpd the energy yield g kwh was used to evaluate the energy efficiency of the ehpd reactor during the mb degradation process which was calculated using eq 2 at 50 degradation rate and the input power for all the three operational parameters table 2 based on the energy yield calculation for 50 mb degradation the highest energy yield was 0 27 g kwh at 68 ml min for air flow rate the highest energy yield was 0 27 g kwh at 2 l min and 3 l min and for the initial mb concentration the highest energy yield was 0 81 g kwh at 100 mg l it seemed that the energy yield decreased as the degradation efficiency and treatment time increased the calculated results were obviously in line with the experiments results which showed decreases in energy yield with the increase in treatment time for all the experiments the reason was due to the low collision probability between plasma reactive species and mb molecules 14 27 also the energy yield was proportional with the initial dye concentration because of more reactant molecules present in the solution influenced by the discharge 43 as the mb degradation efficiency increased with respect to the treatment time it led to a reduction in mb removal per unit of energy consumption over a longer treatment time to further investigate the efficiency of the novel electrohydraulic plasma discharge process a comparison was made between the ehpd in this study with other plasma treatment methods honestly it was sometimes difficult to make a comparison about the efficiency and performance among the plasma processes because of the different reactor types experimental conditions and the wide variety of pollutants used for degradation 12 therefore comparisons presented in this paper only focused on the performance of different nonthermal plasma reactors on mb degradation table 3 based on similar parameters such as degradation and energy efficiencies it could be concluded that the novel continuous flow ehpd process showed a faster degradation and relatively high energy efficiency compared to other nonthermal plasma reactor designs in the literature despite that a few methods reported a high energy yield those reactor designs were not considered better than the ehpd process due to much longer treatment time and or lower removal efficiency according to the data collected in table 3 besides the continuous flow ehpd provided flexibility and practicality in terms of potential development for mass treatment of wastewater 3 6 degradation mechanism of methylene blue by ehpd the possible degradation pathway of mb was studied using lc ms and the total ion chromatogram tic was shown in fig 9 the mb molecules at different treatment times were broken down because of the electric plasma discharge in the mb solution after the end of the treatment time 10 min the peaks of mb were not observed clearly indicating that it was completely degraded the retention time for initial mb started to decrease with the discharge and new peaks byproducts were formed at the shorter retention times the possible formation of intermediates and final products were detected by mass spectroscopy and the potential pathway was shown in fig 10 when mb was dissolved in water the mass spectroscopy observed an mb peak at m z 284 due to the cl being ionized and entering the detached state and the mb cation was isomerized into c6h18n3s 30 12 when mb was degraded by the plasma the presence of hydroxyl radicals oh decomposed mb molecules into different products such as azure b m z 270 azure a m z 256 azure c m z 242 and thionin m z 228 these products were formed mainly due to demethylation and hydroxylation from plasma and could further be reduced to aromatic ring compounds which later broke down to various fragments non aromatic compounds and reacted with other reactive species these intermediate products were eventually mineralized into inorganic compounds such as co2 h2o so4 2 and no3 46 30 47 16 27 many previous authors have suggested the similar possible pathway benetoli et al 46 proposed that mb degradation took place due to two main reaction pathways in the non thermal plasma reactor 1 high energy electron impact and 2 successive hydroxylation addition to the benzene ring of the mb molecule they also observed that demethylated mb molecules was blue shifted in the uv vis absorption peak at 664 nm huang et al 30 proposed an mb degradation mechanism based on the bond dissociation energy bde theory for the dielectric barrier discharge dbd reactor they suggested that it was easier for the chemical bonds to break with low bond dissociation energy they also detected phenyl thiophene during the discharge process at the peak intensity of m z 138 due to the production of ozone and hydroxyl radicals from the discharge the mb molecular structure was oxidized and ultimately transformed into inorganic ions such as co2 h2o so4 2 and no3 4 conclusions the results in this study concluded that the novel continuous flow electrohydraulic plasma ehpd reactor developed was a highly efficient method for treating dye wastewater a nearly complete degradation of methylene blue mb was achieved within 10 min of treatment time the optimum running liquid and air flow rates were 68 ml min and 3 l min showed complete degradation and a better energy efficiency y50 0 27 g kwh were achieved for the initial mb concentration of 20 mg l increasing initial mb concentrations could decrease degradation rates however almost 90 of mb was degraded after only 5 min of treatment even at 100 mg l decrease in ph and increase in conductivity in the solution were observed after 10 min ehpd treatment for all experimental cases mb degradation followed the first order kinetics and the energy yield at 50 conversion was ranging from 0 16 g kwh to 0 81 g kwh for different operating parameters the free radical scavenging experiment showed that hydroxyl radicals played a very important role in mb degradation demethylation and hydroxylation were the two main reactions found in degrading mb molecules in addition cod removal was 92 5 after 10 min treatment for 100 mg l initial mb concentration signaling high mineralization rate and major production of nitrate and hydrogen peroxide was found in the treated solution which could be potentially used as a green nitrogen fertilizer and disinfectant comparison with other plasma methods indicated that the novel continuous flow ehpd reactor examined in this study was a robust and highly efficient process for mb degradation and

13628,photoelectrocatalysis pec is an advanced oxidation water treatment technology which combines the strengths of both heterogeneous photocatalysis and anodic oxidation for the effective degradation of organic pollutants in water at the heart of this technology is the search for photocatalytic materials that exhibit excellent photo electro catalytic properties in this article we reviewed studies on wo3 one of the most promising photocatalysts for solar water treatment technology specific attention was paid to its properties synthesis preparation methods and strategies for improving its performance discussions were presented on some reports wherein the semiconductor and or its composites were used to catalyse the degradation of organic pollutants in water keywords tungsten trioxide photocatalyst photoanode organic pollutants water treatment 1 introduction organic contaminants are undoubtedly one major category of water pollutants which have been of serious concern to the global community owing to their potential debilitating effects on the health of humans and animals organic pollutants such as pharmaceuticals pesticides personal care products and other industrial chemicals have been detected in significant amounts in both surface water and groundwater across the globe 1 4 this is due to the fact that some of them are not readily biodegradable and thus persist in the environment sadly a number of these compounds have been implicated in a myriad of adverse biological effects for instance organic pollutants such as herbicides and pesticides have been reported to induce estrogenicity and toxicity in aquatic animals 5 in the same vein findings have linked human exposure to pesticides steroid hormones flame retardants personal care products etc to health issues such as cancers endocrine disruption reproductive problems oxidative stress and so on 6 10 unfortunately with ever increasing human population and the attendant expanding industrialisation generation of organic pollutants is bound to go up this implies that the amount of these pollutants which will find their way into the aquatic environments will increase as a result treatment technologies for their removal have received tremendous attention from research scientists engineers and other stakeholders in the fields of water purification this is justifiably so because conventional water treatment methods are often not very effective in removing them 11 the fact that many of these organic contaminants are still detected in significant amounts in treated water from wastewater treatment plants attests to this 12 many studies have been conducted and significant progress has been made with techniques such as reverse osmosis adsorption coagulation and flocculation advanced oxidation processes including fenton reaction homogeneous and heterogeneous photocatalysis advanced electrochemical oxidation photoelectrocatalytic oxidation 13 16 etc in particular heterogeneous photocatalysis has generated enormous research interest in the last few decades and tio2 was at the centre of many research activities in the early years heterogeneous photocatalysis has particularly been appealing as a technology for removing organic load from water and wastewater because of its capability to ensure the complete oxidative mineralisation of a wide range of organic compounds including the recalcitrant ones while the photoactivity of tio2 upon uv irradiation had been demonstrated much earlier 17 18 reports on the application of tio2 as photocatalyst for destruction of pollutants only began to surface in the late 1970s and 1980s 19 22 although a very chemically stable and highly photoactive semiconductor 23 tio2 is only excitable by ultraviolet uv light because of its large band gap energy of 3 2 ev 24 since uv light only constitutes a very small fraction about 4 of the solar light tio2 photocatalysis suffers a significant setback in terms of practical utilisation 24 in order to address this challenge many innovative ideas have been promoted these mostly include morphology engineering introduction of metallic and or non metallic impurities into the crystal lattice and preparation of heterostructured materials 25 28 in spite of these efforts narrow band gap semiconductors which exhibit excellent absorption in the visible region of the solar spectrum are being explored some of these semiconductors include bivo4 29 30 g c3n4 31 32 biobr 33 34 bioi 35 36 biocl 37 znfe2o4 38 40 β bi2o3 41 42 cu2o 43 44 wo3 45 46 and so on efforts are also being directed at preparing some other materials and or composites including doped sn3o4 heterostructured zntio3 w18o49 etc that can efficiently utilise broad range of solar energy 47 51 recently research on the application of photoelectrocatalytic pec process for the removal of organic pollutants has also been receiving much attention this technique combines the strengths of photocatalysis and anodic oxidation 52 it has an apparent advantage over heterogeneous photocatalysis in that the applied bias potential helps to reduce the recombination of photoexcited electron hole pairs which is a major drawback in photocatalytic degradation 53 54 the photoanodes for pec are fabricated with photoactive materials such as metal oxide semiconductors thus efforts are also made to improve their optical and electronic properties other than extending the lifespan of the photogenerated charge carriers the electric bias in pec can also lead to the direct oxidation of the organic molecules in the electrolyte via direct electron transfer 55 tungsten trioxide wo3 is one of the visible light active materials that have been explored to a large extent for water purification this review is aimed at discussing the relevant properties synthesis modification and application of wo3 and wo3 based photocatalysts for the removal of organic substances from water via heterogeneous photocatalysis and photoelectrocatalysis 2 tungsten trioxide wo3 nature properties and applications wo3 is an n type metal oxide semiconductor whose crystal structure is dependent on temperature 56 it occurs in five crystalline phases between 180 and 900 c monoclinic ii ε wo3 43 c triclinic δ wo3 43 to 17 c monoclinic i γ wo3 17 330 c orthorhombic β wo3 330 740 c and tetragonal α wo3 740 c 57 fig 1 shows the crystal phases of wo3 the γ phase exhibits the greatest stability at room temperature hence it is the most explored among the different phases 58 γ wo3 is an n type semiconductor with moderate band gap energy 2 4 2 8 ev 59 thus it shows considerably high optical absorption within the visible region of the solar spectrum the value of the band gap energy is composition dependent in the bulk semiconductor and size dependent in the nanocrystalline semiconductor for semiconductor nanocrystals with dimensions smaller than the size of the exciton electrostatically bound electron hole pair quantum confinement effect is observed and the band gap is often wider 60 61 generally the method and conditions of synthesis have effect on the structure and the size of wo3 and consequently on its optical and electronic properties γ wo3 is commonly employed for the fabrication of electrochromic devices materials owing to its high coloration efficiency 62 it is however used in a broad range of other applications including gas sensing 63 water splitting 64 energy storage 65 perovskite solar cells 66 hydrogen evolution reactions 67 photocatalytic disinfection 68 degradation of organic pollutants in water via photocatalysis and photoelectrocatalysis 45 69 70 amongst others the main characteristics of wo3 that made researchers to consider it a promising material for decomposition of organic contaminants in water include deep valence band 3 1 ev relatively high optical absorption within the visible range of the solar spectrum significant electron mobility 6 5 cm2 v s stability in low ph aqueous solutions low susceptibility to photocorrosion non toxicity and low cost 71 73 wo3 exhibits deep valence band and high oxidation power holes which are advantageous for visible light driven degradation of organics in water but its low conduction band level thus low electron reduction potential is a drawback for efficient light energy conversion 73 75 furthermore like many other metal oxide semiconductors the photoactivity of wo3 is hampered by the rapid recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes recombination as a result common approaches that have been reported for minimising this phenomenon and to improve the photocatalytic performance of other metal oxide semiconductors are also being explored for wo3 these include tailored synthesis to obtain morphologies with improved performance metal loading doping formation of composites with carbon nanomaterials formation of heterojunctions with other semiconducting materials 3 preparation of wo3 powder and films 3 1 synthesis and morphology of wo3 powder the preparation of wo3 powder has been achieved with synthesis methods such as sol gel hydrothermal solvothermal combustion and electrospinning the use of different salt precursors varying reaction conditions and the use of various structure directing agents sda have yielded a variety of morphologies with interesting and exciting physical characteristics particle morphologies such as sphere 76 77 plate 78 79 wire 80 81 rod 69 82 microtube 83 fiber 84 85 have been reported some of the electron images of these morphologies are shown in fig 2 in a study by adhikari et al 70 it was shown that rod like wo3 exhibited better photocatalytic performance than the pseudo spherical nanoparticles it is of note that both morphologies were obtained using the same precipitation method but the precursor salts were different the synthesis that produced the rod like morphology used a structure directing agent sda cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide ctab while no sda was used in the other synthesis sda such as diethylenetriamine 76 triton x 100 86 sodium chloride 69 87 sodium sulphate 88 etc have been employed in the preparation of wo3 of different shapes and sizes chen et al 89 also prepared different morphologies of wo3 sphere dendrite and dumbbells and observed that their photocatalytic performance was influenced by the shape of the particles the catalyst with spherically shaped particles was found to exhibit the highest activity in degrading organic pollutants as stated earlier the synthesis approach and the reaction conditions also play important roles in determining the morphology of the final product for instance separate studies by nagy et al 90 and ahmadian et al 91 revealed that the ph of the precursor solution had effect on the physical properties of the resulting wo3 zhang et al 92 also reported that different calcination temperatures yielded wo3 with distinct crystalline phases and morphologies and the phases exhibited different properties the cubic phase had flowery morphology while the monoclinic phase showed a mixture of nanosheets and nanospheres while the monoclinic phase exhibited impressive photocatalytic activity the cubic phase displayed no photocatalytic activity but showed high adsorption capacity for the pollutant methylene blue it is well known that the size dimension and the specific surface area of catalysts have significant effect on their activities 93 94 usually the particle size is inversely correlated to the specific surface area of a catalyst 95 and larger surface area is believed to contain more active sites for catalytic reactions 96 for degradation of organic pollutants photocatalysts with high surface area favour the adsorption of the organic molecules onto the surface of the catalyst and this is beneficial for their photocatalytic removal 97 99 but some studies have shown that catalysts that exhibit highest surface area do not necessarily display the best activity for the degradation of organic pollutants 97 100 also in an investigation by amano et al 101 it was observed that wo3 particles of smaller size and higher surface area exhibited less activity than wo3 particles of bigger size and lower surface area for water oxidation although the photocatalytic activity of the finer particles was found to be comparable to that of the bigger particles when both were applied for the decomposition of organic pollutants the improved performance was attributed to the adsorbed organic molecules which slowed the surface recombination of photogenerated electron hole pairs a fair comparison of the effects of morphological properties on the performance wo3 and catalysts generally is difficult because different chemical substances are often added to achieve the obtained morphologies as discussed earlier these chemicals do not only direct the growth of the catalyst particles they may also introduce impurities that often cause significant alteration in the electronic and optical properties of the catalysts 95 it is therefore worth noting that the overall performance of a photocatalyst is dependent on the interplay of a number of its physical properties shape size dimensions pore structures surface area etc and the contribution of any other material incorporated into its crystal lattice 102 also factors such as the degree of crystallinity and surface lattice defects have been indicated to play roles in charge carriers transport and consequently in the activity of photocatalysts 95 103 105 it is thus clear that the synthesis method precursor reagents structure directing agents or surfactants synthesis conditions and post synthesis treatment for wo3 powder must be carefully chosen and optimised to obtain catalyst which exhibit optimum photocatalytic activity 3 2 preparation wo3 based photoanodes the surface features of a photoelectrode is largely determined by the technique employed to prepare it and its photoelectrocatalytic performance is closely related to its surface characteristics a variety of techniques have been used to obtain the films of wo3 and of its composites on conductive substrates these preparation techniques include anodisation wet chemical synthesis and coating casting spray pyrolysis etc the two commonest methods in the literature are discussed below 3 2 1 anodisation the preparation of wo3 thin film electrodes by anodisation entails the application of voltage to a tungsten w foil sheet rod immersed in certain electrolyte for a period of time 106 the electrolytes commonly employed include acidic media with or without fluoride ions and a variety of other combinations 107 platinum or steel is often used as counter electrode 108 the w foil is usually thoroughly cleaned prior to the anodisation process to ensure that the resulting wo3 film is pure 109 the anodised w substrate is annealed under atmospheric oxygen to obtain the crystalline metal oxide film 110 fernández domene et al 111 reported the preparation wo3 photoanodes by anodisation of w rod in a mixture of sulphuric acid and fluoride ions under hydrodynamic conditions 0 2000 rpm using a rotating disk electrode configuration a nanoplate morphology was observed under almost all experimental conditions but varying the hydrodynamic conditions and electrolyte composition had effect on the dimensions of the films formed it was reported that the presence of fluoride ions in the electrolyte and the rotation of the electrode resulted in the formation of clusters of the nanoplates with high surface area it was thought that the rotation enhanced mass transfer towards the surface of the electrode the thickness of the wo3 film was found to be directly related to the rotation speed these two conditions were said to further enhance the dissolution of the w substrate in the absence of fluoride ions smaller and disordered nanoplates were formed fig 3 the photoelectrochemical properties of the clustered nanoplates were superior to those of the disordered nanoplates apart from fluoride ions oxidising agent such as hydrogen peroxide has also been included in the electrolyte for w anodisation for instance the presence of h2o2 in the electrolyte has been reported to lead to the formation of nanoplatelet nanosheet which form a spongy like layer on the surface of the w substrate again the wo3 film produced using an electrolyte with h2o2 gave a better photoresponse compared to the film obtained in electrolyte without h2o2 112 in a study by watcharenwong et al the effect of electrolyte composition on the morphology and photoresponse of wo3 layer was also examined 113 it was observed that the addition of polyethylene glycol and ethylene glycol to the electrolyte led to enhancement in the photoelectrochemical responses of the films also the impacts of including different acids in the electrolyte on the photoelectrochemical behaviours of wo3 films prepared by the anodisation of w have been investigated 114 sulphuric hydrochloric phosphoric and oxalic acids were included in the electrolyte it was observed that the film obtained using the electrolyte containing oxalic acid gave the lowest charge transfer resistance it has also been shown that the applied potential and length of time have effects on the morphology of the wo3 film produced by anodisation varying the anodisation potential and anodisation time could result in distinct morphological structures with different photocatalytic activities lai et al optimised these two parameters to prepare nanoporous layers of wo3 with high surface area and considerable photoelectrocatalytic activity 115 in a study by mohamed et al 116 two different morphologies of wo3 films nanoporous and nanoflakes were obtained by employing different anodisation conditions in the separate experiments to prepare the two morphologies the anodisation potential and duration of anodisation were the same while the composition of the electrolytes and the reaction temperature were varied the anodisation experiment carried out at room temperature and in which aqueous electrolyte containing h2so4 was used yielded the nanoporous film but when the temperature was changed to 40 c and hno3 was used nanoflake film was obtained the separate effects of the acid and temperature were not investigated in the study the nanoflake film displayed higher photocurrent density it is unclear if it would exhibit superior performance if employed for the decomposition of organic pollutants qi et al 117 also prepared wo3 film consisting three layers of distinct morphologies by varying the anodisation time the first layer being nanorods the second nanoparticles and the third and top layer rectangular nanoflake highest photocurrent response was observed for the triple layered film in comparison to the other two the superior performance of the tripled layered film cannot be attributed to the top most layer of nanoflakes but rather to the entire film there are limited studies where the photocatalytic activities of different morphologies of wo3 films obtained by anodisation for the degradation of organic pollutants are compared most studies focused on improving the morphological properties of the single morphology film 118 120 to obtain wo3 films via anodisation of w which exhibit high photoactivity and other characteristics which are beneficial for decontaminating water containing organic pollutants key parameters such as the electrolyte composition anodisation voltage and duration of anodisation must be thoughtfully selected and optimised 3 2 2 wet chemical synthesis and coating casting here the wo3 photoanode is prepared by coating the surface of a conductive substrate with the metal oxide the coating is usually achieved by dipping the conductive substrate in the dispersion or the precursor solution of the catalyst or by drop casting the dispersion on the surface of the substrate this is then followed by drying and annealing to obtain the crystalline film as discussed in section 3 1 w source the salt the reaction mixture i e components of precursor solution and reaction conditions all contribute to the characteristics and the photoelectrochemical performance of the wo3 film formed ye et al 121 prepared wo3 photoanode by dipping fluorine doped tin oxide fto glass into the precursor solution of the semiconductor after undergoing hydrothermal process and annealing in air the surface of the glass was coated with vertically aligned wo3 nanoplates fig 4 a the photoanode exhibited significant photocurrent density and was effective for degrading organic pollutants under visible light in a similar study liu et al also prepared a film of wo3 nanoplate array on fto fig 4 b for solar photoelectrocatalytic water decontamination 122 the fto was dipped in the precursor solution and the wo3 film was synthesised in a constant temperature water bath it is worth noting that both reports 121 122 used the same set of chemicals and obtained similar morphology despite using different synthesis approaches ammonium oxalate nh4 2c2o4 was used as capping agent in both works in another study zhou et al 123 prepared different morphological structures of wo3 films on fto by hydrothermal process hydrochloric acid was used as nucleating agent and varying its amount gave rise to the different morphologies observed fig 5 of all the morphologies the nanoplate demonstrated superior photoresponse and degradation efficiency and these were attributed to its higher surface area and more effective charge transfer adhikari et al 124 prepared a film of wo3 on indium tin oxide ito glass simply by dipping the glass into an ethanolic dispersion of the catalyst followed by drying in air oven the catalyst powder was previously prepared by hydrothermal process duration of the reaction had effect on the morphology adequate coverage of the glass surface by the catalyst was ensured by dipping the substrate in the dispersion a few times goulart et al 125 prepared wo3 photoanode by drop casting the sol of wo3 precursor on fto a few layers were successively cast and drying was done after each cast the electrode was finally calcined in air oven there are many other reports in which wo3 photoanodes were prepared by wet chemical synthesis and coating 110 126 129 it is worth mention that the catalyst film needs to adhere firmly to the surface of the conductive substrate and not delaminate easily otherwise the photoanode will not be suitable for water remediation the components of the precursor solution and the method of coating may influence the stability and durability of the film 4 modification of wo3 for improved photocatalytic efficiency as stated earlier wo3 is attractive as a visible light sensitive catalyst for water decontamination but its efficiency is significantly impeded because of the fast recombination of the photogenerated electrons and holes leading to reduced lifespan of the charge carriers while some morphologies may display high performance it is still important to carry out modification of the semiconductor to obtain a highly effective and efficient catalyst this explains why many works in the literature do not use pristine wo3 only for degradation studies 4 1 doping loading with metals in a bid to improve their performance both wo3 powder and films have been doped with metals it is believed that the presence of metal ions in the crystal structure of semiconductors alters their electronic structure the metals are thought to create centres in the crystal lattice of photocatalysts where the photogenerated electrons can be trapped and thus the lifetime of the carriers can be prolonged 130 131 some researchers however have suggested that these centres can actually promote recombination in some photocatalytic systems 132 134 nonetheless a large volume of experimental data suggest that metal doping loading generally lead to significant improvement in the performance of many photocatalysts including wo3 mehta et al 135 reported that loading the noble metal ru into the crystal structure of wo3 resulted in remarkable enhancement of the photoactivity of the catalyst the authors attributed the enhancement in the activity of the loaded catalyst to the presence of the noble metal which served to retard the recombination of the charge carriers similarly dhanalakshmi et al 136 observed that loading the noble metal ir into the structure of wo3 led to markedly improved photocatalytic degradation of the target pollutants crystal violet and methylene blue the improvement was also considered to result from the ability of the loaded metal to separate the electron hole pairs also mohite et al 137 observed that yb doped wo3 film showed superior photoelectrocatalytic performance compared to the pristine wo3 film a significant difference was recorded in the abatement of the chemical oxygen demand of the treated polluted water when the doped and the undoped photoanodes were used the use of plasmonic metals such as au and ag has also been experimented these metals exhibit local surface resonance effects which are advantageous for optical absorption and a phenomenon called plasmon induced charge separation both phenomena have been found to be beneficial for the enhancement of the photocatalytic performance of photocatalysts 138 140 gondal et al 141 reported that loading wo3 with ag enhanced the separation of photogenerated electron hole pairs and induced surface plasmon resonance which promotes the generation of charge carriers they recorded about three fold increase in the activity of the wo3 based photocatalyst for the degradation of the herbicide atrazine upon loading with just 1 of the noble metal in a study by choi et al 142 the presence of au in the crystal lattice of wo3 was found to minimise electron and hole recombination and to induce red shifting of the absorption edge to a longer wavelength the photodegradation of the target pollutant was improved by about 50 when the au loaded wo3 was used a red shift in absorption edge is often observed when photocatalysts are loaded with metals this enhances the excitation of photocatalysts by lower energy photons such as visible light 143 many other metals such as mn 144 ce 145 bi 146 co 147 fe 148 er 149 gd 149 cu 150 zn 150 eu 151 etc have been explored as dopants addition to improve the photocatalytic activity of wo3 for the destruction of organic pollutants however other than the general concept explained earlier in the section and the advantageous phenomenon observed with plasmonic metals there appears to be no clear understanding explanation in the literature on why wo3 performed better with a particular metal dopant why for instance did gd wo3 performed better than la wo3 as reported in 149 most of the reasons that have often been advanced for different catalytic activities observed when a photocatalyst is doped with different metals are not directly or indirectly related to characteristics peculiar to the metals 4 2 doping with or adding non metals attempts have been made to incorporate non metallic elements materials into the crystal lattice of wo3 to improve its optical and electronic properties in this respect carbon nanomaterials have been used mostly addition of carbon to photocatalysts have been reported to lead to band gap narrowing and have also been indicated to act as electron sink this implies that carbon materials can extend the light absorption capability of photocatalysts to higher wavelength lower energy and at the same time promote the separation of photogenerated charge carriers song et al 152 investigated the effect of adding carbon nanodots to wo3 on the photoelectrochemical properties and the photocatalytic performance of the composite electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and photocurrent measurements showed that the composite material exhibited remarkably reduced charge transfer resistance and enhanced photocurrent intensity compared to the pure wo3 fig 6 in the same trend the reaction rate constant calculated for the composite for the degradation of the selected pollutant was approximately 7 7 times higher than that of the pure wo3 the superior activity of the composite catalyst was ascribed to the enhanced light absorption capability and the effective separation of electron hole pairs imparted by the carbon nanodots in a study by zhu et al 153 a nanocomposite of reduced graphene oxide and wo3 displayed higher photocatalytic activity than the pristine wo3 the authors observed band gap narrowing improved optical absorption and reduced electron hole recombination upon addition of the carbon nanomaterial to wo3 prabhu et al 154 and hossain et al 155 in separate studies recorded similar observations when graphene was incorporated into wo3 films for photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants in a report by chen et al 156 a carbon dopant was introduced into interstitial position in the crystal of a hydrated wo3 the doping occasioned changes in the band structure and gave rise to lattice defects which had positive outcome on the photoactivity of the doped semiconductor also shahzad et al 157 reported that incorporation of activated carbon into wo3 structure led to band gap reduction and improved light sensitivity the optimised catalyst performed 40 better than the undoped wo3 in degrading paracetamol in separate works by isari et al 158 and zhu et al 159 it was shown that modification of wo3 by carbon nanotubes yielded photocatalysts which are very effective for degrading organic pollutants in water the authors of both reports also highlighted that the carbon nanotubes suppressed recombination of the charge carriers and enhanced the visible light absorption of the modified wo3 it is worth noting that the excellent conductivity and high adsorption capacity of many carbon nanomaterials make them very attractive as dopant addition to wo3 for better photocatalytic and photoelectrocatalytic performance non metals such as n s i and p have also been used to modify the electronic and optical properties of wo3 for improved photocatalytic performance the beneficial effects created by these dopants are similar to those of carbon nanomaterials huang et al 160 showed by experimental and theoretical investigations that doping wo3 with nitrogen resulted in improved band gap narrowing better visible light absorption and higher charge carriers separation fig 7 the reaction rate constant for the degradation of phenol was 4 6 times higher for the n doped wo3 than the undoped wo3 han et al 81 and chen et al 161 showed that doping wo3 with s enhanced its light harvesting capability and rendered it a better catalyst for the photodegradation of organic pollutants in another study by rettie et al 162 s and i were also doped into the crystal lattice of wo3 for improved visible light harvesting ability data from characterisation suggested that both non metals substituted for o in the metal oxide although other pathways such as interstistial incorporation and cation substitution were considered possible for i low concentration s doping was said to create a relatively shallow impurity state which promoted greater visible light absorption of the doped wo3 without any adverse effect on the intengrity of the crystal lattice on the other hand i doping at all concentrations created a deep impurity band in the crystal lattice of wo3 and the photocatalytic performance of the doped catalyst was negatively impacted in a report by sun et al 163 doping p into the crystal structure of wo3 was said to reduce the band gap energy of the photocatalyst from 2 40 to 2 33 ev and the photodegradation efficiency increased by more than four fold evidently there are very limited studies which have rigorously investigated the effects of doping wo3 with non metals discussed in the previous paragraph as a result more studies which consider detailed and extensive experimental data and theoretical computations are necessary to gain more insights into this area 4 3 forming heterostructured catalysts with other semiconductors a number of research and review articles have highlighted and discussed the merits of forming heterojunctions to circumvent the drawbacks of single photocatalysts 53 164 165 coupling two or more semiconductors to create heterojunctions s has particularly been noted to impede recombination of charge carriers a heterojunction is the interface that exists between two semiconductors whose band gaps are unequal and can result in band alignment 166 the advantageous alignment is one which occurs such that the movement of charge carriers within the heterostructured catalyst can extend the lifetime of the photoexcited holes and electrons depending on the type of the semiconductors which are coupled heterojunction such as p n between a p type semiconductor and an n type semiconductor n n between two n type semiconductors and p p between two p type semiconductors can be formed formation of double heterojunctions wherein three semiconductors are combined is also a possibility that has received some attention heterojunctions have also been grouped on the basis of the alignment of the band structures of the coupled semiconductors namely type i straddling type ii staggered and type iii broken in fig 8 diagrams showing heterojunction between two semiconductors and illustration of their band alignment is displayed the reader is referred to review articles by zhang et al 167 peleyeju et al 53 and arotiba et al 168 for information on charge transfer characteristics in each type of the heterojunctions the understanding of the direction of the internal electric field within a heterostructured photocatalyst is necessary to select semiconductors and prepare heterojunction catalysts in which separation of the photogenerated charge carriers is maximised wo3 has been coupled to different semiconducting materials to form heterostructured materials with better photocatalytic characteristics for water purification traditionally uv active metal oxide semiconductors such as tio2 zno and ceo2 have been combined with wo3 170 173 apart from the envisaged effective separation of electron hole pairs coupling these semiconductors with wo3 often leads to the enhancement of their ability to absorb visible light in the same vein visible light sensitive semiconductors such as bivo4 g c3n4 ag3po4 fe3o4 etc have also been coupled with wo3 with the primary purpose of minimising recombination of charge carriers 69 174 177 although other beneficial changes could result from the combination 5 degradation of organic pollutants in water using wo3 based catalysts via photocatalysis pc and photoelectrocatalysis pec as with other semiconducting photocatalysts when photons of suitable energy are incident on wo3 there is excitation of electrons from the valence band to the conduction band fig 9 the positive holes then oxidise water molecules to generate the high potential hydroxyl radicals which are known to attack organic molecules non selectively until they are mineralized 178 the holes are also powerful oxidants which can react with the organic molecules to decompose them the mechanism of generating the oxidants on wo3 thin film anode in photoelectrocatalytic pec process is essentially the same as in the ordinary photocatalytic process except that pec is an enhanced process as stated earlier the bias potential applied to the wo3 anode in pec drives away the photogenerated electrons via the external electrical circuit thereby prolonging the life span of the holes 52 179 availability of abundant holes promotes the generation of hydroxyl radicals and both the generated radicals and free positive holes can effectively degrade the organic molecules in solution in addition the use of electrical energy in pec can also lead to the direct oxidation of the pollutants as a result of electron abstraction from the molecules this direct electro oxidation renders pec more effective than the conventional pc in removing organic contaminants from water fig 10 is a typical pec cell in which the mechanisms by which oxidants are produced is demonstrated the cell is configured such that the photoanode faces the light source visible light fig 11 the electrical energy applied is usually small in magnitude in comparison to the values used in conventional anodic oxidation usually 2 v or its equivalent current density 179 181 in the last few years many research articles have been published on the utilisation of wo3 based powders and thin film electrodes for the destruction of a wide range of organic contaminants in water these photocatalysts have been found to be effective for removing pollutants such as textile dyes pharmaceuticals personal care products industrial chemicals and so on for instance ding et al 183 reported approximately 100 degradation of two dyes methyl orange mo and rhodamine b rhb at relatively short times using ag loaded wo3 nanorods under visible light the reaction time was particularly short for the cationic dye rhb the results show that decolourisation of textile wastewater can be easily achieved using the studied photocatalytic system similarly cristino et al also reported the degradation of the pharmaceuticals ketoprofen and levofloxacin using β25 modified wo3 photoanode at mild experimental conditions the pec system showed promise for the removal of the drugs from water in a recent study by yazdanbakhsh et al 184 the antibiotic sulfamethoxazole was completely degraded using mn wo3 in a photoreactor powered by led emitting diodes led the total organic carbon toc and the toxicity of the treated solution were drastically reduced wu et al 185 also employed ultrathin wo3 nanosheets for the photocatalytic degradation of the highly toxic herbicide metribuzin the herbicide was completely degraded in just 60 min using the catalyst calcined at 100 c under hydrogen for 3 h the work highlighted the positive effect of surface oxygen vacancy defects in wo3 on its performance for decomposing organic molecules table 1 shows the summary of many more works that have been conducted to remove organic pollutants from water using wo3 based materials experimental data have shown that engineered wo3 represents a very attractive photocatalyst for destroying unwanted and harmful organic compounds in water but it is clear from table 1 that combining it with a variety of other materials to harness the strengths of the individual components and the synergistic advantages of the composite may yield a visible light sensitive and highly performing catalyst it is of note that photoactive materials such as biox agx x cl br i bi2moo etc which are relatively new in photocatalytic water decontamination have been coupled with wo3 to produce photocatalysts photoanodes and very interesting results have been recorded as contained in table 1 also a wide range of organic compounds including dyes pharmaceuticals phenols herbicides insecticides and mycotoxins have been degraded using wo3 or wo3 based photocatalysts and significant successes have been reported the removal efficiencies have been mostly evaluated by uv vis spectroscopy or chromatographic spectroscopic techniques depending on the nature of the pollutants a few studies reported the use of total organic carbon toc analysis to evaluate the effectiveness of the treatment system it should be noted that toc analysis provides the best means of measuring abatement of organic load in water since it gives a good idea of the conversion of organic molecules to inorganic ions and co2 hence it is necessary that researchers carry out toc to determine the extent of mineralisation of the organics it is also important to investigate the intermediate products formed only a small fraction of the reported works did this a knowledge of the degradation by products is important to take decision on what to do with the treated water release into the environment or subject to further purification process it is not impossible to have some stable and toxic intermediates products in the treated water therefore carrying out toxicity studies on the water samples before and after treatment is pertinent this would give researchers more information on the effectiveness of the photocatalytic system if the stable intermediate compounds formed are non toxic and biodegradable then the treated water can be released into the environment rather than expending further resources on the treatment system to achieve complete mineralisation 6 conclusion and perspective several research works have shown that advanced oxidation processes aops are promising for removing organic load from water the journey to developing an effective efficient and sustainable aop water treatment reactor began decades ago many innovative ideas have been proposed for aops like heterogeneous photocatalysis and pec since the photocatalytic materials are at the core of these processes researchers have vigorously engaged in material science and engineering to prepare and study potential candidates for workable decontamination process one of the materials that have received considerable attention recently is wo3 this review has presented information on the use of this photocatalyst in heterogeneous photocatalysis and pec for decomposing organic pollutants in water the studies reviewed showed that this visible light sensitive catalyst holds huge promise for water treatment it is especially of interest that manipulating the optical and electronic characteristics of this catalyst can significantly enhance its performance in addition coupling it to other semiconductors has been reported to yield a heterostructured catalysts that offer synergistic benefits for practicable utilisation of wo3 for water treatment studies on different strategies of improving its photocatalytic performance are undoubtedly essential but attention also needs to be paid to producing stable and durable films for photoelectrocatalytic system and recyclable and reusable powders for heterogeneous photocatalytic process furthermore coupling the photo efficient and relatively abundant tio2 to wo3 may provide a photocatalyst that can be easily excited by low energy photons and serve as a powerful material for water purification there are comparatively few number studies on heterostructured photocatalysts containing wo3 and graphitic carbon nitride g c3n4 for degradation of organic pollutants the composite of the two materials should give a considerably effective and efficient photocatalyst that is suitable for real water treatment the semiconducting g c3n4 is well known for its visible light induced activity and high adsorption capacity characteristics which are relevant for developing an effective and sustainable remediation system for removing organics from aqueous media it is of interest that wo3 based photocatalysts have been indicated to hold potential for real application in photocatalytic fuel cell under solar light the use of the system for the dual purpose of simultaneously producing energy and removing organic waste from water is an incentive for extensive research of this material to solve energy and water pollution challenges declaration of competing interest the authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest 
13628,photoelectrocatalysis pec is an advanced oxidation water treatment technology which combines the strengths of both heterogeneous photocatalysis and anodic oxidation for the effective degradation of organic pollutants in water at the heart of this technology is the search for photocatalytic materials that exhibit excellent photo electro catalytic properties in this article we reviewed studies on wo3 one of the most promising photocatalysts for solar water treatment technology specific attention was paid to its properties synthesis preparation methods and strategies for improving its performance discussions were presented on some reports wherein the semiconductor and or its composites were used to catalyse the degradation of organic pollutants in water keywords tungsten trioxide photocatalyst photoanode organic pollutants water treatment 1 introduction organic contaminants are undoubtedly one major category of water pollutants which have been of serious concern to the global community owing to their potential debilitating effects on the health of humans and animals organic pollutants such as pharmaceuticals pesticides personal care products and other industrial chemicals have been detected in significant amounts in both surface water and groundwater across the globe 1 4 this is due to the fact that some of them are not readily biodegradable and thus persist in the environment sadly a number of these compounds have been implicated in a myriad of adverse biological effects for instance organic pollutants such as herbicides and pesticides have been reported to induce estrogenicity and toxicity in aquatic animals 5 in the same vein findings have linked human exposure to pesticides steroid hormones flame retardants personal care products etc to health issues such as cancers endocrine disruption reproductive problems oxidative stress and so on 6 10 unfortunately with ever increasing human population and the attendant expanding industrialisation generation of organic pollutants is bound to go up this implies that the amount of these pollutants which will find their way into the aquatic environments will increase as a result treatment technologies for their removal have received tremendous attention from research scientists engineers and other stakeholders in the fields of water purification this is justifiably so because conventional water treatment methods are often not very effective in removing them 11 the fact that many of these organic contaminants are still detected in significant amounts in treated water from wastewater treatment plants attests to this 12 many studies have been conducted and significant progress has been made with techniques such as reverse osmosis adsorption coagulation and flocculation advanced oxidation processes including fenton reaction homogeneous and heterogeneous photocatalysis advanced electrochemical oxidation photoelectrocatalytic oxidation 13 16 etc in particular heterogeneous photocatalysis has generated enormous research interest in the last few decades and tio2 was at the centre of many research activities in the early years heterogeneous photocatalysis has particularly been appealing as a technology for removing organic load from water and wastewater because of its capability to ensure the complete oxidative mineralisation of a wide range of organic compounds including the recalcitrant ones while the photoactivity of tio2 upon uv irradiation had been demonstrated much earlier 17 18 reports on the application of tio2 as photocatalyst for destruction of pollutants only began to surface in the late 1970s and 1980s 19 22 although a very chemically stable and highly photoactive semiconductor 23 tio2 is only excitable by ultraviolet uv light because of its large band gap energy of 3 2 ev 24 since uv light only constitutes a very small fraction about 4 of the solar light tio2 photocatalysis suffers a significant setback in terms of practical utilisation 24 in order to address this challenge many innovative ideas have been promoted these mostly include morphology engineering introduction of metallic and or non metallic impurities into the crystal lattice and preparation of heterostructured materials 25 28 in spite of these efforts narrow band gap semiconductors which exhibit excellent absorption in the visible region of the solar spectrum are being explored some of these semiconductors include bivo4 29 30 g c3n4 31 32 biobr 33 34 bioi 35 36 biocl 37 znfe2o4 38 40 β bi2o3 41 42 cu2o 43 44 wo3 45 46 and so on efforts are also being directed at preparing some other materials and or composites including doped sn3o4 heterostructured zntio3 w18o49 etc that can efficiently utilise broad range of solar energy 47 51 recently research on the application of photoelectrocatalytic pec process for the removal of organic pollutants has also been receiving much attention this technique combines the strengths of photocatalysis and anodic oxidation 52 it has an apparent advantage over heterogeneous photocatalysis in that the applied bias potential helps to reduce the recombination of photoexcited electron hole pairs which is a major drawback in photocatalytic degradation 53 54 the photoanodes for pec are fabricated with photoactive materials such as metal oxide semiconductors thus efforts are also made to improve their optical and electronic properties other than extending the lifespan of the photogenerated charge carriers the electric bias in pec can also lead to the direct oxidation of the organic molecules in the electrolyte via direct electron transfer 55 tungsten trioxide wo3 is one of the visible light active materials that have been explored to a large extent for water purification this review is aimed at discussing the relevant properties synthesis modification and application of wo3 and wo3 based photocatalysts for the removal of organic substances from water via heterogeneous photocatalysis and photoelectrocatalysis 2 tungsten trioxide wo3 nature properties and applications wo3 is an n type metal oxide semiconductor whose crystal structure is dependent on temperature 56 it occurs in five crystalline phases between 180 and 900 c monoclinic ii ε wo3 43 c triclinic δ wo3 43 to 17 c monoclinic i γ wo3 17 330 c orthorhombic β wo3 330 740 c and tetragonal α wo3 740 c 57 fig 1 shows the crystal phases of wo3 the γ phase exhibits the greatest stability at room temperature hence it is the most explored among the different phases 58 γ wo3 is an n type semiconductor with moderate band gap energy 2 4 2 8 ev 59 thus it shows considerably high optical absorption within the visible region of the solar spectrum the value of the band gap energy is composition dependent in the bulk semiconductor and size dependent in the nanocrystalline semiconductor for semiconductor nanocrystals with dimensions smaller than the size of the exciton electrostatically bound electron hole pair quantum confinement effect is observed and the band gap is often wider 60 61 generally the method and conditions of synthesis have effect on the structure and the size of wo3 and consequently on its optical and electronic properties γ wo3 is commonly employed for the fabrication of electrochromic devices materials owing to its high coloration efficiency 62 it is however used in a broad range of other applications including gas sensing 63 water splitting 64 energy storage 65 perovskite solar cells 66 hydrogen evolution reactions 67 photocatalytic disinfection 68 degradation of organic pollutants in water via photocatalysis and photoelectrocatalysis 45 69 70 amongst others the main characteristics of wo3 that made researchers to consider it a promising material for decomposition of organic contaminants in water include deep valence band 3 1 ev relatively high optical absorption within the visible range of the solar spectrum significant electron mobility 6 5 cm2 v s stability in low ph aqueous solutions low susceptibility to photocorrosion non toxicity and low cost 71 73 wo3 exhibits deep valence band and high oxidation power holes which are advantageous for visible light driven degradation of organics in water but its low conduction band level thus low electron reduction potential is a drawback for efficient light energy conversion 73 75 furthermore like many other metal oxide semiconductors the photoactivity of wo3 is hampered by the rapid recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes recombination as a result common approaches that have been reported for minimising this phenomenon and to improve the photocatalytic performance of other metal oxide semiconductors are also being explored for wo3 these include tailored synthesis to obtain morphologies with improved performance metal loading doping formation of composites with carbon nanomaterials formation of heterojunctions with other semiconducting materials 3 preparation of wo3 powder and films 3 1 synthesis and morphology of wo3 powder the preparation of wo3 powder has been achieved with synthesis methods such as sol gel hydrothermal solvothermal combustion and electrospinning the use of different salt precursors varying reaction conditions and the use of various structure directing agents sda have yielded a variety of morphologies with interesting and exciting physical characteristics particle morphologies such as sphere 76 77 plate 78 79 wire 80 81 rod 69 82 microtube 83 fiber 84 85 have been reported some of the electron images of these morphologies are shown in fig 2 in a study by adhikari et al 70 it was shown that rod like wo3 exhibited better photocatalytic performance than the pseudo spherical nanoparticles it is of note that both morphologies were obtained using the same precipitation method but the precursor salts were different the synthesis that produced the rod like morphology used a structure directing agent sda cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide ctab while no sda was used in the other synthesis sda such as diethylenetriamine 76 triton x 100 86 sodium chloride 69 87 sodium sulphate 88 etc have been employed in the preparation of wo3 of different shapes and sizes chen et al 89 also prepared different morphologies of wo3 sphere dendrite and dumbbells and observed that their photocatalytic performance was influenced by the shape of the particles the catalyst with spherically shaped particles was found to exhibit the highest activity in degrading organic pollutants as stated earlier the synthesis approach and the reaction conditions also play important roles in determining the morphology of the final product for instance separate studies by nagy et al 90 and ahmadian et al 91 revealed that the ph of the precursor solution had effect on the physical properties of the resulting wo3 zhang et al 92 also reported that different calcination temperatures yielded wo3 with distinct crystalline phases and morphologies and the phases exhibited different properties the cubic phase had flowery morphology while the monoclinic phase showed a mixture of nanosheets and nanospheres while the monoclinic phase exhibited impressive photocatalytic activity the cubic phase displayed no photocatalytic activity but showed high adsorption capacity for the pollutant methylene blue it is well known that the size dimension and the specific surface area of catalysts have significant effect on their activities 93 94 usually the particle size is inversely correlated to the specific surface area of a catalyst 95 and larger surface area is believed to contain more active sites for catalytic reactions 96 for degradation of organic pollutants photocatalysts with high surface area favour the adsorption of the organic molecules onto the surface of the catalyst and this is beneficial for their photocatalytic removal 97 99 but some studies have shown that catalysts that exhibit highest surface area do not necessarily display the best activity for the degradation of organic pollutants 97 100 also in an investigation by amano et al 101 it was observed that wo3 particles of smaller size and higher surface area exhibited less activity than wo3 particles of bigger size and lower surface area for water oxidation although the photocatalytic activity of the finer particles was found to be comparable to that of the bigger particles when both were applied for the decomposition of organic pollutants the improved performance was attributed to the adsorbed organic molecules which slowed the surface recombination of photogenerated electron hole pairs a fair comparison of the effects of morphological properties on the performance wo3 and catalysts generally is difficult because different chemical substances are often added to achieve the obtained morphologies as discussed earlier these chemicals do not only direct the growth of the catalyst particles they may also introduce impurities that often cause significant alteration in the electronic and optical properties of the catalysts 95 it is therefore worth noting that the overall performance of a photocatalyst is dependent on the interplay of a number of its physical properties shape size dimensions pore structures surface area etc and the contribution of any other material incorporated into its crystal lattice 102 also factors such as the degree of crystallinity and surface lattice defects have been indicated to play roles in charge carriers transport and consequently in the activity of photocatalysts 95 103 105 it is thus clear that the synthesis method precursor reagents structure directing agents or surfactants synthesis conditions and post synthesis treatment for wo3 powder must be carefully chosen and optimised to obtain catalyst which exhibit optimum photocatalytic activity 3 2 preparation wo3 based photoanodes the surface features of a photoelectrode is largely determined by the technique employed to prepare it and its photoelectrocatalytic performance is closely related to its surface characteristics a variety of techniques have been used to obtain the films of wo3 and of its composites on conductive substrates these preparation techniques include anodisation wet chemical synthesis and coating casting spray pyrolysis etc the two commonest methods in the literature are discussed below 3 2 1 anodisation the preparation of wo3 thin film electrodes by anodisation entails the application of voltage to a tungsten w foil sheet rod immersed in certain electrolyte for a period of time 106 the electrolytes commonly employed include acidic media with or without fluoride ions and a variety of other combinations 107 platinum or steel is often used as counter electrode 108 the w foil is usually thoroughly cleaned prior to the anodisation process to ensure that the resulting wo3 film is pure 109 the anodised w substrate is annealed under atmospheric oxygen to obtain the crystalline metal oxide film 110 fernández domene et al 111 reported the preparation wo3 photoanodes by anodisation of w rod in a mixture of sulphuric acid and fluoride ions under hydrodynamic conditions 0 2000 rpm using a rotating disk electrode configuration a nanoplate morphology was observed under almost all experimental conditions but varying the hydrodynamic conditions and electrolyte composition had effect on the dimensions of the films formed it was reported that the presence of fluoride ions in the electrolyte and the rotation of the electrode resulted in the formation of clusters of the nanoplates with high surface area it was thought that the rotation enhanced mass transfer towards the surface of the electrode the thickness of the wo3 film was found to be directly related to the rotation speed these two conditions were said to further enhance the dissolution of the w substrate in the absence of fluoride ions smaller and disordered nanoplates were formed fig 3 the photoelectrochemical properties of the clustered nanoplates were superior to those of the disordered nanoplates apart from fluoride ions oxidising agent such as hydrogen peroxide has also been included in the electrolyte for w anodisation for instance the presence of h2o2 in the electrolyte has been reported to lead to the formation of nanoplatelet nanosheet which form a spongy like layer on the surface of the w substrate again the wo3 film produced using an electrolyte with h2o2 gave a better photoresponse compared to the film obtained in electrolyte without h2o2 112 in a study by watcharenwong et al the effect of electrolyte composition on the morphology and photoresponse of wo3 layer was also examined 113 it was observed that the addition of polyethylene glycol and ethylene glycol to the electrolyte led to enhancement in the photoelectrochemical responses of the films also the impacts of including different acids in the electrolyte on the photoelectrochemical behaviours of wo3 films prepared by the anodisation of w have been investigated 114 sulphuric hydrochloric phosphoric and oxalic acids were included in the electrolyte it was observed that the film obtained using the electrolyte containing oxalic acid gave the lowest charge transfer resistance it has also been shown that the applied potential and length of time have effects on the morphology of the wo3 film produced by anodisation varying the anodisation potential and anodisation time could result in distinct morphological structures with different photocatalytic activities lai et al optimised these two parameters to prepare nanoporous layers of wo3 with high surface area and considerable photoelectrocatalytic activity 115 in a study by mohamed et al 116 two different morphologies of wo3 films nanoporous and nanoflakes were obtained by employing different anodisation conditions in the separate experiments to prepare the two morphologies the anodisation potential and duration of anodisation were the same while the composition of the electrolytes and the reaction temperature were varied the anodisation experiment carried out at room temperature and in which aqueous electrolyte containing h2so4 was used yielded the nanoporous film but when the temperature was changed to 40 c and hno3 was used nanoflake film was obtained the separate effects of the acid and temperature were not investigated in the study the nanoflake film displayed higher photocurrent density it is unclear if it would exhibit superior performance if employed for the decomposition of organic pollutants qi et al 117 also prepared wo3 film consisting three layers of distinct morphologies by varying the anodisation time the first layer being nanorods the second nanoparticles and the third and top layer rectangular nanoflake highest photocurrent response was observed for the triple layered film in comparison to the other two the superior performance of the tripled layered film cannot be attributed to the top most layer of nanoflakes but rather to the entire film there are limited studies where the photocatalytic activities of different morphologies of wo3 films obtained by anodisation for the degradation of organic pollutants are compared most studies focused on improving the morphological properties of the single morphology film 118 120 to obtain wo3 films via anodisation of w which exhibit high photoactivity and other characteristics which are beneficial for decontaminating water containing organic pollutants key parameters such as the electrolyte composition anodisation voltage and duration of anodisation must be thoughtfully selected and optimised 3 2 2 wet chemical synthesis and coating casting here the wo3 photoanode is prepared by coating the surface of a conductive substrate with the metal oxide the coating is usually achieved by dipping the conductive substrate in the dispersion or the precursor solution of the catalyst or by drop casting the dispersion on the surface of the substrate this is then followed by drying and annealing to obtain the crystalline film as discussed in section 3 1 w source the salt the reaction mixture i e components of precursor solution and reaction conditions all contribute to the characteristics and the photoelectrochemical performance of the wo3 film formed ye et al 121 prepared wo3 photoanode by dipping fluorine doped tin oxide fto glass into the precursor solution of the semiconductor after undergoing hydrothermal process and annealing in air the surface of the glass was coated with vertically aligned wo3 nanoplates fig 4 a the photoanode exhibited significant photocurrent density and was effective for degrading organic pollutants under visible light in a similar study liu et al also prepared a film of wo3 nanoplate array on fto fig 4 b for solar photoelectrocatalytic water decontamination 122 the fto was dipped in the precursor solution and the wo3 film was synthesised in a constant temperature water bath it is worth noting that both reports 121 122 used the same set of chemicals and obtained similar morphology despite using different synthesis approaches ammonium oxalate nh4 2c2o4 was used as capping agent in both works in another study zhou et al 123 prepared different morphological structures of wo3 films on fto by hydrothermal process hydrochloric acid was used as nucleating agent and varying its amount gave rise to the different morphologies observed fig 5 of all the morphologies the nanoplate demonstrated superior photoresponse and degradation efficiency and these were attributed to its higher surface area and more effective charge transfer adhikari et al 124 prepared a film of wo3 on indium tin oxide ito glass simply by dipping the glass into an ethanolic dispersion of the catalyst followed by drying in air oven the catalyst powder was previously prepared by hydrothermal process duration of the reaction had effect on the morphology adequate coverage of the glass surface by the catalyst was ensured by dipping the substrate in the dispersion a few times goulart et al 125 prepared wo3 photoanode by drop casting the sol of wo3 precursor on fto a few layers were successively cast and drying was done after each cast the electrode was finally calcined in air oven there are many other reports in which wo3 photoanodes were prepared by wet chemical synthesis and coating 110 126 129 it is worth mention that the catalyst film needs to adhere firmly to the surface of the conductive substrate and not delaminate easily otherwise the photoanode will not be suitable for water remediation the components of the precursor solution and the method of coating may influence the stability and durability of the film 4 modification of wo3 for improved photocatalytic efficiency as stated earlier wo3 is attractive as a visible light sensitive catalyst for water decontamination but its efficiency is significantly impeded because of the fast recombination of the photogenerated electrons and holes leading to reduced lifespan of the charge carriers while some morphologies may display high performance it is still important to carry out modification of the semiconductor to obtain a highly effective and efficient catalyst this explains why many works in the literature do not use pristine wo3 only for degradation studies 4 1 doping loading with metals in a bid to improve their performance both wo3 powder and films have been doped with metals it is believed that the presence of metal ions in the crystal structure of semiconductors alters their electronic structure the metals are thought to create centres in the crystal lattice of photocatalysts where the photogenerated electrons can be trapped and thus the lifetime of the carriers can be prolonged 130 131 some researchers however have suggested that these centres can actually promote recombination in some photocatalytic systems 132 134 nonetheless a large volume of experimental data suggest that metal doping loading generally lead to significant improvement in the performance of many photocatalysts including wo3 mehta et al 135 reported that loading the noble metal ru into the crystal structure of wo3 resulted in remarkable enhancement of the photoactivity of the catalyst the authors attributed the enhancement in the activity of the loaded catalyst to the presence of the noble metal which served to retard the recombination of the charge carriers similarly dhanalakshmi et al 136 observed that loading the noble metal ir into the structure of wo3 led to markedly improved photocatalytic degradation of the target pollutants crystal violet and methylene blue the improvement was also considered to result from the ability of the loaded metal to separate the electron hole pairs also mohite et al 137 observed that yb doped wo3 film showed superior photoelectrocatalytic performance compared to the pristine wo3 film a significant difference was recorded in the abatement of the chemical oxygen demand of the treated polluted water when the doped and the undoped photoanodes were used the use of plasmonic metals such as au and ag has also been experimented these metals exhibit local surface resonance effects which are advantageous for optical absorption and a phenomenon called plasmon induced charge separation both phenomena have been found to be beneficial for the enhancement of the photocatalytic performance of photocatalysts 138 140 gondal et al 141 reported that loading wo3 with ag enhanced the separation of photogenerated electron hole pairs and induced surface plasmon resonance which promotes the generation of charge carriers they recorded about three fold increase in the activity of the wo3 based photocatalyst for the degradation of the herbicide atrazine upon loading with just 1 of the noble metal in a study by choi et al 142 the presence of au in the crystal lattice of wo3 was found to minimise electron and hole recombination and to induce red shifting of the absorption edge to a longer wavelength the photodegradation of the target pollutant was improved by about 50 when the au loaded wo3 was used a red shift in absorption edge is often observed when photocatalysts are loaded with metals this enhances the excitation of photocatalysts by lower energy photons such as visible light 143 many other metals such as mn 144 ce 145 bi 146 co 147 fe 148 er 149 gd 149 cu 150 zn 150 eu 151 etc have been explored as dopants addition to improve the photocatalytic activity of wo3 for the destruction of organic pollutants however other than the general concept explained earlier in the section and the advantageous phenomenon observed with plasmonic metals there appears to be no clear understanding explanation in the literature on why wo3 performed better with a particular metal dopant why for instance did gd wo3 performed better than la wo3 as reported in 149 most of the reasons that have often been advanced for different catalytic activities observed when a photocatalyst is doped with different metals are not directly or indirectly related to characteristics peculiar to the metals 4 2 doping with or adding non metals attempts have been made to incorporate non metallic elements materials into the crystal lattice of wo3 to improve its optical and electronic properties in this respect carbon nanomaterials have been used mostly addition of carbon to photocatalysts have been reported to lead to band gap narrowing and have also been indicated to act as electron sink this implies that carbon materials can extend the light absorption capability of photocatalysts to higher wavelength lower energy and at the same time promote the separation of photogenerated charge carriers song et al 152 investigated the effect of adding carbon nanodots to wo3 on the photoelectrochemical properties and the photocatalytic performance of the composite electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and photocurrent measurements showed that the composite material exhibited remarkably reduced charge transfer resistance and enhanced photocurrent intensity compared to the pure wo3 fig 6 in the same trend the reaction rate constant calculated for the composite for the degradation of the selected pollutant was approximately 7 7 times higher than that of the pure wo3 the superior activity of the composite catalyst was ascribed to the enhanced light absorption capability and the effective separation of electron hole pairs imparted by the carbon nanodots in a study by zhu et al 153 a nanocomposite of reduced graphene oxide and wo3 displayed higher photocatalytic activity than the pristine wo3 the authors observed band gap narrowing improved optical absorption and reduced electron hole recombination upon addition of the carbon nanomaterial to wo3 prabhu et al 154 and hossain et al 155 in separate studies recorded similar observations when graphene was incorporated into wo3 films for photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants in a report by chen et al 156 a carbon dopant was introduced into interstitial position in the crystal of a hydrated wo3 the doping occasioned changes in the band structure and gave rise to lattice defects which had positive outcome on the photoactivity of the doped semiconductor also shahzad et al 157 reported that incorporation of activated carbon into wo3 structure led to band gap reduction and improved light sensitivity the optimised catalyst performed 40 better than the undoped wo3 in degrading paracetamol in separate works by isari et al 158 and zhu et al 159 it was shown that modification of wo3 by carbon nanotubes yielded photocatalysts which are very effective for degrading organic pollutants in water the authors of both reports also highlighted that the carbon nanotubes suppressed recombination of the charge carriers and enhanced the visible light absorption of the modified wo3 it is worth noting that the excellent conductivity and high adsorption capacity of many carbon nanomaterials make them very attractive as dopant addition to wo3 for better photocatalytic and photoelectrocatalytic performance non metals such as n s i and p have also been used to modify the electronic and optical properties of wo3 for improved photocatalytic performance the beneficial effects created by these dopants are similar to those of carbon nanomaterials huang et al 160 showed by experimental and theoretical investigations that doping wo3 with nitrogen resulted in improved band gap narrowing better visible light absorption and higher charge carriers separation fig 7 the reaction rate constant for the degradation of phenol was 4 6 times higher for the n doped wo3 than the undoped wo3 han et al 81 and chen et al 161 showed that doping wo3 with s enhanced its light harvesting capability and rendered it a better catalyst for the photodegradation of organic pollutants in another study by rettie et al 162 s and i were also doped into the crystal lattice of wo3 for improved visible light harvesting ability data from characterisation suggested that both non metals substituted for o in the metal oxide although other pathways such as interstistial incorporation and cation substitution were considered possible for i low concentration s doping was said to create a relatively shallow impurity state which promoted greater visible light absorption of the doped wo3 without any adverse effect on the intengrity of the crystal lattice on the other hand i doping at all concentrations created a deep impurity band in the crystal lattice of wo3 and the photocatalytic performance of the doped catalyst was negatively impacted in a report by sun et al 163 doping p into the crystal structure of wo3 was said to reduce the band gap energy of the photocatalyst from 2 40 to 2 33 ev and the photodegradation efficiency increased by more than four fold evidently there are very limited studies which have rigorously investigated the effects of doping wo3 with non metals discussed in the previous paragraph as a result more studies which consider detailed and extensive experimental data and theoretical computations are necessary to gain more insights into this area 4 3 forming heterostructured catalysts with other semiconductors a number of research and review articles have highlighted and discussed the merits of forming heterojunctions to circumvent the drawbacks of single photocatalysts 53 164 165 coupling two or more semiconductors to create heterojunctions s has particularly been noted to impede recombination of charge carriers a heterojunction is the interface that exists between two semiconductors whose band gaps are unequal and can result in band alignment 166 the advantageous alignment is one which occurs such that the movement of charge carriers within the heterostructured catalyst can extend the lifetime of the photoexcited holes and electrons depending on the type of the semiconductors which are coupled heterojunction such as p n between a p type semiconductor and an n type semiconductor n n between two n type semiconductors and p p between two p type semiconductors can be formed formation of double heterojunctions wherein three semiconductors are combined is also a possibility that has received some attention heterojunctions have also been grouped on the basis of the alignment of the band structures of the coupled semiconductors namely type i straddling type ii staggered and type iii broken in fig 8 diagrams showing heterojunction between two semiconductors and illustration of their band alignment is displayed the reader is referred to review articles by zhang et al 167 peleyeju et al 53 and arotiba et al 168 for information on charge transfer characteristics in each type of the heterojunctions the understanding of the direction of the internal electric field within a heterostructured photocatalyst is necessary to select semiconductors and prepare heterojunction catalysts in which separation of the photogenerated charge carriers is maximised wo3 has been coupled to different semiconducting materials to form heterostructured materials with better photocatalytic characteristics for water purification traditionally uv active metal oxide semiconductors such as tio2 zno and ceo2 have been combined with wo3 170 173 apart from the envisaged effective separation of electron hole pairs coupling these semiconductors with wo3 often leads to the enhancement of their ability to absorb visible light in the same vein visible light sensitive semiconductors such as bivo4 g c3n4 ag3po4 fe3o4 etc have also been coupled with wo3 with the primary purpose of minimising recombination of charge carriers 69 174 177 although other beneficial changes could result from the combination 5 degradation of organic pollutants in water using wo3 based catalysts via photocatalysis pc and photoelectrocatalysis pec as with other semiconducting photocatalysts when photons of suitable energy are incident on wo3 there is excitation of electrons from the valence band to the conduction band fig 9 the positive holes then oxidise water molecules to generate the high potential hydroxyl radicals which are known to attack organic molecules non selectively until they are mineralized 178 the holes are also powerful oxidants which can react with the organic molecules to decompose them the mechanism of generating the oxidants on wo3 thin film anode in photoelectrocatalytic pec process is essentially the same as in the ordinary photocatalytic process except that pec is an enhanced process as stated earlier the bias potential applied to the wo3 anode in pec drives away the photogenerated electrons via the external electrical circuit thereby prolonging the life span of the holes 52 179 availability of abundant holes promotes the generation of hydroxyl radicals and both the generated radicals and free positive holes can effectively degrade the organic molecules in solution in addition the use of electrical energy in pec can also lead to the direct oxidation of the pollutants as a result of electron abstraction from the molecules this direct electro oxidation renders pec more effective than the conventional pc in removing organic contaminants from water fig 10 is a typical pec cell in which the mechanisms by which oxidants are produced is demonstrated the cell is configured such that the photoanode faces the light source visible light fig 11 the electrical energy applied is usually small in magnitude in comparison to the values used in conventional anodic oxidation usually 2 v or its equivalent current density 179 181 in the last few years many research articles have been published on the utilisation of wo3 based powders and thin film electrodes for the destruction of a wide range of organic contaminants in water these photocatalysts have been found to be effective for removing pollutants such as textile dyes pharmaceuticals personal care products industrial chemicals and so on for instance ding et al 183 reported approximately 100 degradation of two dyes methyl orange mo and rhodamine b rhb at relatively short times using ag loaded wo3 nanorods under visible light the reaction time was particularly short for the cationic dye rhb the results show that decolourisation of textile wastewater can be easily achieved using the studied photocatalytic system similarly cristino et al also reported the degradation of the pharmaceuticals ketoprofen and levofloxacin using β25 modified wo3 photoanode at mild experimental conditions the pec system showed promise for the removal of the drugs from water in a recent study by yazdanbakhsh et al 184 the antibiotic sulfamethoxazole was completely degraded using mn wo3 in a photoreactor powered by led emitting diodes led the total organic carbon toc and the toxicity of the treated solution were drastically reduced wu et al 185 also employed ultrathin wo3 nanosheets for the photocatalytic degradation of the highly toxic herbicide metribuzin the herbicide was completely degraded in just 60 min using the catalyst calcined at 100 c under hydrogen for 3 h the work highlighted the positive effect of surface oxygen vacancy defects in wo3 on its performance for decomposing organic molecules table 1 shows the summary of many more works that have been conducted to remove organic pollutants from water using wo3 based materials experimental data have shown that engineered wo3 represents a very attractive photocatalyst for destroying unwanted and harmful organic compounds in water but it is clear from table 1 that combining it with a variety of other materials to harness the strengths of the individual components and the synergistic advantages of the composite may yield a visible light sensitive and highly performing catalyst it is of note that photoactive materials such as biox agx x cl br i bi2moo etc which are relatively new in photocatalytic water decontamination have been coupled with wo3 to produce photocatalysts photoanodes and very interesting results have been recorded as contained in table 1 also a wide range of organic compounds including dyes pharmaceuticals phenols herbicides insecticides and mycotoxins have been degraded using wo3 or wo3 based photocatalysts and significant successes have been reported the removal efficiencies have been mostly evaluated by uv vis spectroscopy or chromatographic spectroscopic techniques depending on the nature of the pollutants a few studies reported the use of total organic carbon toc analysis to evaluate the effectiveness of the treatment system it should be noted that toc analysis provides the best means of measuring abatement of organic load in water since it gives a good idea of the conversion of organic molecules to inorganic ions and co2 hence it is necessary that researchers carry out toc to determine the extent of mineralisation of the organics it is also important to investigate the intermediate products formed only a small fraction of the reported works did this a knowledge of the degradation by products is important to take decision on what to do with the treated water release into the environment or subject to further purification process it is not impossible to have some stable and toxic intermediates products in the treated water therefore carrying out toxicity studies on the water samples before and after treatment is pertinent this would give researchers more information on the effectiveness of the photocatalytic system if the stable intermediate compounds formed are non toxic and biodegradable then the treated water can be released into the environment rather than expending further resources on the treatment system to achieve complete mineralisation 6 conclusion and perspective several research works have shown that advanced oxidation processes aops are promising for removing organic load from water the journey to developing an effective efficient and sustainable aop water treatment reactor began decades ago many innovative ideas have been proposed for aops like heterogeneous photocatalysis and pec since the photocatalytic materials are at the core of these processes researchers have vigorously engaged in material science and engineering to prepare and study potential candidates for workable decontamination process one of the materials that have received considerable attention recently is wo3 this review has presented information on the use of this photocatalyst in heterogeneous photocatalysis and pec for decomposing organic pollutants in water the studies reviewed showed that this visible light sensitive catalyst holds huge promise for water treatment it is especially of interest that manipulating the optical and electronic characteristics of this catalyst can significantly enhance its performance in addition coupling it to other semiconductors has been reported to yield a heterostructured catalysts that offer synergistic benefits for practicable utilisation of wo3 for water treatment studies on different strategies of improving its photocatalytic performance are undoubtedly essential but attention also needs to be paid to producing stable and durable films for photoelectrocatalytic system and recyclable and reusable powders for heterogeneous photocatalytic process furthermore coupling the photo efficient and relatively abundant tio2 to wo3 may provide a photocatalyst that can be easily excited by low energy photons and serve as a powerful material for water purification there are comparatively few number studies on heterostructured photocatalysts containing wo3 and graphitic carbon nitride g c3n4 for degradation of organic pollutants the composite of the two materials should give a considerably effective and efficient photocatalyst that is suitable for real water treatment the semiconducting g c3n4 is well known for its visible light induced activity and high adsorption capacity characteristics which are relevant for developing an effective and sustainable remediation system for removing organics from aqueous media it is of interest that wo3 based photocatalysts have been indicated to hold potential for real application in photocatalytic fuel cell under solar light the use of the system for the dual purpose of simultaneously producing energy and removing organic waste from water is an incentive for extensive research of this material to solve energy and water pollution challenges declaration of competing interest the authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest 
13629,this work evaluated the granulation process and the stability of aerobic granular sludge in a pilot scale reactor 1 m³ during a long term operation 650 days treating real low strength domestic wastewater two operational strategies distinguished by volumetric exchange ratio ver 50 and 75 were tested enabling higher organic loading rates different topics involving wastewater biological treatment was evaluated from physical chemical and kinetic parameters to molecular biology techniques since process variability can only be described in statistical terms multivariate statistical process control was applied to verify and integrate the results found successful granulation in terms of settling properties sludge volumetric index svi30 70 ml gtss l 1 and svi30 svi5 0 70 and granules fraction 80 were achieved when applying ver 75 multivariate analysis supported that an increment in ver from 50 to 75 is an important strategy for ags stability especially during rainy periods where the carbon availability is lower olr 0 4 kgscod m 3 d 1 carbon compounds were mainly removed during anaerobic feeding phase however the presence of particulate matter led to hydrolysis in the aerated phase nitrification was observed in both strategies nitrospira spp was predominant under lower ver whereas nitrosomonas spp overcame increasing ver although partial denitrification and low phosphorus removal were achieved under both strategies these factors could be target by controlling the excess of do in aeration phase and improving the availability of readily organic substrate in feeding phase keywords granular sludge stability low strength wastewater volumetric exchange ratio organic loading rate multivariate statistical process control 1 introduction wastewater treatment using aerobic granular sludge ags technology has attracted attention in the last years being an alternative for the usual conventional activated sludge cas self immobilized microbial aggregates allow better sludge water separation overcoming the main issue of sludge bulking in cas system the excellent biomass settling properties also permit to dispense secondary settlers cutting off 80 the footprint required in cas systems 1 the technology was first developed in netherlands and has more recently been applied in developing countries such as brazil in this way some concerns related to wastewater characteristics and climate conditions still need attention to achieve success in the operation systems 2 3 despite of several plants are in operation distributed worldwide treating domestic and industrial wastewater there are still challenging issues and limitations holding technology applications 4 the main difficulty is directly linked to the instability of the granules and the loss of biological activity mainly in the treatment of low strength wastewaters 4 seed sludge 3 carbon source 5 organic loading rate olr 6 7 production of extracellular polymeric substances eps 8 food microorganisms f m ratio 9 and feast famine balance and starvation time 10 were reported as the limiting factors to achieve granules stability many cas plants can operate fairly well under low organic loads but in ags systems is required a minimum olr since low olr seems to be linked to granules disintegration 6 7 the authors suggested a minimum influent chemical oxygen demand cod of 200 mg l 1 and an olr of 0 6 kg m 3 d 1 to enable aerobic granules integrity although the recently studies undoubtedly advanced our comprehension about how olr influences the aerobic granule formation some limitations are also displayed for example synthetic wastewater has been adopted as feeding stock 11 12 however it seldom represents the complex composition of real domestic wastewater in addition to load variations 11 13 the time in which the granules remain intact and healthy in a wastewater treatment system is still unpredictable 4 regarding the operation time the extension is another limitation since the most studies presented long term around 100 days of operation 13 which could lead to incomplete interpretations since previous studies have reported disintegration after this period 100 days of operation 3 14 15 furthermore findings in literature are mostly conducted in lab or pilot scale reactors less than 10 l 3 6 7 12 13 which also may be an unfavorable situation considering that any adversity of real conditions could impact the system quickly although ags full scale wastewater treatment plants are currently designed to be operated with fill draw mode i e the treated effluent is pushed and discharged at the reactor top while the raw wastewater enters from its bottom there are still limited studies about this mode of operation 1 11 13 16 when using low strength wastewater in ags cultivation few studies proposed different strategies to increase olr sguanci et al 17 suggested an increment in the olr dosing acetate in the municipal wastewater however it is not economically practicable for full scale sewage treatment plants the strategy to mix low strength domestic sewage with industrial wastewater to increase the olr as presented by pronk et al 1 is not feasible in most of the cases another possibility suggested by these authors was to apply cycles of 3 h in rainy seasons diluted sewage and cycles of 6 5 h in dry seasons more concentrated sewage however influents with high nutrients concentrations may not have the expected removal producing effluent with low quality besides the longer cycle time could lead to a lower treatment capacity in this context the present work aimed a long term evaluation 650 days of the granulation process and stability of ags in a reactor 1 0 m³ operated with fill draw mode treating domestic wastewater two volumetric exchanged ratios ver were tested 50 and 75 in order to compare the influence of olr in the biomass characteristics properties and activity through system performance and bacterial selection the novelty of this work arises from the combination and integrated discussion covering the different topics involving wastewater biological treatment and thus ags system from physical chemical and kinetic parameters to molecular biology techniques furthermore multivariate statistical process control as pca models combined with hotelling t2 control chart was used to evaluate the system stability and detect non random behavior since variability can only be described in statistical terms 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental set up a pilot scale sequencing batch rector sbr with working volume of 1 m³ 0 95 m of diameter and 1 42 m of height was operated under fill draw mode constant volume and fed with domestic wastewater collected directly from municipal sewer system of florianópolis santa

bubbles passed through five diffusers at the bottom of the reactor with a flow rate of 238 l min 1 resulting in a superficial air velocity of 0 56 cm s 1 a programmable logic controller plc was used to automate pumps valves and cycle length the system was operated without control of dissolved oxygen do ph and temperature the experimental period was divided in two operational strategies os 1 and os 2 with different volumetric exchange ratios ver 50 and 75 modified through feeding flow rate figure s1 appendix a supplementary data the system was not inoculated and it was monitored during 339 days for each strategy at the end of the first strategy the reactor was totally drained and the second strategy was started up in os 1 the reactor worked with 50 of ver corresponding to a wastewater up flow velocity of 0 48 m h 1 in os 2 the ver was increased to 75 0 69 m h 1 in order to increment the organic load expecting to achieve a greater conversion capacity and better granular biomass stability 7 18 table 1 summarizes the experimental conditions and wastewater characteristics during os 1 and os 2 2 2 analytical methods 2 2 1 sludge characterization the biomass concentration was evaluated in terms of volatile suspended solids vss 19 the samples were weekly collected at the end of the aerobic phase particle size distributions were obtained by sieving method 20 sludge volume

visualized by an optical microscopy olympus bx40 japan and an electron microscopy energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy sem edx jeol jsm 6390lv japan the eps present in sludge were extracted on a weekly basis under alkaline conditions ph 10 and high temperature 30 min at 80 c followed by sonication 5 min at 55 khz 23 the polysaccharides ps content in eps were determined as glucose equivalent using phenol sulfuric method 24 whereas the protein pn fraction was measured as bovine albumin equivalent according to lowry s method 25 the polyhydroxybutyrate phb analysis were performed according to the methodology proposed by karr et al 26 which is based on measuring crotonic acid formed by acid catalyzed elimination during chemical depolymerization of phb after the acid extraction procedure the samples were diluted in h2so4 5 mm 1 3 proportion and filtered on a cellulose acetate filter 0 45 μm followed by injection on the hplc shimadzu lc 20at japan the analytical column used was the ionic exclusion aminex hpx 87h 300 mm x 7 8 mm d i x9 8 μm from bio rad 2 2 2 wastewater characterization periodic analysis on weekly basis of total suspended solids tss carbon bod cod total and ammonia nitrogen tn nh4 n and total phosphorus tp were performed in order to monitor the reactor performance 19 the anions no2 n no3 n and po4 3 p were measured by ion chromatography dionex corporation usa dissolved oxygen do ph and temperature were measured with a multi parameters probe ysi pro plus free ammonia fa was determined as described by anthonisen et al 27 biomass specific rates for nutrient removal are detailed in appendix a supplementary data five characterizations of the microbial activities during sbr cycle were conducted in each strategy to evaluate substrate conversion in terms of carbon the samples were thus collected every 10 30 min for cod analysis and 30 60 min for phb quantification 2 2 3 microbial community high throughput 16s rrna gene sequencing was conducted by illumina miseq platform to study microbial communities in both strategies the samples were collected at the end of the aeration phase primer set 341f 5 cctacgggnggcwgcag 3 805r 5 ggactachvgggtwtctaat 3 was used to amplify dna extracted by the powersoil dna isolation kit mobio laboratories inc usa the sequences were analysed using the neoprospecta microbiome technologies s library the libraries were sequenced using the miseq sequencing system illumina inc usa and v2 kit with 300 cycles and single end sequencing all the reads were individually submitted to a quality filter based on the sum of the dna bases probabilities errors allowing a maximum of 1 of accumulated errors subsequently the dna sequences corresponding to the illumina adapters were removed the resulting sequences that presented 100 identity were clustered and used for taxonomic identification using silva database fish analysis was carried out to observe the occurrence of ammonium oxidizing bacteria aob nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob and denitrifiers among the general bacterial community of the aerobic granules 28 mixed liquor samples were collected and fixed with 4 w v paraformaldehyde on weekly basis granules were selected from the mixed liquor and also fixed monthly after the fixation step granules were embedded in tissue tek o c t and 20 μm thick granule sections were cut using a cryostat cm 1850 leica germany at 40 c on day 136th and 107th of os 1 and os 2 respectively which corresponded to complete granulation in the strategies samples of mixed liquor and granules slices were target by oligonucleotides probes as described in table s1 appendix a supplementary data 2 3 data analysis multivariate statistical process control mspc techniques were applied to detect abnormal behaviour and out of control schemes using the software statistica 7 0 statsoft inc at first principal component analysis pca was performed in a dataset formed by 37 cases in each strategy in addition hotelling t2 control charts were set up to detect multivariate outliers mean shifts and other distributional deviations from the in control scheme upper control limits ucl were determined using 95 confidential levels for t2 limits calculations 29 further out of control schemes were detailed through t2 decomposition 30 the chosen key variables were volatile suspend solids vss svi30 svi5 ratio svi sludge bed height in the reactor bed particulate polr and soluble solr organic loading rates specific anaerobic anqs and aerobic aeqs cod removal rates observed biomass specific growth rate grow and particle fractions with diameter above 212 μm d 212 normal distribution was checked by kolmogorov smirnov test in order to ensure the applicability of statistical hypotheses testing throughout the study 3 results and discussion 3 1 increment on volumetric exchange ratio long term effects in biomass characteristics during the first month under both operational strategies the biomass growth showed the same increasing pattern reaching higher concentrations under os 1 3 5 g vss l 1 fig 1 a after this period strategies had distinct biomass evolution keeping an average of 1 2 0 2 g vss l 1 after 160 days up to the end of experimental period in os 1 the biomass concentration in os 2 showed lesser biomass loss 20 days but still have not reached a substantial biomass accumulation in almost one year of operation keeping a mean value of 0 8 0 2 g vss l 1 fig 1b this could be ascribed to the kinetics parameters that will be better discuss in section 3 2 svi showed lower values under os 2 achieving svi30 of 73 23 ml g 1 tss and svi5 of 130 48 ml g 1 tss while os 1 had svi30 and svi5 of 97 39 and 180 104 ml g 1 tss respectively fig 1a and 1b the svi30 svi5 ratio has been presented as an indicator of granulation in aerobic granular sludge systems 31 32 therefore the full granulation was achieved during os 1 and os 2 after 136 and 92 days of operation respectively when svi30 svi5 reached 0 9 after 150 days the sludge showed variations in settling ability in both strategies for the os 1 this variability was more pronounced rising svi5 and svi30 to approximately 500 and 200 ml g 1 tss while in os 2 the svi was kept lower around 250 and 150 ml g 1 tss respectively in general both strategies presented similar behavior of sludge settling ability overtime but they showed a crucial difference when biomass concentration is compared in the periods where better svi values were achieved after the instability os 2 could recover biomass accumulation with good settling properties up to 300 days and less variability while os 1 has not showed low svi values accompanied by high biomass amount after this disturbance regarding the particle size distribution a rapid formation 20 days of particles with diameter above 212 μm was observed in os 1 fig 1c however this granules size was kept during the first 40 days and after the 47th day an abrupt decline was observed in which a considerable sludge fraction 75 remained below 212 μm until 200 days of operation time afterwards approximately 50 of particles showed diameter above 212 μm with majority diameter between 212 and 300 μm reaching 85 at the end of this experimental period differently of os 1 under os 2 the particles size increased progressively during 107 days fig 1d achieving 83 of sludge fraction with aggregates diameter above 212 μm after this period fluctuations in granules size was observed up to the end of operational time the sludge size fractions have oscillated between 40 and 70 of particles with diameter above 212 μm being the highest fraction between 300 and 600 μm as a result of higher ver table 1 larger granules were found in os 2 supported by the increased substrate availability driven by the olr change 33 34 gao et al 33 reported that increasing the organic load from 0 45 to 1 5 kg cod m 3 d 1 led to granules with 1 mm of diameter similarly jungles et al 34 described that the olr increment enhanced the formation of aerobic granules which appeared after 6 days with average of 3 5 mm the morphology of biomass aggregates fig 2 had shown differences between the os 1 and os 2 although the aggregates size was greater in os 2 than os 1 the granules showed irregular surfaces finger type structures fig 2e previous studies suggested that the presence of particles in wastewater results in filamentous organisms growth on granules 35 36 indeed about 50 of total olr was composed by particulate matter especially during os 2 which it was almost twice higher than os 1 table 1 according to martins et al 37 the filamentous outgrowth presented higher velocity than floc forming bacteria since they have unidirectional growth instead of in three directions sem analysis documented stalked ciliate colonies mostly represented by epistylis sp fig 2h in the granules structure which contributed to their irregular shape observed in os 2 the presence of protozoa ciliates have been reported in aerobic granules cultivated with real wastewater 1 28 which are primarily responsible for small organic particle uptake 21 as well as small flocs in order to complement the granular sludge composition characteristics the protein pn and polysaccharides ps fractions were quantified proteins pn were the predominant component with a doubling amount when compared to polysaccharides ps quantities under both strategies figure s4 appendix a supplementary data the results showed an average of 228 33 mg pn g 1vss and 97 19 mg ps g 1vss in os 1 while 289 57 mg pn g 1vss and 124 31 mg ps g 1vss in os 2 according to tu et al 38 eps becomes more hydrophobic throughout the granulation process due to the hydrophobic proteins involved in aggregating and densifying the granules contributing to formation and stability from non cellular protein nucleus 39 40 on the other hand the high amount of polysaccharides can lead to an increase in the structural stability and physical strength of the granules 41 in this way the higher quantities of pn and ps in the sludge under os 2 can be correlated with the higher stability found in this strategy 8 3 2 microbial activities and kinetics parameters in order to follow the carbon conversions and understand the heterotrophic metabolism cycles were monitored in terms of cod and phb when granulation was completed in both strategies two representative examples of the substrate profile observed during the operational cycles of both strategies are presented in fig 3 the cycles shown in fig 3a and 3b correspond the 136th and 107th days of operation in os 1 and in os 2 respectively while the 269th day in os 1 and 318th day in os 2 appear in fig 3c and 3d slow and static filling was applied in order to promote the particulate organic matter hydrolysis and anaerobic consumption of soluble cod in both strategies 11 under os 1 partial cod consumption about 70 of total removal occurred in the feeding phase and the remainder cod was consumed within the first 30 min of aeration phase fig 3a and 3c differently as shown in fig 3b and 3d 98 of cod was consumed in the anaerobic filling phase in os 2 however during the subsequent phase aeration for os 2 scod peaks are observed suggesting the hydrolysis of particulate matter and subsequent release of soluble compounds to the liquid fraction followed by aerobic consumption phb production simultaneously with cod uptake could be observed in both strategies reaching around 4 mg g 1tss at the end of feeding phase while during aeration phase the phb was consumed up to approximately 1 mg g 1tss the kinetic parameters were calculated based on the measurements after start up period ie between 40 and 339 days of experimental period in both operational strategies table 2 these parameters provided information about cell s evolution the intrinsic organism s characteristics and the existing environmental conditions 42 the food to microorganism f m ratio provides information about the substrate availability 43 which was twice higher in os 2 0 76 kg scod kg 1 vss d 1 than in os 1 0 33 kg scod kg 1 vss d 1 table 2 a high f m ratio would enhance microbial growth and could be an essential parameter for granules size control 44 in connection to biomass kinetics parameters the half saturation constant k s also provides information between substrate availability and growth rate according to lineweaver burke linearization the observed value k sobs was higher for os 1 72 mg l 1 than for os 2 47 mg l 1 figure s5 appendix a supplementary data the r² obtained from linearization represented 50 of data both correlation coefficients showed significant variation ascribed to influent characteristics table 1 and biomass composition variabilities as well as model inaccuracies 45 this clearly shows that the substrate and bacterial can have a significant effect on the determination of the biokinetic coefficients the lower k s value the higher affinity of the biomass to the substrate resulting in higher growth rates at low substrate conditions 46 47 the observed biomass specific growth rate μ obs has shown greater values in os 2 0 08 d 1 than os 1 0 06 d 1 however the biomass specific decay rate k d was two fold higher for os 2 0 07 d 1 than os 1 0 03 d 1 corroborating the low biomass accumulation in os 2 despite of the most cod have been consumed during the feeding phase in os 2 the contact time between the wastewater and the biomass was not enough to achieve full cod uptake 4 mgphb g 1vss the subsequent phase comprising 240 min of aeration under low substrate level may have resulted in endogenous respiration as it was also observed by guimarães et al 2 in ags systems according to hao et al 48 under starvation regime bacteria oxidize their own cells to provide energy for maintenance under these circumstances observed here a negative growth of biomass could be observed along with consumption of electron acceptors mainly oxygen the kinetics cycles findings in os 2 confirmed cod release fig 3b and 3d all over the aeration phase suggesting lysis of the particles which could explain the lower biomass accumulation under this strategy unlikely os 1 os 2 could be characterized by predation process as well due to large numbers of protozoa colonies fixed on the granule surfaces which is also related to biomass loss the increment on ver from 50 to 75 increased the volumetric removal for carbon nitrogen and phosphorus in os 2 table 2 during os 1 the biomass specific rates of cod q scod anaerobic q scod aerobic nh4 q nh4 and tp q tp were 0 13 g scod d 1 g 1 vss 0 050 g nh4 n d 1 g 1 vss and 0 003 g tp d 1 g 1 vss respectively while they were 0 37 g scod d 1 g 1 vss 0 129 g nh4 n d 1 g 1 vss and 0 005 g tp d 1 g 1 vss in os 2 respectively similar values of 0 10 0 18 g nh4 n d 1 g 1 vss and 0 005 0 008 g tp d 1 g 1 vss were obtained previously for a pilot sbr reactor operated with variable volume and fed with real low strength wastewater 2 however the authors reported higher values for biomass specific rate of scod 0 51 0 58 g scod d 1 g 1 vss overall despite of the lower solids accumulation in os 2 the biomass showed to be quite active in the conditions applied and with high affinity to the available substrate which reached approximately 40 higher conversion capacity than os 1 3 3 influent and effluent characteristics although the real domestic wastewater showed high fluctuations over time it presented similar characteristics applied in both strategies table 1 the final effluent quality and removal efficiencies were summarized in table 3 high carbon removal efficiencies 70 were achieved in both strategies the organic matter and ammonium effluents concentrations were in accordance with brazilian national law 49 under both strategies annual averages obtained in os 1 were 48 and 27 mg l 1 in terms of cod and bod5 whereas 54 and 38 mg l 1 in os 2 the ammonium oxidation was quite similar under os 1 and os 2 although during os 2 the solids concentration and sludge retention time srt 13 7 d were lower than during os 1 23 16 d the system was able to maintain high ammonium removal close to 80 with an average effluent concentration of 9 mg l 1 however the free ammonium fa formation was more pronounced under os 2 reaching 1 2 0 2 mg l 1 whereas 0 8 0 1 mg l 1 was detected in os 1 despite of favorable conditions alternating anaerobic aerobic phases for denitrification process and slow growing heterotrophic organisms total nitrogen removal and phosphate release uptake was not evident during the entire period table 3 average removal efficiencies were approximately 30 for total nitrogen and 25 for total phosphorus in both operational strategies simultaneous nitrification denitrification snd was not achieved even the denitrification during feeding phase was minimal with biomass specific nox consumption rate of 0 004 g nox n d 1 g 1 vss in both strategies table 2 it may happen due to the high do concentration in bulk liquid once the system worked without do control according to layer et al 16 snd cannot be achieved with ags treating low strength municipal wastewater if a constant and high do is maintained during the aeration phase even with greater particles size and full granulation thus do saturation level during aeration was favorable for nitrification but prevented simultaneous denitrification the presence of electron acceptors o2 and nox in the bulk of feeding phase remained from previous cycle could also contribute the low phosphorus removal nitrogen compounds are usually considered to have an adverse effect on phosphorus removing capacity of biological wastewater treatment 50 since this could reduce the amount of substrate available for phosphorus accumulating organisms pao and hence causes the reduction of phosphorus release 51 despite of the c p ratio obtained around 30 gscod g 1 po4 3 p constituted a good basis for pao selection and most readily biodegradable cod was removed in feeding phase 52 the domestic wastewater had only a small portion of volatile fatty acids vfa 15 which have presented challenges in other studies as well 2 53 in addition the contact time between biomass and substrate os 1 26 10 min and os 2 10 2 min was not enough to hydrolysis the particulate matter to allowed vfa production 2 in this way the small cod storage in phb form can be correlated with other slow growing organism but not paos 3 4 microbial ecology structural analyses of microbial community were performed along both strategies fig 4 besides the high fluctuations of the microbial communities there were differences among organisms when the two strategies are compared suggesting that different operational conditions applied were able to select dissimilar microbial populations fig 4a during the first weeks of os 1 the microbial community was dominated by microorganisms representative of municipal wastewater and common in start up period of aerobic granular systems 8 such as genera commamonas acinetobacter and zooglea members of commamodaceae 31 day 5 rhodocyclaceae 20 day 20 and moraxellaceae 12 day 20 families respectively saprospiraceae was also observed with high abundance during the star up period 20th day with 13 of os 1 but was gradually reducing along operational time on the other hand this family was selected by conditions applied in os 2 achieving 34 of relative abundance the conditions applied under os 1 favoured members from caulobacteraceae chitinophagaceae and xanthomonadaceae families while os 2 presented with more abundance rhodobacteraceae day 185 9 flavobacteriaceae day 339 10 and saprospiraceae day 185 34 these abundant populations could be related to eps metabolic pathways 54 specially saprospiraceae and flavobacteriaceae have been proposed as eps producers in granular sludge systems 8 55 therefore the greater eps production in os 2 could be linked with these organisms members of chitinophagaceae family were detected in both strategies increasing their relative abundance from 5 in the first weeks to 17 in the end of operations times this family have been reported to hydrolyze several substrates 56 which could be a crucial hydrolyzing population in the present systems treating complex and large carbon chains compounds of domestic wastewater overall the most populations detected by sequencing analysis were fast growing ordinary heterotrophic organisms oho with aerobic metabolism under both strategies these organisms are supposed to form eps matrices that could embed micro colonies of slower growing populations as polyphosphate pao glycogen accumulating organisms gao and autotrophic nitrifies 57 by fluorescence in situ hybridization fish technique ammonium oxidation to nitrite during os 1 apparently occurred by another metabolic pathway which did not involve aob represented by nitrosomonadaceae family since these organisms were not detected in this first strategy nevertheless an expressive number of nitrospiraspp agglomerate could be seen in the outer layer of the granule as shown in fig 4b in light blue color in dna sequencing the nitrospiraceae family was detected with less than 0 3 relative abundance in os 1 on the other hand comammodaceae was detected 31 in start up period and around 20 all over the strategy which has already been reported as known heterotrophic nitrifier 58 in addition daims et al 59 showed that nitrospiraspp encodes both the pathways for ammonia and nitrite oxidation which are concomitantly expressed during growth by ammonia oxidation to nitrate under os 2 the spatial distribution in granule slice exhibited greater aob and less nitrospiraspp colonies fig 4c this fact may be related to free ammonia fa which concentration reached 1 2 0 2 mg fa l 1 as presented in section 3 3 the formation of fa results in partial nitrification concentrations between 0 1 and 1 0 mg l 1 inhibit nob activity in this case represented by nitrospiraspp whereas aob are only inhibited at much higher concentrations of 10 150 famg l 1 27 nitrite accumulation prior to nitrate formation have been detected in granulation start ups correlating with the sequential development of aob and nob 57 colonies of nitrobacterspp and pseudomonasspp were found in os 1 and os 2 fig 4d and 4e in mixed liquor however the nitrobacterspp clusters were more pronounced in os 1 with several colonies detected and distributed in the sample fig 4d corroborating the nitrate accumulation along this period table 3 during os 2 the denitrification process was not evident however a greater number of pseudomonasspp clusters was detected in this strategy fig 4e 3 5 multivariate analysis multivariate statistical process control mspc were applied to evaluate the variability and detect non random behavior in both operational strategies principal components analysis pca reduced the dimensionality into 3 significant principal components pcs explaining 67 of the total variance in os 1 38 17 and 12 for pc1 pc2 and pc3 respectively whereas they accounted 65 in os 2 29 23 and 13 for pc1 pc2 and pc3 respectively loadings factors presented in table s2 of appendix a supplementary data since each variable is assigned to any loading factor results can be interpreted as correlations between the variables and each pc 60 the scores and loadings biplots of the first 2 pcs were used to visualize the combined behavior of significant variables that affected both operational strategies fig 5 under os 1 the pc1 clustered the dataset into two groups fig 5a at the beginning red circles scores greater values of sludge bed height in the reactor bed vss and particulate organic loading rate polr described the startup period thereafter the subset formed by squares scores represented greater values of specific anaerobic removal rate anqs and biomass specific growth rate grow this pattern suggested a contrasting behavior between operational conditions and biomass characteristics fig 5c scores were quite projected over positive and negative sides of the pc2 where data from the end of the experiment scores 25 37 were grouped mostly on the positive side revealing the reactor worked with higher soluble organic loading rates which improved the biomass granulation a faster start up was depicted under os 2 since the red scores were more grouped in the modelled space fig 5b besides scores 15 29 presented vss and bed values higher than their averages although the reactor worked with low polr and solr in this period the biomass concentration was not affected high vss and bed values fig 5d low deviation was observed thereafter indicating that the os 2 provided a more homogeneous reactor operation and performance when compared to os 1 pca outcomes supported that during the instability period the olr played an important role the destabilization period was characterized by a decrease in the olr 0 4 kg cod m 3 d 1 in both strategies summer rainy period mainly for os 1 figure s6 appendix a supplementary data however under os 2 grey square scores fig 5b the soluble and particulate organic loading rates were not only below their measured averages in this period scores were project in the negative size of pc2 but even greater than those found in os 1 mainly between 170 and 200 days figure s66 appendix a supplementary data in os 1 the particulate organic loading rate was definitely lower all over unstable phase grey square scores fig 5a since the dataset was project in the positive side of pc1 as consequence filamentous microorganisms overcame non filamentous because they are able to take up more nutrients from media with low levels of substrate higher maximum growth rate values 7 61 similar results were reported in terms of organic loading by li et al 62 the authors attributed the dominance of filamentous organisms when the loading was reduced to 0 5 kg cod m 3 d 1 in the reactor peyong et al 7 described granules as fluffy containing filamentous organisms when the system was also operated with real domestic wastewater at 0 54 kg cod m 3 d 1 the large granules gradually disintegrated into small debris that were subsequently washed out from the reactor after 60 days of operation pca also depicted an interesting correlation between the granules stability and substrate metabolism in os 1 almost all cases assigned to the instability period were projected over the positive side of pc1 where the biomass has presented high aerobic cod oxidation activity aeqs although the aeqs presented lower explained variance in both pc1 and pc2 in os 2 the instability period was strongly inversely correlated to the anaerobic cod activity inferring that cod was poorly oxidized through this pathway thus in both strategies pca suggested that aerobic activity was mainly correlated to instabilities issues as known when oxygen is used as electron acceptor for organic matter removal the predominance of fast growing heterotrophs is expected as filamentous organisms which often results in the instability of aerobic granules 10 in order to analyze the variability and abnormal distributions of variables and thus to check whether the processes were in control or out of control hotelling t² control charts were performed fig 6 a and 6b fifteen out of control signals depicted by hotelling s control chart occurred during the os 1 fig 6a whereas only four cases exceeded the control limit under os 2 fig 6b although out of control points occurred in both strategies it was clear that os 2 stood more within statistical control than os 1 furthermore the system took about 200 days to perform a solid in control pattern under os 1 whereas it reached control since the beginning under os 2 early scores under os 1 corroborate these findings since changes on the data distribution were clearly checked from the start up period to just before the stationary phase in the pca model fig 5a according to franca et al 4 long start up are regularly described as one of the most critical concern for practical application of the ags technology along with process instability thus the results of os 2 have shown better performance in these aspects t2 decomposition fig 6c and 6d revealed the power of each variable on the out of control case the greater the decomposed value the greater the contribution of an individual variable to the overall t2 statistic in general under os 1 the biomass concentration addressed most of the out of control schemes fig 6c moreover early out of control schemes were mainly ascribed to the influent characteristics as the particulate organic loading rate accounted largely fig 6c this is in accordance with pca outcomes since the polr presented the thirdest negative loading factor in pc1 the biomass characteristics namely particles diameter and svi30 svi5 stood as the main responsible for the out of control schemes at the end of experimental period on the other hand out of control schemes in os 2 were related mainly to both operational conditions case 21 bed and biomass characteristics case 24 aeqs fig 6d hence fault detection and diagnosis are powerful tools to not only validate the optimal process condition for granular sludge stability but also to draw a reliable analysis of weakness exploring its relation to volumetric exchange ratio biomass activity and composition and wastewater characteristics 3 6 practical implications for real low strength wastewater treatment plants the stability was studied through two operational strategies distinguished by volumetric exchange ratio ver during almost two years in order to increase the applied orl and positive effects on granules stability and conversion capacity as a consequence 7 33 indeed olr showed to be the most decisive factor found in this research that influenced the stability of granular sludge treating low strength domestic wastewater proposals to increase orl reducing the total cycle time may often not be applicable because in such cases influents with high ammonium nitrogen concentrations may not have the expected removal another approach would be the extension of the feeding phase which may either imply a reduction in the aerobic phase or longer cycle time reducing the treatment capacity instead although the systems achieved treated effluent in accordance with brazilian discharge limits more restrictive criteria are imposed by some states municipalities and other countries in order to increase denitrification and phosphorus removal a dedicated anaerobic phase should be added with a do set point and slow recirculation through the sludge bed in sbr system operated with fill draw mode the sludge bed height could be controlled in order to monitor visually the accumulation of biomass and its washout in the present study although the ver was 75 high space for sludge bed the low concentration of solids and small bed height produced an effluent with a low solids concentration 30 mg l 1 to ensure the treatment security an internal recirculation system top to bottom of reactor may have to be applied 1 regarding multivariate statistical process control despite of the most widely applied approaches include methods aiming to reduce the dimensionality of large dataset like pca a combined method as proposed here pca models control charts could be used to evaluate the variability and detect non random behavior in ags system the multivariate analyses plainly revealed the role of particulate organic matter in ags development they should be avoided when tracking a more compact aerobic granule without finger types organisms an adequate primary treatment followed by enough contact time to hydrolyze the remaining particulate matter during the feeding phase is crucial for the proper granules development and stability that is a powerful clue to accomplish the efficient treatment of real low strength wastewater 4 conclusion the ags sbr operated at constant volume with high ver 75 produced a significant fraction 80 of granules with very good settling properties svi30 70 ml gtss l 1 and svi30 svi5 ratio of around 0 70 in the eps content proteins were the predominant component twice compared to polysaccharides which were supported by the higher relative abundance of saprospiraceae and flavobacteriaceae families multivariate analysis supported that increasing ver from 50 to 75 proved to be an important strategy for ags stability especially during rainy periods where the carbon availability is lower olr 0 4 kgscod m 3 d 1 requiring a larger influent volume to maintain the minimum olr for granule maintenance the biomass presented high activity in both strategies producing a good quality effluent cod was mainly removed anaerobically with an emphasis on ver 75 90 however the presence of particulate matter led to hydrolysis in the aerated phase undergoing aerobic metabolism therefore a good primary treatment is recommended to remove suspended solids and avoid this behavior nitrification was successfully achieved in os 1 developed mainly by nitrospira ssp in a single step apparently and in os 2 by nitrosomonas sp and nitrospira sp in two steps partial denitrification and low phosphorus removal were achieved under both strategies funding this work was supported by

13629,this work evaluated the granulation process and the stability of aerobic granular sludge in a pilot scale reactor 1 m³ during a long term operation 650 days treating real low strength domestic wastewater two operational strategies distinguished by volumetric exchange ratio ver 50 and 75 were tested enabling higher organic loading rates different topics involving wastewater biological treatment was evaluated from physical chemical and kinetic parameters to molecular biology techniques since process variability can only be described in statistical terms multivariate statistical process control was applied to verify and integrate the results found successful granulation in terms of settling properties sludge volumetric index svi30 70 ml gtss l 1 and svi30 svi5 0 70 and granules fraction 80 were achieved when applying ver 75 multivariate analysis supported that an increment in ver from 50 to 75 is an important strategy for ags stability especially during rainy periods where the carbon availability is lower olr 0 4 kgscod m 3 d 1 carbon compounds were mainly removed during anaerobic feeding phase however the presence of particulate matter led to hydrolysis in the aerated phase nitrification was observed in both strategies nitrospira spp was predominant under lower ver whereas nitrosomonas spp overcame increasing ver although partial denitrification and low phosphorus removal were achieved under both strategies these factors could be target by controlling the excess of do in aeration phase and improving the availability of readily organic substrate in feeding phase keywords granular sludge stability low strength wastewater volumetric exchange ratio organic loading rate multivariate statistical process control 1 introduction wastewater treatment using aerobic granular sludge ags technology has attracted attention in the last years being an alternative for the usual conventional activated sludge cas self immobilized microbial aggregates allow better sludge water separation overcoming the main issue of sludge bulking in cas system the excellent biomass settling properties also permit to dispense secondary settlers cutting off 80 the footprint required in cas systems 1 the technology was first developed in netherlands and has more recently been applied in developing countries such as brazil in this way some concerns related to wastewater characteristics and climate conditions still need attention to achieve success in the operation systems 2 3 despite of several plants are in operation distributed worldwide treating domestic and industrial wastewater there are still challenging issues and limitations holding technology applications 4 the main difficulty is directly linked to the instability of the granules and the loss of biological activity mainly in the treatment of low strength wastewaters 4 seed sludge 3 carbon source 5 organic loading rate olr 6 7 production of extracellular polymeric substances eps 8 food microorganisms f m ratio 9 and feast famine balance and starvation time 10 were reported as the limiting factors to achieve granules stability many cas plants can operate fairly well under low organic loads but in ags systems is required a minimum olr since low olr seems to be linked to granules disintegration 6 7 the authors suggested a minimum influent chemical oxygen demand cod of 200 mg l 1 and an olr of 0 6 kg m 3 d 1 to enable aerobic granules integrity although the recently studies undoubtedly advanced our comprehension about how olr influences the aerobic granule formation some limitations are also displayed for example synthetic wastewater has been adopted as feeding stock 11 12 however it seldom represents the complex composition of real domestic wastewater in addition to load variations 11 13 the time in which the granules remain intact and healthy in a wastewater treatment system is still unpredictable 4 regarding the operation time the extension is another limitation since the most studies presented long term around 100 days of operation 13 which could lead to incomplete interpretations since previous studies have reported disintegration after this period 100 days of operation 3 14 15 furthermore findings in literature are mostly conducted in lab or pilot scale reactors less than 10 l 3 6 7 12 13 which also may be an unfavorable situation considering that any adversity of real conditions could impact the system quickly although ags full scale wastewater treatment plants are currently designed to be operated with fill draw mode i e the treated effluent is pushed and discharged at the reactor top while the raw wastewater enters from its bottom there are still limited studies about this mode of operation 1 11 13 16 when using low strength wastewater in ags cultivation few studies proposed different strategies to increase olr sguanci et al 17 suggested an increment in the olr dosing acetate in the municipal wastewater however it is not economically practicable for full scale sewage treatment plants the strategy to mix low strength domestic sewage with industrial wastewater to increase the olr as presented by pronk et al 1 is not feasible in most of the cases another possibility suggested by these authors was to apply cycles of 3 h in rainy seasons diluted sewage and cycles of 6 5 h in dry seasons more concentrated sewage however influents with high nutrients concentrations may not have the expected removal producing effluent with low quality besides the longer cycle time could lead to a lower treatment capacity in this context the present work aimed a long term evaluation 650 days of the granulation process and stability of ags in a reactor 1 0 m³ operated with fill draw mode treating domestic wastewater two volumetric exchanged ratios ver were tested 50 and 75 in order to compare the influence of olr in the biomass characteristics properties and activity through system performance and bacterial selection the novelty of this work arises from the combination and integrated discussion covering the different topics involving wastewater biological treatment and thus ags system from physical chemical and kinetic parameters to molecular biology techniques furthermore multivariate statistical process control as pca models combined with hotelling t2 control chart was used to evaluate the system stability and detect non random behavior since variability can only be described in statistical terms 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental set up a pilot scale sequencing batch rector sbr with working volume of 1 m³ 0 95 m of diameter and 1 42 m of height was operated under fill draw mode constant volume and fed with domestic wastewater collected directly from municipal sewer system of florianópolis santa catarina brazil 27 36 12 7 s 48 31 14 9 w the operational 6h cycle comprehended the following phases 90 min of simultaneous feeding and draw 240 min of aeration and 30 min of settling small air bubbles passed through five diffusers at the bottom of the reactor with a flow rate of 238 l min 1 resulting in a superficial air velocity of 0 56 cm s 1 a programmable logic controller plc was used to automate pumps valves and cycle length the system was operated without control of dissolved oxygen do ph and temperature the experimental period was divided in two operational strategies os 1 and os 2 with different volumetric exchange ratios ver 50 and 75 modified through feeding flow rate figure s1 appendix a supplementary data the system was not inoculated and it was monitored during 339 days for each strategy at the end of the first strategy the reactor was totally drained and the second strategy was started up in os 1 the reactor worked with 50 of ver corresponding to a wastewater up flow velocity of 0 48 m h 1 in os 2 the ver was increased to 75 0 69 m h 1 in order to increment the organic load expecting to achieve a greater conversion capacity and better granular biomass stability 7 18 table 1 summarizes the experimental conditions and wastewater characteristics during os 1 and os 2 2 2 analytical methods 2 2 1 sludge characterization the biomass concentration was evaluated in terms of volatile suspended solids vss 19 the samples were weekly collected at the end of the aerobic phase particle size distributions were obtained by sieving method 20 sludge volume index svi was measured after 5 and 30 min of biomass settling svi5 and svi30 to assess granule formation 21 kinetic parameters calculations including sludge retention time srt observed specific biomass growth rate μ and biomass specific decay rate kd are detailed in appendix a supplementary data and followed methodology described by liu and tay 22 the granule formation and shape were visualized by an optical microscopy olympus bx40 japan and an electron microscopy energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy sem edx jeol jsm 6390lv japan the eps present in sludge were extracted on a weekly basis under alkaline conditions ph 10 and high temperature 30 min at 80 c followed by sonication 5 min at 55 khz 23 the polysaccharides ps content in eps were determined as glucose equivalent using phenol sulfuric method 24 whereas the protein pn fraction was measured as bovine albumin equivalent according to lowry s method 25 the polyhydroxybutyrate phb analysis were performed according to the methodology proposed by karr et al 26 which is based on measuring crotonic acid formed by acid catalyzed elimination during chemical depolymerization of phb after the acid extraction procedure the samples were diluted in h2so4 5 mm 1 3 proportion and filtered on a cellulose acetate filter 0 45 μm followed by injection on the hplc shimadzu lc 20at japan the analytical column used was the ionic exclusion aminex hpx 87h 300 mm x 7 8 mm d i x9 8 μm from bio rad 2 2 2 wastewater characterization periodic analysis on weekly basis of total suspended solids tss carbon bod cod total and ammonia nitrogen tn nh4 n and total phosphorus tp were performed in order to monitor the reactor performance 19 the anions no2 n no3 n and po4 3 p were measured by ion chromatography dionex corporation usa dissolved oxygen do ph and temperature were measured with a multi parameters probe ysi pro plus free ammonia fa was determined as described by anthonisen et al 27 biomass specific rates for nutrient removal are detailed in appendix a supplementary data five characterizations of the microbial activities during sbr cycle were conducted in each strategy to evaluate substrate conversion in terms of carbon the samples were thus collected every 10 30 min for cod analysis and 30 60 min for phb quantification 2 2 3 microbial community high throughput 16s rrna gene sequencing was conducted by illumina miseq platform to study microbial communities in both strategies the samples were collected at the end of the aeration phase primer set 341f 5 cctacgggnggcwgcag 3 805r 5 ggactachvgggtwtctaat 3 was used to amplify dna extracted by the powersoil dna isolation kit mobio laboratories inc usa the sequences were analysed using the neoprospecta microbiome technologies s library the libraries were sequenced using the miseq sequencing system illumina inc usa and v2 kit with 300 cycles and single end sequencing all the reads were individually submitted to a quality filter based on the sum of the dna bases probabilities errors allowing a maximum of 1 of accumulated errors subsequently the dna sequences corresponding to the illumina adapters were removed the resulting sequences that presented 100 identity were clustered and used for taxonomic identification using silva database fish analysis was carried out to observe the occurrence of ammonium oxidizing bacteria aob nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob and denitrifiers among the general bacterial community of the aerobic granules 28 mixed liquor samples were collected and fixed with 4 w v paraformaldehyde on weekly basis granules were selected from the mixed liquor and also fixed monthly after the fixation step granules were embedded in tissue tek o c t and 20 μm thick granule sections were cut using a cryostat cm 1850 leica germany at 40 c on day 136th and 107th of os 1 and os 2 respectively which corresponded to complete granulation in the strategies samples of mixed liquor and granules slices were target by oligonucleotides probes as described in table s1 appendix a supplementary data 2 3 data analysis multivariate statistical process control mspc techniques were applied to detect abnormal behaviour and out of control schemes using the software statistica 7 0 statsoft inc at first principal component analysis pca was performed in a dataset formed by 37 cases in each strategy in addition hotelling t2 control charts were set up to detect multivariate outliers mean shifts and other distributional deviations from the in control scheme upper control limits ucl were determined using 95 confidential levels for t2 limits calculations 29 further out of control schemes were detailed through t2 decomposition 30 the chosen key variables were volatile suspend solids vss svi30 svi5 ratio svi sludge bed height in the reactor bed particulate polr and soluble solr organic loading rates specific anaerobic anqs and aerobic aeqs cod removal rates observed biomass specific growth rate grow and particle fractions with diameter above 212 μm d 212 normal distribution was checked by kolmogorov smirnov test in order to ensure the applicability of statistical hypotheses testing throughout the study 3 results and discussion 3 1 increment on volumetric exchange ratio long term effects in biomass characteristics during the first month under both operational strategies the biomass growth showed the same increasing pattern reaching higher concentrations under os 1 3 5 g vss l 1 fig 1 a after this period strategies had distinct biomass evolution keeping an average of 1 2 0 2 g vss l 1 after 160 days up to the end of experimental period in os 1 the biomass concentration in os 2 showed lesser biomass loss 20 days but still have not reached a substantial biomass accumulation in almost one year of operation keeping a mean value of 0 8 0 2 g vss l 1 fig 1b this could be ascribed to the kinetics parameters that will be better discuss in section 3 2 svi showed lower values under os 2 achieving svi30 of 73 23 ml g 1 tss and svi5 of 130 48 ml g 1 tss while os 1 had svi30 and svi5 of 97 39 and 180 104 ml g 1 tss respectively fig 1a and 1b the svi30 svi5 ratio has been presented as an indicator of granulation in aerobic granular sludge systems 31 32 therefore the full granulation was achieved during os 1 and os 2 after 136 and 92 days of operation respectively when svi30 svi5 reached 0 9 after 150 days the sludge showed variations in settling ability in both strategies for the os 1 this variability was more pronounced rising svi5 and svi30 to approximately 500 and 200 ml g 1 tss while in os 2 the svi was kept lower around 250 and 150 ml g 1 tss respectively in general both strategies presented similar behavior of sludge settling ability overtime but they showed a crucial difference when biomass concentration is compared in the periods where better svi values were achieved after the instability os 2 could recover biomass accumulation with good settling properties up to 300 days and less variability while os 1 has not showed low svi values accompanied by high biomass amount after this disturbance regarding the particle size distribution a rapid formation 20 days of particles with diameter above 212 μm was observed in os 1 fig 1c however this granules size was kept during the first 40 days and after the 47th day an abrupt decline was observed in which a considerable sludge fraction 75 remained below 212 μm until 200 days of operation time afterwards approximately 50 of particles showed diameter above 212 μm with majority diameter between 212 and 300 μm reaching 85 at the end of this experimental period differently of os 1 under os 2 the particles size increased progressively during 107 days fig 1d achieving 83 of sludge fraction with aggregates diameter above 212 μm after this period fluctuations in granules size was observed up to the end of operational time the sludge size fractions have oscillated between 40 and 70 of particles with diameter above 212 μm being the highest fraction between 300 and 600 μm as a result of higher ver table 1 larger granules were found in os 2 supported by the increased substrate availability driven by the olr change 33 34 gao et al 33 reported that increasing the organic load from 0 45 to 1 5 kg cod m 3 d 1 led to granules with 1 mm of diameter similarly jungles et al 34 described that the olr increment enhanced the formation of aerobic granules which appeared after 6 days with average of 3 5 mm the morphology of biomass aggregates fig 2 had shown differences between the os 1 and os 2 although the aggregates size was greater in os 2 than os 1 the granules showed irregular surfaces finger type structures fig 2e previous studies suggested that the presence of particles in wastewater results in filamentous organisms growth on granules 35 36 indeed about 50 of total olr was composed by particulate matter especially during os 2 which it was almost twice higher than os 1 table 1 according to martins et al 37 the filamentous outgrowth presented higher velocity than floc forming bacteria since they have unidirectional growth instead of in three directions sem analysis documented stalked ciliate colonies mostly represented by epistylis sp fig 2h in the granules structure which contributed to their irregular shape observed in os 2 the presence of protozoa ciliates have been reported in aerobic granules cultivated with real wastewater 1 28 which are primarily responsible for small organic particle uptake 21 as well as small flocs in order to complement the granular sludge composition characteristics the protein pn and polysaccharides ps fractions were quantified proteins pn were the predominant component with a doubling amount when compared to polysaccharides ps quantities under both strategies figure s4 appendix a supplementary data the results showed an average of 228 33 mg pn g 1vss and 97 19 mg ps g 1vss in os 1 while 289 57 mg pn g 1vss and 124 31 mg ps g 1vss in os 2 according to tu et al 38 eps becomes more hydrophobic throughout the granulation process due to the hydrophobic proteins involved in aggregating and densifying the granules contributing to formation and stability from non cellular protein nucleus 39 40 on the other hand the high amount of polysaccharides can lead to an increase in the structural stability and physical strength of the granules 41 in this way the higher quantities of pn and ps in the sludge under os 2 can be correlated with the higher stability found in this strategy 8 3 2 microbial activities and kinetics parameters in order to follow the carbon conversions and understand the heterotrophic metabolism cycles were monitored in terms of cod and phb when granulation was completed in both strategies two representative examples of the substrate profile observed during the operational cycles of both strategies are presented in fig 3 the cycles shown in fig 3a and 3b correspond the 136th and 107th days of operation in os 1 and in os 2 respectively while the 269th day in os 1 and 318th day in os 2 appear in fig 3c and 3d slow and static filling was applied in order to promote the particulate organic matter hydrolysis and anaerobic consumption of soluble cod in both strategies 11 under os 1 partial cod consumption about 70 of total removal occurred in the feeding phase and the remainder cod was consumed within the first 30 min of aeration phase fig 3a and 3c differently as shown in fig 3b and 3d 98 of cod was consumed in the anaerobic filling phase in os 2 however during the subsequent phase aeration for os 2 scod peaks are observed suggesting the hydrolysis of particulate matter and subsequent release of soluble compounds to the liquid fraction followed by aerobic consumption phb production simultaneously with cod uptake could be observed in both strategies reaching around 4 mg g 1tss at the end of feeding phase while during aeration phase the phb was consumed up to approximately 1 mg g 1tss the kinetic parameters were calculated based on the measurements after start up period ie between 40 and 339 days of experimental period in both operational strategies table 2 these parameters provided information about cell s evolution the intrinsic organism s characteristics and the existing environmental conditions 42 the food to microorganism f m ratio provides information about the substrate availability 43 which was twice higher in os 2 0 76 kg scod kg 1 vss d 1 than in os 1 0 33 kg scod kg 1 vss d 1 table 2 a high f m ratio would enhance microbial growth and could be an essential parameter for granules size control 44 in connection to biomass kinetics parameters the half saturation constant k s also provides information between substrate availability and growth rate according to lineweaver burke linearization the observed value k sobs was higher for os 1 72 mg l 1 than for os 2 47 mg l 1 figure s5 appendix a supplementary data the r² obtained from linearization represented 50 of data both correlation coefficients showed significant variation ascribed to influent characteristics table 1 and biomass composition variabilities as well as model inaccuracies 45 this clearly shows that the substrate and bacterial can have a significant effect on the determination of the biokinetic coefficients the lower k s value the higher affinity of the biomass to the substrate resulting in higher growth rates at low substrate conditions 46 47 the observed biomass specific growth rate μ obs has shown greater values in os 2 0 08 d 1 than os 1 0 06 d 1 however the biomass specific decay rate k d was two fold higher for os 2 0 07 d 1 than os 1 0 03 d 1 corroborating the low biomass accumulation in os 2 despite of the most cod have been consumed during the feeding phase in os 2 the contact time between the wastewater and the biomass was not enough to achieve full cod uptake 4 mgphb g 1vss the subsequent phase comprising 240 min of aeration under low substrate level may have resulted in endogenous respiration as it was also observed by guimarães et al 2 in ags systems according to hao et al 48 under starvation regime bacteria oxidize their own cells to provide energy for maintenance under these circumstances observed here a negative growth of biomass could be observed along with consumption of electron acceptors mainly oxygen the kinetics cycles findings in os 2 confirmed cod release fig 3b and 3d all over the aeration phase suggesting lysis of the particles which could explain the lower biomass accumulation under this strategy unlikely os 1 os 2 could be characterized by predation process as well due to large numbers of protozoa colonies fixed on the granule surfaces which is also related to biomass loss the increment on ver from 50 to 75 increased the volumetric removal for carbon nitrogen and phosphorus in os 2 table 2 during os 1 the biomass specific rates of cod q scod anaerobic q scod aerobic nh4 q nh4 and tp q tp were 0 13 g scod d 1 g 1 vss 0 050 g nh4 n d 1 g 1 vss and 0 003 g tp d 1 g 1 vss respectively while they were 0 37 g scod d 1 g 1 vss 0 129 g nh4 n d 1 g 1 vss and 0 005 g tp d 1 g 1 vss in os 2 respectively similar values of 0 10 0 18 g nh4 n d 1 g 1 vss and 0 005 0 008 g tp d 1 g 1 vss were obtained previously for a pilot sbr reactor operated with variable volume and fed with real low strength wastewater 2 however the authors reported higher values for biomass specific rate of scod 0 51 0 58 g scod d 1 g 1 vss overall despite of the lower solids accumulation in os 2 the biomass showed to be quite active in the conditions applied and with high affinity to the available substrate which reached approximately 40 higher conversion capacity than os 1 3 3 influent and effluent characteristics although the real domestic wastewater showed high fluctuations over time it presented similar characteristics applied in both strategies table 1 the final effluent quality and removal efficiencies were summarized in table 3 high carbon removal efficiencies 70 were achieved in both strategies the organic matter and ammonium effluents concentrations were in accordance with brazilian national law 49 under both strategies annual averages obtained in os 1 were 48 and 27 mg l 1 in terms of cod and bod5 whereas 54 and 38 mg l 1 in os 2 the ammonium oxidation was quite similar under os 1 and os 2 although during os 2 the solids concentration and sludge retention time srt 13 7 d were lower than during os 1 23 16 d the system was able to maintain high ammonium removal close to 80 with an average effluent concentration of 9 mg l 1 however the free ammonium fa formation was more pronounced under os 2 reaching 1 2 0 2 mg l 1 whereas 0 8 0 1 mg l 1 was detected in os 1 despite of favorable conditions alternating anaerobic aerobic phases for denitrification process and slow growing heterotrophic organisms total nitrogen removal and phosphate release uptake was not evident during the entire period table 3 average removal efficiencies were approximately 30 for total nitrogen and 25 for total phosphorus in both operational strategies simultaneous nitrification denitrification snd was not achieved even the denitrification during feeding phase was minimal with biomass specific nox consumption rate of 0 004 g nox n d 1 g 1 vss in both strategies table 2 it may happen due to the high do concentration in bulk liquid once the system worked without do control according to layer et al 16 snd cannot be achieved with ags treating low strength municipal wastewater if a constant and high do is maintained during the aeration phase even with greater particles size and full granulation thus do saturation level during aeration was favorable for nitrification but prevented simultaneous denitrification the presence of electron acceptors o2 and nox in the bulk of feeding phase remained from previous cycle could also contribute the low phosphorus removal nitrogen compounds are usually considered to have an adverse effect on phosphorus removing capacity of biological wastewater treatment 50 since this could reduce the amount of substrate available for phosphorus accumulating organisms pao and hence causes the reduction of phosphorus release 51 despite of the c p ratio obtained around 30 gscod g 1 po4 3 p constituted a good basis for pao selection and most readily biodegradable cod was removed in feeding phase 52 the domestic wastewater had only a small portion of volatile fatty acids vfa 15 which have presented challenges in other studies as well 2 53 in addition the contact time between biomass and substrate os 1 26 10 min and os 2 10 2 min was not enough to hydrolysis the particulate matter to allowed vfa production 2 in this way the small cod storage in phb form can be correlated with other slow growing organism but not paos 3 4 microbial ecology structural analyses of microbial community were performed along both strategies fig 4 besides the high fluctuations of the microbial communities there were differences among organisms when the two strategies are compared suggesting that different operational conditions applied were able to select dissimilar microbial populations fig 4a during the first weeks of os 1 the microbial community was dominated by microorganisms representative of municipal wastewater and common in start up period of aerobic granular systems 8 such as genera commamonas acinetobacter and zooglea members of commamodaceae 31 day 5 rhodocyclaceae 20 day 20 and moraxellaceae 12 day 20 families respectively saprospiraceae was also observed with high abundance during the star up period 20th day with 13 of os 1 but was gradually reducing along operational time on the other hand this family was selected by conditions applied in os 2 achieving 34 of relative abundance the conditions applied under os 1 favoured members from caulobacteraceae chitinophagaceae and xanthomonadaceae families while os 2 presented with more abundance rhodobacteraceae day 185 9 flavobacteriaceae day 339 10 and saprospiraceae day 185 34 these abundant populations could be related to eps metabolic pathways 54 specially saprospiraceae and flavobacteriaceae have been proposed as eps producers in granular sludge systems 8 55 therefore the greater eps production in os 2 could be linked with these organisms members of chitinophagaceae family were detected in both strategies increasing their relative abundance from 5 in the first weeks to 17 in the end of operations times this family have been reported to hydrolyze several substrates 56 which could be a crucial hydrolyzing population in the present systems treating complex and large carbon chains compounds of domestic wastewater overall the most populations detected by sequencing analysis were fast growing ordinary heterotrophic organisms oho with aerobic metabolism under both strategies these organisms are supposed to form eps matrices that could embed micro colonies of slower growing populations as polyphosphate pao glycogen accumulating organisms gao and autotrophic nitrifies 57 by fluorescence in situ hybridization fish technique ammonium oxidation to nitrite during os 1 apparently occurred by another metabolic pathway which did not involve aob represented by nitrosomonadaceae family since these organisms were not detected in this first strategy nevertheless an expressive number of nitrospiraspp agglomerate could be seen in the outer layer of the granule as shown in fig 4b in light blue color in dna sequencing the nitrospiraceae family was detected with less than 0 3 relative abundance in os 1 on the other hand comammodaceae was detected 31 in start up period and around 20 all over the strategy which has already been reported as known heterotrophic nitrifier 58 in addition daims et al 59 showed that nitrospiraspp encodes both the pathways for ammonia and nitrite oxidation which are concomitantly expressed during growth by ammonia oxidation to nitrate under os 2 the spatial distribution in granule slice exhibited greater aob and less nitrospiraspp colonies fig 4c this fact may be related to free ammonia fa which concentration reached 1 2 0 2 mg fa l 1 as presented in section 3 3 the formation of fa results in partial nitrification concentrations between 0 1 and 1 0 mg l 1 inhibit nob activity in this case represented by nitrospiraspp whereas aob are only inhibited at much higher concentrations of 10 150 famg l 1 27 nitrite accumulation prior to nitrate formation have been detected in granulation start ups correlating with the sequential development of aob and nob 57 colonies of nitrobacterspp and pseudomonasspp were found in os 1 and os 2 fig 4d and 4e in mixed liquor however the nitrobacterspp clusters were more pronounced in os 1 with several colonies detected and distributed in the sample fig 4d corroborating the nitrate accumulation along this period table 3 during os 2 the denitrification process was not evident however a greater number of pseudomonasspp clusters was detected in this strategy fig 4e 3 5 multivariate analysis multivariate statistical process control mspc were applied to evaluate the variability and detect non random behavior in both operational strategies principal components analysis pca reduced the dimensionality into 3 significant principal components pcs explaining 67 of the total variance in os 1 38 17 and 12 for pc1 pc2 and pc3 respectively whereas they accounted 65 in os 2 29 23 and 13 for pc1 pc2 and pc3 respectively loadings factors presented in table s2 of appendix a supplementary data since each variable is assigned to any loading factor results can be interpreted as correlations between the variables and each pc 60 the scores and loadings biplots of the first 2 pcs were used to visualize the combined behavior of significant variables that affected both operational strategies fig 5 under os 1 the pc1 clustered the dataset into two groups fig 5a at the beginning red circles scores greater values of sludge bed height in the reactor bed vss and particulate organic loading rate polr described the startup period thereafter the subset formed by squares scores represented greater values of specific anaerobic removal rate anqs and biomass specific growth rate grow this pattern suggested a contrasting behavior between operational conditions and biomass characteristics fig 5c scores were quite projected over positive and negative sides of the pc2 where data from the end of the experiment scores 25 37 were grouped mostly on the positive side revealing the reactor worked with higher soluble organic loading rates which improved the biomass granulation a faster start up was depicted under os 2 since the red scores were more grouped in the modelled space fig 5b besides scores 15 29 presented vss and bed values higher than their averages although the reactor worked with low polr and solr in this period the biomass concentration was not affected high vss and bed values fig 5d low deviation was observed thereafter indicating that the os 2 provided a more homogeneous reactor operation and performance when compared to os 1 pca outcomes supported that during the instability period the olr played an important role the destabilization period was characterized by a decrease in the olr 0 4 kg cod m 3 d 1 in both strategies summer rainy period mainly for os 1 figure s6 appendix a supplementary data however under os 2 grey square scores fig 5b the soluble and particulate organic loading rates were not only below their measured averages in this period scores were project in the negative size of pc2 but even greater than those found in os 1 mainly between 170 and 200 days figure s66 appendix a supplementary data in os 1 the particulate organic loading rate was definitely lower all over unstable phase grey square scores fig 5a since the dataset was project in the positive side of pc1 as consequence filamentous microorganisms overcame non filamentous because they are able to take up more nutrients from media with low levels of substrate higher maximum growth rate values 7 61 similar results were reported in terms of organic loading by li et al 62 the authors attributed the dominance of filamentous organisms when the loading was reduced to 0 5 kg cod m 3 d 1 in the reactor peyong et al 7 described granules as fluffy containing filamentous organisms when the system was also operated with real domestic wastewater at 0 54 kg cod m 3 d 1 the large granules gradually disintegrated into small debris that were subsequently washed out from the reactor after 60 days of operation pca also depicted an interesting correlation between the granules stability and substrate metabolism in os 1 almost all cases assigned to the instability period were projected over the positive side of pc1 where the biomass has presented high aerobic cod oxidation activity aeqs although the aeqs presented lower explained variance in both pc1 and pc2 in os 2 the instability period was strongly inversely correlated to the anaerobic cod activity inferring that cod was poorly oxidized through this pathway thus in both strategies pca suggested that aerobic activity was mainly correlated to instabilities issues as known when oxygen is used as electron acceptor for organic matter removal the predominance of fast growing heterotrophs is expected as filamentous organisms which often results in the instability of aerobic granules 10 in order to analyze the variability and abnormal distributions of variables and thus to check whether the processes were in control or out of control hotelling t² control charts were performed fig 6 a and 6b fifteen out of control signals depicted by hotelling s control chart occurred during the os 1 fig 6a whereas only four cases exceeded the control limit under os 2 fig 6b although out of control points occurred in both strategies it was clear that os 2 stood more within statistical control than os 1 furthermore the system took about 200 days to perform a solid in control pattern under os 1 whereas it reached control since the beginning under os 2 early scores under os 1 corroborate these findings since changes on the data distribution were clearly checked from the start up period to just before the stationary phase in the pca model fig 5a according to franca et al 4 long start up are regularly described as one of the most critical concern for practical application of the ags technology along with process instability thus the results of os 2 have shown better performance in these aspects t2 decomposition fig 6c and 6d revealed the power of each variable on the out of control case the greater the decomposed value the greater the contribution of an individual variable to the overall t2 statistic in general under os 1 the biomass concentration addressed most of the out of control schemes fig 6c moreover early out of control schemes were mainly ascribed to the influent characteristics as the particulate organic loading rate accounted largely fig 6c this is in accordance with pca outcomes since the polr presented the thirdest negative loading factor in pc1 the biomass characteristics namely particles diameter and svi30 svi5 stood as the main responsible for the out of control schemes at the end of experimental period on the other hand out of control schemes in os 2 were related mainly to both operational conditions case 21 bed and biomass characteristics case 24 aeqs fig 6d hence fault detection and diagnosis are powerful tools to not only validate the optimal process condition for granular sludge stability but also to draw a reliable analysis of weakness exploring its relation to volumetric exchange ratio biomass activity and composition and wastewater characteristics 3 6 practical implications for real low strength wastewater treatment plants the stability was studied through two operational strategies distinguished by volumetric exchange ratio ver during almost two years in order to increase the applied orl and positive effects on granules stability and conversion capacity as a consequence 7 33 indeed olr showed to be the most decisive factor found in this research that influenced the stability of granular sludge treating low strength domestic wastewater proposals to increase orl reducing the total cycle time may often not be applicable because in such cases influents with high ammonium nitrogen concentrations may not have the expected removal another approach would be the extension of the feeding phase which may either imply a reduction in the aerobic phase or longer cycle time reducing the treatment capacity instead although the systems achieved treated effluent in accordance with brazilian discharge limits more restrictive criteria are imposed by some states municipalities and other countries in order to increase denitrification and phosphorus removal a dedicated anaerobic phase should be added with a do set point and slow recirculation through the sludge bed in sbr system operated with fill draw mode the sludge bed height could be controlled in order to monitor visually the accumulation of biomass and its washout in the present study although the ver was 75 high space for sludge bed the low concentration of solids and small bed height produced an effluent with a low solids concentration 30 mg l 1 to ensure the treatment security an internal recirculation system top to bottom of reactor may have to be applied 1 regarding multivariate statistical process control despite of the most widely applied approaches include methods aiming to reduce the dimensionality of large dataset like pca a combined method as proposed here pca models control charts could be used to evaluate the variability and detect non random behavior in ags system the multivariate analyses plainly revealed the role of particulate organic matter in ags development they should be avoided when tracking a more compact aerobic granule without finger types organisms an adequate primary treatment followed by enough contact time to hydrolyze the remaining particulate matter during the feeding phase is crucial for the proper granules development and stability that is a powerful clue to accomplish the efficient treatment of real low strength wastewater 4 conclusion the ags sbr operated at constant volume with high ver 75 produced a significant fraction 80 of granules with very good settling properties svi30 70 ml gtss l 1 and svi30 svi5 ratio of around 0 70 in the eps content proteins were the predominant component twice compared to polysaccharides which were supported by the higher relative abundance of saprospiraceae and flavobacteriaceae families multivariate analysis supported that increasing ver from 50 to 75 proved to be an important strategy for ags stability especially during rainy periods where the carbon availability is lower olr 0 4 kgscod m 3 d 1 requiring a larger influent volume to maintain the minimum olr for granule maintenance the biomass presented high activity in both strategies producing a good quality effluent cod was mainly removed anaerobically with an emphasis on ver 75 90 however the presence of particulate matter led to hydrolysis in the aerated phase undergoing aerobic metabolism therefore a good primary treatment is recommended to remove suspended solids and avoid this behavior nitrification was successfully achieved in os 1 developed mainly by nitrospira ssp in a single step apparently and in os 2 by nitrosomonas sp and nitrospira sp in two steps partial denitrification and low phosphorus removal were achieved under both strategies funding this work was supported by
