8545,the presence of year round surface water in streams i e streamflow permanence is an important factor for identifying aquatic habitat availability determining the regulatory status of streams managing land use change allocating water resources and designing scientific studies however accurate high resolution and dynamic prediction of streamflow permanence that accounts for year to year variability at a regional extent is a major gap in modeling capability herein we expand and adapt the u s geological survey usgs probability of streamflow permanence prosper model from its original implementation in the pacific northwest prosperpnw to the upper missouri river basin prosperum a geographical region that includes mountain and prairie ecosystems of the northern united states prosperum is an empirical model used to estimate the probability that a stream channel has year round flow in response to climatic conditions monthly and annual and static physiographic predictor variables of the upstream basin the structure and approach of prosperum are generally consistent with the prosperpnw model but include improved spatial resolution 10 m and a longer modeling period average model accuracy was 81 drainage area upstream proportion as wetlands and upstream proportion as developed land cover were the most important predictor variables the prosperum model identifies decreases in streamflow permanence during climatically drier years although there is variability in the magnitude across basins highlighting geographically varying sensitivity to drought variability in the response of perennial streams to drought conditions among basins in the study area was also observed keywords prosper non perennial perennial intermittent random forest climate change streamflow observations streamflow permanence data availability all data used in this research are available through sources provided in the manuscript 1 introduction burgeoning research in the last two decades has highlighted the ecological importance of streamflow permanence whether a stream flows year round or not and non perennial streams allen et al 2020 datry et al 2017 hale and godsey 2019 non perennial streams streams that periodically cease to flow busch et al 2020 constitute over half of the total channel length of the global river network messager et al 2021 and are expected to increase in extent as a result of shifts in drought frequency and magnitude from climate change brooks 2009 dai 2013 ward et al 2020 zipper et al 2021 and water resources development chiu et al 2017 falke et al 2011 perkin et al 2015 despite this knowledge accurate dynamic prediction forecasting and mapping of perennial and non perennial streams and rivers within the united states jaeger et al 2019 price et al 2021 and globally van meerveld et al 2020 is difficult and remains a gap both from the data and modeling perspective within the united states comparison of the national hydrography dataset nhd streamflow permanence classifications of perennial intermittent and ephemeral streams with field observations indicates misclassification of up to 50 for headwater streams fritz et al 2013 hafen et al 2020 additionally streamflow permanence may change through time with changes in climate godsey and kirchner 2014 ward et al 2020 large uncertainty in the classification of headwater streams which can account for more than 70 of stream channels benstead and leigh 2012 has consequences for land and water resource managers charged with administering water rights delineating riparian buffers and developing environmental impact assessments related to timber harvests and energy and mineral extraction kampf et al 2021 consequently there is a pressing need for more accurate prediction of streamflow permanence at finer spatial and temporal scales the need for accurate prediction of streamflow permanence information is highlighted by regulatory definitions first introduced in the federal water pollution control act fwpca 1972 commonly known as the clean water act cwa the cwa defined three classes of streamflow permanence perennial intermittent and ephemeral which are used to determine regulatory jurisdiction and related rules and revisions of stream classes under the cwa in recent years aspects of the cwa have been revised to include or exclude portions e g connected waterbodies or entire classes e g ephemeral of streams usepa and usace 2020 while it is recognized that these changes might have substantial implications the current state of cartographic and hydrographic representation of streamflow permanence classes is arguably inadequate to quantify the full impact of these changes to the cwa fesenmyer et al 2021 leibowitz et al 2008 usepa and usace 2020 there have been many recent modeling efforts aimed at improving prediction and mapping of perennial and non perennial streams these models vary in geographic extent from global messager et al 2021 national or regional scales snelder et al 2013 yu et al 2018 to individual watersheds and more local scales jensen et al 2018 pate et al 2020 moidu et al 2021 and extend beyond classification of streamflow permanence to include timing of surface water presence beaufort et al 2019 gendaszek et al 2020 kaplan et al 2022 a critical feature of many of these streamflow permanence modeling efforts is that they rely on the aggregation and collection of categorical streamflow observations e g mcshane et al 2017 which are substantially more spatially abundant than long term or continuous streamflow measurements jaeger et al 2021 categorical observations of flow or no flow are a departure from conventional time series streamflow data and their surrogates which are prohibitively costly to implement at the spatial extents necessary to accurately capture the variability in streamflow permanence jaeger et al 2021 included in these models is the united states geological survey s usgs probability of streamflow permanence prosper model jaeger et al 2019 which was originally developed for the pacific northwest prosperpnw and estimates the probability a 30 m stream segment has streamflow for an entire calendar year annual predictions 2004 2016 are based on static physiographic covariates coupled with climatic data the prosperpnw model uses an empirical machine learning approach which has been used in other streamflow permanence efforts messager et al 2021 snelder et al 2013 and has increasing application in water resources modeling tyralis et al 2019 building on the methods developed for prosperpnw the usgs has developed a prosper model for the upper missouri river basin prosperum fig 1 the objectives of the prosperum modeling effort was to 1 improve the spatial and temporal resolution of streamflow permanence estimates in the upper missouri river basin umrb 2 develop a machine learning method for forecasting streamflow permanence 3 identify important drivers predictor variables of streamflow permanence and apparent differential response to climatic conditions between perennial and non perennial streams in the umrb and 4 distribute model results in a manner that facilitates easy incorporation into water resources decision making our work advances the science of streamflow permanence modeling by developing predictive methods that can be implemented at a high spatial resolution here defined as a sub reach scale of 10 m and applied at the regional scale while having the capability of forecasting streamflow permanence up to five months in advance further while there have been other streamflow permanence modeling efforts at larger spatial extents e g global messager et al 2021 the prosper models are the only regional scale probabilistic models with annual outputs which is crucial for understanding interannual variability and temporal trends in the predictions 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the umrb is defined here as the portion of the missouri river basin upstream from lake oahe in south dakota and includes much of montana western north dakota and south dakota and the northern half of wyoming fig 1 we define the umrb as 12 headwater subregions of the missouri river 4 digit hydrologic unit codes huc4s 1002 1013 fig 1 that constitute approximately 627 000 km2 or about 46 of the missouri river s full drainage basin huc4 subregions were used to partition the predictor variable and response data for more efficient geospatial processing and effective model fitting the geographic extent of huc4 is a sufficiently small sub regional unit to evaluate and describe streamflow permanence within the larger modeling domain streams that flow into study area subregions from canada were excluded from the prosperum model domain because of missing or inconsistent data elevation in the umrb ranges from about 511 m in the eastern plains to 4 180 m in the western mountains bedrock geology of umrb is dominated by sedimentary rock in the northern and eastern plains and igneous and metamorphic rock in the mountains of the south and west schruben et al 1994 bedrock in the umrb is overlain with unconsolidated alluvial and glacial lacustrine sediments glacial till and other residual materials schruben et al 1994 three level ii ecoregions environmental protection agency 2018 which are useful for describing the landscape in the context of climate terrain soils and vegetation at a regional scale make up most of the umrb the west central and south central semi arid prairies account for approximately 75 of the umrb the western margin of the umbr is dominated by the western cordillera ecoregion and a localized area in the southwestern portion of the study area falls in the cold deserts ecoregion fig 1 all three ecoregions in the study area are characterized by cold winters 5 0 c normal 1990 2020 mean temperature for december through february prism 2020 summers are generally warmer in the cold deserts and semi arid prairies compared to the western cordillera although average temperatures are cooler in northern latitudes mean annual precipitation ranges from 300 mm to 2500 mm in the cordillera mountains with increasing precipitation at higher elevations precipitation in the deserts and prairies is patchier and ranges from 130 to 550 mm three 8 digit huc huc8 subbasins were chosen to demonstrate spatiotemporal variation of prosperum streamflow permanence predictions across hydroclimatic and physiographic characteristics and for exploratory analysis to develop sub annual streamflow permanence predictions si table 1 fig 1 the three huc8 subbasins were selected based on availability of streamflow observation data and to represent different hydroclimatic regions mountain prairie and transition 2 2 data 2 2 1 streamflow observations the prosperum models were calibrated using point observation data that were aggregated from multiple public and private entities 8 785 streamflow observations si table 2 york et al 2020 the data collected represent multiple studies with potentially different objectives and sampling designs e g continuous streamflow monitoring discrete streamflow measurements qualitative streamflow assessments new data were also collected for this study using aerial photographs and high resolution sub 3 meter satellite imagery esri 2020a to identify the presence or absence of surface water at randomly selected sites along streams in the study area methods detailed in appendix a all observational data were reduced to wet dry or pooled categories wet streamflow observations are defined as observations with clear indications of flowing water e g measured streamflow greater than 0 or clearly described flowing conditions in notes associated with observations dry streamflow observations are defined as observations with clear indications of dry conditions e g measured streamflow of 0 or clearly described no flow dry conditions in notes associated with observations pooled streamflow observations refer to conditions specified as pooled or not flowing in the data observation points were snapped to the 10 m nhdplus hr stream grid as described in york sando and heldmyer 2020 each dataset was processed individually using r r core team 2020 with the packages sp pebesma and bivand 2005 raster hijmans 2020 rgdal bivand et al 2020 rgeos bivand and rundel 2021 and maptools bivand and lewin koh 2021 the streamflow observation data were filtered to meet certain quality control criteria for possible inclusion in the development of the prosperum model all streamflow observation data collected prior to the initial year of the modeling period 1989 were excluded data on streams with drainage areas that extend into canada were excluded because of inconsistent or missing predictor variable data there data on streams with drainage areas greater than 100 square kilometers were excluded to avoid biasing the model toward large perennial rivers inclusion of an observation also required sufficient information to make a classification of wet or dry at that location on the stream channel for example a streamflow discharge measurement or visual description of site conditions was sufficient but water quality field measurements as a proxy for water presence or absence were not considered adequate pooled streamflow observations were excluded because they only represented less than three percent of the total number of streamflow observations 127 4 763 and were likely underrepresented in the database if multiple streamflow observations of the same category e g wet or dry in the same location and year existed the last observation in that year for each class was retained if a location had multiple streamflow observations with different categories e g wet and dry in a single year the last dry observation was retained as the final condition for that year all wet observations made before august 1 were excluded from the model to minimize the potential of including wet observations that might become dry later in the year after all filters were applied to the data 4636 3111 wet and 1525 dry streamflow observations remained for model development fig 1 2 2 2 climatic and physiographic predictor variables to capture the drivers of streamflow permanence in the study area 36 predictor variables representing temporally static physiographic characteristics and temporally dynamic hydroclimatic conditions were included in the prosperum model table 1 predictor variables were selected based on prior results from prosperpnw and prior studies related to controls on streamflow and baseflow in the study area or hydrologically similar basins e g jencso and mcglynn 2011 ahiablame et al 2017 gendaszek et al 2020 predictor variables were also constrained by data availability and spatial and temporal coverage of the datasets except for two climatic datasets evapotranspiration and normalized difference vegetation index ndvi harmonic regression coefficients all predictor variable datasets were downloaded directly from the links provided in table 1 actual evapotranspiration datasets were created in google earth engine gorelick et al 2017 using the operational simplified surface energy balance ssebop senay et al 2013 algorithm following the methods of senay 2018 and schauer and senay 2019 with ndvi data obtained from landsat 5 7 and 8 and reference evapotranspiration data obtained from the gridded surface meteorological dataset gridmet abatzoglou 2012 annual growing season may 1 october 31 actual evapotranspiration was estimated using ssebop for 1985 2018 the ndvi harmonic regression coefficients were created in google earth engine using ndvi products derived from landsat 5 7 and 8 more information on the creation of these two datasets including the google earth engine script used to create the ndvi harmonic regression coefficients is provided in the metadata of the data release for this study sando et al 2022 predictor variables were processed into flow conditioned parameter grids fcpg which capture the upstream conditions for a given predictor variable for every grid cell in a stream network e g barnhart et al 2021 flow conditioned parameter grids for prosperum were generated using nhdplus hr beta flow direction grids u s geological survey 2017 for the huc4s encompassing the prosperum domain the fcpgs were based on the stream network grid defined as any grid cell with a drainage area of 0 01 square kilometers or greater use of this drainage area threshold on the nhdplus hr beta flow accumulation grids produced a more consistent and denser stream network that better captured small headwater streams than only using the stream grid representing flowlines included in the nhdplus hr kampf et al 2021 flow direction grids and the source grids for all predictor variables considered in the models table 1 were downloaded to the usgs yeti supercomputer falgout and gordon 2019 for fcpg creation the predictor variable source grids were processed into fcpgs using the flow conditioned parameter grid tools fcpg tools barnhart et al 2020 the fcpg tools generate grids where each pixel contains the average upstream basin value of an input grid such as monthly precipitation the proportion of an upstream basin occupied by a value such as a land cover class or the result of a localized decay function where input values are weighted by the inverse of their distance to a stream channel such that values on the uplands would have less impact than values within the riparian corridor i e decayed the first two types of fcpgs average and proportion were used in prosperpnw jaeger et al 2019 while the third decayed is new for prosperum but has been implemented in other efforts mcshane and eddy miller 2021 additionally the ndvi harmonic regression coefficients drainage area and higher resolution 30 m evapotranspiration datasets sando et al 2022 were included as new variables in prosperum to account for regional differences in streamflow permanence drivers generally the fcpg tools require two inputs 1 a flow direction grid with values indicating the direction that water would flow across the landscape and 2 a predictor variable dataset to be conditioned using the flow direction grid the predictor variable dataset is either a grid of values for continuous predictor variables such as precipitation totals or a grid of ones and zeroes indicating the presence or absence respectively of categorical data such as a land cover class for decayed fcpgs a weighting grid is needed as a third input to indicate how input predictor variable influence decreases with distance from a stream channel all fcpgs are made by creating 1 an accumulated area grid with pixel values representing the upstream contributing area draining to a given pixel and 2 an accumulated predictor variable grid with pixel values that are summed predictor variable values of all associated upstream grid pixels draining to that given pixel based on the flow direction grid this step is done using taudem tarboton et al 2009 via the fcpg tools the accumulated predictor variable grid is then divided by the accumulated area grid such that each pixel in the final fcpg contains the upstream average value of the predictor variable for the decay type fcpgs the weighting grid is used during the accumulation step to generate an accumulated predictor variable grid modified to account for distance to the stream channel for this analysis we set the weighting grid to 0 25 meaning that each grid cell retains 25 of the predictor variable value as it is accumulated downstream 2 3 analysis the prosperum model is based on binary wet or dry streamflow observations at discrete stream locations as response variables and physiographic and climatic predictor variables that describe conditions upstream of each observation to estimate the probability of year round flow for every stream pixel in the study area s stream network fig 2 the workflow provides probabilistic estimates of streamflow permanence that include 1 annual probabilities based on a full calendar year of climate conditions and 2 forecasted probabilities based on climate conditions through the end of may for a given year as part of this workflow we also investigate the feasibility of predicting sub annual 30 day rolling probabilities streamflow probabilities in three huc8 subbasins which are inferred from integrating prosperum probability estimates with a physically based hydrologic model 2 3 1 model development random forest rf breiman 2001 was used as the statistical framework for prosperum like prosper pnw rf is a machine learning method that is becoming increasingly popular for modeling environmental phenomena because of its ability to develop models using many predictor variables but relatively few response data biau and scornet 2016 further rf is non parametric and does not require that the predictor variable data are screened to meet traditional assumptions associated with parametric multivariate methods including collinearity normality heteroscedasticity and consistency of data structure allowing the model to accept continuous and ordinal data and data of substantially different magnitudes breiman 2001 prosperum includes four submodels herein referred to as model a b c and d models a b and c represent sequential time periods 1989 2000 2001 2003 and 2004 2018 respectively to maximize use of the past period of record of observation and predictor variable data model d provides preliminary forecasted probabilities based on early season january 1 may 31 climatic conditions fig 2 models a b and c were required because two climatic predictor variables did not extend over the complete modeling period specifically the national land cover dataset nlcd mrlcc 2016 is available from 2001 to present and snow water equivalent swe barrett 2003 is available from 2004 to present consequently model a 1989 2000 does not include swe or nlcd predictor variables model b 2001 2003 includes nlcd but not swe model c 2004 2018 includes nlcd and swe fig 2 models a b and c are retrospective models that provide predictions based on the full calendar year of available data model d 2004 2018 provides forecasted probabilities of streamflow permanence for a given year based on climatic predictor variables that can be processed by june 1 for that year fig 2 a limitation of rf is its sensitivity to imbalances in the training data imbalances might have spatial and or temporal dependencies that must be considered during the model development sinha et al 2019 this is particularly true when analyzing environmental data because of the often inherent bias associated with nonrandom sampling designs e g streamflow observations from fish sampling datasets are biased toward wet since the sampling objective of locating fish will prioritize wet locations to overcome imbalances the observation data were first stratified by level ii ecoregion environmental protection agency 2018 and the majority streamflow class wet or dry within each of the three major ecoregions was randomly downsampled using the caret package in r kuhn 2019 to obtain an equal number of wet and dry streamflow observations from each level ii ecoregion for each model run level ii ecoregion designations were assigned using the dominant ecoregion overlapping the basin areas for example if 61 of the contributing area associated with an observation was in the western cordillera ecoregion and 39 of the contributing area was in the west central semi arid prairies ecoregion the site would be classified as western cordillera for the purposes of balancing the data the outcome of this procedure was a dataset containing an equal number of wet and dry streamflow observations in each level ii ecoregion in the study area because this process potentially removes information by filtering observations from the majority class within each ecoregion this process was repeated 10 times with replacement for each submodel the outputs of which were used for the final ensemble average fig 2 a set of hyperparameters were tuned to optimize the performance and accuracy of a rf model hyperparameters included the number of trees developed ntree the number of predictor variables randomly selected for consideration at each split within a tree mtry and the minimum terminal node size which is the minimum number of training data points in the terminal node of each tree nodesize generally ntree should be set high enough for the model to converge on a relatively stable accuracy for this study models were developed with the ntree parameter set at 200 500 and 1 000 trees models were tested with different values for mtry and the optimal value was selected based on the model with the highest classification accuracy final mean mtry values are shown for each model in fig 2 finally nodesize was not specified which allowed the model to develop trees that were unpruned this was deemed to be acceptable for this model because the final model outputs represented an ensemble of 10 individual models which we assume will effectively account for potential overfitting of the model model performance was determined using mean out of bag oob misclassification rate breiman 2001 and the kappa statistic cohen 1960 the default method of determining oob is to randomly select a subset of data to train the model i e training data and use the remaining data for testing i e test data however randomly selecting the training data can lead to overfitting and underestimation of model error especially if there are spatial biases in the density or distribution in the calibration data which is common with environmental data to provide a more robust estimate of model performance that accounts for spatial bias we implemented leave location out 10 fold cross validation llo meyer et al 2018 using the cast package in r meyer 2018 llo ensures the distribution of the response variable in each fold equals the distribution of the entire dataset by splitting the calibration data into training and test datasets with stratified random sampling meyer et al 2018 for this study the stratification for the llo data splitting was based on huc4 boundaries llo was repeated for each of the 10 model runs and all oob misclassification rates were averaged to produce a final ensemble oob misclassification rate for planning purposes resource managers may find it helpful to predict summer and fall streamflow permanence conditions earlier in the calendar year for example decisions on grazing permit allocation and stocking rates may benefit from streamflow permanence estimates provided in june to meet this need we developed another rf model that only included predictor variables available prior to june 1 the process for developing this forecasting model model d is the same as the process for developing model c with the following exceptions fig 2 1 june july and august monthly predictor variables of temperature precipitation and soil moisture are excluded from the model 2 ndvilag0 is not considered and 3 etlag0 is replaced with the et from the previous year etlag12 model predictions produced from models c and d for years beyond the original modeling period 1989 2018 are expected to be available through at least 2025 section 4 6 herein describes how to access and obtain the data 2 3 2 model evaluation external cross validation was performed for each huc4 in addition to internal model metrics i e oob accuracy and kappa statistic models were developed to test the accuracy of the prosperum model model c in each huc4 region by iteratively using all data within each huc4 as test data for example to test the accuracy of the prosperum model c in huc 1002 all data from huc 1002 were excluded from model training and used as test data model c was developed as described above and model predictions were compared to the observed data at observation sites in huc 1002 model performance for the huc was evaluated on mean balanced accuracy sensitivity number of true positives divided by the sum of true negatives and false positives and specificity number of true negatives divided by the sum of true negatives and false positives these processes were repeated for each huc4 in the domain model c was selected as the model to test individual huc4 regions because it represented the longest period of record with all predictor variables used the greatest number of observation data and can be used to make predictions in future years to assess how spatial and temporal imbalances in the training data might affect model predictions we compared the prediction bias of the model to the observation bias of the training data the prediction bias of the model was defined as the absolute difference between the sensitivity and specificity sensitivity and specificity were determined using the external cross validation predictions for the each huc4 region and out of bag predictions for each year the observation bias of the training data was defined as the absolute difference between the proportion of observations classified as wet and the proportion of observations classified as dry this was done for each huc4 region to investigate spatial bias and year with at least one wet and one dry observation to assess temporal bias variable importance the influence of a given predictor variable on the accuracy of a rf model archer and kimes 2008 can be quantified in two ways for classification models 1 the change in mean misclassification and 2 the change in node purity i e the homogeneity of observed classes in the terminal nodes of the model also known as the gini index archer and kimes 2008 for this study we used the change in mean misclassification as the metric to determine overall variable importance to calculate the mean misclassification rate for each rf model the prediction error on the test data was recorded for each of the 500 trees the prediction error was calculated again after excluding each predictor variable the difference between the two prediction error values was averaged over all trees and normalized by the standard deviation liaw and wiener 2002 additionally partial dependence plots were used to visualize how the predicted response of year round flow changed as a function of individual predictor variables in the rf model given the large geographic extent and heterogeneous landscape of the model domain predictor variables potentially had different levels of importance for streamflow permanence estimates in different areas of the domain thus casewise i e local variable importance was calculated for each predictor variable included in the final models using the randomforest liaw and wiener 2002 and caret kuhn 2019 packages in r like global variable importance casewise variable importance was computed by calculating the percent an observation or case was withheld as part of the test dataset out of bag and misclassified when the predictor variable of interest was excluded to visualize spatial patterns of casewise variable importance across the study area all casewise variable importance values were averaged across all model runs for each observation location variable importance maps were then created by spatially interpolating the mean casewise importance for each variable across the study domain at a spatial resolution of 3 km sando et al 2022 interpolation was done using empirical bayesian kriging gribov et al 2006 pilz and spöck 2018 with arcgis esri 2020b finally we conducted analyses to evaluate streamflow permanence across different hydroclimatic conditions at the huc8 and huc4 scale first we evaluated differences in streamflow permanence probability predictions between a climatically wet and dry year in three huc8 subbasins si table 1 the length of total stream network in each of the three huc 8 subbasins was computed for streams with prosperum probabilities above wet or below dry the classification threshold of 0 5 and are represented as perennial or non perennial respectively stream length with probabilities above and below the 0 5 threshold were computed for 2011 a climatically wet year and 2012 a climatically dry year wet and dry years were selected by evaluating the mean annual palmer drought severity index pdsi derived from gridmet abatzoglou 2012 and selecting the year with greatest wet and year with the least dry average value for our study area while it s possible that temporal autocorrelation could affect the results of this comparison we decided that the results could also provide valuable information regarding flashiness or susceptibility to relatively dramatic fluctuations from year to year of these basins thus 2011 and 2012 were retained as our wet and dry years for this purpose to ensure consistent predictions were assessed only years falling within the model c period 2004 2018 were considered differences in the spatial configuration and total stream length for predicted wet and dry streams i e probabilities above and below 0 5 respectively were visually assessed between years second we compared annual prosperum probabilities averaged for all nhdplus hr perennial streams nhdplus hydrographic category 46006 to annual prosperum predictions averaged for all nhdplus hr intermittent streams nhdplus hydrographic category 46003 at the huc4 scale to evaluate potential differences in interannual variability in streamflow permanence between stream classes designated in the nhdplus hr for the modeling period this analysis was done to provide a general comparison between prosper and the nhdplus hr which is commonly used in many resource management decision workflows e g grazing and energy development permitting on federally managed land despite the recognized error in the nhdplus hr streamflow permanence nhdplus hr streams classified as ephemeral were not included because of inconsistencies in the completeness of this class across the study area we evaluated prosperum probabilities in the context of drought years using the annual mean pdsi from the gridmet dataset abatzoglou 2012 averaged for each huc4 to test for significant change point years in the mean prosperum predictions associated with each nhd stream class we used pettitt tests pettitt 1979 with the r package trend pohlert 2020 we included all years of prediction for this analysis but it should be noted that differences in model inputs from models a b and c might have affected the analysis 2 3 3 exploration of sub annual predictions while the prosperum model provides probability of permanence at an annual level many water management decisions require sub annual context that can include seasonal monthly or daily timesteps scarcity of streamflow observation data for the study area prohibited extending random forest model development to sub annual probability of permanence predictions however as an exploratory step towards developing monthly probabilities of streamflow permanence prosperum model predictions were linked to output from a physically based streamflow model daily streamflow models tend to over predict low magnitude streamflow values farmer and vogel 2016 and often underestimate the occurrence of zero flow days therefore we explored the correlation between annual prosperum probabilities and the frequency with which a hydrologic model predicted daily streamflow below a threshold we used the usgs national hydrologic model configuration of the precipitation runoff modeling system nhm prms markstrom et al 2015 to demonstrate how daily hydrologic simulation may extend prosperum probabilities to a sub annual 30 day rolling values scale specifically we used nhm prms outflow as a general surrogate for surface streamflow the nhm prms provides approximately thirty years of daily outflow for many locations in the prosperum region here identified as points of interest pois daily predictions at each poi are referred to as outflow for that location s flowline segment outflow is often considered surface streamflow despite the potential that it may not represent water expressed above the surface in all cases that is an outflow prediction that is small may not be analogous to streamflow measured at a stream gage but instead may be subsurface flow at that poi however because there was not sufficient stream gage data to conduct this analysis in the study area nhm prms outflow was used as an approximation regression analysis was used to link annual prosperum predictions to nhm prms outflow we selected three huc8 subbasins described in section 2 1 fig 1 si table 1 for this analysis prosperum predictions for years corresponding to model c 2004 2018 were used to avoid introducing errors associated with differences in predictor variable sets because nhm prms data were available through 2016 the final time period for this analysis was 2004 2016 we extracted annual prosperum predictions and corresponding daily hydrologic model outputs at 129 nhm prms pois si table 1 that were located within the huc8 subbasins for each poi we partitioned the range of simulated outflow into 1 000 equal interval thresholds and calculated the annual frequency that simulated daily outflow was above each threshold we then calculated correlation coefficients between the nhm prms annual outflow frequencies with the prosperum annual stream permanence probabilities at each poi an optimal simulated threshold was selected for each poi using the maximum correlation coefficient finally ordinary least squares ols regression helsel and hirsch 2002 was used at each poi to predict the annual probability of permanence prosperum prediction as a function of the annual frequency of daily values above the optimal nhm prms threshold our ols regression approach to sub annual streamflow prediction was applied to 129 pois because the sub annual streamflow permanence predictions are only useful for sites that go dry sometime during a year the results were only summarized for pois associated with prosperum predictions that had at least one year with a value of less than 0 5 using the ols equations at each poi we predicted monthly streamflow permanence as a function of the frequency of daily values that are above the optimal thresholds 3 results 3 1 model performance the final ensemble mean classification accuracy of the leave location out 10 fold cross validation was 0 81 with a minimum and maximum accuracy of 0 79 and 0 83 respectively table 2 on average model a was the least accurate model mean accuracy of 0 80 this is not surprising as model a did not include any of the land cover predictor variables i e developed forest wetlands or snow water equivalent datasets models b and c had virtually the same performance which is likely an indication that the addition of snow water equivalent to model c was not a consistently important predictor variable of streamflow permanence across the domain a potential explanation for this is that predictor variables that are correlated with other more informative predictor variables have diminished variable importance in the model because of the splitting and bagging steps in the random forest algorithm on average swe variables had high positive correlation pearson s r rodgers and nicewander 1988 with multiple variables of greater importance including june soil moisture 0 62 elevation 0 64 and temperature in may and june 0 56 this suggests that the runoff mechanisms associated with swe were also explained by the information garnered from these other predictor variables the huc4 cross validation of prosperum model c shows that the eastern regions of the study area generally had slightly lower mean balanced accuracies 0 72 0 75 than huc4 basins in the western region 0 76 0 90 fig 3 this is likely because of the predictability of mountain runoff processes related to streamflow permanence and the complex nonlinear nature of hydrologic responses in prairie systems shook et al 2013 additionally huc4 basins in the eastern region of the model domain tended to have greater accuracy in correctly predicting streams going dry i e greater specificity and less accuracy in correctly predicting perennial flow i e lesser sensitivity while accuracy in the western region of the model domain was the opposite that is the eastern huc4 basins 1008 1010 1011 1012 1013 are more likely to be biased toward non perennial predictions while the regions in the west 1003 1005 1007 are more likely to be biased toward perennial predictions fig 3 the results of our comparison of prediction bias and observation bias for each huc4 region fig 4 a and year fig 4b show that the model predictions are potentially influenced by spatial and temporal imbalances in the training data there is a high degree of correlation between the observation bias and the prediction bias for the huc4 regions pearson s r of 0 83 p value 0 01 there also is a significant positive correlation between these two variables for each year of the model pearson s r of 0 42 p value 0 03 these results indicate that improvements to the model might be made by either incorporating stricter preprocessing steps in the model development or incorporating data that were collected with a more targeted sampling design intended to ensure the training data are balanced by spatial and temporal modeling units 3 2 importance and partial dependence of predictor variables drainage area was the most important predictor variable for all models a b c and d including drainage area improved the mean model accuracy by an average of 10 15 fig 5 the relative importance of the other predictor variables was similar for models b c and d but different for model a fig 5 for models b c and d the second and third most important predictor variables were proportion of basin classified as wetland and proportion of basin classified as developed respectively other important predictor variables included elevation green up characteristics of riparian vegetation ndvi harmonic regression coefficients and the climatic predictor variables of air temperature in may june and july and soil moisture in june interpolated casewise importance for the nine predictor variables with the greatest mean variable importance sando et al 2022 varied considerably across the study area fig 6 a few subtle patterns emerged with the interpolated importance of predictor variables across this large and heterogenous geographic domain first temperature predictor variables tjul tmay and tjun appear to have greater importance in the eastern third of the model domain second soil moisture swcjun appears to have greater importance in the western and eastern thirds of the model domain third ndvi appears to be less important along the eastern edge of the model domain these patterns do not clearly correspond to the level ii ecoregion boundaries or the density of observation data and do not appear to have strong longitudinal or elevation gradients also the lack of ndvi importance along the eastern edge is likely attributed to ndvi not being able to distinguish between riparian and upland vegetation that are supported by the presence of glacial till and shallow groundwater van der kamp and hayashi 2009 the interpolated casewise importance might not accurately represent conditions for all locations fig 6 particularly in areas with little or no calibration data fig 1 the patterns in areas with greater spatial density of streamflow observations might be more reliable as spatial density of observations points within each huc4 was shown to be weakly correlated with balanced accuracy pearson s r of 0 28 in addition the extents of the spatial layers that describe casewise importance are constrained by the extent of the calibration data because of the interpolation process so they do not cover the entire domain probability of year round flow depended substantially on the nine predictor variables with greatest mean variable importance fig 7 probabilities of year round flow remain low 0 25 for streams with small drainage area about 5 km2 and markedly increase beginning at approximately 10 km2 fig 7a streamflow probabilities of 0 5 occur consistently at drainage areas of approximately 30 km2 while this is not a surprise our analysis provides quantitative information on how streamflow permanence might change as a function of drainage area of ecological interest basins with even a relatively small proportion of drainage area classified as wetlands proportion equal to about 0 03 or about 3 are associated with a high probability of permanent streamflow fig 7b our results show a non linear relation between streamflow permanence and developed area streamflow permanence appears to increase as the proportion of developed area increases up to about 0 02 i e 2 of the basin for basins that exceed about 0 02 proportion developed area there does not appear to be a clear relation between streamflow permanence and developed area fig 7c developed area includes land surface types ranging from developed open spaces where impervious surfaces account for 0 20 of the total cover to highly developed areas where impervious surfaces account for 80 100 of the total cover mrlcc 2016 this predictor variable could include a range of developed land cover features including golf courses single family housing units commercial and industrial areas and roadways intuitively predicted probability of streamflow permanence is negatively correlated with mean basin air temperature i e tjul tmay and tjun fig 7d 6g and 6i and positively correlated with mean basin soil moisture i e swcjun fig 7h these monthly climate predictor variables strongly correlate with elevation the mean correlation pearson s r rodgers and nicewander 1988 between the swc variables and elevation is 0 7 and the mean correlation between the t variables and elevation is 0 51 weak correlations exist between ndvilag0 and monthly precipitation mean r of 0 2 monthly temperature mean r of 0 26 and monthly soil moisture mean r of 0 29 generally streamflow permanence probabilities are positively correlated with elevation showing decreased probabilities 0 5 at lower 1500 m and increased probabilities 0 5 at higher elevations 2000 m notably there is a decrease in predicted probabilities associated with the greatest elevation in our sample data 3000 m however this decrease appears to be driven by a relatively small number of observations that might not be representative of the full dataset on average the western portion of the umrb had higher probabilities of streamflow permanence and lower variation in the probability of streamflow permanence than the eastern portion fig 8 there also is a clear band of greater standard deviations in the northwest corner of south dakota though the cause of this greater standard deviation is unclear there tends to be lower standard deviations in the western cordillera and cold deserts ecoregions e g southern portion of huc 1008 and eastern portion of 1013 3 3 differential response in streamflow permanence to hydroclimatic conditions comparing streamflow permanence predictions for climatically wet and dry years for the three huc8 subbasins illustrates how different regions within the larger upper missouri river basin respond to different hydroclimatic conditions fig 9 si table 1 generally streamflow permanence predictions for streams at higher elevations in the smith river and upper tongue river basins were more stable between climatically wetter and drier years as evidenced by the lack of contraction of perennial streams in the climatically dry year of 2012 fig 9 the proportion of stream network in the smith and upper tongue river basins predicted to have year round flow changed from about 18 3 and 18 8 percent in 2011 to about 14 8 and 16 8 percent in 2012 respectively in contrast the redwater river basin which represents a lower elevation climatically drier prairie basin si table 1 shows a marked contraction of perennial flow in 2012 the climatically dry year the proportion of stream network predicted to have year round flow changed from about 8 3 percent in 2011 to about 2 2 percent in 2012 a difference of about 6 1 percent compared to the 3 4 and 1 9 percent difference of the other two subbasins while these changes in overall proportion of stream network seem small they represent potentially substantial differences in the relative length of perennial streams in wet and dry years in particular redwater river basin was predicted to lose about 73 of their perennial stream length in 2012 relative to 2011 conversely smith and upper tongue river basins were predicted to lose about 19 and 10 respectively in that same time frame our comparison of annual mean prosperum predictions for nhdplus hr perennial and intermittent streams shows that the prosperum model clearly differentiates between the two nhdplus stream classes of perennial and intermittent with higher probabilities corresponding to nhdplus streams classified as perennial compared to intermittent streams fig 10 prosperum probabilities associated with nhdplus hr perennial streams show a greater correlation with pdsi mean r of 0 31 than prosperum probabilities associated with nhdplus hr intermittent streams which show no correlation with pdsi mean r 0 001 fig 10 streamflow permanence probabilities show statistically significant changes through time fig 10 five huc4 regions 1003 1007 1008 1009 1012 had significant change points for predictions averaged across nhd perennial streams except for 1003 all regions with significant change points associated with predictions at nhd perennial stream classes were located along the southern extent of our domain significant change point years ranged from 2003 to 2006 for predictions at nhd perennial streams four huc4 regions 1003 1004 1007 1012 had significant change points for predictions averaged across nhd intermittent streams significant change point years included 2001 2004 and 2007 it is important to note that significant change points in prosperum predictions might be an indication of nonstationarity introduced by the inclusion of different predictor variables in the models this could be particularly true when the change point years coincide with changes in the predictor variables used in the model 2001 2004 however despite the potential limitations results may at least partially be associated with hydroclimatology based on the coincident changes in pdsi across the domain and the documented severity of drought in the region cook et al 2009 martin et al 2020 there is a marked dip in pdsi from 2000 to 2010 in the study area that represents what is referred to as the turn of the century drought and is described as more severe than any other drought on record in the basin fig 10 decreases in streamflow permanence probabilities at least for the perennial streams approximately correspond to this drought period fig 10 further change in modeling structure that occurred in 2001 and 2004 that corresponds to more significant change points identified in 2004 was limited to the inclusion of the snow water equivalent swe which ranked low highest rank is 23 out of 36 predictor variables in variable importance plots for the model fig 5 3 4 exploration of sub annual streamflow permanence predictions of the 129 pois in the three huc8 subbasins 48 had at least one year of prosperum predictions below 0 5 which was the default threshold for classifying the location as perennial both the smith and upper tongue river basins had relatively small percentages of non perennial predictions 9 percent and 28 percent respectively whereas the red river basin had 88 percent of prosperum predictions that were non perennial the mean r squared value for all pois with at least one year of non perennial prosperum predictions was 0 44 fig 11 however the highest mean r squared values reached 0 8 there does not appear to be a geographic correspondence for pois that have higher mean r squared values fig 11 and higher mean r squared values generally corresponded to a relatively broader range of prosperum probabilities above and below the 0 5 threshold si fig 1 among the pois with at least one prediction of non perennial flow there was a moderate inverse correlation between the r squared values at each site and the associated strahler stream order r 0 28 example plot configurations showing the prms daily hydrograph scatterplot of frequency above threshold and annual prosperum prediction first through fifth quantile of the 30 day moving frequency above threshold which represents how frequencies change throughout a given year at the example pois sub annual prediction based on ols regression and joint plot of annual prosperum and daily probability of streamflow are shown in si fig 1 in general the scarcity of pois that have non perennial flow and subsequent limitations in the strength of robust correlations between prosperum predictions and the frequency of prms flows above threshold limits subsequent robust predictions of sub annual flow and no flow periods e g si fig 1 the lack of non perennial systems represented in the prms data can largely be attributed to the fact that the prms hydrography is based on the coarser 30 m medium resolution national hydrography dataset that has been shown to underrepresent stream channels especially for non perennial streams roy et al 2009 nevertheless this exercise serves as a potential approach that can be built upon with additional modeled streamflow data for non perennial pois 4 discussion 4 1 towards dynamic streamflow permanence modeling stream networks expand and contract through time as a function of antecedent hydroclimatic conditions fritz et al 2013 moidu et al 2021 van meerveld et al 2019 however monitoring this phenomenon is challenging posing subsequent challenges to modeling streamflow permanence the prosper models prosperum and prosperpnw have established a means to model streamflow permanence with streamflow data that are spatially and temporally sparse the accuracy of both models is similar 0 80 0 82 which is attributed in part to having observational data that represent a sufficient range of climatically wet and dry years that includes at least a decade of data across the spatial domain thus while the calibration data lack extensive records at individual locations in the domain the assumption is that the potential relations between the predictor variables and streamflow permanence are captured within the population of calibration data this approach has been shown to be useful in similar environmental analyses e g lester et al 2014 zografou et al 2020 accuracy of the prosper models might also represent an approximation of the explanatory power that is possible without including data to adequately represent major consumptive water use categories e g public supply withdrawals diversions etc as neither model included adequate information on this component it is possible that for streams and rivers that have been modified by human activities prosperum model outputs might have reduced accuracy the implications of not including adequate data that capture the effects of human modification are likely to be pronounced for areas that have a greater degree of modification in our study area irrigated agriculture is likely to be an indicator of streams that might have greater misclassification rates because of stream withdrawals that aren t accounted for in the model for example a stream that experiences large withdrawals associated with agriculture might be predicted to be permanent based on hydroclimatic conditions but be nonpermanent because of the influence of the withdrawals on the total water in the system these model inaccuracies could provide the basis for studying the effect of the human footprint on streamflow permanence thus an important next step is to improve our ability to incorporate anthropogenic mechanisms that influence streamflow permanence annual and forecasted growing season predictions using nhdplus hr hydrography represent an improvement in spatial resolution on previous models of comparable geographic extent that use a coarser hydrography and are likely limited in capturing the headwater network for example prosperpnw was developed from the nhdplus mr derived from 30 m elevation data snelder et al 2013 provided predictions for stream segments with minimum drainage area of 2 5 km2 excluding some headwater streams of smaller drainage area with increasingly available highly detailed lidar derived hydrography and more accessible high powered computation modeling of streamflow permanence is expected at finer spatial resolution e g jensen et al 2018 warix et al 2021 for increasingly larger geographic extents increased accuracy in the hydrographic representation of the stream channel network would likely improve the applicability of the prosper models and similar stream characteristic models given that the consequences of many management decisions are location specific examples include grazing permits that are based on predicted probabilities of surface water availability and condition for specific streams knapp et al 2020 or buffer width requirements along streams in timber harvest activities that are based on presence of physical channels and in many cases the streamflow permanence classifications kampf et al 2021 additional datasets and new statistical approaches such as physics guided deep learning e g xie et al 2021 might facilitate finer temporal resolution at monthly to daily timesteps by coupling physically based model outputs with empirical data e g streamflow observations york et al 2020 using customized loss functions these new statistical approaches can potentially make use of the finer resolution e g daily of physics based model outputs while penalizing the model using the sparser empirical data data beyond one time streamflow observations for a location will be required and is becoming more possible with citizen crowd source science efforts such as stream tracker kampf et al 2018 or crowdwater seibert et al 2017 and governmental science efforts like flowper jaeger et al 2020 resource managers often have a need for information about future conditions of the resources they manage to avoid overburdening the resource by including predictor variables that are available 2 5 months before the low flow season model d of prosperum presents a first step toward meeting this need this approach of using currently available input data to forecast the probability of future streamflow permanence could be advanced by conducting detailed analyses of optimal lead times for forecasts as well as a more in depth exploration of the use of lagged predictor variables 4 1 1 importance of balanced training data intuitively data driven models are recognized to be heavily influenced by the structure of the data used to train the models this poses a particular challenge when dealing with environmental data especially if the data have been collected or aggregated opportunistically from other previous studies as is the case with the prosper models the reason for this is because it is difficult to design a sampling scheme that accurately captures the true distribution of the phenomenon of interest while also characterizing the full distribution of predictor variable data associated with each class rather these types of studies are often limited by site accessibility e g road stream crossings unknown distribution parameters for the phenomenon of interest changing conditions or inadequate predictor variable data resolution or availability the results of our comparison of prediction bias and observation bias show that prediction bias will potentially be reduced if the sample used to train the data represent a balanced dataset for whatever scale or spatial unit the modeling is being done at fig 4b further environmental data often have a non random temporal structure that should be considered when developing a sampling design for example streams typically have high and low flow periods in each year however these seasonal characteristics are often not considered or not relevant to the study objectives when streamflow permanence data are collected resulting in data that are not temporally balanced fig 4b evidence of this in our study is shown in the distribution of wet and dry streamflow observation frequency across months si fig 2 as streamflow permanence modeling moves toward sub annual predictions collecting data that provide a distribution balanced across the time step of interest e g months will be important 4 2 influence of land cover types on streamflow permanence predictions in the upper missouri river basin 4 2 1 importance of wetlands and riparian vegetation our analysis shows that after contributing area proportion of land cover as wetlands is the second most important variable in the model and that presence of wetlands corresponds to predictions of year round flow in streams wetlands both hydrologically isolated and connected have been shown to be a crucial component of the hydrologic landscape epting et al 2018 mclaughlin et al 2014 wetlands can store and subsequently release surface runoff which regulates surface inundation and increases the length of time that surface water is present on the landscape evenson et al 2018 additionally wetlands including non floodplain wetlands and surface water storage features increase soil moisture and saturation increasing baseflow in some systems buttle 2018 lane et al 2018 in particular wetlands within the prairie region including local to the study area have been shown to contribute to baseflow throughout the summer ameli and creed 2019 brooks et al 2018 the relatively small basin proportion as wetland 0 03 or 3 associated with mean streamflow permanence probabilities above 0 5 was unexpected but may reflect a sensitive connection between wetland presence and availability of surface flow it should be noted that our results do not imply the relation between streamflow permanence and wetlands is causal it might be there is some underlying mechanism not included in the model that causes greater proportion of wetlands and greater likelihood of streamflow permanence for example the presence of wetlands in a watershed is an indicator of elevated water tables which may be due to local geology and or soils in such cases streamflow permanence may be more likely because of groundwater seepage and not the wetlands per se because of these complexities further research is needed to identify the mechanisms underlying apparent connections between streamflow permanence and wetlands however the potential importance of even a small amount of wetlands to baseflow lends credence to such streamflow restoration tools like wet meadow restoration nash et al 2019 and other process based approaches that promote local storage of water to support surface flow pollock et al 2014 wheaton et al 2019 our results also indicated that the timing and degree of vegetation green up as captured with the harmonic regression coefficients of ndvi values were important to the model greater values of the harmonic regression coefficients of ndvi representing higher and longer periods of greenness are associated with greater probabilities of streamflow permanence these results agree with other work that has shown that differences in streamflow permanence class correspond to differences in vegetative characteristics in semiarid riparian zones which is attributed to spatial patterns in consistent availability of shallow groundwater stromberg et al 2010 gendaszek et al 2020 sabathier et al 2021 warix et al 2021 in our study higher values of the ndvi harmonic regression coefficients identify vegetation is not water limited consequently high ndvi harmonic regression coefficients may be proxies for regions of available surface water and shallow groundwater given the known connections between vegetative health and degree of photosynthetic activity and timing and magnitude of water availability aguilar et al 2012 liu et al 2019 including differential characteristics of vegetation greenness through ndvi harmonic regression which may capture timing and magnitude can improve model skill in predicting streamflow permanence 4 2 2 developed area our results show that developed area is the third most important variable for predicting annual streamflow permanence the effects of urbanization and developed area on streamflow have been investigated in multiple studies eng et al 2013 wang and cai 2010 white and greer 2006 past research on the effects of urbanization and developed area on low flows has resulted in conflicting conclusions costigan et al 2016 some studies have concluded that baseflow has increased because of increased urbanization in specific watersheds brandes et al 2005 rosburg et al 2017 roy et al 2009 wang and cai 2010 while others have shown that urbanization decreases baseflow simmons and reynolds 1982 or had inconsistent results chang 2006 mechanistic explanations for urbanization decreasing streamflow have included reduced infiltration and groundwater recharge ferguson and suckling 1990 and groundwater pumping resulting in a lowered water table postel 2000 conversely mechanistic explanations provided for urbanization increasing streamflow include high densities of septic systems leaky pipes from municipality infrastructure and lawn irrigation all of which can offset losses from increased runoff on impervious surfaces lerner 2002 gungle 2005 in our study a low amount of development less than 2 of the basin was associated with higher streamflow permanence which declined with moderate increases in development less than 5 total fig 7 these results may reflect a threshold associated with the percent of a basin that is impervious below which the effects of development typically increase streamflow permanence however if this threshold is exceeded the loss of recharge and infiltration outweighs the potential gains from septic systems and irrigation reducing the probability of streamflow permanence it also is possible that the relation between streamflow permanence and proportion of the basin as developed is not causal but may indicate the presence of an underlying mechanism that promotes both development and streamflow permanence as may be the case for the connection between streamflow permanence and wetlands specifically development may be concentrated in wetter basins or along perennial streams because of the services they provide in this case development is an outcome of high streamflow permanence despite connections between streamflow permanence and the developed land cover class in our model more work is needed to identify underlying hydrologic mechanisms for these connections 4 3 interannual variability of streamflow permanence and drought hydroclimatic conditions influence streamflow permanence with decreases in streamflow permanence during climatically dry and drought conditions ward et al 2020 zipper et al 2021 understanding interannual variability and longer term responses in streamflow permanence is crucial to recognizing where ecosystems might be most sensitive to change it also provides the ability to understand how habitat for critical species both aquatic and terrestrial might change under future conditions and where remediation efforts might be most effective the outputs from prosperum can be used to assess interannual variability because of the annual resolution of the outputs in our analysis of three huc8 subbasins there is variability in extent of expansion and contraction of perennial reaches in wet and dry years respectively fig 9 our comparison of predicted perennial stream length prosperum prediction above 0 5 for three huc8 subbasins in a climatically wet year 2011 and climatically dry year 2012 provides some insight into the degree of sensitivity to changing climatic conditions in the study area in particular the huc8 subbasin with the lowest mean elevation and mean annual precipitation appears to be more sensitive to climatically dry years based on the apparent substantial expansion of streams with low streamflow permanence probabilities in 2012 compared to the other huc8 subbasins these results agree with other work that suggests that mountain streams may have some sensitivity to changing climate conditions ward et al 2020 moidu et al 2021 however they also highlight potential higher sensitivity of lower elevation catchments in streamflow permanence to shifts towards climatically drier conditions which has not been investigated in a comparative sense regarding streamflow permanence prosperum might be able to detect periods of drought when multiple years are drier than normal for example decreases in streamflow permanence probabilities are evident in all huc4 basins for nhd perennial streams fig 8 corresponding to the severe drought from 2000 to 2010 in the upper missouri river basin cook et al 2009 martin et al 2020 interestingly there is not a similarly obvious change in streamflow permanence predictions associated with nhd non perennial intermittent streams however this difference makes sense as the non perennial streams are already classified as dry and therefore will not have a similar response during drought there are five huc4 regions that have significant change points for predictions associated with nhd perennial stream classes and four that have significant change points for predictions associated with nhd intermittent stream classes fig 10 the mean change point year for predictions associated with nhd perennial stream classes is about 2005 while the mean for predictions associated with nhd intermittent streams is 2004 if the assumption that the change in model outputs is showing a response to the drought conditions in the basin the results of this analysis might provide valuable information into the relation between streamflow permanence and climate change interestingly the results show that some huc4s seem to have recovered after the turn of the century drought with increases in streamflow permanence probabilities corresponding to years of positive pdsi following the 2000 2010 drought while others have not this result of different response to drought conditions is in alignment with other work that studied the effect of drought on baseflow in the russian river of coastal california deitch et al 2018 the results of that study suggested that for some streams subsurface and pathways that provide summer baseflow are not replenished in dry years further stoelzle et al 2014 show that geology type and permeability might affect streamflow response and recovery to drought scenarios thus understanding how drought will affect streamflow permanence in the upper missouri river basin will likely require more analyses on underlying geology and the role of groundwater resources in streamflow permanence in the basin again it is important to note that it remains unclear whether this variance in predicted streamflow permanence is a result of changes in hydroclimatic conditions i e drought or an indication of the effect of including additional predictor variables in the model however because of reasons provided in section 3 3 we believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that the changes seen in the model outputs are due to changes in the hydroclimatology i e drought rather than changes in the modeling structure 4 4 sub annual permanence analysis the goal of this analysis was to investigate the feasibility of coupling two independent models with different temporal resolution annual vs daily and modeling structure empirical vs process based to estimate sub annual streamflow permanence our results show that linking hydrologic physically based models and prosperum empirical model presents a method for sub annual characterization of streamflow permanence and could be used to improve streamflow models themselves hydrologic models may benefit from improved characterizations of streamflow permanence in that they can account for the probability of zero flows without explicitly driving models to extreme lows in calibration or application conversely process based models with finer temporal resolution might provide a mechanism for providing information on the hydroperiod or timing of flow for a stream the negative correlation between the r squared values and strahler stream order suggests that the link between hydrologic system models and streamflow permanence models is stronger for lower order streams reflecting the influence of consistency in the model mechanisms at lower stream order it is also possible that there might be fewer anthropogenic influences on these lower order streams reducing the influences that are unaccounted for in the respective models to further investigate the linkages between prosperum and streamflow models study sites could be developed where long term multiple years spanning wet and dry conditions observations of the presence or absence of streamflow is routinely available the current network of streamgages is insufficient in that it is biased toward locations with permanent flow identifying sites with fluctuation between flowing and non flowing states over a longer time horizon i e years and monitoring the site on a regular interval e g weekly or monthly will support the development of sub annual prosperum predictions 4 5 limitations beyond the limitations of any predictive models a number of specific limitations should be considered when using or analyzing the prosperum outputs hydrographic network errors associated with the nhdplus hr beta e g false disconnections in the stream network might affect the reliability of the results huc4 regions were processed independently so predictions along rivers that cross huc4 boundaries might not be valid water use and regulation were not considered in the model architecture so regulated streams or streams with many diversions might not be reliably represented in the model the model used different predictor variable sets for different time periods so different models a b c and d might not have comparable results while the spatial resolution of the predictions is set at 10 meters consistent with the nhdplus hr many of the gridded predictor variable input datasets had coarser resolution so the effective resolution of prosperum predictions is coarser than 10 m additionally there are limitations associated with the sub annual streamflow permanence analysis the prms hydrography is based on the nhdplus mr which is different than the hydrography of prosperum while we ensured the points we used were on corresponding locations differences in these datasets might affect the reliability of this analysis ordinary least squares as with most regression modeling methods performs poorly when extrapolating predictions therefore the model works best for locations that have a good range of prosperum predictions above and below 0 5 to ensure adequate end points for the model to predict within 5 conclusion the prosperum model builds on prior probabilistic streamflow permanence modeling sando and blasch 2015 jaeger et al 2019 to provide annual predictions of year round flow at a 10 m spatial resolution on nhdplus hr hydrography that better captures headwater streams for a large geographic and physiographically heterogeneous extent the model includes three sequential time periods to maximize use of the past period of record of observation and predictor variable data extending from 1989 to 2018 and for years going forward to at least 2025 in addition the model provides preliminary forecasted probabilities based on early season climatic conditions to support land resource managers as an exploratory step prosperum model predictions were linked to output derived from physically based streamflow models as a potential approach towards monthly probabilities of streamflow permanence the final ensemble mean classification accuracy was 0 81 and the five most important predictor variables were drainage area wetlands developed area air temperature in july and ndvi harmonic regression coefficients analysis of three headwater subbasins in climatically wet and dry years revealed variability in differences in streamflow permanence among the different watersheds reflecting different sensitivities of watersheds to hydroclimatic conditions 6 data accessibility all prosperum model outputs are available as 10 m resolution rasters and can

endorsement by the u s government appendix a streamflow observations collected using remote sensing to supplement the streamflow observation dataset high resolution satellite imagery and aerial photographs included in the esri imagery basemap collection esri 2020a were used for obtaining additional streamflow conditions a series of steps were followed to ensure this method did not introduce additional bias into the model first 500 points were randomly placed along national hydrography dataset plus high resolution nhdplus hr flowlines classified as a stream ftype streamriver similarly an additional 600 points were randomly placed along nhdplus hr streams classified as a stream and having a strahler stream order of 1 or 2 to ensure adequate representation of headwater streams second

8545,the presence of year round surface water in streams i e streamflow permanence is an important factor for identifying aquatic habitat availability determining the regulatory status of streams managing land use change allocating water resources and designing scientific studies however accurate high resolution and dynamic prediction of streamflow permanence that accounts for year to year variability at a regional extent is a major gap in modeling capability herein we expand and adapt the u s geological survey usgs probability of streamflow permanence prosper model from its original implementation in the pacific northwest prosperpnw to the upper missouri river basin prosperum a geographical region that includes mountain and prairie ecosystems of the northern united states prosperum is an empirical model used to estimate the probability that a stream channel has year round flow in response to climatic conditions monthly and annual and static physiographic predictor variables of the upstream basin the structure and approach of prosperum are generally consistent with the prosperpnw model but include improved spatial resolution 10 m and a longer modeling period average model accuracy was 81 drainage area upstream proportion as wetlands and upstream proportion as developed land cover were the most important predictor variables the prosperum model identifies decreases in streamflow permanence during climatically drier years although there is variability in the magnitude across basins highlighting geographically varying sensitivity to drought variability in the response of perennial streams to drought conditions among basins in the study area was also observed keywords prosper non perennial perennial intermittent random forest climate change streamflow observations streamflow permanence data availability all data used in this research are available through sources provided in the manuscript 1 introduction burgeoning research in the last two decades has highlighted the ecological importance of streamflow permanence whether a stream flows year round or not and non perennial streams allen et al 2020 datry et al 2017 hale and godsey 2019 non perennial streams streams that periodically cease to flow busch et al 2020 constitute over half of the total channel length of the global river network messager et al 2021 and are expected to increase in extent as a result of shifts in drought frequency and magnitude from climate change brooks 2009 dai 2013 ward et al 2020 zipper et al 2021 and water resources development chiu et al 2017 falke et al 2011 perkin et al 2015 despite this knowledge accurate dynamic prediction forecasting and mapping of perennial and non perennial streams and rivers within the united states jaeger et al 2019 price et al 2021 and globally van meerveld et al 2020 is difficult and remains a gap both from the data and modeling perspective within the united states comparison of the national hydrography dataset nhd streamflow permanence classifications of perennial intermittent and ephemeral streams with field observations indicates misclassification of up to 50 for headwater streams fritz et al 2013 hafen et al 2020 additionally streamflow permanence may change through time with changes in climate godsey and kirchner 2014 ward et al 2020 large uncertainty in the classification of headwater streams which can account for more than 70 of stream channels benstead and leigh 2012 has consequences for land and water resource managers charged with administering water rights delineating riparian buffers and developing environmental impact assessments related to timber harvests and energy and mineral extraction kampf et al 2021 consequently there is a pressing need for more accurate prediction of streamflow permanence at finer spatial and temporal scales the need for accurate prediction of streamflow permanence information is highlighted by regulatory definitions first introduced in the federal water pollution control act fwpca 1972 commonly known as the clean water act cwa the cwa defined three classes of streamflow permanence perennial intermittent and ephemeral which are used to determine regulatory jurisdiction and related rules and revisions of stream classes under the cwa in recent years aspects of the cwa have been revised to include or exclude portions e g connected waterbodies or entire classes e g ephemeral of streams usepa and usace 2020 while it is recognized that these changes might have substantial implications the current state of cartographic and hydrographic representation of streamflow permanence classes is arguably inadequate to quantify the full impact of these changes to the cwa fesenmyer et al 2021 leibowitz et al 2008 usepa and usace 2020 there have been many recent modeling efforts aimed at improving prediction and mapping of perennial and non perennial streams these models vary in geographic extent from global messager et al 2021 national or regional scales snelder et al 2013 yu et al 2018 to individual watersheds and more local scales jensen et al 2018 pate et al 2020 moidu et al 2021 and extend beyond classification of streamflow permanence to include timing of surface water presence beaufort et al 2019 gendaszek et al 2020 kaplan et al 2022 a critical feature of many of these streamflow permanence modeling efforts is that they rely on the aggregation and collection of categorical streamflow observations e g mcshane et al 2017 which are substantially more spatially abundant than long term or continuous streamflow measurements jaeger et al 2021 categorical observations of flow or no flow are a departure from conventional time series streamflow data and their surrogates which are prohibitively costly to implement at the spatial extents necessary to accurately capture the variability in streamflow permanence jaeger et al 2021 included in these models is the united states geological survey s usgs probability of streamflow permanence prosper model jaeger et al 2019 which was originally developed for the pacific northwest prosperpnw and estimates the probability a 30 m stream segment has streamflow for an entire calendar year annual predictions 2004 2016 are based on static physiographic covariates coupled with climatic data the prosperpnw model uses an empirical machine learning approach which has been used in other streamflow permanence efforts messager et al 2021 snelder et al 2013 and has increasing application in water resources modeling tyralis et al 2019 building on the methods developed for prosperpnw the usgs has developed a prosper model for the upper missouri river basin prosperum fig 1 the objectives of the prosperum modeling effort was to 1 improve the spatial and temporal resolution of streamflow permanence estimates in the upper missouri river basin umrb 2 develop a machine learning method for forecasting streamflow permanence 3 identify important drivers predictor variables of streamflow permanence and apparent differential response to climatic conditions between perennial and non perennial streams in the umrb and 4 distribute model results in a manner that facilitates easy incorporation into water resources decision making our work advances the science of streamflow permanence modeling by developing predictive methods that can be implemented at a high spatial resolution here defined as a sub reach scale of 10 m and applied at the regional scale while having the capability of forecasting streamflow permanence up to five months in advance further while there have been other streamflow permanence modeling efforts at larger spatial extents e g global messager et al 2021 the prosper models are the only regional scale probabilistic models with annual outputs which is crucial for understanding interannual variability and temporal trends in the predictions 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the umrb is defined here as the portion of the missouri river basin upstream from lake oahe in south dakota and includes much of montana western north dakota and south dakota and the northern half of wyoming fig 1 we define the umrb as 12 headwater subregions of the missouri river 4 digit hydrologic unit codes huc4s 1002 1013 fig 1 that constitute approximately 627 000 km2 or about 46 of the missouri river s full drainage basin huc4 subregions were used to partition the predictor variable and response data for more efficient geospatial processing and effective model fitting the geographic extent of huc4 is a sufficiently small sub regional unit to evaluate and describe streamflow permanence within the larger modeling domain streams that flow into study area subregions from canada were excluded from the prosperum model domain because of missing or inconsistent data elevation in the umrb ranges from about 511 m in the eastern plains to 4 180 m in the western mountains bedrock geology of umrb is dominated by sedimentary rock in the northern and eastern plains and igneous and metamorphic rock in the mountains of the south and west schruben et al 1994 bedrock in the umrb is overlain with unconsolidated alluvial and glacial lacustrine sediments glacial till and other residual materials schruben et al 1994 three level ii ecoregions environmental protection agency 2018 which are useful for describing the landscape in the context of climate terrain soils and vegetation at a regional scale make up most of the umrb the west central and south central semi arid prairies account for approximately 75 of the umrb the western margin of the umbr is dominated by the western cordillera ecoregion and a localized area in the southwestern portion of the study area falls in the cold deserts ecoregion fig 1 all three ecoregions in the study area are characterized by cold winters 5 0 c normal 1990 2020 mean temperature for december through february prism 2020 summers are generally warmer in the cold deserts and semi arid prairies compared to the western cordillera although average temperatures are cooler in northern latitudes mean annual precipitation ranges from 300 mm to 2500 mm in the cordillera mountains with increasing precipitation at higher elevations precipitation in the deserts and prairies is patchier and ranges from 130 to 550 mm three 8 digit huc huc8 subbasins were chosen to demonstrate spatiotemporal variation of prosperum streamflow permanence predictions across hydroclimatic and physiographic characteristics and for exploratory analysis to develop sub annual streamflow permanence predictions si table 1 fig 1 the three huc8 subbasins were selected based on availability of streamflow observation data and to represent different hydroclimatic regions mountain prairie and transition 2 2 data 2 2 1 streamflow observations the prosperum models were calibrated using point observation data that were aggregated from multiple public and private entities 8 785 streamflow observations si table 2 york et al 2020 the data collected represent multiple studies with potentially different objectives and sampling designs e g continuous streamflow monitoring discrete streamflow measurements qualitative streamflow assessments new data were also collected for this study using aerial photographs and high resolution sub 3 meter satellite imagery esri 2020a to identify the presence or absence of surface water at randomly selected sites along streams in the study area methods detailed in appendix a all observational data were reduced to wet dry or pooled categories wet streamflow observations are defined as observations with clear indications of flowing water e g measured streamflow greater than 0 or clearly described flowing conditions in notes associated with observations dry streamflow observations are defined as observations with clear indications of dry conditions e g measured streamflow of 0 or clearly described no flow dry conditions in notes associated with observations pooled streamflow observations refer to conditions specified as pooled or not flowing in the data observation points were snapped to the 10 m nhdplus hr stream grid as described in york sando and heldmyer 2020 each dataset was processed individually using r r core team 2020 with the packages sp pebesma and bivand 2005 raster hijmans 2020 rgdal bivand et al 2020 rgeos bivand and rundel 2021 and maptools bivand and lewin koh 2021 the streamflow observation data were filtered to meet certain quality control criteria for possible inclusion in the development of the prosperum model all streamflow observation data collected prior to the initial year of the modeling period 1989 were excluded data on streams with drainage areas that extend into canada were excluded because of inconsistent or missing predictor variable data there data on streams with drainage areas greater than 100 square kilometers were excluded to avoid biasing the model toward large perennial rivers inclusion of an observation also required sufficient information to make a classification of wet or dry at that location on the stream channel for example a streamflow discharge measurement or visual description of site conditions was sufficient but water quality field measurements as a proxy for water presence or absence were not considered adequate pooled streamflow observations were excluded because they only represented less than three percent of the total number of streamflow observations 127 4 763 and were likely underrepresented in the database if multiple streamflow observations of the same category e g wet or dry in the same location and year existed the last observation in that year for each class was retained if a location had multiple streamflow observations with different categories e g wet and dry in a single year the last dry observation was retained as the final condition for that year all wet observations made before august 1 were excluded from the model to minimize the potential of including wet observations that might become dry later in the year after all filters were applied to the data 4636 3111 wet and 1525 dry streamflow observations remained for model development fig 1 2 2 2 climatic and physiographic predictor variables to capture the drivers of streamflow permanence in the study area 36 predictor variables representing temporally static physiographic characteristics and temporally dynamic hydroclimatic conditions were included in the prosperum model table 1 predictor variables were selected based on prior results from prosperpnw and prior studies related to controls on streamflow and baseflow in the study area or hydrologically similar basins e g jencso and mcglynn 2011 ahiablame et al 2017 gendaszek et al 2020 predictor variables were also constrained by data availability and spatial and temporal coverage of the datasets except for two climatic datasets evapotranspiration and normalized difference vegetation index ndvi harmonic regression coefficients all predictor variable datasets were downloaded directly from the links provided in table 1 actual evapotranspiration datasets were created in google earth engine gorelick et al 2017 using the operational simplified surface energy balance ssebop senay et al 2013 algorithm following the methods of senay 2018 and schauer and senay 2019 with ndvi data obtained from landsat 5 7 and 8 and reference evapotranspiration data obtained from the gridded surface meteorological dataset gridmet abatzoglou 2012 annual growing season may 1 october 31 actual evapotranspiration was estimated using ssebop for 1985 2018 the ndvi harmonic regression coefficients were created in google earth engine using ndvi products derived from landsat 5 7 and 8 more information on the creation of these two datasets including the google earth engine script used to create the ndvi harmonic regression coefficients is provided in the metadata of the data release for this study sando et al 2022 predictor variables were processed into flow conditioned parameter grids fcpg which capture the upstream conditions for a given predictor variable for every grid cell in a stream network e g barnhart et al 2021 flow conditioned parameter grids for prosperum were generated using nhdplus hr beta flow direction grids u s geological survey 2017 for the huc4s encompassing the prosperum domain the fcpgs were based on the stream network grid defined as any grid cell with a drainage area of 0 01 square kilometers or greater use of this drainage area threshold on the nhdplus hr beta flow accumulation grids produced a more consistent and denser stream network that better captured small headwater streams than only using the stream grid representing flowlines included in the nhdplus hr kampf et al 2021 flow direction grids and the source grids for all predictor variables considered in the models table 1 were downloaded to the usgs yeti supercomputer falgout and gordon 2019 for fcpg creation the predictor variable source grids were processed into fcpgs using the flow conditioned parameter grid tools fcpg tools barnhart et al 2020 the fcpg tools generate grids where each pixel contains the average upstream basin value of an input grid such as monthly precipitation the proportion of an upstream basin occupied by a value such as a land cover class or the result of a localized decay function where input values are weighted by the inverse of their distance to a stream channel such that values on the uplands would have less impact than values within the riparian corridor i e decayed the first two types of fcpgs average and proportion were used in prosperpnw jaeger et al 2019 while the third decayed is new for prosperum but has been implemented in other efforts mcshane and eddy miller 2021 additionally the ndvi harmonic regression coefficients drainage area and higher resolution 30 m evapotranspiration datasets sando et al 2022 were included as new variables in prosperum to account for regional differences in streamflow permanence drivers generally the fcpg tools require two inputs 1 a flow direction grid with values indicating the direction that water would flow across the landscape and 2 a predictor variable dataset to be conditioned using the flow direction grid the predictor variable dataset is either a grid of values for continuous predictor variables such as precipitation totals or a grid of ones and zeroes indicating the presence or absence respectively of categorical data such as a land cover class for decayed fcpgs a weighting grid is needed as a third input to indicate how input predictor variable influence decreases with distance from a stream channel all fcpgs are made by creating 1 an accumulated area grid with pixel values representing the upstream contributing area draining to a given pixel and 2 an accumulated predictor variable grid with pixel values that are summed predictor variable values of all associated upstream grid pixels draining to that given pixel based on the flow direction grid this step is done using taudem tarboton et al 2009 via the fcpg tools the accumulated predictor variable grid is then divided by the accumulated area grid such that each pixel in the final fcpg contains the upstream average value of the predictor variable for the decay type fcpgs the weighting grid is used during the accumulation step to generate an accumulated predictor variable grid modified to account for distance to the stream channel for this analysis we set the weighting grid to 0 25 meaning that each grid cell retains 25 of the predictor variable value as it is accumulated downstream 2 3 analysis the prosperum model is based on binary wet or dry streamflow observations at discrete stream locations as response variables and physiographic and climatic predictor variables that describe conditions upstream of each observation to estimate the probability of year round flow for every stream pixel in the study area s stream network fig 2 the workflow provides probabilistic estimates of streamflow permanence that include 1 annual probabilities based on a full calendar year of climate conditions and 2 forecasted probabilities based on climate conditions through the end of may for a given year as part of this workflow we also investigate the feasibility of predicting sub annual 30 day rolling probabilities streamflow probabilities in three huc8 subbasins which are inferred from integrating prosperum probability estimates with a physically based hydrologic model 2 3 1 model development random forest rf breiman 2001 was used as the statistical framework for prosperum like prosper pnw rf is a machine learning method that is becoming increasingly popular for modeling environmental phenomena because of its ability to develop models using many predictor variables but relatively few response data biau and scornet 2016 further rf is non parametric and does not require that the predictor variable data are screened to meet traditional assumptions associated with parametric multivariate methods including collinearity normality heteroscedasticity and consistency of data structure allowing the model to accept continuous and ordinal data and data of substantially different magnitudes breiman 2001 prosperum includes four submodels herein referred to as model a b c and d models a b and c represent sequential time periods 1989 2000 2001 2003 and 2004 2018 respectively to maximize use of the past period of record of observation and predictor variable data model d provides preliminary forecasted probabilities based on early season january 1 may 31 climatic conditions fig 2 models a b and c were required because two climatic predictor variables did not extend over the complete modeling period specifically the national land cover dataset nlcd mrlcc 2016 is available from 2001 to present and snow water equivalent swe barrett 2003 is available from 2004 to present consequently model a 1989 2000 does not include swe or nlcd predictor variables model b 2001 2003 includes nlcd but not swe model c 2004 2018 includes nlcd and swe fig 2 models a b and c are retrospective models that provide predictions based on the full calendar year of available data model d 2004 2018 provides forecasted probabilities of streamflow permanence for a given year based on climatic predictor variables that can be processed by june 1 for that year fig 2 a limitation of rf is its sensitivity to imbalances in the training data imbalances might have spatial and or temporal dependencies that must be considered during the model development sinha et al 2019 this is particularly true when analyzing environmental data because of the often inherent bias associated with nonrandom sampling designs e g streamflow observations from fish sampling datasets are biased toward wet since the sampling objective of locating fish will prioritize wet locations to overcome imbalances the observation data were first stratified by level ii ecoregion environmental protection agency 2018 and the majority streamflow class wet or dry within each of the three major ecoregions was randomly downsampled using the caret package in r kuhn 2019 to obtain an equal number of wet and dry streamflow observations from each level ii ecoregion for each model run level ii ecoregion designations were assigned using the dominant ecoregion overlapping the basin areas for example if 61 of the contributing area associated with an observation was in the western cordillera ecoregion and 39 of the contributing area was in the west central semi arid prairies ecoregion the site would be classified as western cordillera for the purposes of balancing the data the outcome of this procedure was a dataset containing an equal number of wet and dry streamflow observations in each level ii ecoregion in the study area because this process potentially removes information by filtering observations from the majority class within each ecoregion this process was repeated 10 times with replacement for each submodel the outputs of which were used for the final ensemble average fig 2 a set of hyperparameters were tuned to optimize the performance and accuracy of a rf model hyperparameters included the number of trees developed ntree the number of predictor variables randomly selected for consideration at each split within a tree mtry and the minimum terminal node size which is the minimum number of training data points in the terminal node of each tree nodesize generally ntree should be set high enough for the model to converge on a relatively stable accuracy for this study models were developed with the ntree parameter set at 200 500 and 1 000 trees models were tested with different values for mtry and the optimal value was selected based on the model with the highest classification accuracy final mean mtry values are shown for each model in fig 2 finally nodesize was not specified which allowed the model to develop trees that were unpruned this was deemed to be acceptable for this model because the final model outputs represented an ensemble of 10 individual models which we assume will effectively account for potential overfitting of the model model performance was determined using mean out of bag oob misclassification rate breiman 2001 and the kappa statistic cohen 1960 the default method of determining oob is to randomly select a subset of data to train the model i e training data and use the remaining data for testing i e test data however randomly selecting the training data can lead to overfitting and underestimation of model error especially if there are spatial biases in the density or distribution in the calibration data which is common with environmental data to provide a more robust estimate of model performance that accounts for spatial bias we implemented leave location out 10 fold cross validation llo meyer et al 2018 using the cast package in r meyer 2018 llo ensures the distribution of the response variable in each fold equals the distribution of the entire dataset by splitting the calibration data into training and test datasets with stratified random sampling meyer et al 2018 for this study the stratification for the llo data splitting was based on huc4 boundaries llo was repeated for each of the 10 model runs and all oob misclassification rates were averaged to produce a final ensemble oob misclassification rate for planning purposes resource managers may find it helpful to predict summer and fall streamflow permanence conditions earlier in the calendar year for example decisions on grazing permit allocation and stocking rates may benefit from streamflow permanence estimates provided in june to meet this need we developed another rf model that only included predictor variables available prior to june 1 the process for developing this forecasting model model d is the same as the process for developing model c with the following exceptions fig 2 1 june july and august monthly predictor variables of temperature precipitation and soil moisture are excluded from the model 2 ndvilag0 is not considered and 3 etlag0 is replaced with the et from the previous year etlag12 model predictions produced from models c and d for years beyond the original modeling period 1989 2018 are expected to be available through at least 2025 section 4 6 herein describes how to access and obtain the data 2 3 2 model evaluation external cross validation was performed for each huc4 in addition to internal model metrics i e oob accuracy and kappa statistic models were developed to test the accuracy of the prosperum model model c in each huc4 region by iteratively using all data within each huc4 as test data for example to test the accuracy of the prosperum model c in huc 1002 all data from huc 1002 were excluded from model training and used as test data model c was developed as described above and model predictions were compared to the observed data at observation sites in huc 1002 model performance for the huc was evaluated on mean balanced accuracy sensitivity number of true positives divided by the sum of true negatives and false positives and specificity number of true negatives divided by the sum of true negatives and false positives these processes were repeated for each huc4 in the domain model c was selected as the model to test individual huc4 regions because it represented the longest period of record with all predictor variables used the greatest number of observation data and can be used to make predictions in future years to assess how spatial and temporal imbalances in the training data might affect model predictions we compared the prediction bias of the model to the observation bias of the training data the prediction bias of the model was defined as the absolute difference between the sensitivity and specificity sensitivity and specificity were determined using the external cross validation predictions for the each huc4 region and out of bag predictions for each year the observation bias of the training data was defined as the absolute difference between the proportion of observations classified as wet and the proportion of observations classified as dry this was done for each huc4 region to investigate spatial bias and year with at least one wet and one dry observation to assess temporal bias variable importance the influence of a given predictor variable on the accuracy of a rf model archer and kimes 2008 can be quantified in two ways for classification models 1 the change in mean misclassification and 2 the change in node purity i e the homogeneity of observed classes in the terminal nodes of the model also known as the gini index archer and kimes 2008 for this study we used the change in mean misclassification as the metric to determine overall variable importance to calculate the mean misclassification rate for each rf model the prediction error on the test data was recorded for each of the 500 trees the prediction error was calculated again after excluding each predictor variable the difference between the two prediction error values was averaged over all trees and normalized by the standard deviation liaw and wiener 2002 additionally partial dependence plots were used to visualize how the predicted response of year round flow changed as a function of individual predictor variables in the rf model given the large geographic extent and heterogeneous landscape of the model domain predictor variables potentially had different levels of importance for streamflow permanence estimates in different areas of the domain thus casewise i e local variable importance was calculated for each predictor variable included in the final models using the randomforest liaw and wiener 2002 and caret kuhn 2019 packages in r like global variable importance casewise variable importance was computed by calculating the percent an observation or case was withheld as part of the test dataset out of bag and misclassified when the predictor variable of interest was excluded to visualize spatial patterns of casewise variable importance across the study area all casewise variable importance values were averaged across all model runs for each observation location variable importance maps were then created by spatially interpolating the mean casewise importance for each variable across the study domain at a spatial resolution of 3 km sando et al 2022 interpolation was done using empirical bayesian kriging gribov et al 2006 pilz and spöck 2018 with arcgis esri 2020b finally we conducted analyses to evaluate streamflow permanence across different hydroclimatic conditions at the huc8 and huc4 scale first we evaluated differences in streamflow permanence probability predictions between a climatically wet and dry year in three huc8 subbasins si table 1 the length of total stream network in each of the three huc 8 subbasins was computed for streams with prosperum probabilities above wet or below dry the classification threshold of 0 5 and are represented as perennial or non perennial respectively stream length with probabilities above and below the 0 5 threshold were computed for 2011 a climatically wet year and 2012 a climatically dry year wet and dry years were selected by evaluating the mean annual palmer drought severity index pdsi derived from gridmet abatzoglou 2012 and selecting the year with greatest wet and year with the least dry average value for our study area while it s possible that temporal autocorrelation could affect the results of this comparison we decided that the results could also provide valuable information regarding flashiness or susceptibility to relatively dramatic fluctuations from year to year of these basins thus 2011 and 2012 were retained as our wet and dry years for this purpose to ensure consistent predictions were assessed only years falling within the model c period 2004 2018 were considered differences in the spatial configuration and total stream length for predicted wet and dry streams i e probabilities above and below 0 5 respectively were visually assessed between years second we compared annual prosperum probabilities averaged for all nhdplus hr perennial streams nhdplus hydrographic category 46006 to annual prosperum predictions averaged for all nhdplus hr intermittent streams nhdplus hydrographic category 46003 at the huc4 scale to evaluate potential differences in interannual variability in streamflow permanence between stream classes designated in the nhdplus hr for the modeling period this analysis was done to provide a general comparison between prosper and the nhdplus hr which is commonly used in many resource management decision workflows e g grazing and energy development permitting on federally managed land despite the recognized error in the nhdplus hr streamflow permanence nhdplus hr streams classified as ephemeral were not included because of inconsistencies in the completeness of this class across the study area we evaluated prosperum probabilities in the context of drought years using the annual mean pdsi from the gridmet dataset abatzoglou 2012 averaged for each huc4 to test for significant change point years in the mean prosperum predictions associated with each nhd stream class we used pettitt tests pettitt 1979 with the r package trend pohlert 2020 we included all years of prediction for this analysis but it should be noted that differences in model inputs from models a b and c might have affected the analysis 2 3 3 exploration of sub annual predictions while the prosperum model provides probability of permanence at an annual level many water management decisions require sub annual context that can include seasonal monthly or daily timesteps scarcity of streamflow observation data for the study area prohibited extending random forest model development to sub annual probability of permanence predictions however as an exploratory step towards developing monthly probabilities of streamflow permanence prosperum model predictions were linked to output from a physically based streamflow model daily streamflow models tend to over predict low magnitude streamflow values farmer and vogel 2016 and often underestimate the occurrence of zero flow days therefore we explored the correlation between annual prosperum probabilities and the frequency with which a hydrologic model predicted daily streamflow below a threshold we used the usgs national hydrologic model configuration of the precipitation runoff modeling system nhm prms markstrom et al 2015 to demonstrate how daily hydrologic simulation may extend prosperum probabilities to a sub annual 30 day rolling values scale specifically we used nhm prms outflow as a general surrogate for surface streamflow the nhm prms provides approximately thirty years of daily outflow for many locations in the prosperum region here identified as points of interest pois daily predictions at each poi are referred to as outflow for that location s flowline segment outflow is often considered surface streamflow despite the potential that it may not represent water expressed above the surface in all cases that is an outflow prediction that is small may not be analogous to streamflow measured at a stream gage but instead may be subsurface flow at that poi however because there was not sufficient stream gage data to conduct this analysis in the study area nhm prms outflow was used as an approximation regression analysis was used to link annual prosperum predictions to nhm prms outflow we selected three huc8 subbasins described in section 2 1 fig 1 si table 1 for this analysis prosperum predictions for years corresponding to model c 2004 2018 were used to avoid introducing errors associated with differences in predictor variable sets because nhm prms data were available through 2016 the final time period for this analysis was 2004 2016 we extracted annual prosperum predictions and corresponding daily hydrologic model outputs at 129 nhm prms pois si table 1 that were located within the huc8 subbasins for each poi we partitioned the range of simulated outflow into 1 000 equal interval thresholds and calculated the annual frequency that simulated daily outflow was above each threshold we then calculated correlation coefficients between the nhm prms annual outflow frequencies with the prosperum annual stream permanence probabilities at each poi an optimal simulated threshold was selected for each poi using the maximum correlation coefficient finally ordinary least squares ols regression helsel and hirsch 2002 was used at each poi to predict the annual probability of permanence prosperum prediction as a function of the annual frequency of daily values above the optimal nhm prms threshold our ols regression approach to sub annual streamflow prediction was applied to 129 pois because the sub annual streamflow permanence predictions are only useful for sites that go dry sometime during a year the results were only summarized for pois associated with prosperum predictions that had at least one year with a value of less than 0 5 using the ols equations at each poi we predicted monthly streamflow permanence as a function of the frequency of daily values that are above the optimal thresholds 3 results 3 1 model performance the final ensemble mean classification accuracy of the leave location out 10 fold cross validation was 0 81 with a minimum and maximum accuracy of 0 79 and 0 83 respectively table 2 on average model a was the least accurate model mean accuracy of 0 80 this is not surprising as model a did not include any of the land cover predictor variables i e developed forest wetlands or snow water equivalent datasets models b and c had virtually the same performance which is likely an indication that the addition of snow water equivalent to model c was not a consistently important predictor variable of streamflow permanence across the domain a potential explanation for this is that predictor variables that are correlated with other more informative predictor variables have diminished variable importance in the model because of the splitting and bagging steps in the random forest algorithm on average swe variables had high positive correlation pearson s r rodgers and nicewander 1988 with multiple variables of greater importance including june soil moisture 0 62 elevation 0 64 and temperature in may and june 0 56 this suggests that the runoff mechanisms associated with swe were also explained by the information garnered from these other predictor variables the huc4 cross validation of prosperum model c shows that the eastern regions of the study area generally had slightly lower mean balanced accuracies 0 72 0 75 than huc4 basins in the western region 0 76 0 90 fig 3 this is likely because of the predictability of mountain runoff processes related to streamflow permanence and the complex nonlinear nature of hydrologic responses in prairie systems shook et al 2013 additionally huc4 basins in the eastern region of the model domain tended to have greater accuracy in correctly predicting streams going dry i e greater specificity and less accuracy in correctly predicting perennial flow i e lesser sensitivity while accuracy in the western region of the model domain was the opposite that is the eastern huc4 basins 1008 1010 1011 1012 1013 are more likely to be biased toward non perennial predictions while the regions in the west 1003 1005 1007 are more likely to be biased toward perennial predictions fig 3 the results of our comparison of prediction bias and observation bias for each huc4 region fig 4 a and year fig 4b show that the model predictions are potentially influenced by spatial and temporal imbalances in the training data there is a high degree of correlation between the observation bias and the prediction bias for the huc4 regions pearson s r of 0 83 p value 0 01 there also is a significant positive correlation between these two variables for each year of the model pearson s r of 0 42 p value 0 03 these results indicate that improvements to the model might be made by either incorporating stricter preprocessing steps in the model development or incorporating data that were collected with a more targeted sampling design intended to ensure the training data are balanced by spatial and temporal modeling units 3 2 importance and partial dependence of predictor variables drainage area was the most important predictor variable for all models a b c and d including drainage area improved the mean model accuracy by an average of 10 15 fig 5 the relative importance of the other predictor variables was similar for models b c and d but different for model a fig 5 for models b c and d the second and third most important predictor variables were proportion of basin classified as wetland and proportion of basin classified as developed respectively other important predictor variables included elevation green up characteristics of riparian vegetation ndvi harmonic regression coefficients and the climatic predictor variables of air temperature in may june and july and soil moisture in june interpolated casewise importance for the nine predictor variables with the greatest mean variable importance sando et al 2022 varied considerably across the study area fig 6 a few subtle patterns emerged with the interpolated importance of predictor variables across this large and heterogenous geographic domain first temperature predictor variables tjul tmay and tjun appear to have greater importance in the eastern third of the model domain second soil moisture swcjun appears to have greater importance in the western and eastern thirds of the model domain third ndvi appears to be less important along the eastern edge of the model domain these patterns do not clearly correspond to the level ii ecoregion boundaries or the density of observation data and do not appear to have strong longitudinal or elevation gradients also the lack of ndvi importance along the eastern edge is likely attributed to ndvi not being able to distinguish between riparian and upland vegetation that are supported by the presence of glacial till and shallow groundwater van der kamp and hayashi 2009 the interpolated casewise importance might not accurately represent conditions for all locations fig 6 particularly in areas with little or no calibration data fig 1 the patterns in areas with greater spatial density of streamflow observations might be more reliable as spatial density of observations points within each huc4 was shown to be weakly correlated with balanced accuracy pearson s r of 0 28 in addition the extents of the spatial layers that describe casewise importance are constrained by the extent of the calibration data because of the interpolation process so they do not cover the entire domain probability of year round flow depended substantially on the nine predictor variables with greatest mean variable importance fig 7 probabilities of year round flow remain low 0 25 for streams with small drainage area about 5 km2 and markedly increase beginning at approximately 10 km2 fig 7a streamflow probabilities of 0 5 occur consistently at drainage areas of approximately 30 km2 while this is not a surprise our analysis provides quantitative information on how streamflow permanence might change as a function of drainage area of ecological interest basins with even a relatively small proportion of drainage area classified as wetlands proportion equal to about 0 03 or about 3 are associated with a high probability of permanent streamflow fig 7b our results show a non linear relation between streamflow permanence and developed area streamflow permanence appears to increase as the proportion of developed area increases up to about 0 02 i e 2 of the basin for basins that exceed about 0 02 proportion developed area there does not appear to be a clear relation between streamflow permanence and developed area fig 7c developed area includes land surface types ranging from developed open spaces where impervious surfaces account for 0 20 of the total cover to highly developed areas where impervious surfaces account for 80 100 of the total cover mrlcc 2016 this predictor variable could include a range of developed land cover features including golf courses single family housing units commercial and industrial areas and roadways intuitively predicted probability of streamflow permanence is negatively correlated with mean basin air temperature i e tjul tmay and tjun fig 7d 6g and 6i and positively correlated with mean basin soil moisture i e swcjun fig 7h these monthly climate predictor variables strongly correlate with elevation the mean correlation pearson s r rodgers and nicewander 1988 between the swc variables and elevation is 0 7 and the mean correlation between the t variables and elevation is 0 51 weak correlations exist between ndvilag0 and monthly precipitation mean r of 0 2 monthly temperature mean r of 0 26 and monthly soil moisture mean r of 0 29 generally streamflow permanence probabilities are positively correlated with elevation showing decreased probabilities 0 5 at lower 1500 m and increased probabilities 0 5 at higher elevations 2000 m notably there is a decrease in predicted probabilities associated with the greatest elevation in our sample data 3000 m however this decrease appears to be driven by a relatively small number of observations that might not be representative of the full dataset on average the western portion of the umrb had higher probabilities of streamflow permanence and lower variation in the probability of streamflow permanence than the eastern portion fig 8 there also is a clear band of greater standard deviations in the northwest corner of south dakota though the cause of this greater standard deviation is unclear there tends to be lower standard deviations in the western cordillera and cold deserts ecoregions e g southern portion of huc 1008 and eastern portion of 1013 3 3 differential response in streamflow permanence to hydroclimatic conditions comparing streamflow permanence predictions for climatically wet and dry years for the three huc8 subbasins illustrates how different regions within the larger upper missouri river basin respond to different hydroclimatic conditions fig 9 si table 1 generally streamflow permanence predictions for streams at higher elevations in the smith river and upper tongue river basins were more stable between climatically wetter and drier years as evidenced by the lack of contraction of perennial streams in the climatically dry year of 2012 fig 9 the proportion of stream network in the smith and upper tongue river basins predicted to have year round flow changed from about 18 3 and 18 8 percent in 2011 to about 14 8 and 16 8 percent in 2012 respectively in contrast the redwater river basin which represents a lower elevation climatically drier prairie basin si table 1 shows a marked contraction of perennial flow in 2012 the climatically dry year the proportion of stream network predicted to have year round flow changed from about 8 3 percent in 2011 to about 2 2 percent in 2012 a difference of about 6 1 percent compared to the 3 4 and 1 9 percent difference of the other two subbasins while these changes in overall proportion of stream network seem small they represent potentially substantial differences in the relative length of perennial streams in wet and dry years in particular redwater river basin was predicted to lose about 73 of their perennial stream length in 2012 relative to 2011 conversely smith and upper tongue river basins were predicted to lose about 19 and 10 respectively in that same time frame our comparison of annual mean prosperum predictions for nhdplus hr perennial and intermittent streams shows that the prosperum model clearly differentiates between the two nhdplus stream classes of perennial and intermittent with higher probabilities corresponding to nhdplus streams classified as perennial compared to intermittent streams fig 10 prosperum probabilities associated with nhdplus hr perennial streams show a greater correlation with pdsi mean r of 0 31 than prosperum probabilities associated with nhdplus hr intermittent streams which show no correlation with pdsi mean r 0 001 fig 10 streamflow permanence probabilities show statistically significant changes through time fig 10 five huc4 regions 1003 1007 1008 1009 1012 had significant change points for predictions averaged across nhd perennial streams except for 1003 all regions with significant change points associated with predictions at nhd perennial stream classes were located along the southern extent of our domain significant change point years ranged from 2003 to 2006 for predictions at nhd perennial streams four huc4 regions 1003 1004 1007 1012 had significant change points for predictions averaged across nhd intermittent streams significant change point years included 2001 2004 and 2007 it is important to note that significant change points in prosperum predictions might be an indication of nonstationarity introduced by the inclusion of different predictor variables in the models this could be particularly true when the change point years coincide with changes in the predictor variables used in the model 2001 2004 however despite the potential limitations results may at least partially be associated with hydroclimatology based on the coincident changes in pdsi across the domain and the documented severity of drought in the region cook et al 2009 martin et al 2020 there is a marked dip in pdsi from 2000 to 2010 in the study area that represents what is referred to as the turn of the century drought and is described as more severe than any other drought on record in the basin fig 10 decreases in streamflow permanence probabilities at least for the perennial streams approximately correspond to this drought period fig 10 further change in modeling structure that occurred in 2001 and 2004 that corresponds to more significant change points identified in 2004 was limited to the inclusion of the snow water equivalent swe which ranked low highest rank is 23 out of 36 predictor variables in variable importance plots for the model fig 5 3 4 exploration of sub annual streamflow permanence predictions of the 129 pois in the three huc8 subbasins 48 had at least one year of prosperum predictions below 0 5 which was the default threshold for classifying the location as perennial both the smith and upper tongue river basins had relatively small percentages of non perennial predictions 9 percent and 28 percent respectively whereas the red river basin had 88 percent of prosperum predictions that were non perennial the mean r squared value for all pois with at least one year of non perennial prosperum predictions was 0 44 fig 11 however the highest mean r squared values reached 0 8 there does not appear to be a geographic correspondence for pois that have higher mean r squared values fig 11 and higher mean r squared values generally corresponded to a relatively broader range of prosperum probabilities above and below the 0 5 threshold si fig 1 among the pois with at least one prediction of non perennial flow there was a moderate inverse correlation between the r squared values at each site and the associated strahler stream order r 0 28 example plot configurations showing the prms daily hydrograph scatterplot of frequency above threshold and annual prosperum prediction first through fifth quantile of the 30 day moving frequency above threshold which represents how frequencies change throughout a given year at the example pois sub annual prediction based on ols regression and joint plot of annual prosperum and daily probability of streamflow are shown in si fig 1 in general the scarcity of pois that have non perennial flow and subsequent limitations in the strength of robust correlations between prosperum predictions and the frequency of prms flows above threshold limits subsequent robust predictions of sub annual flow and no flow periods e g si fig 1 the lack of non perennial systems represented in the prms data can largely be attributed to the fact that the prms hydrography is based on the coarser 30 m medium resolution national hydrography dataset that has been shown to underrepresent stream channels especially for non perennial streams roy et al 2009 nevertheless this exercise serves as a potential approach that can be built upon with additional modeled streamflow data for non perennial pois 4 discussion 4 1 towards dynamic streamflow permanence modeling stream networks expand and contract through time as a function of antecedent hydroclimatic conditions fritz et al 2013 moidu et al 2021 van meerveld et al 2019 however monitoring this phenomenon is challenging posing subsequent challenges to modeling streamflow permanence the prosper models prosperum and prosperpnw have established a means to model streamflow permanence with streamflow data that are spatially and temporally sparse the accuracy of both models is similar 0 80 0 82 which is attributed in part to having observational data that represent a sufficient range of climatically wet and dry years that includes at least a decade of data across the spatial domain thus while the calibration data lack extensive records at individual locations in the domain the assumption is that the potential relations between the predictor variables and streamflow permanence are captured within the population of calibration data this approach has been shown to be useful in similar environmental analyses e g lester et al 2014 zografou et al 2020 accuracy of the prosper models might also represent an approximation of the explanatory power that is possible without including data to adequately represent major consumptive water use categories e g public supply withdrawals diversions etc as neither model included adequate information on this component it is possible that for streams and rivers that have been modified by human activities prosperum model outputs might have reduced accuracy the implications of not including adequate data that capture the effects of human modification are likely to be pronounced for areas that have a greater degree of modification in our study area irrigated agriculture is likely to be an indicator of streams that might have greater misclassification rates because of stream withdrawals that aren t accounted for in the model for example a stream that experiences large withdrawals associated with agriculture might be predicted to be permanent based on hydroclimatic conditions but be nonpermanent because of the influence of the withdrawals on the total water in the system these model inaccuracies could provide the basis for studying the effect of the human footprint on streamflow permanence thus an important next step is to improve our ability to incorporate anthropogenic mechanisms that influence streamflow permanence annual and forecasted growing season predictions using nhdplus hr hydrography represent an improvement in spatial resolution on previous models of comparable geographic extent that use a coarser hydrography and are likely limited in capturing the headwater network for example prosperpnw was developed from the nhdplus mr derived from 30 m elevation data snelder et al 2013 provided predictions for stream segments with minimum drainage area of 2 5 km2 excluding some headwater streams of smaller drainage area with increasingly available highly detailed lidar derived hydrography and more accessible high powered computation modeling of streamflow permanence is expected at finer spatial resolution e g jensen et al 2018 warix et al 2021 for increasingly larger geographic extents increased accuracy in the hydrographic representation of the stream channel network would likely improve the applicability of the prosper models and similar stream characteristic models given that the consequences of many management decisions are location specific examples include grazing permits that are based on predicted probabilities of surface water availability and condition for specific streams knapp et al 2020 or buffer width requirements along streams in timber harvest activities that are based on presence of physical channels and in many cases the streamflow permanence classifications kampf et al 2021 additional datasets and new statistical approaches such as physics guided deep learning e g xie et al 2021 might facilitate finer temporal resolution at monthly to daily timesteps by coupling physically based model outputs with empirical data e g streamflow observations york et al 2020 using customized loss functions these new statistical approaches can potentially make use of the finer resolution e g daily of physics based model outputs while penalizing the model using the sparser empirical data data beyond one time streamflow observations for a location will be required and is becoming more possible with citizen crowd source science efforts such as stream tracker kampf et al 2018 or crowdwater seibert et al 2017 and governmental science efforts like flowper jaeger et al 2020 resource managers often have a need for information about future conditions of the resources they manage to avoid overburdening the resource by including predictor variables that are available 2 5 months before the low flow season model d of prosperum presents a first step toward meeting this need this approach of using currently available input data to forecast the probability of future streamflow permanence could be advanced by conducting detailed analyses of optimal lead times for forecasts as well as a more in depth exploration of the use of lagged predictor variables 4 1 1 importance of balanced training data intuitively data driven models are recognized to be heavily influenced by the structure of the data used to train the models this poses a particular challenge when dealing with environmental data especially if the data have been collected or aggregated opportunistically from other previous studies as is the case with the prosper models the reason for this is because it is difficult to design a sampling scheme that accurately captures the true distribution of the phenomenon of interest while also characterizing the full distribution of predictor variable data associated with each class rather these types of studies are often limited by site accessibility e g road stream crossings unknown distribution parameters for the phenomenon of interest changing conditions or inadequate predictor variable data resolution or availability the results of our comparison of prediction bias and observation bias show that prediction bias will potentially be reduced if the sample used to train the data represent a balanced dataset for whatever scale or spatial unit the modeling is being done at fig 4b further environmental data often have a non random temporal structure that should be considered when developing a sampling design for example streams typically have high and low flow periods in each year however these seasonal characteristics are often not considered or not relevant to the study objectives when streamflow permanence data are collected resulting in data that are not temporally balanced fig 4b evidence of this in our study is shown in the distribution of wet and dry streamflow observation frequency across months si fig 2 as streamflow permanence modeling moves toward sub annual predictions collecting data that provide a distribution balanced across the time step of interest e g months will be important 4 2 influence of land cover types on streamflow permanence predictions in the upper missouri river basin 4 2 1 importance of wetlands and riparian vegetation our analysis shows that after contributing area proportion of land cover as wetlands is the second most important variable in the model and that presence of wetlands corresponds to predictions of year round flow in streams wetlands both hydrologically isolated and connected have been shown to be a crucial component of the hydrologic landscape epting et al 2018 mclaughlin et al 2014 wetlands can store and subsequently release surface runoff which regulates surface inundation and increases the length of time that surface water is present on the landscape evenson et al 2018 additionally wetlands including non floodplain wetlands and surface water storage features increase soil moisture and saturation increasing baseflow in some systems buttle 2018 lane et al 2018 in particular wetlands within the prairie region including local to the study area have been shown to contribute to baseflow throughout the summer ameli and creed 2019 brooks et al 2018 the relatively small basin proportion as wetland 0 03 or 3 associated with mean streamflow permanence probabilities above 0 5 was unexpected but may reflect a sensitive connection between wetland presence and availability of surface flow it should be noted that our results do not imply the relation between streamflow permanence and wetlands is causal it might be there is some underlying mechanism not included in the model that causes greater proportion of wetlands and greater likelihood of streamflow permanence for example the presence of wetlands in a watershed is an indicator of elevated water tables which may be due to local geology and or soils in such cases streamflow permanence may be more likely because of groundwater seepage and not the wetlands per se because of these complexities further research is needed to identify the mechanisms underlying apparent connections between streamflow permanence and wetlands however the potential importance of even a small amount of wetlands to baseflow lends credence to such streamflow restoration tools like wet meadow restoration nash et al 2019 and other process based approaches that promote local storage of water to support surface flow pollock et al 2014 wheaton et al 2019 our results also indicated that the timing and degree of vegetation green up as captured with the harmonic regression coefficients of ndvi values were important to the model greater values of the harmonic regression coefficients of ndvi representing higher and longer periods of greenness are associated with greater probabilities of streamflow permanence these results agree with other work that has shown that differences in streamflow permanence class correspond to differences in vegetative characteristics in semiarid riparian zones which is attributed to spatial patterns in consistent availability of shallow groundwater stromberg et al 2010 gendaszek et al 2020 sabathier et al 2021 warix et al 2021 in our study higher values of the ndvi harmonic regression coefficients identify vegetation is not water limited consequently high ndvi harmonic regression coefficients may be proxies for regions of available surface water and shallow groundwater given the known connections between vegetative health and degree of photosynthetic activity and timing and magnitude of water availability aguilar et al 2012 liu et al 2019 including differential characteristics of vegetation greenness through ndvi harmonic regression which may capture timing and magnitude can improve model skill in predicting streamflow permanence 4 2 2 developed area our results show that developed area is the third most important variable for predicting annual streamflow permanence the effects of urbanization and developed area on streamflow have been investigated in multiple studies eng et al 2013 wang and cai 2010 white and greer 2006 past research on the effects of urbanization and developed area on low flows has resulted in conflicting conclusions costigan et al 2016 some studies have concluded that baseflow has increased because of increased urbanization in specific watersheds brandes et al 2005 rosburg et al 2017 roy et al 2009 wang and cai 2010 while others have shown that urbanization decreases baseflow simmons and reynolds 1982 or had inconsistent results chang 2006 mechanistic explanations for urbanization decreasing streamflow have included reduced infiltration and groundwater recharge ferguson and suckling 1990 and groundwater pumping resulting in a lowered water table postel 2000 conversely mechanistic explanations provided for urbanization increasing streamflow include high densities of septic systems leaky pipes from municipality infrastructure and lawn irrigation all of which can offset losses from increased runoff on impervious surfaces lerner 2002 gungle 2005 in our study a low amount of development less than 2 of the basin was associated with higher streamflow permanence which declined with moderate increases in development less than 5 total fig 7 these results may reflect a threshold associated with the percent of a basin that is impervious below which the effects of development typically increase streamflow permanence however if this threshold is exceeded the loss of recharge and infiltration outweighs the potential gains from septic systems and irrigation reducing the probability of streamflow permanence it also is possible that the relation between streamflow permanence and proportion of the basin as developed is not causal but may indicate the presence of an underlying mechanism that promotes both development and streamflow permanence as may be the case for the connection between streamflow permanence and wetlands specifically development may be concentrated in wetter basins or along perennial streams because of the services they provide in this case development is an outcome of high streamflow permanence despite connections between streamflow permanence and the developed land cover class in our model more work is needed to identify underlying hydrologic mechanisms for these connections 4 3 interannual variability of streamflow permanence and drought hydroclimatic conditions influence streamflow permanence with decreases in streamflow permanence during climatically dry and drought conditions ward et al 2020 zipper et al 2021 understanding interannual variability and longer term responses in streamflow permanence is crucial to recognizing where ecosystems might be most sensitive to change it also provides the ability to understand how habitat for critical species both aquatic and terrestrial might change under future conditions and where remediation efforts might be most effective the outputs from prosperum can be used to assess interannual variability because of the annual resolution of the outputs in our analysis of three huc8 subbasins there is variability in extent of expansion and contraction of perennial reaches in wet and dry years respectively fig 9 our comparison of predicted perennial stream length prosperum prediction above 0 5 for three huc8 subbasins in a climatically wet year 2011 and climatically dry year 2012 provides some insight into the degree of sensitivity to changing climatic conditions in the study area in particular the huc8 subbasin with the lowest mean elevation and mean annual precipitation appears to be more sensitive to climatically dry years based on the apparent substantial expansion of streams with low streamflow permanence probabilities in 2012 compared to the other huc8 subbasins these results agree with other work that suggests that mountain streams may have some sensitivity to changing climate conditions ward et al 2020 moidu et al 2021 however they also highlight potential higher sensitivity of lower elevation catchments in streamflow permanence to shifts towards climatically drier conditions which has not been investigated in a comparative sense regarding streamflow permanence prosperum might be able to detect periods of drought when multiple years are drier than normal for example decreases in streamflow permanence probabilities are evident in all huc4 basins for nhd perennial streams fig 8 corresponding to the severe drought from 2000 to 2010 in the upper missouri river basin cook et al 2009 martin et al 2020 interestingly there is not a similarly obvious change in streamflow permanence predictions associated with nhd non perennial intermittent streams however this difference makes sense as the non perennial streams are already classified as dry and therefore will not have a similar response during drought there are five huc4 regions that have significant change points for predictions associated with nhd perennial stream classes and four that have significant change points for predictions associated with nhd intermittent stream classes fig 10 the mean change point year for predictions associated with nhd perennial stream classes is about 2005 while the mean for predictions associated with nhd intermittent streams is 2004 if the assumption that the change in model outputs is showing a response to the drought conditions in the basin the results of this analysis might provide valuable information into the relation between streamflow permanence and climate change interestingly the results show that some huc4s seem to have recovered after the turn of the century drought with increases in streamflow permanence probabilities corresponding to years of positive pdsi following the 2000 2010 drought while others have not this result of different response to drought conditions is in alignment with other work that studied the effect of drought on baseflow in the russian river of coastal california deitch et al 2018 the results of that study suggested that for some streams subsurface and pathways that provide summer baseflow are not replenished in dry years further stoelzle et al 2014 show that geology type and permeability might affect streamflow response and recovery to drought scenarios thus understanding how drought will affect streamflow permanence in the upper missouri river basin will likely require more analyses on underlying geology and the role of groundwater resources in streamflow permanence in the basin again it is important to note that it remains unclear whether this variance in predicted streamflow permanence is a result of changes in hydroclimatic conditions i e drought or an indication of the effect of including additional predictor variables in the model however because of reasons provided in section 3 3 we believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that the changes seen in the model outputs are due to changes in the hydroclimatology i e drought rather than changes in the modeling structure 4 4 sub annual permanence analysis the goal of this analysis was to investigate the feasibility of coupling two independent models with different temporal resolution annual vs daily and modeling structure empirical vs process based to estimate sub annual streamflow permanence our results show that linking hydrologic physically based models and prosperum empirical model presents a method for sub annual characterization of streamflow permanence and could be used to improve streamflow models themselves hydrologic models may benefit from improved characterizations of streamflow permanence in that they can account for the probability of zero flows without explicitly driving models to extreme lows in calibration or application conversely process based models with finer temporal resolution might provide a mechanism for providing information on the hydroperiod or timing of flow for a stream the negative correlation between the r squared values and strahler stream order suggests that the link between hydrologic system models and streamflow permanence models is stronger for lower order streams reflecting the influence of consistency in the model mechanisms at lower stream order it is also possible that there might be fewer anthropogenic influences on these lower order streams reducing the influences that are unaccounted for in the respective models to further investigate the linkages between prosperum and streamflow models study sites could be developed where long term multiple years spanning wet and dry conditions observations of the presence or absence of streamflow is routinely available the current network of streamgages is insufficient in that it is biased toward locations with permanent flow identifying sites with fluctuation between flowing and non flowing states over a longer time horizon i e years and monitoring the site on a regular interval e g weekly or monthly will support the development of sub annual prosperum predictions 4 5 limitations beyond the limitations of any predictive models a number of specific limitations should be considered when using or analyzing the prosperum outputs hydrographic network errors associated with the nhdplus hr beta e g false disconnections in the stream network might affect the reliability of the results huc4 regions were processed independently so predictions along rivers that cross huc4 boundaries might not be valid water use and regulation were not considered in the model architecture so regulated streams or streams with many diversions might not be reliably represented in the model the model used different predictor variable sets for different time periods so different models a b c and d might not have comparable results while the spatial resolution of the predictions is set at 10 meters consistent with the nhdplus hr many of the gridded predictor variable input datasets had coarser resolution so the effective resolution of prosperum predictions is coarser than 10 m additionally there are limitations associated with the sub annual streamflow permanence analysis the prms hydrography is based on the nhdplus mr which is different than the hydrography of prosperum while we ensured the points we used were on corresponding locations differences in these datasets might affect the reliability of this analysis ordinary least squares as with most regression modeling methods performs poorly when extrapolating predictions therefore the model works best for locations that have a good range of prosperum predictions above and below 0 5 to ensure adequate end points for the model to predict within 5 conclusion the prosperum model builds on prior probabilistic streamflow permanence modeling sando and blasch 2015 jaeger et al 2019 to provide annual predictions of year round flow at a 10 m spatial resolution on nhdplus hr hydrography that better captures headwater streams for a large geographic and physiographically heterogeneous extent the model includes three sequential time periods to maximize use of the past period of record of observation and predictor variable data extending from 1989 to 2018 and for years going forward to at least 2025 in addition the model provides preliminary forecasted probabilities based on early season climatic conditions to support land resource managers as an exploratory step prosperum model predictions were linked to output derived from physically based streamflow models as a potential approach towards monthly probabilities of streamflow permanence the final ensemble mean classification accuracy was 0 81 and the five most important predictor variables were drainage area wetlands developed area air temperature in july and ndvi harmonic regression coefficients analysis of three headwater subbasins in climatically wet and dry years revealed variability in differences in streamflow permanence among the different watersheds reflecting different sensitivities of watersheds to hydroclimatic conditions 6 data accessibility all prosperum model outputs are available as 10 m resolution rasters and can

additional bias into the model first 500 points were randomly placed along national hydrography dataset plus high resolution nhdplus hr flowlines classified as a stream ftype streamriver similarly an additional 600 points were randomly placed along nhdplus hr streams classified as a stream and having a strahler stream order of 1 or 2 to ensure adequate representation of headwater streams second the location of each point was visually inspected using the esri world imagery basemap esri 2020a and a value of wet dry nonnatural or unclear was recorded finally the source and date of the imagery at each point location was recorded the spatial resolution of the available imagery provided for the study area is less than 1 m which is sufficient for determining presence or absence of water in a stream assuming there is not any canopy obstruction after these data were collected they were filtered using relevant methods described in section 2 2 1 final data are included in the streamflow

8546,data from a 389 km2 watershed and one of its 14 5 km2 subbasins were used to assess the effects of sampling frequency on the estimation accuracy of the exceedance frequency ef for suspended solids and nitrate nitrogen in streams values of ef estimated from 17 subsampling schemes were compared with the actual ef efa at different threshold concentrations the coefficient of variation and relative bias were used to measure the estimation accuracy results indicated that the efa of the larger watershed was much lower than that of the smaller watershed for both suspended solids and nitrate nitrogen we also found that efa can be modeled as an exponential function of the threshold concentration for the ef estimations the coefficient of variation decreased with increasing sampling frequency and increasing efa the relative bias tended to be negative when efa was low or the threshold concentration was high reaching 75 in some cases this result implies that reported ef values based on low frequency data could be severely underestimated due to the high possibility of missing large events however there were also cases with positive relative bias implying overestimation of ef

northwestern new brunswick canada fig 1 the area of the lrw is approximately 389 km2 about 16 2 of the watershed area is agricultural 77 forest and 6 8 residential xing et al 2013 qi et al 2018 the elevation in the lrw ranges from 122 to 477 m above sea level chow et al 2011 the bbw is a subbasin of the lrw fig 1 the area of the bbw is 14 5 km2 with 65 of the total area agricultural land 21 forested land and the rest residential areas chow et al 2011 qi et al 2017 the elevation in the bbw ranges from 170 to 260 m above sea level the annual precipitation in the area is approximately 1134 mm and about one third of the precipitation is in the form of snow the maximum stream flow and recharging of groundwater aquifers mostly occur during the snow melting season from march to may chow and rees 2006 the bbw is also an experimental watershed managed by agriculture and agri food canada aafc as a national benchmark for monitoring agricultural impacts on soil and water quality monitoring of the watershed was designed to study soil erosion in croplands the dominant crop in the region is potatoes and the efficacy of best management practices on soil health and water quality land use hydrology stream water quality and weather have been continuously monitored since 1992 yang et al 2009 chow et al 2011 xing et al 2012 2 2 data collection and sample analyses flow data and water samples were collected at two hydrological monitoring stations installed at the outlets of lrw and bbw at the bbw station a composite sharp crest v notched triangular weir was used as the structure for flow rate monitoring whereas at the lrw station no flow monitoring structure was constructed and the configuration of the stream riverbed was used as the natural structure at each station a pipe was buried to connect the bottom of the stream to a stilling well the stilling well was constructed with a culvert sunk into the stream bank and was housed in a small shed the stage height of water level in the stilling well was monitored with a float and pulley system and was recorded with a datalogger campbell scientific inc edmonton ab canada stage heights were converted to stream flow rates based on a rating curve locally calibrated at each station with multiple flow surveys when water level was at different heights chow et al 2011 for both stations the datalogger was set to scan stage height at a 5 min interval to save storage space in the datalogger the stage height data was only saved at 5 min interval when the water level change from the previous record was 2 cm approximately the standard deviation of the water level in the stilling well otherwise the record was saved hourly at the top of the hour this prevented the storage space in the datalogger being filled quickly while at the same time allowed the reconstruction of the 5 min water level dataset at the accuracy level of the natural variation water samples were collected using an isco teledyne isco lincoln nebraska usa automatic sampler which was controlled by the same datalogger used for water level monitoring chow et al 2011 the strategy used for water sampling was similar water samples were taken at 5 min interval when the water level change was 5 cm approximately three times of the standard deviation of the water level in the stilling well otherwise water samples were taken every 72 h regardless of water level change this unique sampling strategy was effective in capturing the surface runoff event the rises and falls of the flow at a temporal resolution of 5 min while avoiding large amount of water samples during the stable base flow period between runoff events since the two watersheds are either agriculture dominated or forest dominated without point source of sediment or chemicals changes in sediment and chemical concentrations between runoff events were assumed to be small this assumption was validated with the high density water conductivity data data not shown and further confirmed in an initial assessment which showed that there were negligible variations of ss and agricultural chemical concentrations during the stable base flow period gao 2017 all sample analyses were conducted in the soil and hydrology laboratory in the fredericton research and development centre methods used for determining ss and water pollutant concentrations were described in detail in chow et al 2011 in brief after measuring the volume each sample was first filtered through a 0 45 μm 0 000018 in semipermeable membrane millipore corp billerica massachusetts usa for determination of ss concentration conductivity and ph was measured on the remaining filtrate prior to analysis for no3 n using a flow injection analyzer the laboratory results were synchronized with sampling information downloaded from the datalogger and then were compiled into a spreadsheet file for further analysis a 5 min interval dataset of stream flow rate and ss and no3 n concentrations were obtained by linear interpolation on observations from 2003 to 2008 with model maker cherwell scientific ltd it should be noted that the interpolation essentially only occurred for the stable base flow period when the water level change was close to the natural variation and the variations of ss and agricultural chemical concentrations were negligible during runoff events water level changes exceeded the established threshold 2 cm and 5 min interval data were available so that no interpolation was needed since the errors are controlled within the natural errors of the parameters measured the reconstructed 5 minute data was considered equivalent to real 5 minute data for the purpose of exceedance frequency analysis 2 3 resampling frequency and sampling design the reconstructed 5 min interval data were used as the baseline dataset which has a baseline sampling frequency of 5 min per sample daniel et al 2011 gao 2017 gao et al 2020 the high frequency sampling dataset was further subsampled into 17 time series each with equal time intervals of 5 10 15 30 60 and 120 min 0 5 1 2 3 5 10 and 15 days and 1 3 6 and 12 months note that one sample refers to a collective dataset including all sampling points in a given year with the given time interval starting at a random time within the range of the first time interval in the year for sampling intervals 120 min the resampling selection is limited e g only one selection is possible when the sampling interval is 5 min all possible resampling samples were thus used to generate the dataset for that sampling frequency for relatively larger sampling intervals 0 5 day 50 samples were generated with randomly selected starting points determined using monte carlo random seed generators all samples available in the dataset for each sampling frequency 1 24 samples for sampling intervals 120 min and 50 samples for sampling intervals 0 5 day were used to calculate the ef for that sampling frequency table 1 2 4 exceedance frequency and actual exceedance frequency the ef is defined as the percentage of the number of sampling points exceeding the threshold concentration to the total number of sampling points 1 ef n c c tc n 100 where c is the measured pollutant concentration g l or ppm ctc is the selected threshold concentration in this study g l or ppm n is the number of sampling points with pollutant concentrations c exceeding the selected threshold concentration ctc and n is the total number of sampling points based on initial analyses of concentration variations and canadian drinking water standards canadian council of ministers of the enivronment 1999 chambers et al 2012 we set four threshold concentrations for ss 25 5 0 5 and 0 125 g l and three threshold concentrations for no3 n 10 7 and 5 ppm we defined the ef estimated with the highest sampling frequency five minute interval sampling as the actual exceedance frequency efa to assess the accuracy or errors related to the sampling frequency ef estimated from lower sampling frequencies were compared with efa at different threshold concentrations 2 5 accuracy assessment two statistical indicators the coefficient of variation cv and relative bias rb were used to measure the estimation accuracy of ef the cv is a standardized measure of dispersion of a frequency distribution the cv of ef cv ef was calculated as the percentage of the standard deviation σ to the mean 2 c v ef σ μ ef 100 where µ ef is the average ef of all sampling datasets table 1 for a given sampling frequency standard deviations σ for different sampling frequencies were calculated as follows 3 σ i 1 n e f i μ ef 2 n where n is total number of sampling datasets table 1 and efi is the ef of the ith sampling dataset for a given sampling frequency the rb for a given ef rb ef is defined as the percentage of bias divided by the average exceedance frequency calculated as 4 r b e f i 1 n e f i e f a e f a 100 3 results 3 1 actual exceedance frequency efa at the highest sampling frequency 5 min per sample as expected there were more sampling datasets with exceedance at low threshold concentrations for both water quality variables in both watersheds table 2 we also found much lower numbers of sampling points exceeding threshold concentrations for both ss and no3 n in the lrw compared with the bbw from 2003 to 2008 in the lrw for ss there were zero sampling points exceeding 25 g l and only 23 points exceeding 5 g l compared to 202 and 5480 points respectively in the bbw similarly there were 4513 sampling points exceeding 5 ppm for no3 n in the lrw compared to 310 889 sampling points in the bbw from 2003 to 2008 values of efa for ss and no3 n in the lrw and bbw were calculated based on the number of sampling points with ef exceeding the selected threshold concentrations no3 n 10 7 5 ppm ss 25 5 0 5 0 125 g l at the highest sampling frequency table 3 efa decreased exponentially with increasing threshold concentration for both no3 n and ss in both watersheds table 3 this suggests that efa can be described as an exponential function of the threshold concentration model trend lines clearly demonstrate efa differences with respect to different threshold concentrations between water quality variables and between watersheds fig 2 efa values for no3 n and ss were substantially lower in the lrw than in the bbw for all threshold concentrations model parameter summaries could be used to estimate the efas of no3 n and ss for each watershed at different threshold concentrations 3 2 coefficient of variation of the concentration exceedance frequency in general values of cv ef increased with decreasing sampling frequency for both ss and no3 n in both the bbw and the lrw although there were some differences depending on threshold value and watershed tables 4 and 5 in bbw for ss with the lowest threshold of 0 125 g l the mean cv ef decreased exponentially from 139 89 to 0 01 when the sampling frequency increased from 1 sample yearly to 52 560 samples per year every 5 min correspondingly the std of cv ef also decreased exponentially from 87 14 to 0 01 similarly for no3 n with the lowest threshold of 5 ppm the mean cv ef decreased exponentially from 74 68 to 0 01 and std of cv ef from 40 49 to 0 01 when the sampling frequency increased from 1 sample to 52 560 samples per year however this pattern did not hold as well at higher threshold concentrations mainly because the infrequent concentrations exceeding the threshold value were more likely to be missed during low frequency sampling for example with a threshold concentration of 25 g l for ss in bbw no exceedance was detected when the sampling frequency was lower than 12 samples per year this problem became more severe for the lrw where no exceedance was detected at the highest threshold concentrations for ss 25 g l and no3 n 10 ppm note that there was no data for the std of cv ef for no3 n exceeding 7 ppm in the lrw because there was no exceedance other than in 2006 similarly due to the fewer data points exceeding the higher threshold concentrations than the lower threshold concentrations at the same sampling frequency cv ef values were mostly higher with higher threshold concentrations than with lower threshold concentrations for both ss and no3 n in both bbw and lrw to better understand the general relationship between cv ef and efa for different threshold concentrations and at different sampling frequencies irrespective of pollutant and watershed we pooled all ss and no3 n data from both watersheds to develop a model describing the relationship between cv ef efa and sampling frequencies fig 3 a results show that the cv ef decreased exponentially with increasing sampling frequency and efa fig 3b when efa was less than 0 01 the cv ef increased noticeably as the sampling frequency decreased even at a relatively high sampling frequency i e 4 380 samples per year the cv ef reached 4 90 indicating that rare events had larger variations higher cv ef values occurred with lower efa higher threshold for the same sampling frequency when efa was 15 2 the cv ef increased slowly as the sampling frequency decreased 3 3 relative bias of the concentration exceedance frequency rb ef in general the magnitudes of rb ef for ss and no3 n decreased with increasing sampling frequency in both the bbw and the lrw from 2003 to 2008 with the rate of decrease greater under lower threshold concentrations table 6 these trends were consistent with those of cv ef indicating that the estimation accuracy of ef increased with increasing sampling frequency regardless of threshold concentration most values of rb ef were close to zero when the sampling frequency was higher than 730 samples per year 12 h for ss and no3 n under low threshold concentration conditions the ef was severely underestimated for high threshold concentrations even when the sampling frequency was relatively high for example when the threshold concentration was 25 g l rb ef was close to 50 4 for ss in the bbw even at the relatively high sampling frequency of 4 380 per year every 2 h even at the sampling frequency of 10 min rb ef was still 25 0 average rb efs for ss in the bbw were all negative ranging from 75 0 to 6 3 when the sampling frequency increased from 2 1 2 year to 52 560 samples per year every 5 min for the threshold concentration of 25 g l when the threshold concentration decreased to 0 5 g l the bias was reduced to less than 1 0 with the sampling frequency increased to 4 380 samples per year every 2 h if the threshold concentration decreased to 0 125 g l the bias was less than 1 0 with the sampling frequency of 730 samples per year 2 samples per day we further investigated the general relationships between rb ef and efa for ss and no3 n in the bbw and the lrw at different sampling frequencies from 2003 to 2008 table 7 values of rb ef were close to zero with high sampling frequency 4380 samples per year and high efa 63 70 there were mostly high negative biases many close to 100 when the sampling frequency and efa were low however there were also some high positive biases up to 81 9 this implies that rarely occurring events would not be detected if the sampling frequency was low generally leading to underestimation of exceedance frequency when rarely occurring events were detected they often over represented the high concentrations resulting in overestimation of exceeding frequency by contrast when the sampling frequency increased to 4 380 samples per year and the efa increased to 69 24 the bias was reduced to less than 1 4 discussion 4 1 actual exceedance frequency efa and threshold concentration we found a clear difference in the efas of the two watersheds with the larger watershed lrw having a much lower efa for both no3 n and ss two factors land use and watershed size may explain why efa values in the smaller watershed are higher agricultural land accounts for approximately 65 of the total area in the bbw while in the lwr 16 of the area is agricultural land intensive agricultural activities e g tillage operations exposing soil have been linked to increased ss in streams chow and rees 2006 also frequent fertilizer applications can result in nutrient loss degrading stream ecosystems yang et al 2011 gao et al 2020 also reported that variations in annual pollutant loadings in the lrw watershed were lower than that in the bbw watershed size may also play an important role in affecting occurrences of pollutant concentrations exceeding the high threshold concentration smaller watersheds tend to react quickly to major storms with flash flooding runoff dramatically increasing pollutant concentrations concentrations of pollutants in streams are strongly affected by complex discharge rate patterns either as dilution effects or mobilization effects depending on the watershed size and pollutant minaudo et al 2019 bigger watersheds like the lrw have higher chances of being composed of a larger mixture or mosaic of nutrients ss inputs for example a much larger riparian buffer system was able to absorb pollutants washed off from uplands chase et al 2016 spatial heterogeneity of the sources of inputs in a larger watershed will lead to lower temporal variability compared to a smaller catchment zhang et al 2017 4 2 potential errors and accuracy of the exceedance estimation we used cv ef and rb ef to measure the accuracy of the exceedance estimation for both watersheds a low sampling frequency would lead to a lower estimation accuracy or higher uncertainties as indicated by cv ef this result is in general in agreement with previous studies for other water quality indicators such as annual loading jones et al 2012 gao et al 2020 similar to cv ef we also found that a lower sampling frequency tended to produce misleading results or biases as indicated by rb ef studies on the impact of the sampling frequency on the annual loading estimation accuracy have been carried out moatar et al 2013 gao et al 2020 dialameh and ghane 2022 however studies on concentration exceedance are rare an intensive study by jones et al 2012 found that the range of possible frequencies of exceedance broadens as the sampling frequency decreases consistent with our finding that as the sampling frequency decreases the cv of exceedance increases zhang et al 2019 also found that large flux biases are more likely associated with sites that have large concentration and discharge variabilities short concentration records and low sampling frequencies skeffington et al 2015 subsampled hourly measurements of dissolved oxygen do water temperature ph and p in four different catchments in southern england comparable to the lrw in size they found that water quality parameters like ph were relatively stable and that monthly samples were more than sufficient to achieve necessary accuracy for do and p monthly or weekly samples likely produced misleading results their results generally agreed with results from this study except that they did not assess exceedance frequencies note that their highest sampling frequency was hourly and that their objective was focused on the average concentration or average water temperature when combining data from both watersheds we found that cv ef decreased exponentially with sampling frequency and increasing efa this implies that it is difficult to achieve a reliable estimate of ef when the threshold concentration is high or when efa is low this is likely caused by the lower ef associated with higher threshold concentrations because there were more sampling points exceeding the lower threshold concentration for both water quality variables we noted high negative biases close to 100 with low frequency and low efa implying that rarely occurring events could not be detected at low sampling frequencies others have also reported similar observations for example babitsch and sundermann 2020 used the subsampling method to estimate the impact of sample size on pollutant loading and exceedance accuracy they also found that the estimation accuracy decreased as the sample size decreased concluding that the usage of small sample sizes would likely underestimate true mean annual pollutant loads in chemical surveillance and scientific research thus potentially jeopardizing the validity of results although jones et al 2012 did not draw conclusions on the potential biases incurred as the sampling frequency decreased they reported that the mean ef in one watershed studied was lower at lower sampling frequencies e g weekly and monthly compared to that at a higher sampling frequency in another watershed studied we conclude that the underestimation of ef at lower sampling frequencies is universal especially when the natural occurrence of exceedance is low this finding has important implications because low frequency sampling is commonly used to assess exceedances underreporting high concentration events 5 conclusions determining appropriate sampling frequencies is critically important for hydrological studies because high sampling frequencies are associated with higher costs and low sampling frequencies could lead to lower accuracies or even misleading biases in this study we evaluated the relationship between sampling frequency and the estimation accuracy of the concentration exceedance frequency ef for suspended solids ss and nitrate nitrogen no3 n in two watersheds i e a small agricultural watershed of 14 5 km2 and a larger forested watershed of 389 km2 we found that the actual exceedance frequency efa dramatically differed between the two watersheds with the larger little river watershed lrw having a much lower efa than the smaller black brook watershed bbw for both no3 n and ss this difference was likely caused by the different proportions of agricultural land in each watershed i e 17 in the lrw versus 68 in the bbw we also found that efa decreased exponentially with increasing threshold concentration values of efa for no3 n and ss can be modeled as exponential functions of threshold concentration used to calculate the ef with different parameters for different watersheds and different water quality variables the model can be used to estimate efa in both watersheds with different threshold concentrations for different water quality standards we also found that the coefficient of variation of the ef cv ef decreased with increasing sampling frequency and decreased with increasing efa for both no3 n and ss in both watersheds based on all data from both watersheds combined the cv ef can thus be modeled as an exponential function of sampling frequency and efa in other words the estimation accuracy of ef as measured by the cv is only related to efa and sampling frequency regardless of the measured pollutant or monitored watershed we found that the relative bias rb tended to be negative when the threshold concentration was high and when the sampling frequency was low especially for ss with threshold concentrations equal to 25 g l in the bbw and 5 g l in the lrw similar to cv ef the rb ef was also affected by sampling frequency and efa specifically when efa was low the ef could be severely underestimated even when sampled at a relatively high frequency declaration of competing interest the

samples were collected at two hydrological monitoring stations installed at the outlets of lrw and bbw at the bbw station a composite sharp crest v notched triangular weir was used as the structure for flow rate monitoring whereas at the lrw station no flow monitoring structure was constructed and the configuration of the stream riverbed was used as the natural structure at each station a pipe was buried to connect the bottom of the stream to a stilling well the stilling well was constructed with a culvert sunk into the stream bank and was housed in a small shed the stage height of water level in the stilling well was monitored with a float and pulley system and was recorded with a datalogger campbell scientific inc edmonton ab canada stage heights were converted to stream flow rates based on a rating curve locally calibrated at each station with multiple flow surveys when water level was at different heights chow et al 2011 for both stations the datalogger was set to scan stage height at a 5 min interval to save storage space in the datalogger the stage height data was only saved at 5 min interval when the water level change from the previous record was 2 cm approximately the standard deviation of the water level in the stilling well otherwise the record was saved hourly at the top of the hour this prevented the storage space in the datalogger being filled quickly while at the same time allowed the reconstruction of the 5 min water level dataset at the accuracy level of the natural variation water samples were collected using an isco teledyne isco lincoln nebraska usa automatic sampler which was controlled by the same datalogger used for water level monitoring chow et al 2011 the strategy used for water sampling was similar water samples were taken at 5 min interval when the water level change was 5 cm approximately three times of the standard deviation of the water level in the stilling well otherwise water samples were taken every 72 h regardless of water level change this unique sampling strategy was effective in capturing the surface runoff event the rises and falls of the flow at a temporal resolution of 5 min while avoiding large amount of water samples during the stable base flow period between runoff events since the two watersheds are either agriculture dominated or forest dominated without point source of sediment or chemicals changes in sediment and chemical concentrations between runoff events were assumed to be small this assumption was validated with the high density water conductivity data data not shown and further confirmed in an initial assessment which showed that there were negligible variations of ss and agricultural chemical concentrations during the stable base flow period gao 2017 all sample analyses were conducted in the soil and hydrology laboratory in the fredericton research and development centre methods used for determining ss and water pollutant concentrations were described in detail in chow et al 2011 in brief after measuring the volume each sample was first filtered through a 0 45 μm 0 000018 in semipermeable membrane millipore corp billerica massachusetts usa for determination of ss concentration conductivity and ph was measured on the remaining filtrate prior to analysis for no3 n using a flow injection analyzer the laboratory results were synchronized with sampling information downloaded from the datalogger and then were compiled into a spreadsheet file for further analysis a 5 min interval dataset of stream flow rate and ss and no3 n concentrations were obtained by linear interpolation on observations from 2003 to 2008 with model maker cherwell scientific ltd it should be noted that the interpolation essentially only occurred for the stable base flow period when the water level change was close to the natural variation and the variations of ss and agricultural chemical concentrations were negligible during runoff events water level changes exceeded the established threshold 2 cm and 5 min interval data were available so that no interpolation was needed since the errors are controlled within the natural errors of the parameters measured the reconstructed 5 minute data was considered equivalent to real 5 minute data for the purpose of exceedance frequency analysis 2 3 resampling frequency and sampling design the reconstructed 5 min interval data were used as the baseline dataset which has a baseline sampling frequency of 5 min per sample daniel et al 2011 gao 2017 gao et al 2020 the high frequency sampling dataset was further subsampled into 17 time series each with equal time intervals of 5 10 15 30 60 and 120 min 0 5 1 2 3 5 10 and 15 days and 1 3 6 and 12 months note that one sample refers to a collective dataset including all sampling points in a given year with the given time interval starting at a random time within the range of the first time interval in the year for sampling intervals 120 min the resampling selection is limited e g only one selection is possible when the sampling interval is 5 min all possible resampling samples were thus used to generate the dataset for that sampling frequency for relatively larger sampling intervals 0 5 day 50 samples were generated with randomly selected starting points determined using monte carlo random seed generators all samples available in the dataset for each sampling frequency 1 24 samples for sampling intervals 120 min and 50 samples for sampling intervals 0 5 day were used to calculate the ef for that sampling frequency table 1 2 4 exceedance frequency and actual exceedance frequency the ef is defined as the percentage of the number of sampling points exceeding the threshold concentration to the total number of sampling points 1 ef n c c tc n 100 where c is the measured pollutant concentration g l or ppm ctc is the selected threshold concentration in this study g l or ppm n is the number of sampling points with pollutant concentrations c exceeding the selected threshold concentration ctc and n is the total number of sampling points based on initial analyses of concentration variations and canadian drinking water standards canadian council of ministers of the enivronment 1999 chambers et al 2012 we set four threshold concentrations for ss 25 5 0 5 and 0 125 g l and three threshold concentrations for no3 n 10 7 and 5 ppm we defined the ef estimated with the highest sampling frequency five minute interval sampling as the actual exceedance frequency efa to assess the accuracy or errors related to the sampling frequency ef estimated from lower sampling frequencies were compared with efa at different threshold concentrations 2 5 accuracy assessment two statistical indicators the coefficient of variation cv and relative bias rb were used to measure the estimation accuracy of ef the cv is a standardized measure of dispersion of a frequency distribution the cv of ef cv ef was calculated as the percentage of the standard deviation σ to the mean 2 c v ef σ μ ef 100 where µ ef is the average ef of all sampling datasets table 1 for a given sampling frequency standard deviations σ for different sampling frequencies were calculated as follows 3 σ i 1 n e f i μ ef 2 n where n is total number of sampling datasets table 1 and efi is the ef of the ith sampling dataset for a given sampling frequency the rb for a given ef rb ef is defined as the percentage of bias divided by the average exceedance frequency calculated as 4 r b e f i 1 n e f i e f a e f a 100 3 results 3 1 actual exceedance frequency efa at the highest sampling frequency 5 min per sample as expected there were more sampling datasets with exceedance at low threshold concentrations for both water quality variables in both watersheds table 2 we also found much lower numbers of sampling points exceeding threshold concentrations for both ss and no3 n in the lrw compared with the bbw from 2003 to 2008 in the lrw for ss there were zero sampling points exceeding 25 g l and only 23 points exceeding 5 g l compared to 202 and 5480 points respectively in the bbw similarly there were 4513 sampling points exceeding 5 ppm for no3 n in the lrw compared to 310 889 sampling points in the bbw from 2003 to 2008 values of efa for ss and no3 n in the lrw and bbw were calculated based on the number of sampling points with ef exceeding the selected threshold concentrations no3 n 10 7 5 ppm ss 25 5 0 5 0 125 g l at the highest sampling frequency table 3 efa decreased exponentially with increasing threshold concentration for both no3 n and ss in both watersheds table 3 this suggests that efa can be described as an exponential function of the threshold concentration model trend lines clearly demonstrate efa differences with respect to different threshold concentrations between water quality variables and between watersheds fig 2 efa values for no3 n and ss were substantially lower in the lrw than in the bbw for all threshold concentrations model parameter summaries could be used to estimate the efas of no3 n and ss for each watershed at different threshold concentrations 3 2 coefficient of variation of the concentration exceedance frequency in general values of cv ef increased with decreasing sampling frequency for both ss and no3 n in both the bbw and the lrw although there were some differences depending on threshold value and watershed tables 4 and 5 in bbw for ss with the lowest threshold of 0 125 g l the mean cv ef decreased exponentially from 139 89 to 0 01 when the sampling frequency increased from 1 sample yearly to 52 560 samples per year every 5 min correspondingly the std of cv ef also decreased exponentially from 87 14 to 0 01 similarly for no3 n with the lowest threshold of 5 ppm the mean cv ef decreased exponentially from 74 68 to 0 01 and std of cv ef from 40 49 to 0 01 when the sampling frequency increased from 1 sample to 52 560 samples per year however this pattern did not hold as well at higher threshold concentrations mainly because the infrequent concentrations exceeding the threshold value were more likely to be missed during low frequency sampling for example with a threshold concentration of 25 g l for ss in bbw no exceedance was detected when the sampling frequency was lower than 12 samples per year this problem became more severe for the lrw where no exceedance was detected at the highest threshold concentrations for ss 25 g l and no3 n 10 ppm note that there was no data for the std of cv ef for no3 n exceeding 7 ppm in the lrw because there was no exceedance other than in 2006 similarly due to the fewer data points exceeding the higher threshold concentrations than the lower threshold concentrations at the same sampling frequency cv ef values were mostly higher with higher threshold concentrations than with lower threshold concentrations for both ss and no3 n in both bbw and lrw to better understand the general relationship between cv ef and efa for different threshold concentrations and at different sampling frequencies irrespective of pollutant and watershed we pooled all ss and no3 n data from both watersheds to develop a model describing the relationship between cv ef efa and sampling frequencies fig 3 a results show that the cv ef decreased exponentially with increasing sampling frequency and efa fig 3b when efa was less than 0 01 the cv ef increased noticeably as the sampling frequency decreased even at a relatively high sampling frequency i e 4 380 samples per year the cv ef reached 4 90 indicating that rare events had larger variations higher cv ef values occurred with lower efa higher threshold for the same sampling frequency when efa was 15 2 the cv ef increased slowly as the sampling frequency decreased 3 3 relative bias of the concentration exceedance frequency rb ef in general the magnitudes of rb ef for ss and no3 n decreased with increasing sampling frequency in both the bbw and the lrw from 2003 to 2008 with the rate of decrease greater under lower threshold concentrations table 6 these trends were consistent with those of cv ef indicating that the estimation accuracy of ef increased with increasing sampling frequency regardless of threshold concentration most values of rb ef were close to zero when the sampling frequency was higher than 730 samples per year 12 h for ss and no3 n under low threshold concentration conditions the ef was severely underestimated for high threshold concentrations even when the sampling frequency was relatively high for example when the threshold concentration was 25 g l rb ef was close to 50 4 for ss in the bbw even at the relatively high sampling frequency of 4 380 per year every 2 h even at the sampling frequency of 10 min rb ef was still 25 0 average rb efs for ss in the bbw were all negative ranging from 75 0 to 6 3 when the sampling frequency increased from 2 1 2 year to 52 560 samples per year every 5 min for the threshold concentration of 25 g l when the threshold concentration decreased to 0 5 g l the bias was reduced to less than 1 0 with the sampling frequency increased to 4 380 samples per year every 2 h if the threshold concentration decreased to 0 125 g l the bias was less than 1 0 with the sampling frequency of 730 samples per year 2 samples per day we further investigated the general relationships between rb ef and efa for ss and no3 n in the bbw and the lrw at different sampling frequencies from 2003 to 2008 table 7 values of rb ef were close to zero with high sampling frequency 4380 samples per year and high efa 63 70 there were mostly high negative biases many close to 100 when the sampling frequency and efa were low however there were also some high positive biases up to 81 9 this implies that rarely occurring events would not be detected if the sampling frequency was low generally leading to underestimation of exceedance frequency when rarely occurring events were detected they often over represented the high concentrations resulting in overestimation of exceeding frequency by contrast when the sampling frequency increased to 4 380 samples per year and the efa increased to 69 24 the bias was reduced to less than 1 4 discussion 4 1 actual exceedance frequency efa and threshold concentration we found a clear difference in the efas of the two watersheds with the larger watershed lrw having a much lower efa for both no3 n and ss two factors land use and watershed size may explain why efa values in the smaller watershed are higher agricultural land accounts for approximately 65 of the total area in the bbw while in the lwr 16 of the area is agricultural land intensive agricultural activities e g tillage operations exposing soil have been linked to increased ss in streams chow and rees 2006 also frequent fertilizer applications can result in nutrient loss degrading stream ecosystems yang et al 2011 gao et al 2020 also reported that variations in annual pollutant loadings in the lrw watershed were lower than that in the bbw watershed size may also play an important role in affecting occurrences of pollutant concentrations exceeding the high threshold concentration smaller watersheds tend to react quickly to major storms with flash flooding runoff dramatically increasing pollutant concentrations concentrations of pollutants in streams are strongly affected by complex discharge rate patterns either as dilution effects or mobilization effects depending on the watershed size and pollutant minaudo et al 2019 bigger watersheds like the lrw have higher chances of being composed of a larger mixture or mosaic of nutrients ss inputs for example a much larger riparian buffer system was able to absorb pollutants washed off from uplands chase et al 2016 spatial heterogeneity of the sources of inputs in a larger watershed will lead to lower temporal variability compared to a smaller catchment zhang et al 2017 4 2 potential errors and accuracy of the exceedance estimation we used cv ef and rb ef to measure the accuracy of the exceedance estimation for both watersheds a low sampling frequency would lead to a lower estimation accuracy or higher uncertainties as indicated by cv ef this result is in general in agreement with previous studies for other water quality indicators such as annual loading jones et al 2012 gao et al 2020 similar to cv ef we also found that a lower sampling frequency tended to produce misleading results or biases as indicated by rb ef studies on the impact of the sampling frequency on the annual loading estimation accuracy have been carried out moatar et al 2013 gao et al 2020 dialameh and ghane 2022 however studies on concentration exceedance are rare an intensive study by jones et al 2012 found that the range of possible frequencies of exceedance broadens as the sampling frequency decreases consistent with our finding that as the sampling frequency decreases the cv of exceedance increases zhang et al 2019 also found that large flux biases are more likely associated with sites that have large concentration and discharge variabilities short concentration records and low sampling frequencies skeffington et al 2015 subsampled hourly measurements of dissolved oxygen do water temperature ph and p in four different catchments in southern england comparable to the lrw in size they found that water quality parameters like ph were relatively stable and that monthly samples were more than sufficient to achieve necessary accuracy for do and p monthly or weekly samples likely produced misleading results their results generally agreed with results from this study except that they did not assess exceedance frequencies note that their highest sampling frequency was hourly and that their objective was focused on the average concentration or average water temperature when combining data from both watersheds we found that cv ef decreased exponentially with sampling frequency and increasing efa this implies that it is difficult to achieve a reliable estimate of ef when the threshold concentration is high or when efa is low this is likely caused by the lower ef associated with higher threshold concentrations because there were more sampling points exceeding the lower threshold concentration for both water quality variables we noted high negative biases close to 100 with low frequency and low efa implying that rarely occurring events could not be detected at low sampling frequencies others have also reported similar observations for example babitsch and sundermann 2020 used the subsampling method to estimate the impact of sample size on pollutant loading and exceedance accuracy they also found that the estimation accuracy decreased as the sample size decreased concluding that the usage of small sample sizes would likely underestimate true mean annual pollutant loads in chemical surveillance and scientific research thus potentially jeopardizing the validity of results although jones et al 2012 did not draw conclusions on the potential biases incurred as the sampling frequency decreased they reported that the mean ef in one watershed studied was lower at lower sampling frequencies e g weekly and monthly compared to that at a higher sampling frequency in another watershed studied we conclude that the underestimation of ef at lower sampling frequencies is universal especially when the natural occurrence of exceedance is low this finding has important implications because low frequency sampling is commonly used to assess exceedances underreporting high concentration events 5 conclusions determining appropriate sampling frequencies is critically important for hydrological studies because high sampling frequencies are associated with higher costs and low sampling frequencies could lead to lower accuracies or even misleading biases in this study we evaluated the relationship between sampling frequency and the estimation accuracy of the concentration exceedance frequency ef for suspended solids ss and nitrate nitrogen no3 n in two watersheds i e a small agricultural watershed of 14 5 km2 and a larger forested watershed of 389 km2 we found that the actual exceedance frequency efa dramatically differed between the two watersheds with the larger little river watershed lrw having a much lower efa than the smaller black brook watershed bbw for both no3 n and ss this difference was likely caused by the different proportions of agricultural land in each watershed i e 17 in the lrw versus 68 in the bbw we also found that efa decreased exponentially with increasing threshold concentration values of efa for no3 n and ss can be modeled as exponential functions of threshold concentration used to calculate the ef with different parameters for different watersheds and different water quality variables the model can be used to estimate efa in both watersheds with different threshold concentrations for different water quality standards we also found that the coefficient of variation of the ef cv ef decreased with increasing sampling frequency and decreased with increasing efa for both no3 n and ss in both watersheds based on all data from both watersheds combined the cv ef can thus be modeled as an exponential function of sampling frequency and efa in other words the estimation accuracy of ef as measured by the cv is only related to efa and sampling frequency regardless of the measured pollutant or monitored watershed we found that the relative bias rb tended to be negative when the threshold concentration was high and when the sampling frequency was low especially for ss with threshold concentrations equal to 25 g l in the bbw and 5 g l in the lrw similar to cv ef the rb ef was also affected by sampling frequency and efa specifically when efa was low the ef could be severely underestimated even when sampled at a relatively high frequency declaration of competing interest the

8547,the sensitivity of future groundwater recharge and temperature development was investigated for three alluvial aquifers in the urban agglomeration of the city of basel switzerland for selected climate projections groundwater recharge and the associated temperature imprinting of aquifers which are mainly determined by artificial groundwater recharge and infiltrating surface water were investigated 3d numerical groundwater flow and heat transport modeling allowed quantifying and differentiating between natural and artificial groundwater recharge and thermal impacts for aquifers where the infiltration of river water is an important component in the groundwater balance the effects of climate change will be influenced by changes in river flow and thermal regimes and also by artificial groundwater recharge of surface water considering all climate scenarios investigated the net heat input from river water infiltration for the lange erlen case study area increases by an average of 42 by 2055 and 62 by 2085 compared to the reference year 2000 together with further heat inputs particularly by artificial groundwater recharge the temperatures of the extracted drinking water would increase by 0 4 to 1 3 k by 2055 and 0 7 to 3 1 k by 2085 in the hardwald case study area the most significant heat exchange occurs by artificial groundwater recharge as a result and considering all climate scenarios investigated heat loss by groundwater extraction increases by an average of 38 during the winter months from the year 2000 to the year 2085 the increased heat input especially in the summer months results in a temperature increase of the extracted drinking water of 0 2 to 1 0 k by 2055 and 0 6 to 4 0 k by 2085 in the lower birs valley case study area net heat input from river water infiltration increases by an average of 42 by 2055 and 62 by 2085 correspondingly the temperatures of the extracted drinking water increase by 0 9 to 3 2 k by 2055 and by 0 3 to 5 4 k by 2085 the quantitative assessment of climate change impacts on the groundwater resources presented allows to differentiate between hydraulic and thermal impacts of natural and artificial groundwater recharge processes accordingly individual drinking water wells are exposed differently to the various components of groundwater recharge seasonal shifts in natural groundwater recharge processes and adaptation strategies related to artificial groundwater recharge could therefore be an important factor affecting groundwater resources in future moreover increased groundwater recharge from artificial groundwater recharge systems in summer months and the interaction with surface waters during high runoff periods which will occur more often in winter months are likely to strongly influence groundwater recharge and temperatures keywords groundwater recharge artificial infiltration river groundwater interaction temperature imprinting seasonal shift data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction the expected quantitative and qualitative impacts of climate change on surface and groundwater resources ipcc 2014 highlight the importance of this issue on national and international policy agendas from the global scale of the climate change phenomenon it is likely that water balances will also be affected at local scales oni et al 2014 porporato et al 2004 switzerland is particularly exposed to climate change and its impact on hydrology and hydrogeology climatological and hydrological studies such as ch2018 2018 hydro ch2018 2020 ch2014 impacts 2014 ch2011 2011 and nrp61 2015 estimate that dry periods will occur more frequently in summer while slightly higher precipitation and a rising snow line should lead to increased river runoff and groundwater recharge in winter while total annual water balances of swiss water resources including groundwater will only change slightly in the future seasonal changes are expected to be more pronounced likewise changes in groundwater recharge of regional aquifers are expected changnon et al 1988 zektser and loaiciga 1993 the motivation for this research was the increasing temperatures of swiss surface waters hari et al 2006 michel et al 2019 michel et al 2021 and groundwater resources epting et al 2021 epting et al 2020 hunkeler 2020 which can be expected as a consequence of climate change but also as a result of local anthropogenic activities especially in urban areas quantitative and qualitative temperature deficits of underground resources will be increasingly observed bafu 2021 estimated future increase of groundwater demand during droughts will be accompanied by increased artificial groundwater recharge with comparatively warm surface water in summer which will additionally increase groundwater temperatures and thus the drinking water extracted after 2003 buwal et al 2004 zappa and kan 2007 also 2006 russo et al 2015 2015 bafu 2016 and 2018 bafu 2019 liechti et al 2019 meteoschweiz 2018 tratschin et al 2019 were characterized by summer heat waves zappa et al 2019 for these years a noticeable increase in water temperature particularly in the lowland rivers flowing through the swiss plateau could be observed piccolroaz et al 2018 in switzerland so called heat summers or years occur when temperatures exceed 30 c for more than five consecutive days which according to the world meteorological organization wmo is 3 to 5 k above the long term daily temperature maximum in these years also high groundwater temperatures were recorded schürch et al 2018 practical experience in recent years has shown that drinking water temperatures above 25 c can occur in water supply systems and endanger a hygienically safe groundwater supply osmancevic et al 2018 at water temperatures above 15 c it tastes insipid several studies have shown clear positive trends in river water temperature in the last decades at various locations worldwide dokulil 2014 foen 2012 hannah and garner 2015 morrison et al 2002 o reilly et al 2015 watts et al 2015 webb 1996 in switzerland observations since 1970 show a trend of 0 33 k per decade in surface water temperature slightly lower than observations for air temperature this warming is more marked on the swiss plateau lowland catchments than for higher altitude surface waters michel et al 2020 vinna et al 2021 the latter being characterized by higher thermal resilience due to cooling effects of either snow glacier melting or releases from high altitude hydropower reservoirs during the warm season piccolroaz et al 2016 meanwhile no clear trend in discharge can be attributed to climate change over the last few decades michel et al 2020 anthropogenic influence on surface water

influence on surface water through thermal pollution has also been shown to modify the relationship between air and water temperature webb et al 2008 such influences must be taken into consideration when studying the impact of climate change in anthropogenically modified and perturbed catchments hannah and garner 2015 vinna et al 2018 webb et al 2008 the warming observed in the past is expected to continue over the next decade and to accelerate toward the end of the century with high emissions scenarios the summer warming of surface waters could then reach 4 k for rivers on the swiss plateau and 6 k in alpine rivers michel et al 2021 however significant long term increase in groundwater temperatures as could be expected as a result of climate change and observed regionally for example in austria umweltbundesamt 2011 has not yet been observed in switzerland foen 2019 schürch et al 2018 generally the increase in surface water temperatures is also expected to affect groundwater temperature which are fed by surface water infiltration epting et al 2021 most research to date has focused on predicting possible impacts of climate change on surface waters while large regional and coarse resolution models have been used for groundwater systems to determine their sensitivity to changes in critical input parameters such as precipitation and runoff york et al 2002 yusoff et al 2002 with a few exceptions of detailed investigations of very small aquifers e g malcolm and soulsby 2000 most studies concentrated on entire catchment areas and only on changes in percolating precipitation water i e precipitation fed aquifers in a synopsis of climate change effects on groundwater recharge the importance of understanding groundwater recharge processes including timing and location for the characterization of groundwater resources was emphasized by smerdon 2017 six review articles crosbie et al 2013 green et al 2011 kurylyk and macquarrie 2013 meixner et al 2016 moeck et al 2016 taylor et al 2013 show that the uncertainty of distribution and trend in future precipitation from general circulation models gcm results in varying predictions of groundwater recharge these studies also conclude that the modeling studies are often not able to predict the magnitude and direction increase or decrease of future recharge conditions several recent publications highlighted the role of quaternary deposits to store groundwater in alpine regions christensen et al 2020 and specifically the role of unconsolidated quaternary deposits arnoux et al 2021 arnoux et al 2020 wirth et al 2020 only a few studies address river groundwater interaction under climate change scenarios e g epting et al 2021 scibek et al 2007 where changes in river flow regime and changes in groundwater recharge interact these interactions are particularly important since groundwater recharge often comprises large fractions of infiltrated surface water huggenberger and epting 2011 epting et al 2021 demonstrated that in order to understand the future development of groundwater temperatures it is necessary to take a differentiated view of geological site conditions and relevant hydrogeological processes including the processes of groundwater recharge positive and negative responses and direct anthropogenic influences knowledge of these fundamentals is essential for understanding the response of aquifers to anthropogenic and climate change impacts within the scope of the research program hydro ch2018 epting et al 2021 foen 2020 it was hypothesized that for generally high yielding alluvial aquifers quantitative groundwater recharge and the associated temperature imprinting of aquifers is primarily determined by infiltrating surface water i e river fed aquifers specifically increased groundwater recharge during high runoff periods is expected to have a strong influence on groundwater temperatures of river fed aquifers while quantitative results on river discharge and temperature changes could be derived michel et al 2021 potential effects of increased or decreased temperatures of infiltrating surface water on groundwater resources could only be assessed qualitatively therefore this research focuses on a quantitative assessment of climate change on different groundwater recharge components of three alluvial aquifers in the urban agglomeration of the city of basel switzerland baseline data include hydraulic and temperature measurements within the rivers and groundwater resources also used for calibration and validation data derived from river discharge and water temperature modeling as well as operational forecasts of the water suppliers we hypothesized that seasonal shifts in groundwater recharge processes related to surface water infiltration from rivers and artificial groundwater recharge due to climate change are important factors affecting future groundwater and accordingly drinking water temperatures 2 investigation areas

providing approx 30 000 m3 d drinking water to six communities comprising approximately 51 000 people 2 1 artificial groundwater recharge in the three case study areas surface water is used for artificial groundwater recharge which contributes significantly to the overall groundwater balance there are three main reasons for the need for artificial recharge of groundwater resources in the basel area 1 groundwater extraction exceeds natural groundwater recharge 2 the use of previously filtered and to some extent treated river water can improve the quality of the extracted water and 3 the installation of artificial hydraulic barriers makes it possible to limit the inflow of groundwater with poor water quality particularly relevant for the hardwald study area in the lange erlen and hardwald case study areas water of the river rhine is used for artificial groundwater recharge at the artificial recharge plant in the lower birs valley water of the river birs is used for artificial groundwater recharge different methods of artificial recharge are used fig 2 1 infiltration fields lange erlen 2 infiltration trenches and ponds hardwald and 3 infiltration systems with filter layers and injection wells lower birs valley 2 2 selected climate projections to evaluate climate related changes to the different groundwater recharge components and the studied aquifers 3 climate projections developed within ch2018 2018 have been selected ch2018 project team 2018 ch2018 2018 feigenwinter et al 2018 for each of the projections the emission scenarios rcp2 6 4 scenarios consistent climate protection and limitation of warming to 2 k compared to the pre industrial state rcp4 5 6 scenarios medium development with limited climate protection and rcp8 5 7 scenarios no climate protection were studied climate model output from the daily local ch2018 product climate models downscaled to the location of meteorological stations was selected for the river temperature modeling with the air2stream model section 2 3 daily resolved air temperature data from the basel station bas covering 1981 to 2099 were used in situ air temperature measurements from bas was additionally used for model calibration and forcing adjustment sections 2 3 3 1 as boundary condition for the groundwater heat transport models we selected two climate models from each rcp scenario which covered the complete hydraulic range of discharge and river temperature from air2stream model runs i e maximum and minimum bounds table 1 and table a1 3 in the appendix 2 3 river discharge and water temperature modeling to derive climate related changes in quantitative groundwater recharge via infiltrating surface waters and artificial groundwater recharge and associated temperature effects it was important to evaluate changed river runoff and temperatures at selected locations along the rivers within the aquifers that were investigated table a2 4 and fig a2 4 in the appendix future projections of runoff from the prevah precipitation runoff evapotranspiration hydrological response unit hru related model model at 200 m resolution were used in this work brunner et al 2019a brunner et al 2019b viviroli et al 2009 input data for the prevah models include precipitation air temperature relative humidity shortwave radiation and wind speed using the same data as for the gcm rcm models table 1 and table a1 3 in the appendix model results include future projections of streamflow including glacier and snowmelt but projections of water temperature trends were previously lacking therefore for the present hydrologic modeling the hybrid physical statistical model air2stream piccolroaz et al 2016 toffolon and piccolroaz 2015 was used to simulate future stream temperature projections and which has already been extensively validated including applications to swiss streams piccolroaz et al 2016 råman vinnå et al 2018 toffolon and piccolroaz 2015 whereas the runoff projections of the prevah models cover the whole of switzerland the present study is limited to the basel region in northwestern switzerland the air2stream model were simulated with data from one meteorological station basel bas fig 1 for four river stations monitored by the hydrology division of the foen table a2 4 and fig a2 4 in the appendix rivers birs 2106 rhine 2289 rheinfelden 2091 and wiese 2199 for the calibration of the air2stream model historical water temperature measurements from the foen were used since no water temperature data were available at the river rhine station 2289 water temperature measurements from the foen river rhine station 2613 which is located 6 900 m downstream of station 2289 were used instead the hybrid river water temperature model air2stream eight parameter version table a4 in the appendix combines comparatively simple stochastic models for parameter calibration with a physically based structure that accounts for the main physical processes controlling the thermal dynamics of rivers the model requires air temperature and discharge as inputs to calculate river water temperature with a daily time resolution it was calibrated for the period in which measured data of air temperature discharge and tributary water temperature were available this approach did not allow for independent model validation which was deliberately omitted in favor of a more robust calibration of the parameters 2 4 groundwater heat transport modeling for the finite element flow and heat transport modeling the software feflow 7 2 dhi diersch 2014 was used the bedrock topography of the hydrogeologic models was prepared using the geologic 3d gocad 1999 model of the basel region dresmann et al 2015 contrary to the consideration of entire river catchment areas for which a more or less closed water balance can be calculated additional water components in and outflows must be considered for aquifers over different boundaries some of the groundwater recharge components including temperature imprinting can directly be influenced by atmospheric climate change via precipitation and hydrological runoff conditions table 2 summarizes the main groundwater recharge components natural boundary conditions include percolating precipitation regional groundwater inflow imported groundwater regimes and out and inflow from the lateral hillslope catchment areas as well as interaction of surface waters with groundwater anthropogenic boundary conditions include groundwater extraction and artificial groundwater recharge to ensure comparability between the three modeled case study areas the corresponding boundary conditions were uniformly defined and parameterized the hydraulic and thermal conditions at the model boundaries e g specified hydraulic heads and temperatures flow and heat fluxes fig 1 are defined on the basis of river and groundwater measurement data and already developed procedures for model parameterization epting 2017 this data allowed to define the present state of the studied river groundwater systems which involves assessing the hydrological hydrogeological and geological as well as anthropogenic settings mostly stationary character and hydraulic and thermal boundary conditions mostly transient character the hydraulic and thermal present state describes an average situation including seasonal but also event and use related variations in flow and thermal regimes for river groundwater systems concerning the climate change scenarios all results are discussed by comparing the simulation results for the years 2055 and 2085 to the reference year 2000 2 4 1 upper boundary condition compared to the amounts of artificially recharged water well extractions and river infiltration groundwater recharge due to percolating precipitation is an insignificant component in the overall water balance of the groundwater bodies studied huggenberger and epting 2011 page et al 2011 and does not have a sensitive effect on the modeling therefore for the present state only average annual precipitation rates bas station fig 1 and considering evapotranspiration losses were included consistently over time in the different model areas table 3 for heavily sealed surfaces values for percolating precipitation water is reduced huggenberger and epting 2011 for the present state thermal upper boundary condition ground temperature measured at a depth of 20 cm at a location in the city of basel fig 1 were employed as cauchy boundary condition in daily resolution the heat transfer rate from the surface was inversely calibrated with pest whereas this parameter summarizes attributes such as the distance to groundwater as well as the thermal properties of the soil to account for the thermal effects of climate change for this boundary condition the trend in temperature for the selected climate projections was considered table b1 in the appendix 2 4 2 regional groundwater flow the regional groundwater in and outflow of the different gravel aquifers was defined as 1st kind dirichlet boundary condition by means of the hydraulics measured in ow fig 1 and table 3 hill slope inflows were defined as 2nd kind flux neumann boundary condition whereas areal groundwater recharge was estimated in relation to the hill slope catchment areas e g huggenberger et al 2006 as for the upper boundary condition to account for the thermal effects of climate change the trend in temperature for the selected climate projections was considered table b1 in the appendix concerning the hydraulic effect of climate projections on this boundary no data basis was available and the present state was maintained 2 4 3 surface waters to assess the impact of climate change on the investigated aquifers in relation to the interaction with the rivers different interaction types were distinguished including table 3 i infiltration of surface water for connected river groundwater systems where the riverbed is directly connected to the groundwater saturated zone of the aquifer ii unconnected systems where the riverbed is separated from the groundwater saturated zone of the aquifer and surface water infiltrates into the aquifer via the unsaturated zone iii exfiltration of groundwater with hydraulic gradients from the groundwater to the river and groundwater exfiltrates into the river the hydraulics and temperatures of the surface waters are continuously measured at various foen stations table a4 in the appendix based on gaging curves the discharges resulting from the hydrological simulations could be converted to water levels required for groundwater modeling fig b1 in the appendix the converted water levels were interpolated to selected points along the rivers wiese rhine and birs based on longitudinal riverbed profiles of the watercourses for all points where a larger vertical offset of the river bottom exists e g bottom sills or locks along the river wiese or the birsfelden river power plant along the river rhine the water level was calculated according to the elevation of the bottom up and downstream from the offset and interpolated in between both the hydraulic and the thermal boundary conditions of the rivers were realized as 3rd kind cauchy whereas the hydraulic and thermal transfer rates were inversely calibrated with pest to account for transient permeability of the riverbed conductance the transfer rate for flow was described as time varying using colmation decolmation models affolter et al 2010a these describe the change in the hydraulic properties of the riverbed at low and medium discharge the permeability of the riverbed decreases due to the settling and penetration of fine particles into the pore space of the cover or filter layer colmation and approaches a minimum value above a certain discharge threshold during flood events the colmated riverbed is ruptured and the permeability increases abruptly after the flood colmation of the riverbed starts again the base value as well as the maximum value of the conductance were determined beforehand by means of inverse calibration with pest for different river sections 2 4 4 groundwater extraction and artificial recharge groundwater extraction and recharge data which are related to the amount of water per infiltration system were provided by the water supplies the data on groundwater recharge are subject to large uncertainties for operational reasons for example the error in the lange erlen case study area is estimated to about 30 when allocating the total amount of water to the individual infiltration fields in the lange erlen case study area as well as to the various trenches and ponds in the hardwald case study area gates are opened on an empirical basis of a certain number of revolutions flow rates are or were measured only sporadically evapotranspiration from the forested infiltration fields trenches and ponds also removes some of the water from the infiltration volume which also contributes to the uncertainty in the recharge data another uncertainty in the lange erlen case study area infiltration system is associated with the impounded area of the infiltration fields it is known that some fields do not wet the entire area during recharge periods but often only partial areas to reduce this uncertainty the borderline of the effective artificial infiltration fields was measured with a handheld gps device however even if the wetted area at maximum water level in the infiltration fields is known the water infiltrates heterogeneously there may even be individual sip points or areas which are only wetted for a short time at maximum water level and subsequently no longer contribute to infiltration the recharge data in the lange erlen case study area in m3 d were divided by the area of each recharge field to obtain the corresponding flux per unit area according to the new measurements subsequently these fluxes per unit area which have the dimension of a velocity value m d were integrated into the groundwater model as 2nd kind neumann boundary condition in contrast to artificial groundwater recharge the groundwater extractions at all wells are recorded with high temporal resolution and were integrated into the model in hourly resolution for the simulated period daily totals of the water volumes in m3 d were available for the artificial groundwater recharge of the hardwald case study area based on flow measurements a distribution key percentage of infiltration rates in m d per trench and pond for the infiltration per trench section and pond for different operational conditions could be defined as 2nd kind neumann boundary condition the groundwater extractions are recorded at all wells and were considered as daily mean values finally at the artificial recharge facility in the lower birs valley treated water from the river birs is infiltrated into the groundwater by 9 injection wells at full operation about 200 l s 1 are infiltrated the hourly recharge quantities are recorded which were included in the model as daily sum 2nd kind neumann boundary condition also the groundwater extractions are recorded at all wells and were considered as daily mean values in the groundwater model no systematic measurements of the recharge water temperature were available therefore the temperature of the recharge water was measured in a selected infiltration field in the lange erlen case study area fig 4 as well as in an infiltration trench in the hardwald fig 5 in both cases the temperature measurements of the recharge water agree well with the river rhine water temperatures bafu station rhine weil rheinfelden 2091 for the modeling therefore the water temperatures of the river rhine could directly be considered for the parameterization of the temperature boundary condition 1st kind dirichlet for the recharge water due to the small distance of the artificial infiltration facility in the lower birs valley to the river birs it was assumed that also here the temperature of the recharge water corresponds to that of the river bafu station birs münchenstein hofmatt 2106 2 5 groundwater heat transport model calibration the hydraulic properties which are highly heterogeneous were inversely calibrated using automated parameter estimation pest model independent parameter estimation and uncertainty analysis and the pilot points method doherty 1994 doherty 2010 doherty et al 2011 the groundwater flow models for the case study areas already existed and the hydraulics had already been calibrated and validated transiently for different time periods within the framework of different research projects table 4 for this project the models were calibrated for heat transport table 4 therefore thermal aquifer properties thermal conductivity and thermal capacity as well as thermal transfer rates across stream bottoms were calibrated based on observed temperature measurements for the description of model performance the root mean square error rmse the mean absolute error mae and the normalized root mean square error nrmse were calculated according to 1 rmse 1 n i 1 n y meas i y cal i 2 2 mae 1 n i 1 n y meas i y cal i and 3 nrmse rmse y meas where n is the number of measurements y meas i the measured values hydraulic head and temperature at time i and y cal i the calculated value at time i respectively and y meas the mean of the measured values normalizing the rmse facilitates the comparison between datasets of the different models of the study areas the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient e was also determined nash and sutcliffe 1970 which is another widely used normalized metric it is defined as 4 e 1 i 1 n y meas i y cal i 2 i 1 n y meas i y meas 2 the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient can take values between to 1 an efficiency of 1 corresponds to a perfect match of measured and calculated values an efficiency of 0 means that the calculated values are as accurate as the mean of the observed data values less than 0 mean that the error variance numerator in equation is greater than the variance of the measured data denominator in equation 2 6 operational scenarios for the lange erlen and hardwald case study areas the selected operational scenarios consider increased supply for the hardwald case study area also reduced also based on demand development forecasts general water supply planning march 2019 when selecting the operational scenarios for the artificial groundwater recharge plant in the lower birs valley it was evaluated how large the minimum recharge volumes must be so that the water supplies of the municipalities of aesch and reinach fig 1 are guaranteed even during dry summer months the groundwater flow model of the lower birs valley was validated using the measurement data of the dry summer 2018 the selected operational scenarios table 4 for the three artificial recharge systems were simulated for the present state as well as for the climate projection with the maximum expected changes table 1 scenario s6 3 results 3 1 hydrological modeling despite the high resolution of the gcm rcm modeling considered and the statistical downscaling using the meteorological stations minor differences exist between modeled and observed air temperature during the historical period table a1 and fig a1 in the appendix similar yet extensive discrepancies also exist between modeled and measured runoff because the air2stream model was calibrated based on air temperature and discharge measurements and because of the data driven derivation of model parameters such differences even if small may artificially alter the quantification of projected river water temperature into the future to avoid this problem future projections of the time series of air temperature and runoff used as inputs to air2stream were statistically adjusted using the change factor approach diaz nieto and wilby 2005 minville et al 2008 piccolroaz et al 2021 climatological mean annual cycles on a daily time scale for the calibration period were produced for both measured and rcm gcm modeled air temperatures and discharges fig a1 4 in the appendix keeping the projected trends in the rcm gcm datasets the climate forcing for air temperature and runoff was then adjusted each year according to equation 5 5 f n i f o i c s j c m j where fni is the adjusted variable at time i foi is the daily time series of the variable simulated from the rcm gcm model combinations and cmj and csj are the climatological years for measurements and gcm rcm output on the day of year j corresponding to time i respectively the climatological years were smoothed using a 60 day window to remove the effect of possible pulse events especially for discharge and river discharge was never lower bounded by the minimum observed flow to maintain validity of calibrated parameters the mean flow used by air2stream to normalize the time varying flow and water depth see parameters δ and ϑ in the model equations toffolon and piccolroaz 2015 was limited to include only the time period used for calibration from the climate modeling it is evident that the trend in air temperature has a seasonal component bas station fig 1 with more warming in the summer months compared to the rest of the year fig 3 surface water runoff follows a similar seasonal pattern with increased runoff during winter months and reduced runoff in summer months fig 3 this phenomenon is most pronounced for the river rhine stations 2289 and 2091 fig 1 as upstream glaciers and snowfields are expected to shrink and days with snow cover to decrease the seasonal dependence of the increase in air temperature and the change in runoff results in elevated river warming in the summer months and decreased warming in the winter months fig 3 the degree of warming resulting from the simulations depends on the respective climate scenarios as expected the highest warming can be observed for the climate scenario rcp8 5 air temperature 0 4 k per decade and river temperatures between 0 2 and 0 25 k per decade the extent to which air and water temperatures differ depends on the size of the watercourse with the rhine stations 2289 and 2091 fig 1 showing the greatest dependence between the decrease in discharge and the increase in water temperatures fig a5 in the appendix 3 2 groundwater flow and heat transport modeling fig 4 fig 5 and fig 6 show the present state of the hydraulic and thermal groundwater regime for different seasons in the lange erlen the hardwald and the lower birs valley case study areas respectively the influence of artificial groundwater recharge is clearly visible in all case study areas including the cooling effect on the groundwater in the winter and spring months and the heat introduced into the aquifer in the summer and autumn months cooling and heating plumes move down gradient from the individual infiltration systems to the drinking water wells 3 2 1 lange erlen present state overall the calibration period from 01 01 2018 to 31 12 2018 1 a mostly indicates good agreements between measured and calculated groundwater levels table b2 in the appendix the rmse mae nrmse between the observed and calculated heads ranges between only 0 06 to 0 46 m 0 08 to 0 42 m 7 to 23 respectively the nse ranges between 0 14 and 0 87 the rmse mae nrmse between the observed and calculated temperatures of the drinking water and observation wells ranges between 1 3 and 4 2 k 1 1 to 3 6 k 12 to 106 and 1 1 to 7 1 k 0 9 to 6 2 k 5 to 83 respectively the nse ranges between 0 25 and 0 99 for the drinking water wells and between 0 28 and 0 96 for the observation wells despite the sometimes large deviations between measured and calculated groundwater temperatures and negative nse values the temporal development of measured and calculated groundwater temperatures in the drinking water and observation wells down gradient of the infiltration systems indicates a reasonable agreement figs b2 and b3 in the appendix in general the fit for the observation wells is often better than for the drinking water wells which can be explained by the fact that the flow model was calibrated based on the hydraulics of the observation wells especially for individual wells the measured temperature profiles can reasonably be reproduced with the heat transport model also in the observation wells down gradient of the infiltration systems the measured temperature profiles can be reproduced very well with the simulation this shows that the thermal influence of artificial groundwater recharge is well captured by the heat transport model for the lange erlen case study area the main influence on the groundwater balance fig 7 and fig b4 in the appendix is the infiltration of river water as well as the artificial groundwater recharge and the groundwater extraction of the drinking water wells large volumes of groundwater leave the model area via the western model boundary while groundwater extraction by the wells is relatively balanced and constant over the entire data period artificial groundwater recharge varies strongly and abruptly when the system is temporarily out of service compared to low water situations during flood events much more almost a factor of 2 surface water infiltrates from the river wiese into the groundwater fig b5 in the appendix shows an annual cycle and fig 7 summarizes the heat balances across the most important boundary conditions in the lange erlen case study area the heat exchange across the unsaturated zone ranges between 100 mw and is more or less balanced over the year compared to the case study areas in the hardwald and the lower birs valley the depth of the groundwater table is comparatively small at a few meters below the soil surface and therefore a seasonal atmospheric influence on groundwater temperatures is to be expected heat introduced to the aquifer by the infiltration of river water sometimes reaches values above 60 mw in summer and late summer is comparatively high and shows a marked seasonal pattern characterized by a phase lag compared to the river water temperature cycle the heat loss from the groundwater into the river exfiltration is comparatively low and can be observed mainly in the first half of the year with a maximum in the spring months below 10 mw the heat loss can be explained by the fact that in the first half of the year the groundwater temperatures are temporarily higher than those of the river water and accordingly a thermal gradient from the groundwater to the river exists via the regional groundwater inflow from the northeastern river valley comparatively little heat is introduced into the aquifer the down gradient heat loss from the aquifer towards basel is comparatively high reaching 70 mw which can be attributed to the heat introduced to the groundwater via river infiltration and partly also via artificial groundwater recharge the heat exchange via artificial groundwater recharge is comparatively balanced over the year via the artificial groundwater recharge cooling of the groundwater occurs in the autumn and winter months with a maximum of about 70 mw and heat is introduced to the groundwater in the spring and summer months with a maximum of almost 85 mw peaks of heat output in summer months can be associated with comparatively cold river water which is infiltrated after previously comparatively warm water was infiltrated short peaks in heat output during the summer months can be associated with relatively cold river water infiltrating after phases where previously comparatively warm water was infiltrated fig b5 in the appendix due to the groundwater extractions of the drinking water supply a heat loss from the groundwater with a maximum above 25 mw takes place mainly in the second half of the year which is confirmed by measured elevated temperatures in the extracted water fig b4 in the appendix 3 2 2 hardwald present state overall the calibration period 01 10 2011 30 09 2012 1 a mostly indicates good agreement between measured and calculated groundwater levels table b3 the rmse mae nrmse between the observed and calculated heads ranges between only 0 05 to 1 43 m 0 04 to 1 42 m 0 to 266 respectively the nse ranges between 0 07 and 0 60 the rmse mae nrmse between the observed and calculated temperatures of the drinking water and observation wells ranges between 0 7 and 1 9 k 0 6 to 1 8 k 9 to 50 and 0 1 to 4 0 k 0 1 to 3 5 k 17 to 211 respectively the nse ranges between 0 24 and 0 90 for the drinking water wells and between 0 05 and 0 78 for the observation wells despite the sometimes large deviations between measured and calculated groundwater temperatures and negative nse values the temporal development of measured and calculated groundwater temperatures in the drinking water and observation wells down gradient of the infiltration systems indicates a reasonable agreement figs b6 and b7 in the appendix for most wells expect for ow10 and w19 the measured temperature profiles can reasonably be reproduced with the heat transport model also in the observation wells down gradient of the infiltration systems the measured temperature profiles can be reproduced very well with the simulation this shows that the thermal influence of artificial groundwater recharge is well captured by the heat transport model for the hardwald case study area the main influence on the groundwater balance fig 7 and fig b8 in the appendix is the artificial groundwater recharge while groundwater extractions by the drinking water wells are only half as large the magnitudes of in and outflow via the natural boundary conditions of the rivers and the southeastern and southern model boundary are comparatively balanced resulting in a small positive net contribution fig b9 in the appendix shows the annual cycle and fig 7 summarizes the heat balances across the most important boundary conditions in the hardwald case study area the heat input across the unsaturated zone reaches values of up to 460 mw in the summer months while the heat loss in the winter months reaches values of 290 mw the heat exchange is large compared to the other boundary conditions but more or less balanced over the year since the depth of the groundwater table generally is greater than 10 m over large areas the seasonal atmospheric influence on groundwater temperatures is expected to be minor the heat exchange across the river rhine is generally in the range of 45 mw and is thus one order of magnitude smaller than the heat exchange across the unsaturated zone due to the temperature gradient in the autumn and winter months comparatively warmer groundwater exfiltrates into the comparatively cold river thus a heat loss from the aquifer into the river takes place in the spring and summer months heat is introduced from the comparatively warmer river into the aquifer the variability of heat exchange is due to the non stationarity of surface water runoff and the processes of river groundwater interaction a net heat loss from the aquifer can be observed throughout the year although less in the late spring and summer months lower thermal gradient from the groundwater to surface water during single flood events increased heat exchange results the heat exchange via the regional groundwater flow towards the east and southeast is generally small with an almost zero net effect fig b8 in the appendix via the artificial groundwater recharge heat is introduced into the groundwater with maximum values reaching 150 mw especially in the summer half year the heat introduced via the artificial groundwater recharge is higher than the effect of the cooling of the groundwater by the infiltration of comparatively colder recharge water in the winter month with maximum values reaching 115 mw as for the lange erlen case study area short peaks in heat output during the summer months can be associated with relatively cold river water infiltrating after phases where previously comparatively warm water was infiltrated fig b9 in the appendix groundwater extractions from the drinking water supply result in a highly seasonal heat loss with a maximum in late autumn of more than 15 mw which is confirmed by measured elevated temperatures in the extracted water 3 2 3 lower birs valley present state overall the calibration period 01 01 2018 bis 31 12 2018 1 a mostly indicates good agreements between measured and calculated groundwater levels table b4 the rmse mae nrmse between the observed and calculated heads ranges between 0 31 and 0 60 m 0 23 to 0 48 m 12 to 24 respectively the nse ranges between 0 35 and 1 00 the rmse mae nrmse between the observed and calculated temperatures of the observation wells ranges between a perfect match of 0 to only 1 6 k 0 0 to 1 6 k 6 to 328 the nse ranges between 0 77 and 1 00 for the observation wells especially in the observation wells down gradient of the infiltration systems the measured temperature profiles can be reproduced very well with the simulation fig b10 this shows that the thermal influence of artificial groundwater recharge is well captured by the heat transport model in the lower birs valley case study area the main influence on the groundwater balance fig 7 and fig b11 in the appendix is the interaction with the river birs likewise the infiltration of comparatively cold river water into the aquifer can be clearly observed in the spring and winter months for a southern section of the river birs in correspondence of a double bend of the river fig 6 further the inflow via the southern and the outflow via the northern model boundary are important boundary conditions whereas artificial groundwater recharge is mainly operated in summer groundwater extraction via drinking water wells takes place all year round fig b12 in the appendix shows the annual cycle and fig 7 summarizes the heat balances across the most important boundary conditions in the lower birs valley case study area fig 1 heat exchange across the unsaturated zone is comparatively large sometimes exceeding 9 mw but is more or less balanced throughout the year since the depth of to the groundwater table over large areas generally is larger than 10 m the seasonal atmospheric influence on groundwater temperatures is expected to be minor the heat introduced across the river birs shows a strong variability reaches almost 9 mw in late summer and is in the same order of magnitude as the heat exchange across the unsaturated zone as described above for the river rhine the variability of heat exchange between the river birs and the aquifer is due to the non stationarity of surface water runoff and the processes of river groundwater interaction a heat loss from the aquifer of around 1 7 mw can be observed throughout the year although less in the summer months lower thermal gradient from the groundwater to the river this is due to the fact that individual sections of the river birs are mainly receiving groundwater thus at these sections the processes of groundwater exfiltration dominate fig b11 in the appendix in general however a net positive heat flux from the river to the groundwater is observed during one annual cycle fig 7 and fig b12 in the appendix via the regional groundwater flow regime heat is introduced from the south and is comparatively constant at about 3 7 mw the down gradient heat loss from the aquifer towards the north is slightly higher with about 5 7 mw but also comparatively constant this net heat gain within the valley groundwater flow regime can be associated with additional heat introduced by river infiltration see above the western hill slope boundary inflow and partly also by the artificial groundwater recharge the heat exchange via artificial groundwater recharge is small compared to the groundwater recharge systems in the lange erlen and hardwald case study areas because much less water is artificially recharged table 4 fig b11 in the appendix in the winter half year artificial groundwater recharge results in sporadic cooling of the groundwater with a maximum heat extraction of more than 6 mw the heat introduced by artificial groundwater recharge with maximum values of more than 15 mw into the groundwater occurs mainly in the summer half year due to the groundwater extractions of the drinking water supply a seasonal heat loss takes place and is most pronounced in late summer with a maximum of above 5 mw 3 2 4 hydraulic and thermal groundwater regime climate scenarios fig 8 shows the seasonal heat exchange for the reference years 2000 2055 and 2085 for all investigated climate scenarios table 1 in the lange erlen the hardwald and the lower birs valley case study areas for selected boundary conditions table 5 shows the temperature change in the drinking water wells for the climate projections with the lowest scenario s1 table 1 and the strongest scenario s6 table 1 climate change impacts since the infiltration of river water is the predominant river groundwater interaction process in the lange erlen case study area the difference between heat introduced by river infiltration and heat loss by groundwater exfiltration results in a net heat input into the aquifer for the different seasons compared to 2000 and depending on the season and the different climate scenarios the heat input increases by 5 to 75 mean 42 from 2000 to 2055 and by 10 to 119 mean 62 from 2000 to 2085 fig 8 left column top heat exchange via artificial groundwater recharge shows comparatively smaller thermal effects for the different seasons and for the climate scenarios studied fig 8 left column middle compared to 2000 and depending on the season and the different climate scenarios the heat loss by the drinking water extraction increases by 7 to 72 mean 36 from 2000 to 2055 and by 16 to 142 mean 56 from 2000 to 2085 fig 8 left column bottom for all drinking water wells a temperature increase is observed which is about 0 4 to 0 6 k by 2055 and about 0 7 to 1 3 k by 2085 for scenario 1 and about 1 3 to 2 2 k by 2055 and about 1 8 to 3 1 k by 2085 for scenario 6 table 5 fig 9 shows the temperature change for scenarios 1 and 6 for the years 2055 and 2085 compared to the reference state in 2000 of the drinking water wells in the lange erlen case study area the difference between heat introduced by river infiltration and heat loss by exfiltration of groundwater into the river results in a net heat exchange of the river with the aquifer in the hardwald case study area for the present state heat loss from the aquifer into the river rhine by the exfiltration of comparatively warm groundwater in the autumn and especially in the winter months can be observed which changes only slightly for the different climate scenarios in the autumn months but increases in the winter months in the years 2055 by up to 59 mean 2 and 2085 by up to 102 mean 38 compared to the reference year 2000 fig 8 middle column top the heat introduced by the river rhine in the spring and especially in the summer and autumn months changes only slightly for the different climate scenarios in the years 2055 and 2085 the development is similar for the heat exchange via artificial groundwater recharge which is overall much higher than that via river groundwater interaction for the winter spring and summer months relatively little changes can be observed for the different climate scenarios in 2055 and 2085 in the autumn months heat introduced to the aquifer increases from well balanced conditions in 2000 and 2055 to approx 20 mw in 2085 compared to the reference year 2000 fig 8 middle column middle as in the lange erlen case study area a slight decrease of heat loss in winter can be observed for 2055 compared to 2000 and 2085 the heat loss via drinking water extractions increases steadily over the years 2000 to 2055 and 2085 whereby in absolute terms it is highest in the winter and especially in the autumn months the strongest increase over the years is observed for the winter months compared to 2000 and depending on the season and the different climate scenarios the heat loss in the summer months increases by up to 128 mean 75 from 2000 to 2055 and by up to 115 mean 198 from 2000 to 2085 fig 8 middle column bottom a temperature increase is observed for all drinking water wells which is about 0 2 to 0 3 k by 2055 for scenario s1 and about 0 7 to 1 0 k by 2085 and about 0 6 to 1 6 k by 2055 for scenario s6 and about 1 5 to 4 0 k by 2085 table 5 fig 9 shows the temperature change for scenarios 1 and 6 for the years 2055 and 2085 compared to the reference state in 2000 of the drinking water wells in the hardwald case study area particularly the drinking water wells which not only are affected by the artificial groundwater recharge show the highest temperature changes for the scenario 6 in 2085 since in the lower birs valley as in the lange erlen case study area river infiltration is the predominant river groundwater interaction process the difference between heat introduced by river infiltration and heat loss by groundwater exfiltration into the river results in a net heat input to the aquifer in the summer and autumn months whereas the development for the summer months is indistinct the heat introduced in the autumn months compared to 2000 and depending on the different climate scenarios increases by up to 144 mean 55 from 2000 to 2055 and by up to 262 mean 74 from 2000 to 2085 fig 8 right column top in the winter and spring months heat is lost from the aquifer into the river whereas values are close to zero and significantly smaller than the heat input in the summer and autumn months the heat exchange by the artificial groundwater recharge shows relatively lower thermal effects for the different seasons and investigated climate scenarios a comparatively high heat input which is on the same order of magnitude as the heat introduced by river water infiltration takes place in the summer months in the spring and autumn months the heat input increases slightly depending on the different climate scenarios fig 8 right column middle compared to 2000 and depending on the time of year and the different climate scenarios the heat loss by drinking water extraction increases by 17 to 380 mean 207 from 2000 to 2055 and by 43 to 628 mean 282 from 2000 to 2085 fig 8 right column bottom for all drinking water wells a temperature increase is observed which for the scenario s1 is at about 0 85 k by 2055 and at about 0 3 to 0 7 k by 2085 and for the scenario s6 at about 1 0 to 3 2 k by 2055 and at about 2 6 to 5 4 k by 2085 table 5 fig 9 shows the temperature change for scenarios s1 and s6 for the years 2055 and 2085 compared to the reference state in 2000 of the drinking water wells in the lower birs valley case study area particularly the drinking water wells to the north which are more influenced by the regional groundwater flow components and especially the inflow from the hillslope catchments show the highest temperature changes for the scenario s6 in 2055 and 2085 3 2 5 hydraulic and thermal groundwater regime operational scenarios for the groundwater extractions in the lange erlen case study area for the operational scenario a which corresponds to an average operation mode as well as operational scenario b and c table 4 it can be observed that between the present state 2018 and for climate scenario s6 in 2085 the heat input by the artificial groundwater recharge increases by only approx 1 fig 10 left column bottom the heat loss from the aquifer is low and increases for the present state and the climate scenario s6 in 2085 only slightly in relation to the increased pumping rates and infiltration quantities the heat loss of the extractions increases by approx 40 from the present state to the climate scenario s6 in 2085 for the individual operational scenarios respectively fig 10 left column top this large increase has the same order of magnitude for the corresponding operational change compared to the present state table 1 for the groundwater extraction in the hardwald case study area for scenario a which corresponds to an average operation mode table 4 it can be observed that between the present state 2014 and for the climate scenario s6 in 2085 the heat input in the summer months and the heat output in the winter months due to the artificial groundwater recharge only increase by approx 6 and approx 16 respectively fig 10 middle column bottom for the operational scenario b with low pumping rates and reduced artificial groundwater recharge table 4 a reduction of the heat exchange results thus the heat loss of the groundwater extractions decreases by approx 60 fig 10 middle column top and that for the artificial groundwater recharge in the winter months by approx 52 fig 10 middle column bottom the heat introduced by the artificial groundwater recharge in the summer months even decreases by approx 92 operational scenario c with increased pumping rates and infiltration quantities table 4 results in an increase in heat exchange for the present state thus the heat loss via the groundwater extractions increases by about 76 and that for the artificial groundwater recharge in the winter months by about 9 the heat introduced by the artificial groundwater recharge in the summer months increases by about 52 for the operational scenario c and for the climate scenario s6 the heat loss increases by about 76 compared to average operation due to the groundwater extractions this is the same increase as observed for the corresponding operation change in the present state see above the heat exchange by artificial groundwater recharge shows only minor changes for the different operational scenarios considered and climate scenario s6 in 2085 for the groundwater extractions in the lower birs valley case study area the heat loss is reduced by up to 9 present state in 2018 and 8 scenario s1 in 2085 for the different operational scenarios of increased groundwater recharge table 4 the reduction can be explained by the operational scenarios for which a continuous operation of the infiltration over the year is considered the present operation however takes place mainly in the summer months when comparatively warm river water is infiltrated the heat introduced via the artificial groundwater recharge in the summer months increases by up to 68 present state in 2018 and 63 scenario s6 in 2085 the heat loss in the winter months increases by up to 49 present state in 2018 and 30 scenario s6 in 2085 fig 10 right column 4 summary discussion the impacts of climate change on water resources are becoming increasingly apparent and quantitative and qualitative impacts on water resources and local drinking water supplies can already be observed today for three unconsolidated rock groundwater resources used for drinking water supply in the basel region future impacts on groundwater quantity and quality as well as direct impacts of climate change and indirect impacts of local anthropogenic changes were investigated in scope of our studies the role of artificial groundwater recharge and surface water infiltration for quantitative groundwater recharge and the temporal development of groundwater temperatures were evaluated river flow and temperature as well groundwater flow and heat transport simulations were used to evaluate hydraulic and thermal changes against the background of climate warming and different strategies for water supply planning the water resources in the lange erlen hardwald and lower birs valley case study areas are characterized by similarities in the hydraulic and thermal groundwater regime but also differ significantly in individual natural and anthropogenic boundary conditions they have in common that artificially recharged groundwater is an important component in the overall water balance at all three areas and that cold winter and warm summer groundwater plumes follow the hydraulic gradient from the different artificial infiltration systems mainly to the drinking water wells for all study areas a strong heat loss takes place especially in summer and late summer by drinking water extractions which is confirmed by the measured increased temperatures in the pumped water figs b2 and b6 in the appendix in the following the main results for the present state and for the evaluated climate and operational scenarios of the study areas are summarized in the lange erlen case study area river infiltration is the predominant river groundwater interaction process therefore heat is introduced by the infiltration of river water into the aquifer mainly in summer and late summer considering all investigated climate scenarios the net heat input by infiltration of river water increases by an average of 42 until 2055 and by an average of 62 until 2085 compared to the reference year 2000 correspondingly heat loss via groundwater extraction also increases by an average of 36 by 2055 and an average of 56 by 2085 as a result the temperatures of the extracted drinking water would increase by 0 4 to 1 3 k by 2055 and 0 7 to 3 1 k by 2085 compared to the reference year 2000 operational scenarios with increased pumping rates and infiltration quantities result in an increase of the heat exchange especially the heat loss by groundwater extraction increases by approx 40 from the present state to the climate scenario s6 in 2085 for the individual operational scenarios respectively however the heat exchange via artificial groundwater recharge shows only minor changes for the different operational scenarios in the hardwald case study area the most significant heat exchange takes place via artificial groundwater recharge in ponds and trenches considering all climate scenarios investigated the heat loss by groundwater extraction during the winter months increases by an average of 38 from the year 2000 to the year 2085 as a result the temperatures of the extracted drinking water would increase by 0 2 to 1 0 k by 2055 and 0 6 to 4 0 k by 2085 compared to the reference year 2000 operational scenarios with increased pumping rates and infiltration quantities result in an increase of the heat exchange especially the heat loss by groundwater extraction increases by up to 76 compared to an average operation mode already for the present state but also considering the climate scenarios with these observations for both the lange erlen and hardwald case study areas were water of the river rhine is artificially recharged to the aquifer the already observed high maximum surface water temperatures above 26 c of the river rhine in summer observed today will affect the drinking water supply in the basel region in the lower birs valley case study area the heat exchange between the river and the aquifer depends besides the seasonality on which river section is considered whereas for southern river sections the infiltration of river water into the aquifer is the dominating interaction process for northern river sections it is the exfiltration of groundwater into the river overall heat input into the aquifer from the river and by artificial groundwater recharge is higher than heat loss by groundwater extractions considering all investigated climate scenarios the net heat input by infiltration of river water increases by an average of 42 until 2055 and by an average of 62 until 2085 especially in the autumn months compared to the reference year 2000 the heat loss by drinking water extraction increases by an average of 36 from 2000 to 2055 and by an average of 56 from 2000 to 2085 accordingly the simulated temperatures of the extracted drinking water increase by 0 85 to 3 2 k by 2055 and by 0 3 to 5 4 k by 2085 depending on the climate scenario investigated operational scenarios with increased artificial groundwater recharge result in an increase in heat exchange continuous operation of the artificial infiltration reduces the heat extraction by up to 9 this would result in lower temperatures of the extracted drinking water 5 conclusions for three alluvial aquifers in the urban agglomeration of the city of basel switzerland the sensitivity of individual rivers and aquifers to climate change was quantitatively assessed and compared based on river discharge and temperature as well as groundwater flow and heat transport simulations the influence of different groundwater recharge components and the temperature developments of the groundwater extraction of the drinking water supply could be assessed this information was the basis for assessing the hydraulic and thermal sensitivity of the studied aquifers to climatic and anthropogenic changes the quantitative assessment highlights the need to distinguish between different thermal exposures of drinking water wells and to differentiate between natural and artificial components of groundwater recharge we could show that the complex interplay of the various natural and anthropogenic influencing factors can only be adequately analyzed by flow and heat transport simulations of river and groundwater systems such models make it possible to quantify the interaction of surface water and groundwater resources both spatially and temporally and investigate in greater depth the quantitative and qualitative effects of climate change by means of scenario calculations in this way thermal balances and thermal impacts can be calculated and the thermal impacts of climate change and future uses be quantified as the current and foreseen warming of surface waters and groundwater is expected to have a large impact on many aquatic ecosystems and biochemical processes a proper understanding of the involved processes and interactions and their respective impacts are highly required future climate impact studies should therefore aim at coupling surface and groundwater models in order to incorporate exchange processes to better assess quantitative and ecological impacts on aquatic systems and to consider anthropogenic usage of surface water and groundwater as a base for developing climate change adaptation strategies for their management alluvial aquifers in river valleys often are highly productive not only for water supply but also for agriculture accordingly they are locations where decisions must be taken for groundwater resource

8547,the sensitivity of future groundwater recharge and temperature development was investigated for three alluvial aquifers in the urban agglomeration of the city of basel switzerland for selected climate projections groundwater recharge and the associated temperature imprinting of aquifers which are mainly determined by artificial groundwater recharge and infiltrating surface water were investigated 3d numerical groundwater flow and heat transport modeling allowed quantifying and differentiating between natural and artificial groundwater recharge and thermal impacts for aquifers where the infiltration of river water is an important component in the groundwater balance the effects of climate change will be influenced by changes in river flow and thermal regimes and also by artificial groundwater recharge of surface water considering all climate scenarios investigated the net heat input from river water infiltration for the lange erlen case study area increases by an average of 42 by 2055 and 62 by 2085 compared to the reference year 2000 together with further heat inputs particularly by artificial groundwater recharge the temperatures of the extracted drinking water would increase by 0 4 to 1 3 k by 2055 and 0 7 to 3 1 k by 2085 in the hardwald case study area the most significant heat exchange occurs by artificial groundwater recharge as a result and considering all climate scenarios investigated heat loss by groundwater extraction increases by an average of 38 during the winter months from the year 2000 to the year 2085 the increased heat input especially in the summer months results in a temperature increase of the extracted drinking water of 0 2 to 1 0 k by 2055 and 0 6 to 4 0 k by 2085 in the lower birs valley case study area net heat input from river water infiltration increases by an average of 42 by 2055 and 62 by 2085 correspondingly the temperatures of the extracted drinking water increase by 0 9 to 3 2 k by 2055 and by 0 3 to 5 4 k by 2085 the quantitative assessment of climate change impacts on the groundwater resources presented allows to differentiate between hydraulic and thermal impacts of natural and artificial groundwater recharge processes accordingly individual drinking water wells are exposed differently to the various components of groundwater recharge seasonal shifts in natural groundwater recharge processes and adaptation strategies related to artificial groundwater recharge could therefore be an important factor affecting groundwater resources in future moreover increased groundwater recharge from artificial groundwater recharge systems in summer months and the interaction with surface waters during high runoff periods which will occur more often in winter months are likely to strongly influence groundwater recharge and temperatures keywords groundwater recharge artificial infiltration river groundwater interaction temperature imprinting seasonal shift data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction the expected quantitative and qualitative impacts of climate change on surface and groundwater resources ipcc 2014 highlight the importance of this issue on national and international policy agendas from the global scale of the climate change phenomenon it is likely that water balances will also be affected at local scales oni et al 2014 porporato et al 2004 switzerland is particularly exposed to climate change and its impact on hydrology and hydrogeology climatological and hydrological studies such as ch2018 2018 hydro ch2018 2020 ch2014 impacts 2014 ch2011 2011 and nrp61 2015 estimate that dry periods will occur more frequently in summer while slightly higher precipitation and a rising snow line should lead to increased river runoff and groundwater recharge in winter while total annual water balances of swiss water resources including groundwater will only change slightly in the future seasonal changes are expected to be more pronounced likewise changes in groundwater recharge of regional aquifers are expected changnon et al 1988 zektser and loaiciga 1993 the motivation for this research was the increasing temperatures of swiss surface waters hari et al 2006 michel et al 2019 michel et al 2021 and groundwater resources epting et al 2021 epting et al 2020 hunkeler 2020 which can be expected as a consequence of climate change but also as a result of local anthropogenic activities especially in urban areas quantitative and qualitative temperature deficits of underground resources will be increasingly observed bafu 2021 estimated future increase of groundwater demand during droughts will be accompanied by increased artificial groundwater recharge with comparatively warm surface water in summer which will additionally increase groundwater temperatures and thus the drinking water extracted after 2003 buwal et al 2004 zappa and kan 2007 also 2006 russo et al 2015 2015 bafu 2016 and 2018 bafu 2019 liechti et al 2019 meteoschweiz 2018 tratschin et al 2019 were characterized by summer heat waves zappa et al 2019 for these years a noticeable increase in water temperature particularly in the lowland rivers flowing through the swiss plateau could be observed piccolroaz et al 2018 in switzerland so called heat summers or years occur when temperatures exceed 30 c for more than five consecutive days which according to the world meteorological organization wmo is 3 to 5 k above the long term daily temperature maximum in these years also high groundwater temperatures were recorded schürch et al 2018 practical experience in recent years has shown that drinking water temperatures above 25 c can occur in water supply systems and endanger a hygienically safe groundwater supply osmancevic et al 2018 at water temperatures above 15 c it tastes insipid several studies have shown clear positive trends in river water temperature in the last decades at various locations worldwide dokulil 2014 foen 2012 hannah and garner 2015 morrison et al 2002 o reilly et al 2015 watts et al 2015 webb 1996 in switzerland observations since 1970 show a trend of 0 33 k per decade in surface water temperature slightly lower than observations for air temperature this warming is more marked on the swiss plateau lowland catchments than for higher altitude surface waters michel et al 2020 vinna et al 2021 the latter being characterized by higher thermal resilience due to cooling effects of either snow glacier melting or releases from high altitude hydropower reservoirs during the warm season piccolroaz et al 2016 meanwhile no clear trend in discharge can be attributed to climate change over the last few decades michel et al 2020 anthropogenic influence on surface water temperatures has been observed because of vegetation changes garner et al 2017 johnson and jones 2000 moore et al 2005 urbanization and river channelization lepori and roberts 2015 webb 1996 use of

influence on surface water through thermal pollution has also been shown to modify the relationship between air and water temperature webb et al 2008 such influences must be taken into consideration when studying the impact of climate change in anthropogenically modified and perturbed catchments hannah and garner 2015 vinna et al 2018 webb et al 2008 the warming observed in the past is expected to continue over the next decade and to accelerate toward the end of the century with high emissions scenarios the summer warming of surface waters could then reach 4 k for rivers on the swiss plateau and 6 k in alpine rivers michel et al 2021 however significant long term increase in groundwater temperatures as could be expected as a result of climate change and observed regionally for example in austria umweltbundesamt 2011 has not yet been observed in switzerland foen 2019 schürch et al 2018 generally the increase in surface water temperatures is also expected to affect groundwater temperature which are fed by surface water infiltration epting et al 2021 most research to date has focused on predicting possible impacts of climate change on surface waters while large regional and coarse resolution models have been used for groundwater systems to determine their sensitivity to changes in critical input parameters such as precipitation and runoff york et al 2002 yusoff et al 2002 with a few exceptions of detailed investigations of very small aquifers e g malcolm and soulsby 2000 most studies concentrated on entire catchment areas and only on changes in percolating precipitation water i e precipitation fed aquifers in a synopsis of climate change effects on groundwater recharge the importance of understanding groundwater recharge processes including timing and location for the characterization of groundwater resources was emphasized by smerdon 2017 six review articles crosbie et al 2013 green et al 2011 kurylyk and macquarrie 2013 meixner et al 2016 moeck et al 2016 taylor et al 2013 show that the uncertainty of distribution and trend in future precipitation from general circulation models gcm results in varying predictions of groundwater recharge these studies also conclude that the modeling studies are often not able to predict the magnitude and direction increase or decrease of future recharge conditions several recent publications highlighted the role of quaternary deposits to store groundwater in alpine regions christensen et al 2020 and specifically the role of unconsolidated quaternary deposits arnoux et al 2021 arnoux et al 2020 wirth et al 2020 only a few studies address river groundwater interaction under climate change scenarios e g epting et al 2021 scibek et al 2007 where changes in river flow regime and changes in groundwater recharge interact these interactions are particularly important since groundwater recharge often comprises large fractions of infiltrated surface water huggenberger and epting 2011 epting et al 2021 demonstrated that in order to understand the future development of groundwater temperatures it is necessary to take a differentiated view of geological site conditions and relevant hydrogeological processes including the processes of groundwater recharge positive and negative responses and direct anthropogenic influences knowledge of these fundamentals is essential for understanding the response of aquifers to anthropogenic and climate change impacts within the scope of the research program hydro ch2018 epting et al 2021 foen 2020 it was hypothesized that for generally high yielding alluvial aquifers quantitative groundwater recharge and the associated temperature imprinting of aquifers is primarily determined by infiltrating surface water i e river fed aquifers specifically increased groundwater recharge during high runoff periods is expected to have a strong influence on groundwater temperatures of river fed aquifers while quantitative results on river discharge and temperature changes could be derived michel et al 2021 potential effects of increased or decreased temperatures of infiltrating surface water on groundwater resources could only be assessed qualitatively therefore this research focuses on a quantitative assessment of climate change on different groundwater recharge components of three alluvial aquifers in the urban agglomeration of the city of basel switzerland baseline data include hydraulic and temperature measurements within the rivers and groundwater resources also used for calibration and validation data derived from river discharge and water temperature modeling as well as operational forecasts of the water suppliers we hypothesized that seasonal shifts in groundwater recharge processes related to surface water infiltration from rivers and artificial groundwater recharge due to climate change are important factors affecting future groundwater and accordingly drinking water temperatures 2 investigation areas

providing approx 30 000 m3 d drinking water to six communities comprising approximately 51 000 people 2 1 artificial groundwater recharge in the three case study areas surface water is used for artificial groundwater recharge which contributes significantly to the overall groundwater balance there are three main reasons for the need for artificial recharge of groundwater resources in the basel area 1 groundwater extraction exceeds natural groundwater recharge 2 the use of previously filtered and to some extent treated river water can improve the quality of the extracted water and 3 the installation of artificial hydraulic barriers makes it possible to limit the inflow of groundwater with poor water quality particularly relevant for the hardwald study area in the lange erlen and hardwald case study areas water of the river rhine is used for artificial groundwater recharge at the artificial recharge plant in the lower birs valley water of the river birs is used for artificial groundwater recharge different methods of artificial recharge are used fig 2 1 infiltration fields lange erlen 2 infiltration trenches and ponds hardwald and 3 infiltration systems with filter layers

water temperature modeling to derive climate related changes in quantitative groundwater recharge via infiltrating surface waters and artificial groundwater recharge and associated temperature effects

models table 1 and table a1 3 in the appendix model results include future projections of streamflow including glacier and snowmelt but projections of water temperature trends were previously lacking therefore for the present hydrologic modeling the hybrid physical statistical model air2stream piccolroaz et al 2016 toffolon and piccolroaz 2015 was used to simulate future stream temperature projections and which has already been extensively validated including applications to swiss streams piccolroaz et al 2016 råman vinnå et al 2018 toffolon and piccolroaz 2015 whereas the runoff projections of the prevah models cover the whole of switzerland the present study is limited to the basel region in northwestern switzerland the air2stream model were simulated with data from one

controlling the thermal dynamics of rivers the model requires air temperature and discharge as inputs to calculate river water temperature with a daily time resolution it was calibrated for the period in which measured data of air temperature discharge and tributary water temperature were available this approach did not allow for independent model validation which was deliberately omitted in favor of a more robust calibration of the parameters 2 4 groundwater heat transport modeling for the finite element flow and heat transport modeling the software feflow 7 2 dhi diersch 2014 was used the bedrock topography of the hydrogeologic models was prepared using the geologic 3d gocad 1999 model of the basel region dresmann et al 2015 contrary to the consideration of entire river catchment areas for which a more or less closed water balance can be calculated additional water components in and outflows must be considered for aquifers over different boundaries some of the groundwater recharge components including temperature imprinting can directly be influenced by atmospheric climate change via precipitation and hydrological runoff conditions table 2 summarizes the main groundwater recharge components natural boundary conditions include percolating precipitation regional groundwater inflow imported groundwater regimes and out and inflow from the lateral hillslope catchment areas as well as interaction of surface waters with groundwater anthropogenic boundary conditions include groundwater extraction and artificial groundwater recharge to ensure comparability between the three modeled case study areas the corresponding boundary conditions were uniformly defined and parameterized the hydraulic and thermal conditions at the model boundaries e g specified hydraulic heads and temperatures flow and heat fluxes fig 1 are defined on the basis of river and groundwater measurement data and already developed procedures for model parameterization epting 2017 this data allowed to define the present state of the studied river groundwater systems which involves assessing the hydrological hydrogeological and geological as well as anthropogenic settings mostly stationary character and hydraulic and thermal boundary conditions mostly transient character the hydraulic and thermal present state describes an average situation including seasonal but also event and use related variations in flow and thermal regimes for river groundwater systems concerning the climate change scenarios all results are discussed by comparing the simulation results for the years 2055 and 2085 to the reference year 2000 2 4 1 upper boundary condition compared to the amounts of artificially recharged water well extractions and river infiltration groundwater recharge due to percolating precipitation is an insignificant component in the overall water balance of the groundwater bodies studied huggenberger and epting 2011 page et al 2011 and does not have a sensitive effect on the modeling therefore for the present state only average annual precipitation rates bas station fig 1 and considering evapotranspiration losses were included consistently over time in the different model areas table 3 for heavily sealed surfaces values for percolating precipitation water is reduced huggenberger and epting 2011 for the present state thermal upper boundary condition ground temperature measured at a depth of 20 cm at a location in the city of basel fig 1 were employed as cauchy boundary condition in daily resolution the heat transfer rate from the surface was inversely calibrated with pest whereas this parameter summarizes attributes such as the distance to groundwater as well as the thermal properties of the soil to account for the thermal effects of climate change for this boundary condition the trend in temperature for the selected climate projections was considered table b1 in the appendix 2 4 2 regional groundwater flow the regional groundwater in and outflow of the different gravel aquifers was defined as 1st kind dirichlet boundary condition by means of the hydraulics measured in ow fig 1 and table 3 hill slope inflows were defined as 2nd kind flux neumann boundary condition whereas areal groundwater recharge was estimated in relation to the hill slope catchment areas e g huggenberger et al 2006 as for the upper boundary condition to account for the thermal effects of climate change the trend in temperature for the selected climate projections was considered table b1 in the appendix concerning the hydraulic effect of climate projections on this boundary no data basis was available and the present state was maintained 2 4 3 surface waters to assess the impact of climate change on the investigated aquifers in relation to the interaction with the rivers different interaction types were distinguished including table 3 i infiltration of surface water for connected river groundwater systems where the riverbed is directly connected to the groundwater saturated zone of the aquifer ii unconnected systems where the riverbed is separated from the groundwater saturated zone of the aquifer and surface water infiltrates into the aquifer via the unsaturated zone iii exfiltration of groundwater with hydraulic gradients from the groundwater to the river and groundwater exfiltrates into the river the hydraulics and temperatures of the surface waters are continuously measured at various foen stations table a4 in the appendix based on gaging curves the discharges resulting from the hydrological simulations could be converted to water levels required for groundwater modeling fig b1 in the appendix the converted water levels were interpolated to selected points along the rivers wiese rhine and birs based on longitudinal riverbed profiles of the watercourses for all points where a larger vertical offset of the river bottom exists e g bottom sills or locks along the river wiese or the birsfelden river power plant along the river rhine the water level was calculated according to the elevation of the bottom up and downstream from the offset and interpolated in between both the hydraulic and the thermal boundary conditions of the rivers were realized as 3rd kind cauchy whereas the hydraulic and thermal transfer rates were inversely calibrated with pest to account for transient permeability of the riverbed conductance the transfer rate for flow was described as time varying using colmation decolmation models affolter et al 2010a these describe the change in the hydraulic properties of the riverbed at low and medium discharge the permeability of the riverbed decreases due to the settling and penetration of fine particles into the pore space of the cover or filter layer colmation and approaches a minimum value above a certain discharge threshold during flood events the colmated riverbed is ruptured and the permeability increases abruptly after the flood colmation of the riverbed starts again the base value as well as the maximum value of the conductance were determined beforehand by means of inverse calibration with pest for different river sections 2 4 4 groundwater extraction and artificial recharge groundwater extraction and recharge data which are related to the amount of water per infiltration system were provided by the water supplies the data on groundwater recharge are subject to large uncertainties for operational reasons for example the error in the lange erlen case study area is estimated to about 30 when allocating the total amount of water to the individual infiltration fields in the lange erlen case study area as well as to the various trenches and ponds in the hardwald case study area gates are opened on an empirical basis of a certain number of revolutions flow rates are or were measured only sporadically evapotranspiration from the forested infiltration fields trenches and ponds also removes some of the water from the infiltration volume which also contributes to the uncertainty in the recharge data another uncertainty in the lange erlen case study area infiltration system is associated with the impounded area of the infiltration fields it is known that some fields do not wet the entire area during recharge periods but often only partial areas to reduce this uncertainty the borderline of the effective artificial infiltration fields was measured with a handheld gps device however even if the wetted area at maximum water level in the infiltration fields is known the water infiltrates heterogeneously there may even be individual sip points or areas which are only wetted for a short time at maximum water level and subsequently no longer contribute to infiltration the recharge data in the lange erlen case study area in m3 d were divided by the area of each recharge field to obtain the corresponding flux per unit area according to the new measurements subsequently these fluxes per unit area which have the dimension of a velocity value m d were integrated into the groundwater model as 2nd kind neumann boundary condition in contrast to artificial groundwater recharge the groundwater extractions at all wells are recorded with high temporal resolution and were integrated into the model in hourly resolution for the simulated period daily totals of the water volumes in m3 d were available for the artificial groundwater recharge of the hardwald case study area based on flow measurements a distribution key percentage of infiltration rates in m d per trench and pond for the infiltration per trench section and pond for different operational conditions could be defined as 2nd kind neumann boundary condition the groundwater extractions are recorded at all wells and were considered as daily mean values finally at the artificial recharge facility in the lower birs valley treated water from the river birs is infiltrated into the groundwater by 9 injection wells at full operation about 200 l s 1 are infiltrated the hourly recharge quantities are recorded which were included in the model as daily sum 2nd kind neumann boundary condition also the groundwater extractions are recorded at all wells and were considered as daily mean values in the groundwater model no systematic measurements of the recharge water temperature were available therefore the temperature of the recharge water was measured in a selected infiltration field in the lange erlen case study area fig 4 as well as in an infiltration trench in the hardwald fig 5 in both cases the temperature measurements of the recharge water agree well with the river rhine water temperatures bafu station rhine weil rheinfelden 2091 for the modeling therefore the water temperatures of the river rhine could directly be considered for the parameterization of the temperature boundary condition 1st kind dirichlet for the recharge water due to the small distance of the artificial infiltration facility in the lower birs valley to the river birs it was assumed that also here the temperature of the recharge water corresponds to that of the river bafu station birs münchenstein hofmatt 2106 2 5 groundwater heat transport model calibration the hydraulic properties which are highly heterogeneous were inversely calibrated using automated parameter estimation pest model independent parameter estimation and uncertainty analysis and the pilot points method doherty 1994 doherty 2010 doherty et al 2011 the groundwater flow models for the case study areas already existed and the hydraulics had already been calibrated and validated transiently for different time periods within the framework of different research projects table 4 for this project the models were calibrated for heat transport table 4 therefore thermal aquifer properties thermal conductivity and thermal capacity as well as thermal transfer rates across stream bottoms were calibrated based on observed temperature measurements for the description of model performance the root mean square error rmse the mean absolute error mae and the normalized root mean square error nrmse were calculated according to 1 rmse 1 n i 1 n y meas i y cal i 2 2 mae 1 n i 1 n y meas i y cal i and 3 nrmse rmse y meas where n is the number of measurements y meas i the measured values hydraulic head and temperature at time i and y cal i the calculated value at time i respectively and y meas the mean of the measured values normalizing the rmse facilitates the comparison between datasets of the different models of the study areas the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient e was also determined nash and sutcliffe 1970 which is another widely used normalized metric it is defined as 4 e 1 i 1 n y meas i y cal i 2 i 1 n y meas i y meas 2 the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient can take values between to 1 an efficiency of 1 corresponds to a perfect match of measured and calculated values an efficiency of 0 means that the calculated values are as accurate as the mean of the observed data values less than 0 mean that the error variance numerator in equation is greater than the variance of the measured data denominator in equation 2 6 operational scenarios for the lange erlen and hardwald case study areas the selected operational scenarios consider increased supply for the hardwald case study area also reduced also based on demand development forecasts general water supply planning march 2019 when selecting the operational scenarios for the artificial groundwater recharge plant in the lower birs valley it was evaluated how large the minimum recharge volumes must be so that the water supplies of the municipalities of aesch and reinach fig 1 are guaranteed even during dry summer months the groundwater flow model of the lower birs valley was validated using the measurement data of the dry summer 2018 the selected operational scenarios table 4 for the three artificial recharge systems were simulated for the present state as well as for the climate projection with the maximum expected changes table 1 scenario s6 3 results 3 1 hydrological modeling despite the high resolution of the gcm rcm modeling considered and the statistical downscaling using the meteorological stations minor differences exist between modeled and observed air temperature during the historical period table a1 and fig a1 in the appendix similar yet extensive discrepancies also exist between modeled and measured runoff because the air2stream model was calibrated based on air temperature and discharge measurements and because of the data driven derivation of model parameters such differences even if small may artificially alter the quantification of projected river water temperature into the future to avoid this problem future projections of the time series of air temperature and runoff used as inputs to air2stream were statistically adjusted using the change factor approach diaz nieto and wilby 2005 minville et al 2008 piccolroaz et al 2021 climatological mean annual cycles on a daily time scale for the calibration period were produced for both measured and rcm gcm modeled air temperatures and discharges fig a1 4 in the appendix keeping the projected trends in the rcm gcm datasets the climate forcing for air temperature and runoff was then adjusted each year according to equation 5 5 f n i f o i c s j c m j where fni is the adjusted variable at time i foi is the daily time series of the variable simulated from the rcm gcm model combinations and cmj and csj are the climatological years for measurements and gcm rcm output on the day of year j corresponding to time i respectively the climatological years were smoothed using a 60 day window to remove the effect of possible pulse events especially for discharge and river discharge was never lower bounded by the minimum observed flow to maintain validity of calibrated parameters the mean flow used by air2stream to normalize the time varying flow and water depth see parameters δ and ϑ in the model equations toffolon and piccolroaz 2015 was limited to include only the time period used for calibration from the climate modeling it is evident that the trend in air temperature has a seasonal component bas station fig 1 with more warming in the summer months compared to the rest of the year fig 3 surface water runoff follows a similar seasonal pattern with increased runoff during winter months and reduced runoff in summer months fig 3 this phenomenon is most pronounced for the river rhine stations 2289 and 2091 fig 1 as upstream glaciers and snowfields are expected to shrink and days with snow cover to decrease the seasonal dependence of the increase in air temperature and the change in runoff results in elevated river warming in the summer months and decreased warming in the winter months fig 3 the degree of warming resulting from the simulations depends on the respective climate scenarios as expected the highest warming can be observed for the climate scenario rcp8 5 air temperature 0 4 k per decade and river temperatures between 0 2 and 0 25 k per decade the extent to which air and water temperatures differ depends on the size of the watercourse with the rhine stations 2289 and 2091 fig 1 showing the greatest dependence between the decrease in discharge and the increase in water temperatures fig a5 in the appendix 3 2 groundwater flow and heat transport modeling fig 4 fig 5 and fig 6 show the present state of the hydraulic and thermal groundwater regime for different seasons in the lange erlen the hardwald and the lower birs valley case study areas respectively the influence of artificial groundwater recharge is clearly visible in all case study areas including the cooling effect on the groundwater in the winter and spring months and the heat introduced into the aquifer in the summer and autumn months cooling and heating plumes move down gradient from the individual infiltration systems to the drinking water wells 3 2 1 lange erlen present state overall the calibration period from 01 01 2018 to 31 12 2018 1 a mostly indicates good agreements between measured and calculated groundwater levels table b2 in the appendix the rmse mae nrmse between the observed and calculated heads ranges between only 0 06 to 0 46 m 0 08 to 0 42 m 7 to 23 respectively the nse ranges between 0 14 and 0 87 the rmse mae nrmse between the observed and calculated temperatures of the drinking water and observation wells ranges between 1 3 and 4 2 k 1 1 to 3 6 k 12 to 106 and 1 1 to 7 1 k 0 9 to 6 2 k 5 to 83 respectively the nse ranges between 0 25 and 0 99 for the drinking water wells and between 0 28 and 0 96 for the observation wells despite the sometimes large deviations between measured and calculated groundwater temperatures and negative nse values the temporal development of measured and calculated groundwater temperatures in the drinking water and observation wells down gradient of the infiltration systems indicates a reasonable agreement figs b2 and b3 in the appendix in general the fit for the observation wells is often better than for the drinking water wells which can be explained by the fact that the flow model was calibrated based on the hydraulics of the observation wells especially for individual wells the measured temperature profiles can reasonably be reproduced with the heat transport model also in the observation wells down gradient of the infiltration systems the measured temperature profiles can be reproduced very well with the simulation this shows that the thermal influence of artificial groundwater recharge is well captured by the heat transport model for the lange erlen case study area the main influence on the groundwater balance fig 7 and fig b4 in the appendix is the infiltration of river water as well as the artificial groundwater recharge and the groundwater extraction of the drinking water wells large volumes of groundwater leave the model area via the western model boundary while groundwater extraction by the wells is relatively balanced and constant over the entire data period artificial groundwater recharge varies strongly and abruptly when the system is temporarily out of service compared to low water situations during flood events much more almost a factor of 2 surface water infiltrates from the river wiese into the groundwater fig b5 in the appendix shows an annual cycle and fig 7 summarizes the heat balances across the most important boundary conditions in the lange erlen case study area the heat exchange across the unsaturated zone ranges between 100 mw and is more or less balanced over the year compared to the case study areas in the hardwald and the lower birs valley the depth of the groundwater table is comparatively small at a few meters below the soil surface and therefore a seasonal atmospheric influence on groundwater temperatures is to be expected heat introduced to the aquifer by the infiltration of river water sometimes reaches values above 60 mw in summer and late summer is comparatively high and shows a marked seasonal pattern characterized by a phase lag compared to the river water temperature cycle the heat loss from the groundwater into the river exfiltration is comparatively low and can be observed mainly in the first half of the year with a maximum in the spring months below 10 mw the heat loss can be explained by the fact that in the first half of the year the groundwater temperatures are temporarily higher than those of the river water and accordingly a thermal gradient from the groundwater to the river exists via the regional groundwater inflow from the northeastern river valley comparatively little heat is introduced into the aquifer the down gradient heat loss from the aquifer towards basel is comparatively high reaching 70 mw which can be attributed to the heat introduced to the groundwater via river infiltration and partly also via artificial groundwater recharge the heat exchange via artificial groundwater recharge is comparatively balanced over the year via the artificial groundwater recharge cooling of the groundwater occurs in the autumn and winter months with a maximum of about 70 mw and heat is introduced to the groundwater in the spring and summer months with a maximum of almost 85 mw peaks of heat output in summer months can be associated with comparatively cold river water which is infiltrated after previously comparatively warm water was infiltrated short peaks in heat output during the summer months can be associated with relatively cold river water infiltrating after phases where previously comparatively warm water was infiltrated fig b5 in the appendix due to the groundwater extractions of the drinking water supply a heat loss from the groundwater with a maximum above 25 mw takes place mainly in the second half of the year which is confirmed by measured elevated temperatures in the extracted water fig b4 in the appendix 3 2 2 hardwald present state overall the calibration period 01 10 2011 30 09 2012 1 a mostly indicates good agreement between measured and calculated groundwater levels table b3 the rmse mae nrmse between the observed and calculated heads ranges between only 0 05 to 1 43 m 0 04 to 1 42 m 0 to 266 respectively the nse ranges between 0 07 and 0 60 the rmse mae nrmse between the observed and calculated temperatures of the drinking water and observation wells ranges between 0 7 and 1 9 k 0 6 to 1 8 k 9 to 50 and 0 1 to 4 0 k 0 1 to 3 5 k 17 to 211 respectively the nse ranges between 0 24 and 0 90 for the drinking water wells and between 0 05 and 0 78 for the observation wells despite the sometimes large deviations between measured and calculated groundwater temperatures and negative nse values the temporal development of measured and calculated groundwater temperatures in the drinking water and observation wells down gradient of the infiltration systems indicates a reasonable agreement figs b6 and b7 in the appendix for most wells expect for ow10 and w19 the measured temperature profiles can reasonably be reproduced with the heat transport model also in the observation wells down gradient of the infiltration systems the measured temperature profiles can be reproduced very well with the simulation this shows that the thermal influence of artificial groundwater recharge is well captured by the heat transport model for the hardwald case study area the main influence on the groundwater balance fig 7 and fig b8 in the appendix is the artificial groundwater recharge while groundwater extractions by the drinking water wells are only half as large the magnitudes of in and outflow via the natural boundary conditions of the rivers and the southeastern and southern model boundary are comparatively balanced resulting in a small positive net contribution fig b9 in the appendix shows the annual cycle and fig 7 summarizes the heat balances across the most important boundary conditions in the hardwald case study area the heat input across the unsaturated zone reaches values of up to 460 mw in the summer months while the heat loss in the winter months reaches values of 290 mw the heat exchange is large compared to the other boundary conditions but more or less balanced over the year since the depth of the groundwater table generally is greater than 10 m over large areas the seasonal atmospheric influence on groundwater temperatures is expected to be minor the heat exchange across the river rhine is generally in the range of 45 mw and is thus one order of magnitude smaller than the heat exchange across the unsaturated zone due to the temperature gradient in the autumn and winter months comparatively warmer groundwater exfiltrates into the comparatively cold river thus a heat loss from the aquifer into the river takes place in the spring and summer months heat is introduced from the comparatively warmer river into the aquifer the variability of heat exchange is due to the non stationarity of surface water runoff and the processes of river groundwater interaction a net heat loss from the aquifer can be observed throughout the year although less in the late spring and summer months lower thermal gradient from the groundwater to surface water during single flood events increased heat exchange results the heat exchange via the regional groundwater flow towards the east and southeast is generally small with an almost zero net effect fig b8 in the appendix via the artificial groundwater recharge heat is introduced into the groundwater with maximum values reaching 150 mw especially in the summer half year the heat introduced via the artificial groundwater recharge is higher than the effect of the cooling of the groundwater by the infiltration of comparatively colder recharge water in the winter month with maximum values reaching 115 mw as for the lange erlen case study area short peaks in heat output during the summer months can be associated with relatively cold river water infiltrating after phases where previously comparatively warm water was infiltrated fig b9 in the appendix groundwater extractions from the drinking water supply result in a highly seasonal heat loss with a maximum in late autumn of more than 15 mw which is confirmed by measured elevated temperatures in the extracted water 3 2 3 lower birs valley present state overall the calibration period 01 01 2018 bis 31 12 2018 1 a mostly indicates good agreements between measured and calculated groundwater levels table b4 the rmse mae nrmse between the observed and calculated heads ranges between 0 31 and 0 60 m 0 23 to 0 48 m 12 to 24 respectively the nse ranges between 0 35 and 1 00 the rmse mae nrmse between the observed and calculated temperatures of the observation wells ranges between a perfect match of 0 to only 1 6 k 0 0 to 1 6 k 6 to 328 the nse ranges between 0 77 and 1 00 for the observation wells especially in the observation wells down gradient of the infiltration systems the measured temperature profiles can be reproduced very well with the simulation fig b10 this shows that the thermal influence of artificial groundwater recharge is well captured by the heat transport model in the lower birs valley case study area the main influence on the groundwater balance fig 7 and fig b11 in the appendix is the interaction with the river birs likewise the infiltration of comparatively cold river water into the aquifer can be clearly observed in the spring and winter months for a southern section of the river birs in correspondence of a double bend of the river fig 6 further the inflow via the southern and the outflow via the northern model boundary are important boundary conditions whereas artificial groundwater recharge is mainly operated in summer groundwater extraction via drinking water wells takes place all year round fig b12 in the appendix shows the annual cycle and fig 7 summarizes the heat balances across the most important boundary conditions in the lower birs valley case study area fig 1 heat exchange across the unsaturated zone is comparatively large sometimes exceeding 9 mw but is more or less balanced throughout the year since the depth of to the groundwater table over large areas generally is larger than 10 m the seasonal atmospheric influence on groundwater temperatures is expected to be minor the heat introduced across the river birs shows a strong variability reaches almost 9 mw in late summer and is in the same order of magnitude as the heat exchange across the unsaturated zone as described above for the river rhine the variability of heat exchange between the river birs and the aquifer is due to the non stationarity of surface water runoff and the processes of river groundwater interaction a heat loss from the aquifer of around 1 7 mw can be observed throughout the year although less in the summer months lower thermal gradient from the groundwater to the river this is due to the fact that individual sections of the river birs are mainly receiving groundwater thus at these sections the processes of groundwater exfiltration dominate fig b11 in the appendix in general however a net positive heat flux from the river to the groundwater is observed during one annual cycle fig 7 and fig b12 in the appendix via the regional groundwater flow regime heat is introduced from the south and is comparatively constant at about 3 7 mw the down gradient heat loss from the aquifer towards the north is slightly higher with about 5 7 mw but also comparatively constant this net heat gain within the valley groundwater flow regime can be associated with additional heat introduced by river infiltration see above the western hill slope boundary inflow and partly also by the artificial groundwater recharge the heat exchange via artificial groundwater recharge is small compared to the groundwater recharge systems in the lange erlen and hardwald case study areas because much less water is artificially recharged table 4 fig b11 in the appendix in the winter half year artificial groundwater recharge results in sporadic cooling of the groundwater with a maximum heat extraction of more than 6 mw the heat introduced by artificial groundwater recharge with maximum values of more than 15 mw into the groundwater occurs mainly in the summer half year due to the groundwater extractions of the drinking water supply a seasonal heat loss takes place and is most pronounced in late summer with a maximum of above 5 mw 3 2 4 hydraulic and thermal groundwater regime climate scenarios fig 8 shows the seasonal heat exchange for the reference years 2000 2055 and 2085 for all investigated climate scenarios table 1 in the lange erlen the hardwald and the lower birs valley case study areas for selected boundary conditions table 5 shows the temperature change in the drinking water wells for the climate projections with the lowest scenario s1 table 1 and the strongest scenario s6 table 1 climate change impacts since the infiltration of river water is the predominant river groundwater interaction process in the lange erlen case study area the difference between heat introduced by river infiltration and heat loss by groundwater exfiltration results in a net heat input into the aquifer for the different seasons compared to 2000 and depending on the season and the different climate scenarios the heat input increases by 5 to 75 mean 42 from 2000 to 2055 and by 10 to 119 mean 62 from 2000 to 2085 fig 8 left column top heat exchange via artificial groundwater recharge shows comparatively smaller thermal effects for the different seasons and for the climate scenarios studied fig 8 left column middle compared to 2000 and depending on the season and the different climate scenarios the heat loss by the drinking water extraction increases by 7 to 72 mean 36 from 2000 to 2055 and by 16 to 142 mean 56 from 2000 to 2085 fig 8 left column bottom for all drinking water wells a temperature increase is observed which is about 0 4 to 0 6 k by 2055 and about 0 7 to 1 3 k by 2085 for scenario 1 and about 1 3 to 2 2 k by 2055 and about 1 8 to 3 1 k by 2085 for scenario 6 table 5 fig 9 shows the temperature change for scenarios 1 and 6 for the years 2055 and 2085 compared to the reference state in 2000 of the drinking water wells in the lange erlen case study area the difference between heat introduced by river infiltration and heat loss by exfiltration of groundwater into the river results in a net heat exchange of the river with the aquifer in the hardwald case study area for the present state heat loss from the aquifer into the river rhine by the exfiltration of comparatively warm groundwater in the autumn and especially in the winter months can be observed which changes only slightly for the different climate scenarios in the autumn months but increases in the winter months in the years 2055 by up to 59 mean 2 and 2085 by up to 102 mean 38 compared to the reference year 2000 fig 8 middle column top the heat introduced by the river rhine in the spring and especially in the summer and autumn months changes only slightly for the different climate scenarios in the years 2055 and 2085 the development is similar for the heat exchange via artificial groundwater recharge which is overall much higher than that via river groundwater interaction for the winter spring and summer months relatively little changes can be observed for the different climate scenarios in 2055 and 2085 in the autumn months heat introduced to the aquifer increases from well balanced conditions in 2000 and 2055 to approx 20 mw in 2085 compared to the reference year 2000 fig 8 middle column middle as in the lange erlen case study area a slight decrease of heat loss in winter can be observed for 2055 compared to 2000 and 2085 the heat loss via drinking water extractions increases steadily over the years 2000 to 2055 and 2085 whereby in absolute terms it is highest in the winter and especially in the autumn months the strongest increase over the years is observed for the winter months compared to 2000 and depending on the season and the different climate scenarios the heat loss in the summer months increases by up to 128 mean 75 from 2000 to 2055 and by up to 115 mean 198 from 2000 to 2085 fig 8 middle column bottom a temperature increase is observed for all drinking water wells which is about 0 2 to 0 3 k by 2055 for scenario s1 and about 0 7 to 1 0 k by 2085 and about 0 6 to 1 6 k by 2055 for scenario s6 and about 1 5 to 4 0 k by 2085 table 5 fig 9 shows the temperature change for scenarios 1 and 6 for the years 2055 and 2085 compared to the reference state in 2000 of the drinking water wells in the hardwald case study area particularly the drinking water wells which not only are affected by the artificial groundwater recharge show the highest temperature changes for the scenario 6 in 2085 since in the lower birs valley as in the lange erlen case study area river infiltration is the predominant river groundwater interaction process the difference between heat introduced by river infiltration and heat loss by groundwater exfiltration into the river results in a net heat input to the aquifer in the summer and autumn months whereas the development for the summer months is indistinct the heat introduced in the autumn months compared to 2000 and depending on the different climate scenarios increases by up to 144 mean 55 from 2000 to 2055 and by up to 262 mean 74 from 2000 to 2085 fig 8 right column top in the winter and spring months heat is lost from the aquifer into the river whereas values are close to zero and significantly smaller than the heat input in the summer and autumn months the heat exchange by the artificial groundwater recharge shows relatively lower thermal effects for the different seasons and investigated climate scenarios a comparatively high heat input which is on the same order of magnitude as the heat introduced by river water infiltration takes place in the summer months in the spring and autumn months the heat input increases slightly depending on the different climate scenarios fig 8 right column middle compared to 2000 and depending on the time of year and the different climate scenarios the heat loss by drinking water extraction increases by 17 to 380 mean 207 from 2000 to 2055 and by 43 to 628 mean 282 from 2000 to 2085 fig 8 right column bottom for all drinking water wells a temperature increase is observed which for the scenario s1 is at about 0 85 k by 2055 and at about 0 3 to 0 7 k by 2085 and for the scenario s6 at about 1 0 to 3 2 k by 2055 and at about 2 6 to 5 4 k by 2085 table 5 fig 9 shows the temperature change for scenarios s1 and s6 for the years 2055 and 2085 compared to the reference state in 2000 of the drinking water wells in the lower birs valley case study area particularly the drinking water wells to the north which are more influenced by the regional groundwater flow components and especially the inflow from the hillslope catchments show the highest temperature changes for the scenario s6 in 2055 and 2085 3 2 5 hydraulic and thermal groundwater regime operational scenarios for the groundwater extractions in the lange erlen case study area for the operational scenario a which corresponds to an average operation mode as well as operational scenario b and c table 4 it can be observed that between the present state 2018 and for climate scenario s6 in 2085 the heat input by the artificial groundwater recharge increases by only approx 1 fig 10 left column bottom the heat loss from the aquifer is low and increases for the present state and the climate scenario s6 in 2085 only slightly in relation to the increased pumping rates and infiltration quantities the heat loss of the extractions increases by approx 40 from the present state to the climate scenario s6 in 2085 for the individual operational scenarios respectively fig 10 left column top this large increase has the same order of magnitude for the corresponding operational change compared to the present state table 1 for the groundwater extraction in the hardwald case study area for scenario a which corresponds to an average operation mode table 4 it can be observed that between the present state 2014 and for the climate scenario s6 in 2085 the heat input in the summer months and the heat output in the winter months due to the artificial groundwater recharge only increase by approx 6 and approx 16 respectively fig 10 middle column bottom for the operational scenario b with low pumping rates and reduced artificial groundwater recharge table 4 a reduction of the heat exchange results thus the heat loss of the groundwater extractions decreases by approx 60 fig 10 middle column top and that for the artificial groundwater recharge in the winter months by approx 52 fig 10 middle column bottom the heat introduced by the artificial groundwater recharge in the summer months even decreases by approx 92 operational scenario c with increased pumping rates and infiltration quantities table 4 results in an increase in heat exchange for the present state thus the heat loss via the groundwater extractions increases by about 76 and that for the artificial groundwater recharge in the winter months by about 9 the heat introduced by the artificial groundwater recharge in the summer months increases by about 52 for the operational scenario c and for the climate scenario s6 the heat loss increases by about 76 compared to average operation due to the groundwater extractions this is the same increase as observed for the corresponding operation change in the present state see above the heat exchange by artificial groundwater recharge shows only minor changes for the different operational scenarios considered and climate scenario s6 in 2085 for the groundwater extractions in the lower birs valley case study area the heat loss is reduced by up to 9 present state in 2018 and 8 scenario s1 in 2085 for the different operational scenarios of increased groundwater recharge table 4 the reduction can be explained by the operational scenarios for which a continuous operation of the infiltration over the year is considered the present operation however takes place mainly in the summer months when comparatively warm river water is infiltrated the heat introduced via the artificial groundwater recharge in the summer months increases by up to 68 present state in 2018 and 63 scenario s6 in 2085 the heat loss in the winter months increases by up to 49 present state in 2018 and 30 scenario s6 in 2085 fig 10 right column 4 summary discussion the impacts of climate change on water resources are becoming increasingly apparent and quantitative and qualitative impacts on water resources and local drinking water supplies can already be observed today for three unconsolidated rock groundwater resources used for drinking water supply in the basel region future impacts on groundwater quantity and quality as well as direct impacts of climate change and indirect impacts of local anthropogenic changes were investigated in scope of our studies the role of artificial groundwater recharge and surface water infiltration for quantitative groundwater recharge and the temporal development of groundwater temperatures were evaluated river flow and temperature as well groundwater flow and heat transport simulations were used to evaluate hydraulic and thermal changes against the background of climate warming and different strategies for water supply planning the water resources in the lange erlen hardwald and lower birs valley case study areas are characterized by similarities in the hydraulic and thermal groundwater regime but also differ significantly in individual natural and anthropogenic boundary conditions they have in common that artificially recharged groundwater is an important component in the overall water balance at all three areas and that cold winter and warm summer groundwater plumes follow the hydraulic gradient from the different artificial infiltration systems mainly to the drinking water wells for all study areas a strong heat loss takes place especially in summer and late summer by drinking water extractions which is confirmed by the measured increased temperatures in the pumped water figs b2 and b6 in the appendix in the following the main results for the present state and for the evaluated climate and operational scenarios of the study areas are summarized in the lange erlen case study area river infiltration is the predominant river groundwater interaction process therefore heat is introduced by the infiltration of river water into the aquifer mainly in summer and late summer considering all investigated climate scenarios the net heat input by infiltration of river water increases by an average of 42 until 2055 and by an average of 62 until 2085 compared to the reference year 2000 correspondingly heat loss via groundwater extraction also increases by an average of 36 by 2055 and an average of 56 by 2085 as a result the temperatures of the extracted drinking water would increase by 0 4 to 1 3 k by 2055 and 0 7 to 3 1 k by 2085 compared to the reference year 2000 operational scenarios with increased pumping rates and infiltration quantities result in an increase of the heat exchange especially the heat loss by groundwater extraction increases by approx 40 from the present state to the climate scenario s6 in 2085 for the individual operational scenarios respectively however the heat exchange via artificial groundwater recharge shows only minor changes for the different operational scenarios in the hardwald case study area the most significant heat exchange takes place via artificial groundwater recharge in ponds and trenches considering all climate scenarios investigated the heat loss by groundwater extraction during the winter months increases by an average of 38 from the year 2000 to the year 2085 as a result the temperatures of the extracted drinking water would increase by 0 2 to 1 0 k by 2055 and 0 6 to 4 0 k by 2085 compared to the reference year 2000 operational scenarios with increased pumping rates and infiltration quantities result in an increase of the heat exchange especially the heat loss by groundwater extraction increases by up to 76 compared to an average operation mode already for the present state but also considering the climate scenarios with these observations for both the lange erlen and hardwald case study areas were water of the river rhine is artificially recharged to the aquifer the already observed high maximum surface water temperatures above 26 c of the river rhine in summer observed today will affect the drinking water supply in the basel region in the lower birs valley case study area the heat exchange between the river and the aquifer depends besides the seasonality on which river section is considered whereas for southern river sections the infiltration of river water into the aquifer is the dominating interaction process for northern river sections it is the exfiltration of groundwater into the river overall heat input into the aquifer from the river and by artificial groundwater recharge is higher than heat loss by groundwater extractions considering all investigated climate scenarios the net heat input by infiltration of river water increases by an average of 42 until 2055 and by an average of 62 until 2085 especially in the autumn months compared to the reference year 2000 the heat loss by drinking water extraction increases by an average of 36 from 2000 to 2055 and by an average of 56 from 2000 to 2085 accordingly the simulated temperatures of the extracted drinking water increase by 0 85 to 3 2 k by 2055 and by 0 3 to 5 4 k by 2085 depending on the climate scenario investigated operational scenarios with increased artificial groundwater recharge result in an increase in heat exchange continuous operation of the artificial infiltration reduces the heat extraction by up to 9 this would result in lower temperatures of the extracted drinking water 5 conclusions for three alluvial aquifers in the urban agglomeration of the city of basel switzerland the sensitivity of individual rivers and aquifers to climate change was quantitatively assessed and compared based on river discharge and temperature as well as groundwater flow and heat transport simulations the influence of different groundwater recharge components and the temperature developments of the groundwater extraction of the drinking water supply could be assessed this information was the basis for assessing the hydraulic and thermal sensitivity of the studied aquifers to climatic and anthropogenic changes the quantitative assessment highlights the need to distinguish between different thermal exposures of drinking water wells and to differentiate between natural and artificial components of groundwater recharge we could show that the complex interplay of the various natural and anthropogenic influencing factors can only be adequately analyzed by flow and heat transport simulations of river and groundwater systems such models make it possible to quantify the interaction of surface water and groundwater resources both spatially and temporally and investigate in greater depth the quantitative and qualitative effects of climate change by means of scenario calculations in this way thermal balances and thermal impacts can be calculated and the thermal impacts of climate change and future uses be quantified as the current and foreseen warming of surface waters and groundwater is expected to have a large impact on many aquatic ecosystems and biochemical processes a proper understanding of the involved processes and interactions and their respective impacts are highly required future climate impact studies should therefore aim at coupling surface and groundwater models in order to incorporate exchange processes to better assess quantitative and ecological impacts on aquatic systems and to consider anthropogenic usage of surface water and groundwater as a base for developing climate change adaptation strategies for their management alluvial aquifers in river valleys often are highly productive not only for water supply but also for agriculture accordingly they are locations where decisions must be taken for groundwater resource

8548,laura k lautz is a premier mentor collaborator and researcher at the intersection of natural hydrologic systems and humans her research has shifted the paradigm around measuring and understanding the impacts of surface water and groundwater interactions across spatial and temporal scales she has done this by testing and refining new methods and by collaborating with training supporting and mentoring diverse scientists here we review her research across five themes summarizing the prior status of the field what lautz contributed as well as new directions in the field inspired by her work lautz s research expanded our understanding of the impacts of stream restoration on surface water groundwater interactions where she tested new field methods and showed that restoration structures increase hyporheic exchange locally altering biogeochemical function of the streambed she refined novel methods for measuring surface water groundwater exchanges and worked to make these methods easily accessible through freely available software her research group greatly expanded the use of heat as a quantitative tracer of hydrologic processes via the well used vflux and hflux programs her research evaluated the impacts of surface water groundwater interactions in urban streams showing the substantial fluxes of nutrients and chloride that can move through those exchanges and the potential for groundwater to help buffer contamination to assess groundwater impacts on streamflow below tropical glaciers she used a wide range of field methods to reveal the sensitivity of these systems to climate change finally she built tools to quantify natural brine contamination of drinking water wells in areas that may later be subject to high volume hydraulic fracturing creating a needed pre fracking dataset through this process she identified multiple sources of salinity that are already reaching wells in these systems overall this research has been done with a focus on mentoring and training the next generation of hydrologists including work to specifically train for careers beyond academia and facilitating early career scientists to realize their innate potentials with former trainees in careers across industry government and academia dr laura k lautz is now working to build cross disciplinary research at even larger scales across federal research units guaranteeing that an even larger impact on hydrology is still to come keywords surface water groundwater stream restoration heat tracing urban streams hydraulic fracturing tropical glaciers data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction the research of dr laura k lautz has been broadly impactful in advancing the study of near surface and surface water hydrology because of unique ways in which she integrates ideas and multidisciplinary methodologies and develops safe and equitable space for diverse researchers to address critical water issues over her career thus far and we want to emphasize the thus far the central thesis of her work has been to increase quantification of surface water groundwater interactions and their impact on flow and water quality across multiple spatial and temporal scales this work has focused on identifying prototyping testing and validating new methodological approaches e g baker et al 2019 christian et al 2016 lautz et al 2014 especially the use of heat tracing of streambed hydrologic exchange e g briggs et al 2012 gordon et al 2013 lautz 2010 her work also investigates anthropogenic impacts on surface

candidates and thirteen master s students over her career so far which we herein call the lautz research group providing each with the skills to go on and work in industry government academia and beyond lautz et al 2018 in this paper we summarize her impact on five research themes 1 surface water groundwater interactions after stream restoration 2 using heat fluxes to evaluate multiscale surface water groundwater exchange 3 the distribution and impacts of surface water groundwater exchange in urban contexts 4 understanding climate change impacts on hydrology below tropical glaciers 5

help the scientific community to chart a path of future research needs this career path shows that estimating the impact a scholar has on the field cannot be calculated through papers citations or grants alone cuahsi board of directors officers 2022 2 an overview of the research of laura k lautz 2 1 stream restoration and its impacts on surface water groundwater interactions over the past decades in stream restoration structures have often been invoked as potential mechanisms for improving stream water quality by enhancing hyporheic exchange and related reactive processes craig et al 2008 hester and gooseff 2010 specifically in stream geomorphic features that are engineered through the restoration process such as j hooks or cross vanes can serve as critical drivers of reach or bedform scale hyporheic exchange endreny et al 2011a 2011b lautz et al 2010 fig 3 although this concept was an attractive solution to a large scale problem there had been little quantitative evaluation of how common stream restoration structures directly impact exchanges of water and solute as part of her dissertation research lautz applied the u s geological survey modflow groundwater flow model to evaluate advective exchanges around a simple anthropogenic channel spanning log dams lautz and siegel 2006 using process based models paired with particle tracking lautz and her coauthor showed that the engineered structures should enhance hyporheic exchange by increasing localized hydraulic gradients and creating hyporheic exchange zones up to two times larger than those expected around natural geomorphic features in the study reach which was later supported by field observations of increased connectivity around such dams fanelli and lautz 2008 along with log dams this phenomena was observed at cross vanes that created an order of magnitude increase in vertical hyporheic flux daniluk et al 2013 but practical limitations arise as the total volume of streamflow that interacts with the hyporheic zone in restored reaches is still low gordon et al 2013 utilizing the strengths of both modeling and field observations provided insights into the role of ecosystem engineering for water quality impacts that helped evaluate the potential benefits of hyporheic zone enhancement from restoration practices through this work contributions from the lautz research group also addressed the scientific community s need for improved field methods to quantify hydro biogeochemical fluxes over time this was tackled through the production and improvement of several tools the lautz research group advanced the use of in situ heat tracing techniques to quantify one dimensional hydrologic fluxes in a streambed reviewed by irvine and lautz 2015 as described in detail in section 2 2 in her research group geochemical tracing was also often coupled with heat tracing to help quantify source mixing in streambeds gordon et al 2013 zimmer and lautz 2015 2014 the lautz research group paired these hydrologic exchange methods with observations of pore water nutrient concentrations to quantify how hyporheic exchange affected water quality fanelli and lautz 2008 hubbard jr et al 2010 gordon et al 2013 showed that only 0 4 of surface water exchanged with the hyporheic zone across a 45 55 m stream reach which is a critical observation to temper expectations of benefits of enhancing hyporheic exchange for water quality applications this body of work also showed that while engineered geomorphic features can be localized hot spots for advective hyporheic exchange generally low residence time of subsurface flowpaths around structures reduced the potential for substantial nutrient cycling gordon et al 2013 zimmer and lautz 2015 drawing from and inspired by lautz s research both practitioners and aquatic scientists continue to better quantify how in stream features can alter hyporheic exchange and in stream function herzog et al 2019 her work opened doors to addressing the next frontier of knowledge gaps within ecosystem engineering lewandowski et al 2019 for example lautz her collaborators and her trainees are studying the role of reactive barriers and beaver dam analogs bdas on recreating natural functions especially in heavily degraded urban and agricultural systems bdas are a new restoration structure that aim to mimic the impacts of beaver dams on the hydrology geomorphology and ecosystems of streams pollock et al 2014 recent work shows high spatial variability in the impact of bdas on stream temperature nutrient production and erosion deposition characteristics davis et al 2021 pearce et al 2021a wade et al 2020 along with colleagues she recently explicitly called for approaching the use monitoring and evaluation of bdas differently than how the community approached natural channel design lautz and colleagues are encouraging both a thorough understanding of the goals of the approach and appropriately monitoring impact of initial installations before widely using the technique lautz et al 2019 despite the growing popularity of this new approach it remains unclear if bdas will achieve the desired goals of stakeholders 2 2 heat tracing of streambed exchange temperature is measured throughout aquatic environments for a myriad of reasons related to habitat biogeochemical reaction and water quality however heat can also be used as a tracer of physical processes such as the movement of water through porous media the governing coupled fluid flow and heat transport physics were generally defined in 1d during the 1960s bredehoeft and papaopulos 1965 stallman 1965 suzuki 1960 goto et al 2005 and later hatch et al 2006 and keery et al 2007 presented analytical solutions to these equations based on the vertical transport of natural diurnal signals through porous media using these solutions vertical water flux rates can efficiently be calculated at multiple depths and locations over time representing a major complement to existing physical methods such as seepage meters given the highly dynamic nature of surface water groundwater exchange lautz recognized the power in automatically tracking variable flux rates over time using low cost temperature sensors and she used these heat tracing tools to quantify solute fluxes around stream restoration structures as discussed above fanelli and lautz 2008 lautz et al 2010 as the lautz research group coalesced around similar methods at syracuse university in 2009 they found that implementation of the diurnal signal based techniques throughout the hydrology community was generally ad hoc using custom codes often diurnal signal processing was rudimentary and based on maximum and minimum daily temperature values an approach prone to uncertainty building on the signal processing tools presented by swanson and cardenas 2010 and vogt et al 2010 lautz research group developed the software vflux for open use in the matlab environment gordon et al 2012 the free vflux tool opened up broad access to what were previously boutique methods engendering worldwide use where matlab licenses were available the dynamic harmonic regression signal processing provided by the captain toolbox young et al 2010 allows non stationary signal extraction typically diurnal such that dynamic flux rates could be tracked over long time periods and at sub daily timescales further vflux automatically harmonizes various temperature records to the same timesteps and includes monte carlo based uncertainty analysis features that both promote easy use of the methodology and more realistic understanding of results when new analytical solutions were published that combined multiple attributes of diurnal signal transport to allow for the calculation of bulk thermal diffusivity and streambed scour deposition luce et al 2013 mccallum et al 2012 the lautz research group added this functionality to vflux2 and published original research to assess how this new information might be harnessed to indicate times of unreliable water flux estimates irvine and lautz 2015 after applying the vertical heat tracing methods to a range of field data lautz decided more should be known about the impact of non ideal field conditions that often if not always violate the fundamental assumptions of 1d analytical models the resulting modeling and benchtop experiments are highly cited single author reality checks regarding the capabilities and limitations of the vflux methods lautz 2012 2010 and compliment the quantitative uncertainty analysis of vflux later several members of the lautz research group followed this body of work up with a how to guide for the diurnal signal based vertical flux methodology that serves as an accessible introduction and companion to vflux aimed at environmental professionals and academic fields outside of hydrology irvine et al 2017 in addition to substantial efforts in refining existing methods and broadly facilitating their use the lautz research group continued to use the heat tracing tools for novel hydrological research for example briggs et al 2012 explored how high spatial resolution bed temperature data collected with wrapped fiber optic sensors enhanced the tracking of shallow hyporheic flow over time the hyporheic residence times inferred from that high resolution data were applied to better understand spatiotemporal redox patterns above natural beaver dams briggs et al 2014 briggs et al 2013 bridging to stream reach scales lautz and ribaudo 2012 demonstrated how spatial point estimates of vertical flux could be upscaled across the streambed in 2d by building on the principles of conant 2004 in applying heat tracing techniques at stream network scales the lautz research group also made important contributions to the modeling of stream temperature westhoff et al 2007 presented a linear 1d total heat budget model for streams yet the use of that model was not readily accessible to most to address this glose et al 2017 released a similar heat budget model in spreadsheet format called hflux that has to date been used by several research groups abdi et al 2021 2020 abdi and endreny 2019 caldwell et al 2019 feigl et al 2022 roesky and hayashi 2022 another contribution from the lautz research group was baker et al 2019 which details a method to account for water surface reflection of thermal infrared imagery when evaluating large scale water surface temperature patterns to inform stream temperature modeling and hydrology process interpretation a final example of lautz research group heat tracing contributions at stream network scales is the study of briggs et al 2018 who developed a new method of paired air water annual temperature signal analysis that can efficiently indicate relative groundwater influence and parse dominance of shallow within approx 6 m of land surface vs deeper groundwater sources fig 4 this methodology was recently applied by studies conducted at the continental scale hare et al 2021 johnson et al 2020 and has been made readily available via a free software application accessed 3 31 2022 https cuahsi shinyapps io pasta 2 3 urban water urban hydrology was long focused around the idea that impervious surface cover and its subsequent change in partitioning of precipitation between infiltration and runoff primarily drove the responses seen in streams and rivers leopold 1968 paul and meyer 2001 walsh et al 2005 early work focused heavily on stormflow with less research on urban influences on the rest of the streamflow regime and coupled groundwater systems however there was growing consensus in the 2000s that this uni directional approach to urban hydrology missed important interactions across space and time that drive stream response kaushal and belt 2012 one idea that arose during this period was the importance of surface water groundwater interactions in urban systems hancock 2002 especially in light of the large amounts of money being spent on stream restoration that would re connect streams to surrounding floodplains and groundwater bernhardt et al 2005 hester and gooseff 2010 as work in hyporheic exchange showed the importance of residence time on biogeochemical cycling in more natural and less engineered streams briggs et al 2014 briggs et al 2013 the question quickly evolved to consider such processes in urban systems the research out of the lautz research group that focused on urban systems aimed to understand the impact of surface water groundwater interactions work that was done through a combination of field and modeling studies ledford and lautz 2015 showed contrasting spatial and temporal patterns in sulfate chloride and nitrate between urban reaches disconnected from groundwater compared to those with active exchanges of water and solutes floodplain connection in urban systems enhanced surface water groundwater interactions but the seasonal impact varied across conservative ions with consistent vs variable loadings this helped build a new conceptual model of the importance of groundwater re connection in urban systems fig 5 further urban stream work was done to understand the role of riparian zone aquifers on the migration of road salt contamination using a modflow model ledford et al 2016 found that overbank flood events in winter carried high salt loads from upstream areas and would recharge the riparian zone aquifer winter discharge of lower chloride groundwater which recharged the aquifer in summer helped lower in stream chloride concentrations during high salt application periods while summer discharge of higher chloride groundwater recharged during overbank flood events the previous winter increased in stream concentrations at the stream network scale monitoring of in stream chloride loads through time showed that reaches disconnected from groundwater act as a delivery system for chloride applied in the watershed as road salt reaching the stream directly through runoff and snowmelt slosson et al 2021 in comparison to culverted streams with cement banks urban streams where surface water was connected to groundwater had more complex hydrologic and transport dynamics in such systems larger scale groundwater flow paths were important routes of chloride transport both into and out of urban headwater catchments slosson et al 2021 this work added to the growing body of knowledge around chronic groundwater contamination of road salt in urban systems and the impact this has on surface water concentrations the importance of surface water groundwater interactions on nitrate concentrations and loads in urban systems varied over space and time in the summer urban reaches that were disconnected from groundwater channelized and did not have surrounding riparian vegetation had very high nitrate removal which then decreased in winter as productivity declined ledford et al 2017 despite this high uptake these urbanized reaches were still net sources of nitrate loads downstream across all seasons beltran et al 2021 surface water groundwater interactions had minimal impact on nitrate in an urban stream with intact riparian buffers resulting in relatively constant concentrations and loads through time but shifts between a gaining and losing system over the year caused seasonal shifts in nitrate source vs sink behavior with an overall removal of nitrate mass in areas with high surface water groundwater interaction beltran et al 2021 ledford et al 2017 one area of nitrate sourcing to urban systems that was investigated by the lautz research group is the potential for legacy nitrate from cemeteries to drive high groundwater nitrate loads with an estimated 25 50 of nitrate load to a stream potentially coming from burial decay products lautz et al 2020 this work all highlights the importance of considering surface water groundwater interaction along with biological uptake when identifying sources and sinks of nitrate to urban streams work to understand the importance of heterogeneities in surface water groundwater interactions in urban systems continues this includes an increased interest in urban baseflow ledford et al 2020 and work that shows unlike for stormflow there is no uniform response to increased impervious surface cover on baseflow bhaskar et al 2020 along with work to understand how the quantity of water differs in urban systems the vital importance of understanding the long term impacts of road salt on northern streams and rivers continues kelly et al 2019 mazumder et al 2021 including work to understand impacts of climate change on future salt regimes gutchess et al 2018 nitrogen concentrations in urban streams remain enriched compared to less impacted systems journey et al 2018 mulholland et al 2008 and so research continues to work to understand sources transport and fate of nitrogen and the impacts that changes in surface water groundwater interactions have on urban stream nutrients 2 4 climate change and tropical glaciers the lautz research group s contributions to hydrology include an internationally collaborative component applying her expertise in surface water groundwater interactions to better understand shifting alpine water resources in a rapidly changing climate mark et al 2017 mountain glaciers are in rapid recession or disappearing worldwide due to climate change induced warming this causes a shift in the hydrologic cycle and water availability particularly in regions that depend on runoff from mountain glaciers for their dry season water supply viviroli et al 2011 during the late 2000s there was a general realization that surface runoff wasn t the sole source of proglacial water in mountain regions instead erosional and depositional geomorphic features in glaciated valleys formed unique and substantial groundwater systems in the tropical mountain valleys of peru baraer et al 2009 in the mid 2010s the lautz research group joined existing efforts by her collaborators to understand and characterize these systems and led the way toward an understanding of the interactions between these proglacial aquifers and valley streams between 2015 and 2019 lautz made multiple excursions to the cordillera blanca cb in the ancash region of peru with a diverse group of co investigators that included human geographers meteorologists hydrologists and geochemists from both peru and abroad during this time the lautz research group produced or contributed to nine published articles and eight graduate theses that characterized for the first time the mechanisms by which this groundwater resource was emerging to the surface and contributing to proglacial streams glas et al 2018 lautz and collaborators analyzed surface water and groundwater samples for ionic and isotopic composition using synoptic sampling across proglacial meadows and debris fans of the cb they used principal component analysis dilution gauging and stable isotopes to identify relative contributions to streamflow by moraines talus and proglacial alluvial fans at altitudes higher than 4000 m above sea level gordon et al 2015 lautz s team then used constant rate rhodamine dilution gauging and in stream temperature logging to model the stream energy balance in one of cb s principal proglacial valleys identifying artesian springs as the source for more than a third of dry season streamflow somers et al 2016 their later work in the qualcayhuanca valley of the cb provided important developments in stream energy balance modeling by defining the role of diurnally fluctuating temperature signals from glacial melt baker et al 2018 work by the lautz research group in this region also contributed to improvements in the use of thermal infrared imagery to locate groundwater inputs to valley streams and springs across the cb baker et al 2019 wigmore et al 2019 lautz later expanded her research toolkit and collaborative network to include the use of near surface geophysical methods to estimate the volumetric storage capacity of the cb s proglacial aquifer system her team collaborated with the u s geological survey hydrogeophysics branch and the instituto geofisico del peru https www igp gob pe to obtain and transport geophysical equipment to these remote alpine reaches using electrical resistivity tomography and both passive and active near surface seismic methods her team was able to confirm the hypothesis that buried talus deposits were forming confined aquifers with substantial storage capacity glas et al 2019b fig 6 estimates of layer thickness from these geophysical surveys were later used to parameterize a groundwater flow model and arrive at groundwater residence times of 6 months to 1 5 years in the quilcayhuanca aquifer baker 2019 short groundwater residence times underline the vulnerability of these alpine streams to glacial loss particularly for downstream communities during the driest months of the year lautz s work in the cb has allowed researchers to forecast water availability from alpine meadows under future climate scenarios underscoring the impermanence of this natural resource over the next century somers et al 2019 the collaborative work of the lautz team has expanded hydrologic understanding and applicability of field methods in glaciated alpine regions which are among the most rapidly changing hydrologic systems in modern times hayashi 2020 somers and mckenzie 2020 2 5 identifying contamination to private drinking wells conventionally sourced natural gas has been a common fossil fuel used across the globe but around 2005 the expansion of high volume hydraulic fracturing hvhf and horizontal drilling from unconventional sources such as the marcellus shale resulted in concerns around contamination of water sources from both migration up from the fracturing zones improper well sealing and the storage of flow back waters vidic et al 2013 in states above the marcellus shale especially pennsylvania hvhf was frequently blamed for methane and water quality contamination of drinking water wells jackson et al 2013 osborn et al 2011 boyer et al 2012 however the ability to clearly link issues around methane contamination or high salinity in extracted groundwater to hvhf was limited davies 2011 saba and orzechowski 2011 in part because there were not ample data around the natural variability of either before hvhf new york state placed a ban on hvhf although conventional wells did exist across the state lautz et al 2014 the lack of hvhf in new york allowed for the collection of pre fracturing or baseline groundwater quality data to assess for natural spatial and temporal variability in contamination from migration from appalachian basin brines and from conventional drilling including both salinity and methane contributions from lautz and collaborators to these issues focused on using statistical techniques to assess large scale databases and identify sources and patterns of contamination initial research involved building a discriminant analysis tool that utilized nine solutes in groundwater to statistically analyze if salinity was sourced from appalachian basin brine road salt septic effluent or animal waste lautz et al 2014 this fingerprinting tool highlighted the importance of measuring halogens including bromide chloride and iodide to differentiate salinity sources and was able to accurately assign salinity to an appalachian basin brine source 99 4 of the time showing its potential wider applicability to assessing salinity in locations with hvhf this statistical model was later applied to groundwater databases from outside of the marcellus shale area chien and lautz 2018 the model proved to be highly adaptable remaining over 80 accurate even with small datasets this work proved how a small but strong dataset that includes the chemistry of sources of contamination can be built to correctly identify contamination in other samples using measures of nine solutes a large database of groundwater sourced drinking water samples located over the marcellus shale in new york was compiled and the data were used to predict natural drivers of methane concentration a classification decision tree analysis found that high methane sources were more likely to occur in sodium rich waters from valleys and in wells that were screened in specific geologic units christian et al 2016 temporal sampling of natural methane variability across the same domestic wells highlighted natural changes in concentration as groundwater elevations shift throughout the year and different brine formations are pulled into the well campbell et al 2022 fig 7 this means single point in time baseline measurements which are the current norm for assessing for contamination after hvhf may not be representative this research highlights the inherent natural variability of baseline sources of saline groundwater across space and time which will potentially obfuscate linking contamination that is sourced from issues related to horizontal drilling or hvhf in locations where drilling is active the lautz research group provided a critical public service in developing the home well chemical database that identified expected indicators of contamination and in fingerprinting a range of potential sources of salinity in groundwater

8548,laura k lautz is a premier mentor collaborator and researcher at the intersection of natural hydrologic systems and humans her research has shifted the paradigm around measuring and understanding the impacts of surface water and groundwater interactions across spatial and temporal scales she has done this by testing and refining new methods and by collaborating with training supporting and mentoring diverse scientists here we review her research across five themes summarizing the prior status of the field what lautz contributed as well as new directions in the field inspired by her work lautz s research expanded our understanding of the impacts of stream restoration on surface water groundwater interactions where she tested new field methods and showed that restoration structures increase hyporheic exchange locally altering biogeochemical function of the streambed she refined novel methods for measuring surface water groundwater exchanges and worked to make these methods easily accessible through freely available software her research group greatly expanded the use of heat as a quantitative tracer of hydrologic processes via the well used vflux and hflux programs her research evaluated the impacts of surface water groundwater interactions in urban streams showing the substantial fluxes of nutrients and chloride that can move through those exchanges and the potential for groundwater to help buffer contamination to assess groundwater impacts on streamflow below tropical glaciers she used a wide range of field methods to reveal the sensitivity of these systems to climate change finally she built tools to quantify natural brine contamination of drinking water wells in areas that may later be subject to high volume hydraulic fracturing creating a needed pre fracking dataset through this process she identified multiple sources of salinity that are already reaching wells in these systems overall this research has been done with a focus on mentoring and training the next generation of hydrologists including work to specifically train for careers beyond academia and facilitating early career scientists to realize their innate potentials with former trainees in careers across industry government and academia dr laura k lautz is now working to build cross disciplinary research at even larger scales across federal research units guaranteeing that an even larger impact on hydrology is still to come keywords surface water groundwater stream restoration heat tracing urban streams hydraulic fracturing tropical glaciers data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction the research of dr laura k lautz has been broadly impactful in advancing the study of near surface and surface water hydrology because of unique ways in which she integrates ideas and multidisciplinary methodologies and develops safe and equitable space for diverse researchers to address critical water issues over her career thus far and we want to emphasize the thus far the central thesis of her work has been to increase quantification of surface water groundwater interactions and their impact on flow and water quality across multiple spatial and temporal scales this work has focused on identifying prototyping testing and validating new methodological approaches e g baker et al 2019 christian et al 2016 lautz et al 2014 especially the use of heat tracing of streambed hydrologic exchange e g briggs et al 2012 gordon et al 2013 lautz 2010 her work also investigates anthropogenic impacts on surface water and groundwater and their interactions across a wide range of land use types impact levels and spatial and temporal ranges e g glas et al 2019b lautz et al 2014 lautz et al 2020 this breadth of work across multiple fields and the range of field and modeling based approaches used to answer questions has transformed hydrology especially fields in surface water groundwater interactions and helped grow methods in an accessible way while moving research in the field of hydrology forward has been impactful she has also focused on effectively mentoring and training the next generation of hydrologists a generation that aims to better reflect the diversity of our population national academies of science engineering and medicine 2022 she has trained three postdoctoral scholars seven ph d candidates and thirteen master s students over her career so far which we herein call the lautz research group providing each with the skills to go on and work in industry government academia and beyond lautz et al 2018 in this paper we summarize her impact on five research themes 1 surface water groundwater interactions after stream restoration 2 using heat fluxes to evaluate multiscale surface water groundwater exchange 3 the distribution and impacts of surface water groundwater exchange in urban contexts 4 understanding climate change impacts on hydrology below tropical glaciers 5 and identifying and quantifying sources of basin brines to drinking water wells fig 1 while this paper summarizes her impact so far fig 2 she continues to help guide future research towards answering critical questions around water and our planet national academies of science engineering and medicine 2022 with a master s degree in education along with her phd in earth science she has used her wide range of training across multiple career paths after achieving full professorship she recently shifted her career trajectory from academia to a federal grant program officer where she can directly help the scientific community to chart a path of future research needs this career path shows that estimating the impact a scholar has on the field cannot be calculated through papers citations or grants alone cuahsi board of directors officers 2022 2 an overview of the research of laura k lautz 2 1 stream restoration and its impacts on surface water groundwater interactions over the past decades in stream restoration structures have often been invoked as potential mechanisms for improving stream water quality by enhancing hyporheic exchange and related reactive processes craig et al 2008 hester and gooseff 2010 specifically in stream geomorphic features that are engineered through the restoration process such as j hooks or cross vanes can serve as critical drivers of reach or bedform scale hyporheic exchange endreny et al 2011a 2011b lautz et al 2010 fig 3 although this concept was an attractive solution to a large scale problem there had been little quantitative evaluation of how common stream restoration structures directly impact exchanges of water and solute as part of her dissertation research lautz applied the u s geological survey modflow groundwater flow model to evaluate advective exchanges around a simple anthropogenic channel spanning log dams lautz and siegel 2006 using process based models paired with particle tracking lautz and her coauthor showed that the engineered structures should enhance hyporheic exchange by increasing localized hydraulic gradients and creating hyporheic exchange zones up to two times larger than those expected around natural geomorphic features in the study reach which was later supported by field observations of increased connectivity around such dams fanelli and lautz 2008 along with log dams this phenomena was observed at cross vanes that created an order of magnitude increase in vertical hyporheic flux daniluk et al 2013 but practical limitations arise as the total volume of streamflow that interacts with the hyporheic zone in restored reaches is still low gordon et al 2013 utilizing the strengths of both modeling and field observations provided insights into the role of ecosystem engineering for water quality impacts that helped evaluate the potential benefits of hyporheic zone enhancement from restoration practices through this work contributions from the lautz research group also addressed the scientific community s need for improved field methods to quantify hydro biogeochemical fluxes over time this was tackled through the production and improvement of several tools the lautz research group advanced the use of in situ heat tracing techniques to quantify one dimensional hydrologic fluxes in a streambed reviewed by irvine and lautz 2015 as described in detail in section 2 2 in her research group geochemical tracing was also often coupled with heat tracing to help quantify source mixing in streambeds gordon et al 2013 zimmer and lautz 2015 2014 the lautz research group paired these hydrologic exchange methods with observations of pore water nutrient concentrations to quantify how hyporheic exchange affected water quality fanelli and lautz 2008 hubbard jr et al 2010 gordon et al 2013 showed that only 0 4 of surface water exchanged with the hyporheic zone across a 45 55 m stream reach which is a critical observation to temper expectations of benefits of enhancing hyporheic exchange for water quality applications this body of work also showed that while engineered geomorphic features can be localized hot spots for advective hyporheic exchange generally low residence time of subsurface flowpaths around structures reduced the potential for substantial nutrient cycling gordon et al 2013 zimmer and lautz 2015 drawing from and inspired by lautz s research both practitioners and aquatic scientists continue to better quantify how in stream features can alter hyporheic exchange and in stream function herzog et al 2019 her work opened doors to addressing the next frontier of knowledge gaps within ecosystem engineering lewandowski et al 2019 for example lautz her collaborators and her trainees are studying the role of reactive barriers and beaver dam analogs bdas on recreating natural functions especially in heavily degraded urban and agricultural systems bdas are a new restoration structure that aim to mimic the impacts of beaver dams on the hydrology geomorphology and ecosystems of streams pollock et al 2014 recent work shows high spatial variability in the impact of bdas on stream temperature nutrient production and erosion deposition characteristics davis et al 2021 pearce et al 2021a wade et al 2020 along with colleagues she recently explicitly called for approaching the use monitoring and evaluation of bdas differently than how the community approached natural channel design lautz and colleagues are encouraging both a thorough understanding of the goals of the approach and appropriately monitoring impact of initial installations before widely using the technique lautz et al 2019 despite the growing popularity of this new approach it remains unclear if bdas will achieve the desired goals of stakeholders 2 2 heat tracing of streambed exchange temperature is measured throughout aquatic environments for a myriad of reasons related to habitat biogeochemical reaction and water quality however heat can also be used as a tracer of physical processes such as the movement of water through porous media the governing coupled fluid flow and heat transport physics were generally defined in 1d during the 1960s bredehoeft and papaopulos 1965 stallman 1965 suzuki 1960 goto et al 2005 and later hatch et al 2006 and keery et al 2007 presented analytical solutions to these equations based on the vertical transport of natural diurnal signals through porous media using these solutions vertical water flux rates can efficiently be calculated at multiple depths and locations over time representing a major complement to existing physical methods such as seepage meters given the highly dynamic nature of surface water groundwater exchange lautz recognized the power in automatically tracking variable flux rates over time using low cost temperature sensors and she used these heat tracing tools to quantify solute fluxes around stream restoration structures as discussed above fanelli and lautz 2008 lautz et al 2010 as the lautz research group coalesced around similar methods at syracuse university in 2009 they found that implementation of the diurnal signal based techniques throughout the hydrology community was generally ad hoc using custom codes often diurnal signal processing was rudimentary and based on maximum and minimum daily temperature values an approach prone to uncertainty building on the signal processing tools presented by swanson and cardenas 2010 and vogt et al 2010 lautz research group developed the software vflux for open use in the matlab environment gordon et al 2012 the free vflux tool opened up broad access to what were previously boutique methods engendering worldwide use where matlab licenses were available the dynamic harmonic regression signal processing provided by the captain toolbox young et al 2010 allows non stationary signal extraction typically diurnal such that dynamic flux rates could be tracked over long time periods and at sub daily timescales further vflux automatically harmonizes various temperature records to the same timesteps and includes monte carlo based uncertainty analysis features that both promote easy use of the methodology and more realistic understanding of results when new analytical solutions were published that combined multiple attributes of diurnal signal transport to allow for the calculation of bulk thermal diffusivity and streambed scour deposition luce et al 2013 mccallum et al 2012 the lautz research group added this functionality to vflux2 and published original research to assess how this new information might be harnessed to indicate times of unreliable water flux estimates irvine and lautz 2015 after applying the vertical heat tracing methods to a range of field data lautz decided more should be known about the impact of non ideal field conditions that often if not always violate the fundamental assumptions of 1d analytical models the resulting modeling and benchtop experiments are highly cited single author reality checks regarding the capabilities and limitations of the vflux methods lautz 2012 2010 and compliment the quantitative uncertainty analysis of vflux later several members of the lautz research group followed this body of work up with a how to guide for the diurnal signal based vertical flux methodology that serves as an accessible introduction and companion to vflux aimed at environmental professionals and academic fields outside of hydrology irvine et al 2017 in addition to substantial efforts in refining existing methods and broadly facilitating their use the lautz research group continued to use the heat tracing tools for novel hydrological research for example briggs et al 2012 explored how high spatial resolution bed temperature data collected with wrapped fiber optic sensors enhanced the tracking of shallow hyporheic flow over time the hyporheic residence times inferred from that high resolution data were applied to better understand spatiotemporal redox patterns above natural beaver dams briggs et al 2014 briggs et al 2013 bridging to stream reach scales lautz and ribaudo 2012 demonstrated how spatial point estimates of vertical flux could be upscaled across the streambed in 2d by building on the principles of conant 2004 in applying heat tracing techniques at stream network scales the lautz research group also made important contributions to the modeling of stream temperature westhoff et al 2007 presented a linear 1d total heat budget model for streams yet the use of that model was not readily accessible to most to address this glose et al 2017 released a similar heat budget model in spreadsheet format called hflux that has to date been used by several research groups abdi et al 2021 2020 abdi and endreny 2019 caldwell et al 2019 feigl et al 2022 roesky and hayashi 2022 another contribution from the lautz research group was baker et al 2019 which details a method to account for water surface reflection of thermal infrared imagery when evaluating large scale water surface temperature patterns to inform stream temperature modeling and hydrology process interpretation a final example of lautz research group heat tracing contributions at stream network scales is the study of briggs et al 2018 who developed a new method of paired air water annual temperature signal analysis that can efficiently indicate relative groundwater influence and parse dominance of shallow within approx 6 m of land surface vs deeper groundwater sources fig 4 this methodology was recently applied by studies conducted at the continental scale hare et al 2021 johnson et al 2020 and has been made readily available via a free software application accessed 3 31 2022 https cuahsi shinyapps io pasta 2 3 urban water urban hydrology was long focused around the idea that impervious surface cover and its subsequent change in partitioning of precipitation between infiltration and runoff primarily drove the responses seen in streams and rivers leopold 1968 paul and meyer 2001 walsh et al 2005 early work focused heavily on stormflow with less research on urban influences on the rest of the streamflow regime and coupled groundwater systems however there was growing consensus in the 2000s that this uni directional approach to urban hydrology missed important interactions across space and time that drive stream response kaushal and belt 2012 one idea that arose during this period was the importance of surface water groundwater interactions in urban systems hancock 2002 especially in light of the large amounts of money being spent on stream restoration that would re connect streams to surrounding floodplains and groundwater bernhardt et al 2005 hester and gooseff 2010 as work in hyporheic exchange showed the importance of residence time on biogeochemical cycling in more natural and less engineered streams briggs et al 2014 briggs et al 2013 the question quickly evolved to consider such processes in urban systems the research out of the lautz research group that focused on urban systems aimed to understand the impact of surface water groundwater interactions work that was done through a combination of field and modeling studies ledford and lautz 2015 showed contrasting spatial and temporal patterns in sulfate chloride and nitrate between urban reaches disconnected from groundwater compared to those with active exchanges of water and solutes floodplain connection in urban systems enhanced surface water groundwater interactions but the seasonal impact varied across conservative ions with consistent vs variable loadings this helped build a new conceptual model of the importance of groundwater re connection in urban systems fig 5 further urban stream work was done to understand the role of riparian zone aquifers on the migration of road salt contamination using a modflow model ledford et al 2016 found that overbank flood events in winter carried high salt loads from upstream areas and would recharge the riparian zone aquifer winter discharge of lower chloride groundwater which recharged the aquifer in summer helped lower in stream chloride concentrations during high salt application periods while summer discharge of higher chloride groundwater recharged during overbank flood events the previous winter increased in stream concentrations at the stream network scale monitoring of in stream chloride loads through time showed that reaches disconnected from groundwater act as a delivery system for chloride applied in the watershed as road salt reaching the stream directly through runoff and snowmelt slosson et al 2021 in comparison to culverted streams with cement banks urban streams where surface water was connected to groundwater had more complex hydrologic and transport dynamics in such systems larger scale groundwater flow paths were important routes of chloride transport both into and out of urban headwater catchments slosson et al 2021 this work added to the growing body of knowledge around chronic groundwater contamination of road salt in urban systems and the impact this has on surface water concentrations the importance of surface water groundwater interactions on nitrate concentrations and loads in urban systems varied over space and time in the summer urban reaches that were disconnected from groundwater channelized and did not have surrounding riparian vegetation had very high nitrate removal which then decreased in winter as productivity declined ledford et al 2017 despite this high uptake these urbanized reaches were still net sources of nitrate loads downstream across all seasons beltran et al 2021 surface water groundwater interactions had minimal impact on nitrate in an urban stream with intact riparian buffers resulting in relatively constant concentrations and loads through time but shifts between a gaining and losing system over the year caused seasonal shifts in nitrate source vs sink behavior with an overall removal of nitrate mass in areas with high surface water groundwater interaction beltran et al 2021 ledford et al 2017 one area of nitrate sourcing to urban systems that was investigated by the lautz research group is the potential for legacy nitrate from cemeteries to drive high groundwater nitrate loads with an estimated 25 50 of nitrate load to a stream potentially coming from burial decay products lautz et al 2020 this work all highlights the importance of considering surface water groundwater interaction along with biological uptake when identifying sources and sinks of nitrate to urban streams work to understand the importance of heterogeneities in surface water groundwater interactions in urban systems continues this includes an increased interest in urban baseflow ledford et al 2020 and work that shows unlike for stormflow there is no uniform response to increased impervious surface cover on baseflow bhaskar et al 2020 along with work to understand how the quantity of water differs in urban systems the vital importance of understanding the long term impacts of road salt on northern streams and rivers continues kelly et al 2019 mazumder et al 2021 including work to understand impacts of climate change on future salt regimes gutchess et al 2018 nitrogen concentrations in urban streams remain enriched compared to less impacted systems journey et al 2018 mulholland et al 2008 and so research continues to work to understand sources transport and fate of nitrogen and the impacts that changes in surface water groundwater interactions have on urban stream nutrients 2 4 climate change and tropical glaciers the lautz research group s contributions to hydrology include an internationally collaborative component applying her expertise in surface water groundwater interactions to better understand shifting alpine water resources in a rapidly changing climate mark et al 2017 mountain glaciers are in rapid recession or disappearing worldwide due to climate change induced warming this causes a shift in the hydrologic cycle and water availability particularly in regions that depend on runoff from mountain glaciers for their dry season water supply viviroli et al 2011 during the late 2000s there was a general realization that surface runoff wasn t the sole source of proglacial water in mountain regions instead erosional and depositional geomorphic features in glaciated valleys formed unique and substantial groundwater systems in the tropical mountain valleys of peru baraer et al 2009 in the mid 2010s the lautz research group joined existing efforts by her collaborators to understand and characterize these systems and led the way toward an understanding of the interactions between these proglacial aquifers and valley streams between 2015 and 2019 lautz made multiple excursions to the cordillera blanca cb in the ancash region of peru with a diverse group of co investigators that included human geographers meteorologists hydrologists and geochemists from both peru and abroad during this time the lautz research group produced or contributed to nine published articles and eight graduate theses that characterized for the first time the mechanisms by which this groundwater resource was emerging to the surface and contributing to proglacial streams glas et al 2018 lautz and collaborators analyzed surface water and groundwater samples for ionic and isotopic composition using synoptic sampling across proglacial meadows and debris fans of the cb they used principal component analysis dilution gauging and stable isotopes to identify relative contributions to streamflow by moraines talus and proglacial alluvial fans at altitudes higher than 4000 m above sea level gordon et al 2015 lautz s team then used constant rate rhodamine dilution gauging and in stream temperature logging to model the stream energy balance in one of cb s principal proglacial valleys identifying artesian springs as the source for more than a third of dry season streamflow somers et al 2016 their later work in the qualcayhuanca valley of the cb provided important developments in stream energy balance modeling by defining the role of diurnally fluctuating temperature signals from glacial melt baker et al 2018 work by the lautz research group in this region also contributed to improvements in the use of thermal infrared imagery to locate groundwater inputs to valley streams and springs across the cb baker et al 2019 wigmore et al 2019 lautz later expanded her research toolkit and collaborative network to include the use of near surface geophysical methods to estimate the volumetric storage capacity of the cb s proglacial aquifer system her team collaborated with the u s geological survey hydrogeophysics branch and the instituto geofisico del peru https www igp gob pe to obtain and transport geophysical equipment to these remote alpine reaches using electrical resistivity tomography and both passive and active near surface seismic methods her team was able to confirm the hypothesis that buried talus deposits were forming confined aquifers with substantial storage capacity glas et al 2019b fig 6 estimates of layer thickness from these geophysical surveys were later used to parameterize a groundwater flow model and arrive at groundwater residence times of 6 months to 1 5 years in the quilcayhuanca aquifer baker 2019 short groundwater residence times underline the vulnerability of these alpine streams to glacial loss particularly for downstream communities during the driest months of the year lautz s work in the cb has allowed researchers to forecast water availability from alpine meadows under future climate scenarios underscoring the impermanence of this natural resource over the next century somers et al 2019 the collaborative work of the lautz team has expanded hydrologic understanding and applicability of field methods in glaciated alpine regions which are among the most rapidly changing hydrologic systems in modern times hayashi 2020 somers and mckenzie 2020 2 5 identifying contamination to private drinking wells conventionally sourced natural gas has been a common fossil fuel used across the globe but around 2005 the expansion of high volume hydraulic fracturing hvhf and horizontal drilling from unconventional sources such as the marcellus shale resulted in concerns around contamination of water sources from both migration up from the fracturing zones improper well sealing and the storage of flow back waters vidic et al 2013 in states above the marcellus shale especially pennsylvania hvhf was frequently blamed for methane and water quality contamination of drinking water wells jackson et al 2013 osborn et al 2011 boyer et al 2012 however the ability to clearly link issues around methane contamination or high salinity in extracted groundwater to hvhf was limited davies 2011 saba and orzechowski 2011 in part because there were not ample data around the natural variability of either before hvhf new york state placed a ban on hvhf although conventional wells did exist across the state lautz et al 2014 the lack of hvhf in new york allowed for the collection of pre fracturing or baseline groundwater quality data to assess for natural spatial and temporal variability in contamination from migration from appalachian basin brines and from conventional drilling including both salinity and methane contributions from lautz and collaborators to these issues focused on using statistical techniques to assess large scale databases and identify sources and patterns of contamination initial research involved building a discriminant analysis tool that utilized nine solutes in groundwater to statistically analyze if salinity was sourced from appalachian basin brine road salt septic effluent or animal waste lautz et al 2014 this fingerprinting tool highlighted the importance of measuring halogens including bromide chloride and iodide to differentiate salinity sources and was able to accurately assign salinity to an appalachian basin brine source 99 4 of the time showing its potential wider applicability to assessing salinity in locations with hvhf this statistical model was later applied to groundwater databases from outside of the marcellus shale area chien and lautz 2018 the model proved to be highly adaptable remaining over 80 accurate even with small datasets this work proved how a small but strong dataset that includes the chemistry of sources of contamination can be built to correctly identify contamination in other samples using measures of nine solutes a large database of groundwater sourced drinking water samples located over the marcellus shale in new york was compiled and the data were used to predict natural drivers of methane concentration a classification decision tree analysis found that high methane sources were more likely to occur in sodium rich waters from valleys and in wells that were screened in specific geologic units christian et al 2016 temporal sampling of natural methane variability across the same domestic wells highlighted natural changes in concentration as groundwater elevations shift throughout the year and different brine formations are pulled into the well campbell et al 2022 fig 7 this means single point in time baseline measurements which are the current norm for assessing for contamination after hvhf may not be representative this research highlights the inherent natural variability of baseline sources of saline groundwater across space and time which will potentially obfuscate linking contamination that is sourced from issues related to horizontal drilling or hvhf in locations where drilling is active the lautz research group provided a critical public service in developing the home well chemical database that identified expected indicators of contamination and in fingerprinting a range of potential sources of salinity in groundwater in addition to hydraulic fracturing activities 3 the ongoing impact of laura lautz as evidenced by the themes of her research published works of the lautz research group span the realms of physical hydrology biogeochemistry modeling statistics and computer programming fig 1 these papers continue to grow in influence and importance with time lautz s citations have grown in magnitude each year of

8549,satellite remote sensing data sar and ocean color merra 2 reanalysis and records at astrakhan meteorological station were used to investigate interannual variability of ice cover characteristics in the north caspian sea for 23 winter seasons november 1 april 15 from 1999 2000 to 2021 2022 the maximum annual ice cover area ice freeze onset and melt dates and ice cover duration were determined from satellite remote sensing data mostly sar instruments on board the european space agency s satellites ranging from ers 2 to the sentinel 1a 1b tandem we propose a new band combination for sentinel 2 msi and landsat 8 oli that allows better distinguishing ice cover from clouds or land than the standard rgb composites in the absence of sar data this method was used to estimate the above mentioned parameters with high spatial and temporal resolution to assess the severity of winters the criterion on the basis of the sum of freezing degree days sfdd was applied for this purpose we used values of daily minimum air temperature over the north caspian 44 46 47 14 n 46 70 52 90 e daily mean and daily minimum ones over its coldest eastern part with the western border at 50 e obtained from the merra 2 reanalysis as well as data from the meteorological station in astrakhan 46 35 n 48 07 e the resulting sfdd sequences show that until the winter of 2011 2012 there was a cooling trend on average with noticeable interannual variability whereas after that winter it changed to warming for astrakhan and virtually disappeared for the north caspian and its eastern part a noticeable interannual variability is also shown by the maximum ice area and the duration of the ice period both parameters with maximums in the winter of 2011 2012 we discuss in detail the correspondence between the sfdd

enclosed water body with an area of approximately 378 500 km2 located on the border of eastern europe and asia its length from north to south is more than 1030 km with a width ranging from about 200 to 400 km terziev et al 1992 kosarev 2005 nesterov 2016 taking into account the differences in physical and geographical conditions the bottom topography and the noticeable dependence of the sea surface temperature on latitude the sea is usually divided into the north the middle and the south caspian the border between the north and the middle caspian go along chechen island tyub karagan cape line and between the middle and the south caspian along zhiloy island kuuli cape line kosarev 1975 terziev et al 1992 kostianoy 2005 kosarev 2005 the north caspian is the shallowest the predominant and maximum depths are 4 4 m and 25 m respectively and the smallest part of the caspian sea about 90 100 km2 or 24 3 of the sea area nesterov 2016 water salinity in this part of the sea varies from 0 2 psu practical salinity units near the mouths of the volga and the ural rivers to 11 psu near the border with the middle caspian ice is observed every year in the north caspian in abnormally cold winters with northern winds floating ice drifting along the western coast of the middle caspian can reach as far as the apsheron peninsula where baku city is located at the border with the south caspian fig 1 shallow bays also freeze for example the turkmenbashi krasnovodsk bay at the eastern coast of the south caspian terziev et al 1992 in the 2000s ice near the apsheron peninsula and in the turkmenbashi and south cheleken bays was observed in the very severe winter of 2011 2012 lavrova et al 2019a the turkmenbashi bay also froze in the severe winter of 2007 2008 ginzburg et al 2012 kostianoy et al 2014 studies of the ice regime of the caspian sea began in the second half of the 19th early 20th centuries at coastal meteorological stations since the late 1920s observations of the state of ice cover in the north caspian have also been carried out by aerial reconnaissance and from expeditionary ships and since the late 1970s with the use of satellite information bukharitsin 1987 terziev et al 1992 in the 21st century the use of satellite information satellite altimetry synthetic aperture radar sar and radiometer data is an integral part of the research on the ice regime and its trends in connection with changing climatic conditions in the north caspian see for example kouraev et al 2003 2004 2011 maksimov 2018 lavrova et al 2019a sigitov et al 2019 ogorodov et al 2020 the relevance of such studies in addition to scientific interest is determined by national economic tasks fishing safety of winter navigation safety of technical infrastructure associated with oil and gas exploration production and transportation impact of hummock formations on the seabed and offshore oil and gas pipelines kostianoy et al 2016 the nature of ice conditions in each winter the change in the total ice cover during the ice season is determined by thermal and dynamic factors the predominant role is played by the thermal factor which causes during periods of sharp or prolonged cooling the spread of ice formation processes over the sea area as well as the weakening or destruction of the ice cover during intense and prolonged thaws the ice period in the north caspian lasts during moderate winters from november to march complete freezing and formation of fast ice usually occur north of the line of chechen island kulaly island in severe and very severe winters fast ice can extend to the isobaths of 20 m terziev et al 1992 bukharitsin et al 2015 the thickness of ice of thermal natural growth in the north caspian observed in january february even in very severe winters does not exceed 50 60 cm in the northwestern part and 80 90 cm in the northeastern part bukharitsin 2008 bolgov et al 2007 under the influence of dynamic factors wind waves currents sea level fluctuations in the second half of the ice season fast ice breaks up its area decreases and the area of floating ice increases the processes of ice layering and hummock formation occur also ice deformation can be observed even in the beginning of winter such as finger rafting of large nilas ice fields etc bukharitsin 1984 terziev et al 1992 dumanskaya 2014 a number of recent publications indicate changes in the characteristics of the ice regime in the north caspian that occurred in the period from the second half of the 20th century to the beginning of the 21st century and were associated with caspian sea warming these are a decrease in the number of very severe and severe winters and an increase in the number of mild ones bukharitsin 2008 dumanskaya 2014 ivkina et al 2017 yaitskaya and magaeva 2020 ogorodov et al 2020 ginzburg et al 2021 shifting ice formation towards later dates and ice decay towards earlier dates and accordingly reducing the duration of ice period kouraev et al 2004 2011 kostianoy et al 2014 dumanskaya 2014 yaitskaya and magaeva 2020 a reduction of ice cover area kouraev et al 2004 2011 kostianoy et al 2014 yaitskaya and magaeva 2020 ginzburg et al 2021 and decrease of ice thickness ivkina et al 2017 lobanov and naurozbayeva 2018 on the other hand there is evidence of a slowdown or absence of warming of the caspian sea and its northern part in the second decade of the 2000s the positive linear trend of air temperature over the caspian sea equal to 0 03 c year in the 41 year period 1980 2020 ginzburg et al 2021 turned out to be about half as much as previously estimated for the period 1979 2011 kostianoy et al 2014 the average annual sea surface temperature in the sea as a whole and in three its regions has not increased since the maximum of 2010 kazmin 2019 2021 showed that the average air temperature over the caspian sea with significant interannual variability changed in cycles with time intervals lasting 10 25 years a decrease in 1948 1968 then an increase in 1968 2002 and again a decrease until 2017 a negative trend in the average air temperature over the caspian sea in 2012 2016 was noted in krutov 2020 and lavrova et al 2019a showed that the trends in both air temperature over the north caspian and its surface temperature from july 2002 to july 2019 were slightly negative in connection with these changes in the air sea surface temperature of the caspian sea in the 2000s it is of interest to find out how ice cover area and duration ice freeze onset and melt dates winter severity and duration of negative temperature period have changed with the focus on the north caspian as a freezing region of the caspian sea the aims of the study covering the period from 1999 2000 to 2021 2022 are 1 to analyze sar and ocean color data in order to determine spatial distribution and calculate the annual maximum ice cover area 2 on the basis of satellite information to determine the annual freeze onset and melt dates and the duration of ice period 3 on the basis of atmospheric reanalysis model data and meteorological station records to calculate and analyze interannual variability of the sum of freezing degree days sfdd and sfdd derived winter severity 4 to determine the trends in the duration of negative temperature period 5 to estimate the maximum ice cover areas and determine how they depend on winter severity and the duration of negative temperature period 6 to compare our sea ice monitoring results with the known results for previous periods 2 material and methods the annual maximum area of ice cover in winter ice freeze onset date of first appearance of ice and melt dates date of last appearance of ice and ice cover duration were determined from satellite remote sensing data all available satellite data were used for daily monitoring of ice conditions in the north caspian during 1999 2000 2021 2022 fig 2 first of all the monitoring was based on synthetic aperture radar sar data from the european space agency esa satellite sensors whose main characteristics are presented in table 1 more detailed information on these sensors can be found on the website of these missions https earth esa int eogateway missions https sentinels copernicus eu web sentinel the choice of sar data for ice cover monitoring is determined by their independence from weather and sunlight conditions taking into account that overcast weather over the north caspian sea is observed from half to two thirds of the investigated period from 1 november to 15 april regular observations from space are possible only with the help of sars two sentinel 1 satellites were in orbit till december 2021 which allowed receiving sar data from the north caspian almost daily sentinel 1a is currently in orbit sentinel 1b after an anomaly experienced on 23 december 2021 lost its data transmission capability so that unfortunately the mission cannot be recovered sars emit microwave radiation toward the earth s surface and receive the reflected signal with the same antenna recording amplitude and phase jackson and apel 2004 the sar image represents the intensity of the reflected signal from the surface which is measured by the value of the backscatter coefficient the information obtained from sea ice sar data depends on the radar frequency polarization and incidence angle as well as the backscatter intensity of a given ice type which is influenced by the physical and dielectric properties of the ice dierking 2013 ulaby et al 1981 the polarization of the sar signal is an important parameter and different combinations are used to solve different problems the radar systems are designed to operate in horizontal h and vertical v planes as a transmitted signal depolarizes when reaching the earth surface a specific sar can operate in four different polarization combinations hh hv vh and vv the first letter refers to the transmitted signal while the second letter refers to the backscattered signal hh and vv signals are known as co polarized signals while hv and vh signals are known as cross polarized signals sano et al 2020 kostianoy and lavrova 2022 the dual polarization data can be used to differentiate between open water and sea ice geldsetzer and yackel 2009 johansson et al 2018 and are used by operational services around the world for this purpose since the northern coast of the north caspian is rather indented the coastal zone represents numerous shoals and small islands it is quite difficult to differentiate between sea ice and land especially in the periods of ice formation and melt although at cross polarization noise level is too high and ice and water have weak radar contrasts cross polarization is well suited to distinguish the coast edge co polarized radar data were used to identify ice cover location polynyas and ice free areas when simultaneous co polarized and cross polarized satellite radar data were available different combinations of these were used for more accurate interpretation distinguishing between land and ice ice and water sea surface manifestations of wind field variations in the near surface atmospheric layer and sea ice good results for sentinel 1 data were obtained for the following color composites red hh vv green hh vv blue hv vh or red hv vh green hh vv blue hv hh vh vv ice thickness cannot be directly determined from sar data but can only be approximated by ice development stage ice types determination of ice type and thickness was outside the scope of this study despite the fact that sar data have a clear advantage for ice monitoring they also have some disadvantages the first one is narrow swath width to determine the annual maximum of ice cover area it is necessary to compose a mosaic of several sar images which are sometimes obtained on different days the second is wind shadow areas near the shore in case of wind from the shore such areas have similar signatures in radar images as new ice also to improve the quality of sar data interpretation ocean color data listed in table 2 were used the modis viirs and olci sensors have large swath width covering the entire water area of the north caspian fig 1 in addition the surveys take place every day with a time difference of several hours in the case of partial cloudiness combining data acquired at different times of the same day one can minimize the cloudiness in order to determine the ice cover boundary more accurately the disadvantage of these data is low spatial resolution which leaves little chance to clearly distinguish areas of new ice landsat and sentinel 2 satellite data with high spatial resolution 10 30 m allow quite accurately detecting in absence of clouds areas of ice build up and melt as well as ice fractures polynyas open water etc their disadvantages are small swath width see table 2 and less than once a day survey frequency the revisit frequency is 2 3 days for the sentinel 2a b tandem and 16 days for landsat thus the use of multi sensor satellite data the availability of which over the years is presented in fig 2 provided high accuracy of the results achieved in this work each year of monitoring was supported with satellite data both radar and high and medium resolution ocean color data over the past five years data from 12 satellites were available on a continuous basis it should be emphasized that determining the annual maximum area of ice cover is possible only on the basis of satellite data processing and analyzing all these data required powerful and versatile software tools an information system called see the sea sts was developed at the space research institute of the russian academy of sciences with the purpose to aid in solving oceanographic problems using remote sensing data mityagina et al 2014 lavrova et al 2019b sts operates an archive of all available satellite data from the 1980s to the present day and offers a powerful and comprehensive toolkit for processing and thematic analysis of various data different in physical nature spatial resolution units of measurement and acquisition times as well as storing the obtained results sts enables product selection for ocean color data that is creating red green blue rgb composites from different band combinations suitable for example for distinguishing ice from clouds or ice from land fig 3 presents an example of different rgb composites demonstrating that sentinel 2 msi standard true color composite red 4 band 650 680 nm green 3 band 542 577 nm blue 2 band 456 523 nm does not allow for reliable identification of ice and distinguishing it from cloudiness or shore fig 3a the best result is achieved with the following bands red 12 2110 2280 nm green 8 785 900 nm blue 4 640 680 nm fig 3b for landsat 8 oli the following band combination is used red 7 2100 2290 nm green 5 850 880 nm blue 4 640 680 nm note that the msi bands are different in spatial resolution band 12 has a resolution of 20 m and bands 8 and 4 have a resolution of 10 m in sts however matching different spatial resolution data is made automatically an sts tool for water surface classification allows online compiling user maps using satellite data the standard problem of image classification that previously as a rule demanded specialized software is solved by the sts mapping interface both the unsupervised clustering and the supervised classification algorithms are integrated supervised classification suits best for ice type identification the user specifies an array of points assigned to different classes the result of classification is displayed in the browser window and the aggregate area of each class is automatically calculated this way we get the total area of ice cover excluding cracks polynyas areas of clear water and islands that may be 15 20 less than the area estimated on the basis of the outer ice edge length the sts classification tool is of particular value in the case of intense ice melt when ice cover is largely inhomogeneous with an abundance of scattered ice floes patches of open water etc fig 4 shows a supervised classification performed to identify ice types and estimate their aggregate areas in a landsat 7 etm image of 04 03 2001 different parameters are used to characterize the severity of winters in the north caspian and to identify trends in the ice cover with climate change ice cover area in km2 kosarev 1975 terziev et al 1992 kouraev et al 2004 2011 lavrova et al 2019a or as a percentage of the total region s area dumanskaya 2014 yaitskaya and magaeva 2020 ogorodov et al 2020 ginzburg et al 2021 dates of ice appearance and clearance duration of ice cover ice thickness the sum of freezing degree days sfdd terziev et al 1992 the long term variability of the maximum ice area and thickness in october march is in good agreement with the corresponding long term variability of the sfdd terziev et al 1992 therefore the sfdd as the most accessible parameter based on data from meteorological stations located in the coastal areas of the water area during the ice period is most often used to characterize the severity of winters for the purpose of this study the sfdd is defined as the sum of positive differences between 0 c and daily air temperature below 0 c and calculated over the whole freezing period of the year the sfdd unit of measurement is degree celsius to calculate the sfdd we will use not only daily mean air temperature as most authors do but sometimes also daily minimum air temperature when essential the distinction will be pointed out in the literature the sfdd is determined for different months of the ice period and according to data from different meteorological stations on the coast the criteria for the classification of winters by their severity are also different kosarev 1975 kosarev and tuzhilkin 2000 kosarev et al 2004 bukharitsin 2006 2008 bolgov et al 2007 dumanskaya 2014 ivkina et al 2017 lavrova et al 2019a yaitskaya and magaeva 2020 ogorodov et al 2020 a summary of data on anomalous winters warm and cold in the period from 1937 1938 to 1999 2000 based on information provided in kosarev 1975 terziev et al 1992 kouraev et al 2003 is given in ginzburg et al 2004 here to assess winter severity we use the same sfdd criteria as described by bukharitsin 2006 2008 bukharitsin et al 2015 bolgov et al 2007 and lavrova et al 2019a for astrakhan meteorological station 46 35 n 48 07 e and ivkina et al 2017 for peshnoy meteorological station 46 9 n 51 68 e very severe sfdd greater than 900 c severe 900 700 c moderate 700 400 c mild 400 100 c very mild 100 c note that air temperature over land and over sea can differ significantly in particular when ice begins to form in shallow waters and bays usually the temperature at coastal stations still remains positive for several days in contrast in the middle of winter the minimum temperatures recorded at coastal stations are never observed above the water surface therefore it can be assumed that sfdd estimates based on data from one meteorological station or averaged data from several meteorological stations on the north caspian coast may not always adequately reflect the seasonal and interannual variability of the ice cover in this regard it is useful to estimate annual sfdd over a given area of the sea surface of the north caspian and compare them with data of astrakhan meteorological station the station is located at a distance of 375 km from the north caspian northeast coast where the ice cover starts to form in winter fig 1 for this purpose we used air temperature produced with the giovanni online data system v 4 30 of the nasa goddard earth sciences data and information services center ges disc acker and leptoukh 2007 namely we used area averaged 2 meter air temperature daily mean and daily minimum of merra 2 model m2sdnxslv v5 12 4 with spatial resolution 0 5 0 625 for the time period from 1 november to 15 april for 1999 2000 to 2021 2022 winter seasons m2sdnxslv is a 2 dimensional daily dataset in modern era retrospective analysis for research and applications version 2 merra 2 this dataset in particular consists of daily statistics such as daily mean or daily minimum and maximum air temperature at 2 meter merra 2 is the latest version of global atmospheric reanalysis for the satellite era produced by nasa global modeling and assimilation office gmao using the goddard earth observing system model geos version 5 12 4 the dataset covers the period of 1980 present with the latency of 3 weeks after the end of a month https disc gsfc nasa gov datasets m2sdnxslv 5 12 4 summary merra 2 as well as its predecessor merra is known to realistically represent different climate variables over the ocean and continents this can be attributed to the rich data assimilation input high spatial resolution which is important for realistic simulation of the regional weather and climate patterns also being non spectral nasa merra model may be better capable of simulating interaction of the atmospheric flow with the orography for instance bosilovich 2013 demonstrated good merra skills in representation of precipitation and temperatures over the american continent also schubert et al 2022 have shown that merra 2 is highly skillful in representing extreme temperature regimes over the northern hemisphere tilinina et al 2013 demonstrated that merra is superior in representing northern hemisphere cyclone activity particularly in the atlantic eurasian sector bentamy et al 2017 demonstrated that merra is well depicting statistical properties of air sea turbulent fluxes over the ocean luo et al 2020 demonstrated that merra 2 reproduces well sea surface temperature atmospheric temperature and humidity over the atlantic ocean this was proved through comparisons with independent marine atmospheric emitted radiance interferometer m aeri and radiosonde data from the aerosols and ocean science expeditions aerose cruises since the climate and ice conditions are very different in the eastern and western parts of the north caspian we performed a joint analysis of three types of air temperature data for each winter period 1 data obtained from the merra 2 m2sdnxslv v5 12 4 model for the entire north caspian 2 the same separately for the eastern part of the north caspian with the western limit at 50 e and 3 data from astrakhan meteorological station we bounded the north caspian by the following limits 44 46 47 14 n 46 70 52 90 e 3 results to determine winter climate changes for the period from 1999 2000 to 2021 2022 we used the following parameters dates of transition through 0 c of the near surface layer of atmosphere either to negative or positive temperatures ice freeze onset and melt dates ice cover area the sfdd 3 1 sum of freezing degree days the following data were used to determine the sfdd in the three selected areas 1 daily mean and daily minimum air temperatures at a height of 2 m over the eastern north caspian 2 daily minimum air temperatures over the entire north caspian both of these data arrays were determined with merra 2 and 3 daily air temperatures at astrakhan meteorological station the resulting sequences of the sfdd for the three study sites are shown in fig 5 one can see that the character of the four curves in fig 5 is largely the same until the winter of 2011 2012 there is a cooling trend in the sfdd on average with noticeable interannual variability while after this winter it is either warming for astrakhan or practically absent the cold and warm peaks of the curves are observed mainly in the same years but there are also notable differences until the winter of 2011 2012 the astrakhan sfdd is in most cases higher i e the winters are colder than over the eastern north caspian this may be due to the fact that in cold winters air over land cools more than over water thus the minimum air temperature recorded on february 8 2012 at the meteorological station in astrakhan is 31 5 c while the air temperature over the eastern part of the north caspian does not drop below 18 6 c february 4 2012 throughout that winter the sfdd over the entire north caspian which includes relatively warmer waters of the western north caspian is lower i e the air is warmer for all winters except 2004 2005 however since the winter of 2011 2012 the picture has changed the sfdd over the eastern part of the north caspian gets to exceed that at the meteorological station in astrakhan the air becomes relatively colder and the range of interannual fluctuations of the sfdd over the north caspian increases markedly in addition in the sfdd sequence for the eastern part of the north caspian the distinctly warm winter of 2003 2004 and the cold winter of 2002 2003 for daily mean data do not appear whereas the cold peaks of 2014 2015 2016 2017 and especially 2020 2021 exceed the peak of 2011 2012 note that these anomalously warm cold winters appear on the curve for astrakhan in fig 5 and in the data of well known publications on winter severity in the north caspian bukharitsin et al 2015 ivkina et al 2017 nepomenko et al 2019 tatarnikov et al 2020 ginzburg et al 2021 according to these publications the winter of 2011 2012 was the coldest in the north caspian from astrakhan and peshnoy meteorological stations data in the period 1999 2020 it can be assumed that such difference in the manifestation of anomalous winters in the data of the astrakhan meteorological station and in the merra 2 data for the north caspian is associated with a restructuring of the atmospheric circulation since the 2011 2012 winter which made the eastern north caspian colder than the astrakhan region this fact seems to be proved independently by satellite data which shows a general increase in the ice cover area till winter of 2011 2012 and a subsequent decrease of the ice cover area see section 3 4 3 2 winter severity let us compare the character of winters over the 23 year period in the eastern north caspian and in astrakhan on the basis of the sfdd obtained fig 5 and using the above winter severity criteria table 3 in the table the winters in bold are those that fall into the same gradation of winter severity for both regions as can be seen there are 9 such matches in the mild winter gradation for moderate winters there are 5 matches only one winter 2020 2021 is graded as severe in both regions and we see no matches in the very severe winter grade as noted above in february 2012 there were no such extremely low air temperatures over the sea as were recorded at astrakhan meteorological station from merra 2 2 m altitude air temperature data for the period from 1999 2000 to 2021 2022 we derive the following winter severity breakdown very mild 0 severe 4 3 only one winter 2020 2021 moderate 39 1 and mild 56 6 no very mild winters were observed meanwhile from the astrakhan weather station data we get very severe 4 3 only one winter 2011 2012 severe 17 5 moderate 39 1 mild 39 1 and no very mild winters as well fig 6 thus compared to merra 2 marine air temperature data coastal astrakhan data show more severe and very severe winters less mild ones and the same number of moderate winters the discrepancy can be explained by the distance of several hundred km between the locations and different data sources i e meteorological records and modeling as for the whole north caspian the following winter severity percentages are obtained severe 4 5 winter of 2020 2021 moderate 54 6 mild 40 9 no very severe and very mild winters are observed in the study period thus the share of moderate winters is the highest in all three regions of interest is the nature of the change in air temperature over the north caspian and its eastern part in the period from november 1 1999 to november 1 2021 the time series of air temperature over the eastern north caspian reveals no significant trend fig 7a whereas over the entire north caspian the trend is slightly positive 0 05 c year fig 7b since 2011 the annual temperature amplitude has been increasing with summer maximums exceeding 32 c july 2021 and winter minimums nearly reaching 26 c february 2021 such an amplitude 58 c was never observed from 1999 to 2014 both figures show that year to year variability of summer temperature varies in the range of several degrees while winter temperature may vary in the range of 10 c and even more this causes a significant year to year variability in the sea ice cover area and duration see sections 3 3 and 3 4 3 3 ice cover duration the interannual variability in winter severity also determines the interannual variability in the dates of ice appearance clearance freeze onset melt dates ice period duration and ice thickness the ice period duration was determined from the satellite images as the number of days between the first and the last appearances of sea surface ice in the data for this purpose mostly radar data were used because they do not depend on cloud cover and have a resolution of 10 m for the winters of 2012 2013 and 2013 2014 ocean color data were used in the absence of radar data between the end of the envisat mission in april 2012 and the launch of sentinel 1a in april 2014 due to certain local peculiarities the timing of ice formation in the north caspian is rather irregular there are caucasus mountains on the west of the region and deserts of central asia on the east in general the western north caspian is characterized by a milder climate with higher average winter temperatures as compared to the eastern part where climate is much more continental persisting north and northeast winds bring a strong cooling of the air with temperatures 10 15 c below zero in december and minus 25 30 c on the coast in january sea ice always appears earlier in the east which is evidenced by the differences in onset times of the same ice phases and ice development patterns in neighboring regions at close latitudes bolgov et al 2007 in the east ice is observed every year while in the west there may be no ice and snow at all in mild winters usually ice freezing begins in the east in early november then ice spreads over the northern part and in early january it can be observed in the open sea as far as the shallow water edge spanning from the chechen island to the tyuleniy seal islands and further to the tyub karagan peninsula fig 1 further spreading to the south however proceeds much slower as heat exchange with the warm masses of deep waters is more intense in the study period ice freezing began in november with the exception of 7 winters when it started in early december 2005 2006 2008 2009 2009 2010 2010 2011 2012 2013 2013 2014 and 2015 2016 table 4 melting of ice starts in the western part of the north caspian and as a rule no ice is found there by the beginning of march ice melts slower in the north than in the east where water is the shallowest in the region in the beginning of april small ice fields are sometimes still observed at the northern coast between 50 20 and 52 60 n north off tyuleniy seal islands where water warms up slowly the latest ice presence date is 16 april 2012 table 4 the sea ice duration graph is shown in fig 8 the longest ice period was observed during the severe winter of 2011 2012 it reached 163 days from 17 11 2011 to 16 04 2012 the shortest ice period lasted only 86 days and occurred in the mild winter of 2015 2016 the average ice duration in the north caspian is 124 days after the winter of 2011 2012 similar to air temperature figure 7 strong variations in ice duration are observed 3 4 annual maximum area of ice cover the annual maximum area of ice cover was also determined from satellite data first of all obtained with terra aqua modis sensor modis data has a resolution of 250 500 m and one scene covers the whole water area of the north caspian in cases where modis images were contaminated with clouds a mosaic of sentinel 1a b sar c radar images were used given that the eastern north caspian freezes every year the annual maximum total ice cover area depends on the ice extent in the western north caspian there is no significant correlation between sea ice duration and annual maximum of ice cover area for the winter of 2013 2014 there is no correlation at all this may be explained by the absence of sar data at that time see fig 2 table 1 when in conditions of autumn cloudiness the start of ice formation and consequently ice period duration could be determined inaccurately meanwhile from table 4 one can see a better correlation between sea ice duration and duration of the period with negative air temperature the greatest correlation throughout the period under consideration is observed between the maximums minimums of the ice cover area and the sfdd for the eastern north caspian with the exception of the winters of 2001 2002 and 2014 2015 although the negative trend in the ice cover area after the winter of 2011 2012 is more consistent with that for the sfdd for astrakhan figs 9 10 a possible explanation is obvious the lower the air temperature the greater is the frozen area of the sea surface the maximum recorded ice cover area is 103 5 thous km2 it was observed in the severe winter of 2011 2012 when the entire north caspian was frozen during that winter ice also formed along the western coast of the middle caspian as far south as the absheron peninsula and even in the shallow bays of turkmenbashi krasnovodsk and south cheleken of the south caspian lavrova et al 2019a it should be noted that presence of ice in the middle and even in the south caspian is not really unique this occurs practically every severe and in some moderate winters for example during a moderate and even mild according to the astrakhan meteorological station winter of 2004 2005 in february 2005 ice spread along the western coast of the middle caspian to the absheron peninsula and during the winter of 2013 2014 the bays of turkmenbashi krasnovodsk and south cheleken of the south caspian were covered with ice for a week however ice in the middle and south caspian is not usually observed for more than 7 10 days the smallest annual maximum ice cover area was recorded in 2019 2020 it was only 36 thous km2 the 23 year average annual maximum ice cover area is 73 4 thous km2 as a rule the maximum ice coverage is reached in january february in 2012 the maximum ice area was observed in early march but in the winter of 2011 2012 ice freeze onset was also late in early december 4 discussion due to different climate conditions in the north caspian the coldest is its northeastern part the sfdd at different points on the coast can differ markedly and accordingly the severity of a particular winter can be estimated differently under the same severity criteria for example according to yaitskaya and magaeva 2020 the winter of 1913 1914 was the mildest in astrakhan and atyrau the winter of 2003 2004 at tyuleniy and the winter of 1965 1966 at fort shevchenko winter of 1998 1999 in lavrova et al 2019a refers to mild winters whereas in ivkina et al 2017 to moderate ones in addition a comparative analysis of the severity of winters of the same gradation in the 21st and 20th centuries in lobanov and naurozbaeva 2021 indicates a decrease in the severity of winters in the 21st century for example in the very severe winter of 1953 1954 the sfdds in atyrau and makhachkala were 1317 c and 447 c respectively whereas in the very severe winter of 2011 2012 by astrakhan data they were 699 c and 174 c respectively the same conclusion was made by dumanskaya 2018 over the 132 year period the decrease of the sfdd in astrakhan occurred at an average rate of 2 c year however this discrepancy does not affect the conclusions of various authors about the change in the nature of winters in different time intervals indicating corresponding climate change in the north caspian it follows from many works bukharitsin et al 2015 dumanskaya 2014 ivkina et al 2017 nepomenko et al 2019 yaitskaya and magaeva 2020 ogorodov et al 2020 tatarnikov et al 2020 etc that in the 21st century compared to the 20th century the number of very severe and severe winters has decreased while the number of mild winters has increased this is reflected in the table 5 that we compiled from the data of these works and the results of our study it should be noted that the assignment of a particular winter to a certain gradation depends on the criterion used some authors bukharitsin 2006 2008 2015 ivkina et al 2017 use the criterion specified in table 3 dumanskaya 2014 nepomenko et al 2019 and tatarnikov et al 2020 use the sfdd criterion developed by dumanskaya mild 265 c moderate 265 640 c severe 640 c other use their own custom criteria ogorodov et al 2020 yaitskaya and magaeva 2020 the dependence of winter severity on the criterion used can be demonstrated on the data for the eastern north caspian merra 2 mean in table 5 recalculating the corresponding sfdds from fig 5 using the dumanskaya criterion one gets the inverse ratio of the number of mild and moderate winters mild winters 8 34 8 moderate 14 60 9 table 5 our analysis of the air temperature over the north caspian sea derived from merra 2 data for the period 1999 2000 2021 2022 shows neither a decrease in the number of severe winters nor an increase in the number of mild ones only a weak positive trend in the long term air temperature data over the north caspian sea is determined although over this period air temperature did not reach the minimum that was recorded in atyrau in 1954 37 4 c but in astrakhan in 2012 the temperature fell close to the record minimum of 31 5 c the percentage of severe winters obtained in our study 21 7 see fig 5 for daily mean values agrees well with that obtained in the longest 167 year observation period in astrakhan 1845 1846 2011 2012 22 dumanskaya 2014 we noted that since 2011 there have been very sharp interannual fluctuations with large amplitude in our sfdd values figs 5 10 our data cover a relatively short period of time 23 years in the 21st century it is characterized by a cooling phase on average from 1999 2000 to 2011 2012 followed by a warming phase from astrakhan data analysis or stagnation on average with cold winters in 2014 2015 2016 2017 and especially 2020 2021 in the northeastern region and in the entire north caspian fig 5 based on remote sensing data from 1978 1979 to 2001 2002 kouraev et al 2004 showed that no noticeable trend was found in the beginning of the ice period in either the western or eastern parts of the north caspian however a decreasing trend was found in the duration of the ice period and the area of ice cover since the winter of 1993 1994 analysis of the interannual variability of ice cover area and ice duration in the north caspian for the period 1978 2007 kouraev et al 2011 kostianoy et al 2014 showed a positive trend in both in the first half of the 1980s then until 2007 a warming stage was observed on average note that estimates of maximum ice cover areas can vary considerably depending on the dataset used this is evident for example for the winters from 1998 1999 to 2006 2007 from available literature e g kouraev et al 2011 and our own observations we base our study on all available data from satellite radar and ocean color sensors and compare changes in the ice cover areas in different periods rather than the absolute values of these areas the absence of a clear correlation between the duration of the ice period and sddf which is caused by the alternation of periods of ice formation and its melting during sharp changes in air temperature was demonstrated in lavrova et al 2019a such a correlation was observed only in the mild winter of 2015 2016 the harsh winter of 2002 2003 and the very severe winter of 2011 2012 yaitskaya and magaeva 2020 showed a reduction in the number of severe winters and an increase in the number of mild ones in the second half of the 20th century the beginning of the 21st century the ice cover in severe winters is on average about 76 of the total area of the north caspian in moderate winters about 65 in mild ones about 47 with an average long term value for the period 1940 2015 equal to 57 the average duration of the ice season is 81 and 124 days for the meteorological stations kulaly and peshnoy respectively for more than half a century it has decreased by 16 days at the peshnoy meteorological station and by 6 days at astrakhan the average long term ice coverage in the north caspian in the period 1940 2019 according to ogorodov et al 2020 is 57 with interannual changes from 30 to 85 in the winters of 1999 2000 and 1953 1954 respectively average annual ice cover of 57 in the period 1961 1990 decreased to 50 in 1981 2010 ogorodov et al 2020 significant interannual changes in ice cover area in winters from 1998 1999 to 2018 2019 from a minimum value of approximately 44 000 km2 during the mild winter of 1999 2000 up to a maximum of 90 000 km2 during the very severe winter of 2011 2012 were demonstrated in lavrova et al 2019a for comparison in the most severe winter in february 1954 ice cover reached 103 516 km2 terziev et al 1992 the use of high spatial resolution satellite data allowed us to estimate more accurately the duration of ice period and dates of ice freeze onset and melt in the north caspian as compared to the estimates of other authors we found that on average the ice period duration was on the increase until 2012 and on the decrease after that with noticeable interannual variability figs 8 10 the best correspondence between the duration of the ice period maximums and minimums and the sfdd is observed for the winter of 2011 2012 while for example a rather long ice period corresponds to the mild winter of 2003 2004 128 days table 4 the longest period with air temperature below 0 c november 6 march 29 table 4 and the longest ice period 163 days table 4 correspond to the cold winter of 2011 2012 the shortest ice period 86 days table 4 corresponds to the warm winter of 2015 2016 these ice period estimates are in good agreement with ivkina et al 2017 setting aside these anomalous ice periods the average ice duration in the 21st century decreased from 124 days in the first decade to 120 days in the second decade as for the maximum area of the ice cover this parameter can be determined correctly only from satellite data as follows from figs 9 10 and table 4 on average the ice area increases during the cooling phase until 2012 and decreases with noticeable interannual variability further until 2022 the extremums of maximum ice area are generally consistent with those of the sfdd better correspondence with the sfdd for astrakhan the eastern north caspian freezes almost every year though in some winters such as in the mild winter of 2019 2020 with large areas of open water in the 21st century the average maximum ice cover area has decreased from 75 4 thous sq km in the first decade to 71 3 thous sq km in the second decade thus all recent studies indicate a trend towards a decrease in the sfdd warming in the north caspian a decrease in the thickness of ice the area of ice cover and the duration of the ice season a shift in the onset of ice formation towards later dates and ice clearance towards earlier dates considering our results for the relatively small 23 years but recent period 1999 2000 2021 2022 we cannot conclude that there is a shift of the onset of ice freezing towards later dates and ice clearance towards earlier dates table 4 5 conclusions satellite sar and ocean color data were used to study the interannual variability of ice cover of the caspian sea from 1999 to 2022 available satellite data of high and medium spatial resolution allowed determining with great accuracy the dates of ice freeze onset and melt in the north caspian sea ice period duration and maximum ice area in each winter we have found a strong interannual variability of these parameters especially after 2012 with growing amplitude of fluctuations being more accurate compared to optical imagery satellite sar instruments provide daily data coverage including cloudy days with data that enable discrimination between sea ice water and shallow areas high resolution optical images were used to fill gaps between consecutive sar images a new combination of optical bands was tested and applied to correctly detect ice on the sea surface the use of sar imagery and other satellite information allowed us to accurately estimate the annual maximum ice cover as well as to determine the dates of first appearance and last occurrence of ice in the region using high resolution sar data we were able to show that in the 23 year study period there was neither a shift to later dates of ice freezing nor a shift to earlier dates of ice melting see table 4 as some authors stated earlier we do not exclude that such shifts occurred in the 20th century though it is difficult to evaluate in the absence of satellite data of high spatial resolution for that period we found that the longest ice cover period was in 2011 2012 163 days and the shortest one in 2015 2016 86 days the average duration of ice cover during the study period was 124 days heterogeneity of the ice cover the presence of polynyas areas of open water and separate ice fields make an accurate determination of the ice cover a difficult task in our study we used the see the sea information system which allows a clear recognition of such features as ice land and water and determining the area of each the maximum ice coverage for the study period was observed in the winter of 2011 2012 and it was equal to 103 5 thous km2 the minimum annual ice coverage was in the winter of 2019 2020 and it was only 36 thous km2 the average annual ice cover area during the 23 year period was 72 thous km2 our results confirm the conclusions of other authors that the maximum annual area of the ice cover is slowly decreasing but solely due to the ice in the western part of the north caspian the eastern north caspian freezes almost every year but in some years such as 2019 2020 with large areas of open water in the literature winters are usually classified by severity into very severe severe moderate and mild based on sdff the latter is the stumbling point because different authors obtain daily air temperature from different locations and for different time periods months to calculate the sfdd in particular most of the authors use data from astrakhan meteorological station located at the beginning of the volga river delta at a distance of 375 km from the northeastern coast of the north caspian where the ice cover starts to form it would seem that these data are unlikely to adequately reflect seasonal and interannual variability of the caspian ice cover in the present study for the first time we used merra 2 atmospheric reanalysis data obtained specifically over the north caspian sea and separately over its eastern part located to the east of 50 e merra 2 dates of transition to negative temperatures completely correspond to ice freeze onset dates derived from the satellite data the major outcome of our study is the established high correlation between ice cover area in the north caspian sea and winter severity evaluated specifically for the eastern north caspian for the period from 2015 onwards when data from 12 satellite sensors became simultaneously available the datasets of different spectral range and spatial resolution complement each other and allow deriving more accurate information on sea ice cover as concerns the data from ground meteorological stations they can be used to calculate the sfdd and make ice cover comparisons only if obtained from meteorological stations located specifically in the northeastern part of the north caspian like atyrau peshnoy etc nevertheless the interannual variabilities of the sfdd calculated from different data seem to be similar if we don t pay attention to absolute values with the same peaks in certain years regardless the variety of approaches to the determination of sfdd and winter severity there is a general agreement among the researchers which is confirmed by our work that moderate and mild winters prevail one of the most important issues arises when we compare the values of the sfdd and ice cover area and duration sometimes the maximum and minimum peaks in the sfdd do not correspond to the relative peaks of ice cover area and duration sometimes the sfdd peaks of a certain level correspond to different values of ice cover area and duration in different years we suggest that the reason lies in the fact that we as well as all other authors compare ice cover variations only with air temperature factor whereas there are many other important sea and atmosphere factors that can seriously impact the ice regime in the north caspian wind speed and direction and wave height and direction can influence the timing of sea ice as well as its spatial distribution and concentration a significant decrease of the caspian sea level by about 2 m since 1995 ginzburg et al 2021 observed in the shallow north caspian can significantly impact heat capacity of the water column as well as air sea heat exchange and cooling of the surface water till freezing point regional climate change which includes wind forcing serykh and kostianoy 2020 can increase or decrease mass and heat exchange between the warmer middle and the colder north caspian sea due to changes in the intensity of currents the north caspian is the most brackish part of the caspian sea with lowest values of salinity which varies from 0 2 to 11 psu this is the result of the volga and ural rivers runoff to the north caspian thus from year to year the variations in runoff and relative changes in water salinity can seriously impact the freezing point also the heat content of the water column collected during previous to freezing months was never estimated and used as a parameter which may have an impact on the appearance of ice to the above list of factors we can add changes in solar irradiance cloud cover atmospheric precipitation rain snow evaporation humidity etc all these factors which require special attention and research can significantly impact the relationship between the sfdd and the ice cover finally even if a robust correspondence between the sfdd and ice cover regime is established there is still an acute problem of forecasting the ice cover area and duration at least several months before the appearance of ice in the north caspian sea this is a very important issue for well developed offshore oil and gas industry in kazakhstan and russia which includes oil platforms and pipelines as well as ship transportation kostianoy et al 2016 nepomenko et al 2019 and an important task for future research funding this research was funded by

8549,satellite remote sensing data sar and ocean color merra 2 reanalysis and records at astrakhan meteorological station were used to investigate interannual variability of ice cover characteristics in the north caspian sea for 23 winter seasons november 1 april 15 from 1999 2000 to 2021 2022 the maximum annual ice cover area ice freeze onset and melt dates and ice cover duration were determined from satellite remote sensing data mostly sar instruments on board the european space agency s satellites ranging from ers 2 to the sentinel 1a 1b tandem we propose a new band combination for sentinel 2 msi and landsat 8 oli that allows better distinguishing ice cover from clouds or land than the standard rgb composites in the absence of sar data this method was used to estimate the above mentioned parameters with high spatial and temporal resolution to assess the severity of winters the criterion on the basis of the sum of freezing degree days sfdd was applied for this purpose we used values of daily minimum air temperature over the north caspian 44 46 47 14 n 46 70 52 90 e daily mean and daily minimum ones over its coldest eastern part with the western border at 50 e obtained from the merra 2 reanalysis as well as data from the meteorological station in astrakhan 46 35 n 48 07 e the resulting sfdd sequences show that until the winter of 2011 2012 there was a cooling trend on average with noticeable interannual variability whereas after that winter it changed to warming for astrakhan and virtually disappeared for the north caspian and its eastern part a noticeable interannual variability is also shown by the maximum ice area and the duration of the ice period both parameters with maximums in the winter of 2011 2012 we discuss in detail the correspondence between the sfdd and ice cover characteristics variations as well as previously published results in agreement with the other authors we find that in the 21st century compared to the 20th century the number of very

enclosed water body with an area of approximately 378 500 km2 located on the border of eastern europe and asia its length from north to south is more than 1030 km with a width ranging from about 200 to 400 km terziev et al 1992 kosarev 2005 nesterov 2016 taking into account the differences in physical and geographical conditions the bottom topography and the noticeable dependence of the sea surface temperature on latitude the sea is usually divided into the north the middle and the south caspian the border between the north and the middle caspian go along chechen island tyub karagan cape line and between the middle and the south caspian along zhiloy island kuuli cape line kosarev 1975 terziev et al 1992 kostianoy 2005 kosarev 2005 the north caspian is the shallowest the predominant and maximum depths are 4 4 m and 25 m respectively and the smallest part of the caspian sea about 90 100 km2 or 24 3 of the sea area nesterov 2016 water salinity in this part of the sea varies from 0 2 psu practical salinity units near the mouths of the volga and the ural rivers to 11 psu near the border with the middle caspian ice is observed every year in the north caspian in abnormally cold winters with northern winds floating ice drifting along the western coast of the middle caspian can reach as far as the apsheron peninsula where baku city is located at the border with the south caspian fig 1 shallow bays also freeze for example the turkmenbashi krasnovodsk bay at the eastern coast of the south caspian terziev et al 1992 in the 2000s ice near the apsheron peninsula and in the turkmenbashi and south cheleken bays was observed in the very severe winter of 2011 2012 lavrova et al 2019a the turkmenbashi bay also froze in the severe winter of 2007 2008 ginzburg et al 2012 kostianoy et al 2014 studies of the ice regime of the caspian sea began in the second half of the 19th early 20th centuries at coastal meteorological stations since the late 1920s observations of the state of ice cover in the north caspian have also been carried out by aerial reconnaissance and from expeditionary ships and since the late 1970s with the use of satellite information bukharitsin 1987 terziev et al 1992 in the 21st century the use of satellite information satellite altimetry synthetic aperture radar sar and radiometer data is an integral part of the research on the ice regime and its trends in connection with changing climatic conditions in the north caspian see for example kouraev et al 2003 2004 2011 maksimov 2018 lavrova et al 2019a sigitov et al 2019 ogorodov et al 2020 the relevance of such studies in addition to scientific interest is determined by national economic tasks fishing safety of winter navigation safety of technical infrastructure associated with oil and gas exploration production and transportation impact of hummock formations on the seabed and offshore oil and gas pipelines kostianoy et al 2016 the nature of ice conditions in each winter the change in the total ice cover during the ice season is determined by thermal and dynamic factors the predominant role is played by the thermal factor which causes during periods of sharp or prolonged cooling the spread of ice formation processes over the sea area as well as the weakening or destruction of the ice cover during intense and prolonged thaws the ice period in the north caspian lasts during moderate winters from november to march complete freezing and formation of fast ice usually occur north of the line of chechen island kulaly island in severe and very severe winters fast ice can extend to the isobaths of 20 m terziev et al 1992 bukharitsin et al 2015 the thickness of ice of thermal natural growth in the north caspian observed in january february even in very severe winters does not exceed 50 60 cm in the northwestern part and 80 90 cm in the northeastern part bukharitsin 2008 bolgov et al 2007 under the influence of dynamic factors wind waves currents sea level fluctuations in the second half of the ice season fast ice breaks up its area decreases and the area of floating ice increases the processes of ice layering and hummock formation occur also ice deformation can be observed even in the beginning of winter such as finger rafting of large nilas ice fields etc bukharitsin 1984 terziev et al 1992 dumanskaya 2014 a number of recent publications indicate changes in the characteristics of the ice regime in the north caspian that occurred in the period from the second half of the 20th century to the beginning of the 21st century and were associated with caspian sea warming these are a decrease in the number of very severe and severe winters and an increase in the number of mild ones bukharitsin 2008 dumanskaya 2014 ivkina et al 2017 yaitskaya and magaeva 2020 ogorodov et al 2020 ginzburg et al 2021 shifting ice formation towards later dates and ice decay towards earlier dates and accordingly reducing the duration of ice period kouraev et al 2004 2011 kostianoy et al 2014 dumanskaya 2014 yaitskaya and magaeva 2020 a reduction of ice cover area kouraev et al 2004 2011 kostianoy et al 2014 yaitskaya and magaeva 2020 ginzburg et al 2021 and decrease of ice thickness ivkina et al 2017 lobanov and naurozbayeva 2018 on the other hand there is evidence of a slowdown or absence of warming of the caspian sea and its northern part in the second decade of the 2000s the positive linear trend of air temperature over the caspian sea equal to 0 03 c year in the 41 year period 1980 2020 ginzburg et al 2021 turned out to be about half as much as previously estimated for the period 1979 2011 kostianoy et al 2014 the average annual sea surface temperature in the sea as a whole and in three its regions has not increased since the maximum of 2010 kazmin 2019 2021 showed that the average air temperature over the caspian sea with significant interannual variability changed in cycles with time intervals lasting 10 25 years a decrease in 1948 1968 then an increase in 1968 2002 and again a decrease until 2017 a negative trend in the average air temperature over the caspian sea in 2012 2016 was noted in krutov 2020 and lavrova et al 2019a showed that the trends in both air temperature over the north caspian and its surface temperature from july 2002 to july 2019 were slightly negative in connection with these changes in the air sea surface temperature of the caspian sea in the 2000s it is of interest to find out how ice cover area and duration ice freeze onset and melt dates winter severity and duration of negative temperature period have changed with the focus on the north caspian as a freezing region of the caspian sea the aims of the study covering the period from 1999 2000 to 2021 2022 are 1 to analyze sar and ocean color data in order to determine spatial distribution and calculate the annual maximum ice cover area 2 on the basis of satellite information to determine the annual freeze onset and melt dates and the duration of ice period 3 on the basis of atmospheric reanalysis model data and meteorological station records to calculate and analyze interannual variability of the sum of freezing degree days sfdd and sfdd derived winter severity 4 to determine the trends in the duration of negative temperature period 5 to estimate the maximum ice cover areas and determine how they depend on winter severity and the duration of negative temperature period 6 to compare our sea ice monitoring results with the known results for previous periods 2 material and methods the annual maximum area of ice cover in winter ice freeze onset date of first appearance of ice and melt dates date of last appearance of ice and ice cover duration were determined from satellite remote sensing data all available satellite data were used for daily monitoring of ice conditions in the north caspian during 1999 2000 2021 2022 fig 2 first of all the monitoring was based on synthetic aperture radar sar data from the european space agency esa satellite sensors whose main characteristics are presented in table 1 more detailed information on these sensors can be found on the website of these missions https earth esa int eogateway missions https sentinels copernicus eu web sentinel the choice of sar data for ice cover monitoring is determined by their independence from weather and sunlight conditions taking into account that overcast weather over the north caspian sea is observed from half to two thirds of the investigated period from 1 november to 15 april regular observations from space are possible only with the help of sars two sentinel 1 satellites were in orbit till december 2021 which allowed receiving sar data from the north caspian almost daily sentinel 1a is currently in orbit sentinel 1b after an anomaly experienced on 23 december 2021 lost its data transmission capability so that unfortunately the mission cannot be recovered sars emit microwave radiation toward the earth s surface and receive the reflected signal with the same antenna recording amplitude and phase jackson and apel 2004 the sar image represents the intensity of the reflected signal from the surface which is measured by the value of the backscatter coefficient the information obtained from sea ice sar data depends on the radar frequency polarization and incidence angle as well as the backscatter intensity of a given ice type which is influenced by the physical and dielectric properties of the ice dierking 2013 ulaby et al 1981 the polarization of the sar signal is an important parameter and different combinations are used to solve different problems the radar systems are designed to operate in horizontal h and vertical v planes as a transmitted signal depolarizes when reaching the earth surface a specific sar can operate in four different polarization combinations hh hv vh and vv the first letter refers to the transmitted signal while the second letter refers to the backscattered signal hh and vv signals are known as co polarized signals while hv and vh signals are known as cross polarized signals sano et al 2020 kostianoy and lavrova 2022 the dual polarization data can be used to differentiate between open water and sea ice geldsetzer and yackel 2009 johansson et al 2018 and are used by operational services around the world for this purpose since the northern coast of the north caspian is rather indented the coastal zone represents numerous shoals and small islands it is quite difficult to differentiate between sea ice and land especially in the periods of ice formation and melt although at cross polarization noise level is too high and ice and water have weak radar contrasts cross polarization is well suited to distinguish the coast edge co polarized radar data were used to identify ice cover location polynyas and ice free areas when simultaneous co polarized and cross polarized satellite radar data were available different combinations of these were used for more accurate interpretation distinguishing between land and ice ice and water sea surface manifestations of wind field variations in the near surface atmospheric layer and sea ice good results for sentinel 1 data were obtained for the following color composites red hh vv green hh vv blue hv vh or red hv vh green hh vv blue hv hh vh vv ice thickness cannot be directly determined from sar data but can only be approximated by ice development stage ice types determination of ice type and thickness was outside the scope of this study despite the fact that sar data have a clear advantage for ice monitoring they also have some disadvantages the first one is narrow swath width to determine the annual maximum of ice cover area it is necessary to compose a mosaic of several sar images which are sometimes obtained on different days the second is wind shadow areas near the shore in case of wind from the shore such areas have similar signatures in radar images as new ice also to improve the quality of sar data interpretation ocean color data listed in table 2 were used the modis viirs and olci sensors have large swath width covering the entire water area of the north caspian fig 1 in addition the surveys take place every day with a time difference of several hours in the case of partial cloudiness combining data acquired at different times of the same day one can minimize the cloudiness in order to determine the ice cover boundary more accurately the disadvantage of these data is low spatial resolution which leaves little chance to clearly distinguish areas of new ice landsat and sentinel 2 satellite data with high spatial resolution 10 30 m allow quite accurately detecting in absence of clouds areas of ice build up and melt as well as ice fractures polynyas open water etc their disadvantages are small swath width see table 2 and less than once a day survey frequency the revisit frequency is 2 3 days for the sentinel 2a b tandem and 16 days for landsat thus the use of multi sensor satellite data the availability of which over the years is presented in fig 2 provided high accuracy of the results achieved in this work each year of monitoring was supported with satellite data both radar and high and medium resolution ocean color data over the past five years data from 12 satellites were available on a continuous basis it should be emphasized that determining the annual maximum area of ice cover is possible only on the basis of satellite data processing and analyzing all these data required powerful and versatile software tools an information system called see the sea sts was developed at the space research institute of the russian academy of sciences with the purpose to aid in solving oceanographic problems using remote sensing data mityagina et al 2014 lavrova et al 2019b sts operates an archive of all available satellite data from the 1980s to the present day and offers a powerful and comprehensive toolkit for processing and thematic analysis of various data different in physical nature spatial resolution units of measurement and acquisition times as well as storing the obtained results sts enables product selection for ocean color data that is creating red green blue rgb composites from different band combinations suitable for example for distinguishing ice from clouds or ice from land fig 3 presents an example of different rgb composites demonstrating that sentinel 2 msi standard true color composite red 4 band 650 680 nm green 3 band 542 577 nm blue 2 band 456 523 nm does not allow for reliable identification of ice and distinguishing it from cloudiness or shore fig 3a the best result is achieved with the following bands red 12 2110 2280 nm green 8 785 900 nm blue 4 640 680 nm fig 3b for landsat 8 oli the following band combination is used red 7 2100 2290 nm green 5 850 880 nm blue 4 640 680 nm note that the msi bands are different in spatial resolution band 12 has a resolution of 20 m and bands 8 and 4 have a resolution of 10 m in sts however matching different spatial resolution data is made automatically an sts tool for water surface classification allows online compiling user maps using satellite data the standard problem of image classification that previously as a rule demanded specialized software is solved by the sts mapping interface both the unsupervised clustering and the supervised classification algorithms are integrated supervised classification suits best for ice type identification the user specifies an array of points assigned to different classes the result of classification is displayed in the browser window and the aggregate area of each class is automatically calculated this way we get the total area of ice cover excluding cracks polynyas areas of clear water and islands that may be 15 20 less than the area estimated on the basis of the outer ice edge length the sts classification tool is of particular value in the case of intense ice melt when ice cover is largely inhomogeneous with an abundance of scattered ice floes patches of open water etc fig 4 shows a supervised classification performed to identify ice types and estimate their aggregate areas in a landsat 7 etm image of 04 03 2001 different parameters are used to characterize the severity of winters in the north caspian and to identify trends in the ice cover with climate change ice cover area in km2 kosarev 1975 terziev et al 1992 kouraev et al 2004 2011 lavrova et al 2019a or as a percentage of the total region s area dumanskaya 2014 yaitskaya and magaeva 2020 ogorodov et al 2020 ginzburg et al 2021 dates of ice appearance and clearance duration of ice cover ice thickness the sum of freezing degree days sfdd terziev et al 1992 the long term variability of the maximum ice area and thickness in october march is in good agreement with the corresponding long term variability of the sfdd terziev et al 1992 therefore the sfdd as the most accessible parameter based on data from meteorological stations located in the coastal areas of the water area during the ice period is most often used to characterize the severity of winters for the purpose of this study the sfdd is defined as the sum of positive differences between 0 c and daily air temperature below 0 c and calculated over the whole freezing period of the year the sfdd unit of measurement is degree celsius to calculate the sfdd we will use not only daily mean air temperature as most authors do but sometimes also daily minimum air temperature when essential the distinction will be pointed out in the literature the sfdd is determined for different months of the ice period and according to data from different meteorological stations on the coast the criteria for the classification of winters by their severity are also different kosarev 1975 kosarev and tuzhilkin 2000 kosarev et al 2004 bukharitsin 2006 2008 bolgov et al 2007 dumanskaya 2014 ivkina et al 2017 lavrova et al 2019a yaitskaya and magaeva 2020 ogorodov et al 2020 a summary of data on anomalous winters warm and cold in the period from 1937 1938 to 1999 2000 based on information provided in kosarev 1975 terziev et al 1992 kouraev et al 2003 is given in ginzburg et al 2004 here to assess winter severity we use the same sfdd criteria as described by bukharitsin 2006 2008 bukharitsin et al 2015 bolgov et al 2007 and lavrova et al 2019a for astrakhan meteorological station 46 35 n 48 07 e and ivkina et al 2017 for peshnoy meteorological station 46 9 n 51 68 e very severe sfdd greater than 900 c severe 900 700 c moderate 700 400 c mild 400 100 c very mild 100 c note that air temperature over land and over sea can differ significantly in particular when ice begins to form in shallow waters and bays usually the temperature at coastal stations still remains positive for several days in contrast in the middle of winter the minimum temperatures recorded at coastal stations are never observed above the water surface therefore it can be assumed that sfdd estimates based on data from one meteorological station or averaged data from several meteorological stations on the north caspian coast may not always adequately reflect the seasonal and interannual variability of the ice cover in this regard it is useful to estimate annual sfdd over a given area of the sea surface of the north caspian and compare them with data of astrakhan meteorological station the station is located at a distance of 375 km from the north caspian northeast coast where the ice cover starts to form in winter fig 1 for this purpose we used air temperature produced with the giovanni online data system v 4 30 of the nasa goddard earth sciences data and information services center ges disc acker and leptoukh 2007 namely we used area averaged 2 meter air temperature daily mean and daily minimum of merra 2 model m2sdnxslv v5 12 4 with spatial resolution 0 5 0 625 for the time period from 1 november to 15 april for 1999 2000 to 2021 2022 winter seasons m2sdnxslv is a 2 dimensional daily dataset in modern era retrospective analysis for research and applications version 2 merra 2 this dataset in particular consists of daily statistics such as daily mean or daily minimum and maximum air temperature at 2 meter merra 2 is the latest version of global atmospheric reanalysis for the satellite era produced by nasa global modeling and assimilation office gmao using the goddard earth observing system model geos version 5 12 4 the dataset covers the period of 1980 present with the latency of 3 weeks after the end of a month https disc gsfc nasa gov datasets m2sdnxslv 5 12 4 summary merra 2 as well as its predecessor merra is known to realistically represent different climate variables over the ocean and continents this can be attributed to the rich data assimilation input high spatial resolution which is important for realistic simulation of the regional weather and climate patterns also being non spectral nasa merra model may be better capable of simulating interaction of the atmospheric flow with the orography for instance bosilovich 2013 demonstrated good merra skills in representation of precipitation and temperatures over the american continent also schubert et al 2022 have shown that merra 2 is highly skillful in representing extreme temperature regimes over the northern hemisphere tilinina et al 2013 demonstrated that merra is superior in representing northern hemisphere cyclone activity particularly in the atlantic eurasian sector bentamy et al 2017 demonstrated that merra is well depicting statistical properties of air sea turbulent fluxes over the ocean luo et al 2020 demonstrated that merra 2 reproduces well sea surface temperature atmospheric temperature and humidity over the atlantic ocean this was proved through comparisons with independent marine atmospheric emitted radiance interferometer m aeri and radiosonde data from the aerosols and ocean science expeditions aerose cruises since the climate and ice conditions are very different in the eastern and western parts of the north caspian we performed a joint analysis of three types of air temperature data for each winter period 1 data obtained from the merra 2 m2sdnxslv v5 12 4 model for the entire north caspian 2 the same separately for the eastern part of the north caspian with the western limit at 50 e and 3 data from astrakhan meteorological station we bounded the north caspian by the following limits 44 46 47 14 n 46 70 52 90 e 3 results to determine winter climate changes for the period from 1999 2000 to 2021 2022 we used the following parameters dates of transition through 0 c of the near surface layer of atmosphere either to negative or positive temperatures ice freeze onset and melt dates ice cover area the sfdd 3 1 sum of freezing degree days the following data were used to determine the sfdd in the three selected areas 1 daily mean and daily minimum air temperatures at a height of 2 m over the eastern north caspian 2 daily minimum air temperatures over the entire north caspian both of these data arrays were determined with merra 2 and 3 daily air temperatures at astrakhan meteorological station the resulting sequences of the sfdd for the three study sites are shown in fig 5 one can see that the character of the four curves in fig 5 is largely the same until the winter of 2011 2012 there is a cooling trend in the sfdd on average with noticeable interannual variability while after this winter it is either warming for astrakhan or practically absent the cold and warm peaks of the curves are observed mainly in the same years but there are also notable differences until the winter of 2011 2012 the astrakhan sfdd is in most cases higher i e the winters are colder than over the eastern north caspian this may be due to the fact that in cold winters air over land cools more than over water thus the minimum air temperature recorded on february 8 2012 at the meteorological station in astrakhan is 31 5 c while the air temperature over the eastern part of the north caspian does not drop below 18 6 c february 4 2012 throughout that winter the sfdd over the entire north caspian which includes relatively warmer waters of the western north caspian is lower i e the air is warmer for all winters except 2004 2005 however since the winter of 2011 2012 the picture has changed the sfdd over the eastern part of the north caspian gets to exceed that at the meteorological station in astrakhan the air becomes relatively colder and the range of interannual fluctuations of the sfdd over the north caspian increases markedly in addition in the sfdd sequence for the eastern part of the north caspian the distinctly warm winter of 2003 2004 and the cold winter of 2002 2003 for daily mean data do not appear whereas the cold peaks of 2014 2015 2016 2017 and especially 2020 2021 exceed the peak of 2011 2012 note that these anomalously warm cold winters appear on the curve for astrakhan in fig 5 and in the data of well known publications on winter severity in the north caspian bukharitsin et al 2015 ivkina et al 2017 nepomenko et al 2019 tatarnikov et al 2020 ginzburg et al 2021 according to these publications the winter of 2011 2012 was the coldest in the north caspian from astrakhan and peshnoy meteorological stations data in the period 1999 2020 it can be assumed that such difference in the manifestation of anomalous winters in the data of the astrakhan meteorological station and in the merra 2 data for the north caspian is associated with a restructuring of the atmospheric circulation since the 2011 2012 winter which made the eastern north caspian colder than the astrakhan region this fact seems to be proved independently by satellite data which shows a general increase in the ice cover area till winter of 2011 2012 and a subsequent decrease of the ice cover area see section 3 4 3 2 winter severity let us compare the character of winters over the 23 year period in the eastern north caspian and in astrakhan on the basis of the sfdd obtained fig 5 and using the above winter severity criteria table 3 in the table the winters in bold are those that fall into the same gradation of winter severity for both regions as can be seen there are 9 such matches in the mild winter gradation for moderate winters there are 5 matches only one winter 2020 2021 is graded as severe in both regions and we see no matches in the very severe winter grade as noted above in february 2012 there were no such extremely low air temperatures over the sea as were recorded at astrakhan meteorological station from merra 2 2 m altitude air temperature data for the period from 1999 2000 to 2021 2022 we derive the following winter severity breakdown very mild 0 severe 4 3 only one winter 2020 2021 moderate 39 1 and mild 56 6 no very mild winters were observed meanwhile from the astrakhan weather station data we get very severe 4 3 only one winter 2011 2012 severe 17 5 moderate 39 1 mild 39 1 and no very mild winters as well fig 6 thus compared to merra 2 marine air temperature data coastal astrakhan data show more severe and very severe winters less mild ones and the same number of moderate winters the discrepancy can be explained by the distance of several hundred km between the locations and different data sources i e meteorological records and modeling as for the whole north caspian the following winter severity percentages are obtained severe 4 5 winter of 2020 2021 moderate 54 6 mild 40 9 no very severe and very mild winters are observed in the study period thus the share of moderate winters is the highest in all three regions of interest is the nature of the change in air temperature over the north caspian and its eastern part in the period from november 1 1999 to november 1 2021 the time series of air temperature over the eastern north caspian reveals no significant trend fig 7a whereas over the entire north caspian the trend is slightly positive 0 05 c year fig 7b since 2011 the annual temperature amplitude has been increasing with summer maximums exceeding 32 c july 2021 and winter minimums nearly reaching 26 c february 2021 such an amplitude 58 c was never observed from 1999 to 2014 both figures show that year to year variability of summer temperature varies in the range of several degrees while winter temperature may vary in the range of 10 c and even more this causes a significant year to year variability in the sea ice cover area and duration see sections 3 3 and 3 4 3 3 ice cover duration the interannual variability in winter severity also determines the interannual variability in the dates of ice appearance clearance freeze onset melt dates ice period duration and ice thickness the ice period duration was determined from the satellite images as the number of days between the first and the last appearances of sea surface ice in the data for this purpose mostly radar data were used because they do not depend on cloud cover and have a resolution of 10 m for the winters of 2012 2013 and 2013 2014 ocean color data were used in the absence of radar data between the end of the envisat mission in april 2012 and the launch of sentinel 1a in april 2014 due to certain local peculiarities the timing of ice formation in the north caspian is rather irregular there are caucasus mountains on the west of the region and deserts of central asia on the east in general the western north caspian is characterized by a milder climate with higher average winter temperatures as compared to the eastern part where climate is much more continental persisting north and northeast winds bring a strong cooling of the air with temperatures 10 15 c below zero in december and minus 25 30 c on the coast in january sea ice always appears earlier in the east which is evidenced by the differences in onset times of the same ice phases and ice development patterns in neighboring regions at close latitudes bolgov et al 2007 in the east ice is observed every year while in the west there may be no ice and snow at all in mild winters usually ice freezing begins in the east in early november then ice spreads over the northern part and in early january it can be observed in the open sea as far as the shallow water edge spanning from the chechen island to the tyuleniy seal islands and further to the tyub karagan peninsula fig 1 further spreading to the south however proceeds much slower as heat exchange with the warm masses of deep waters is more intense in the study period ice freezing began in november with the exception of 7 winters when it started in early december 2005 2006 2008 2009 2009 2010 2010 2011 2012 2013 2013 2014 and 2015 2016 table 4 melting of ice starts in the western part of the north caspian and as a rule no ice is found there by the beginning of march ice melts slower in the north than in the east where water is the shallowest in the region in the beginning of april small ice fields are sometimes still observed at the northern coast between 50 20 and 52 60 n north off tyuleniy seal islands where water warms up slowly the latest ice presence date is 16 april 2012 table 4 the sea ice duration graph is shown in fig 8 the longest ice period was observed during the severe winter of 2011 2012 it reached 163 days from 17 11 2011 to 16 04 2012 the shortest ice period lasted only 86 days and occurred in the mild winter of 2015 2016 the average ice duration in the north caspian is 124 days after the winter of 2011 2012 similar to air temperature figure 7 strong variations in ice duration are observed 3 4 annual maximum area of ice cover the annual maximum area of ice cover was also determined from satellite data first of all obtained with terra aqua modis sensor modis data has a resolution of 250 500 m and one scene covers the whole water area of the north caspian in cases where modis images were contaminated with clouds a mosaic of sentinel 1a b sar c radar images were used given that the eastern north caspian freezes every year the annual maximum total ice cover area depends on the ice extent in the western north caspian there is no significant correlation between sea ice duration and annual maximum of ice cover area for the winter of 2013 2014 there is no correlation at all this may be explained by the absence of sar data at that time see fig 2 table 1 when in conditions of autumn cloudiness the start of ice formation and consequently ice period duration could be determined inaccurately meanwhile from table 4 one can see a better correlation between sea ice duration and duration of the period with negative air temperature the greatest correlation throughout the period under consideration is observed between the maximums minimums of the ice cover area and the sfdd for the eastern north caspian with the exception of the winters of 2001 2002 and 2014 2015 although the negative trend in the ice cover area after the winter of 2011 2012 is more consistent with that for the sfdd for astrakhan figs 9 10 a possible explanation is obvious the lower the air temperature the greater is the frozen area of the sea surface the maximum recorded ice cover area is 103 5 thous km2 it was observed in the severe winter of 2011 2012 when the entire north caspian was frozen during that winter ice also formed along the western coast of the middle caspian as far south as the absheron peninsula and even in the shallow bays of turkmenbashi krasnovodsk and south cheleken of the south caspian lavrova et al 2019a it should be noted that presence of ice in the middle and even in the south caspian is not really unique this occurs practically every severe and in some moderate winters for example during a moderate and even mild according to the astrakhan meteorological station winter of 2004 2005 in february 2005 ice spread along the western coast of the middle caspian to the absheron peninsula and during the winter of 2013 2014 the bays of turkmenbashi krasnovodsk and south cheleken of the south caspian were covered with ice for a week however ice in the middle and south caspian is not usually observed for more than 7 10 days the smallest annual maximum ice cover area was recorded in 2019 2020 it was only 36 thous km2 the 23 year average annual maximum ice cover area is 73 4 thous km2 as a rule the maximum ice coverage is reached in january february in 2012 the maximum ice area was observed in early march but in the winter of 2011 2012 ice freeze onset was also late in early december 4 discussion due to different climate conditions in the north caspian the coldest is its northeastern part the sfdd at different points on the coast can differ markedly and accordingly the severity of a particular winter can be estimated differently under the same severity criteria for example according to yaitskaya and magaeva 2020 the winter of 1913 1914 was the mildest in astrakhan and atyrau the winter of 2003 2004 at tyuleniy and the winter of 1965 1966 at fort shevchenko winter of 1998 1999 in lavrova et al 2019a refers to mild winters whereas in ivkina et al 2017 to moderate ones in addition a comparative analysis of the severity of winters of the same gradation in the 21st and 20th centuries in lobanov and naurozbaeva 2021 indicates a decrease in the severity of winters in the 21st century for example in the very severe winter of 1953 1954 the sfdds in atyrau and makhachkala were 1317 c and 447 c respectively whereas in the very severe winter of 2011 2012 by astrakhan data they were 699 c and 174 c respectively the same conclusion was made by dumanskaya 2018 over the 132 year period the decrease of the sfdd in astrakhan occurred at an average rate of 2 c year however this discrepancy does not affect the conclusions of various authors about the change in the nature of winters in different time intervals indicating corresponding climate change in the north caspian it follows from many works bukharitsin et al 2015 dumanskaya 2014 ivkina et al 2017 nepomenko et al 2019 yaitskaya and magaeva 2020 ogorodov et al 2020 tatarnikov et al 2020 etc that in the 21st century compared to the 20th century the number of very severe and severe winters has decreased while the number of mild winters has increased this is reflected in the table 5 that we compiled from the data of these works and the results of our study it should be noted that the assignment of a particular winter to a certain gradation depends on the criterion used some authors bukharitsin 2006 2008 2015 ivkina et al 2017 use the criterion specified in table 3 dumanskaya 2014 nepomenko et al 2019 and tatarnikov et al 2020 use the sfdd criterion developed by dumanskaya mild 265 c moderate 265 640 c severe 640 c other use their own custom criteria ogorodov et al 2020 yaitskaya and magaeva 2020 the dependence of winter severity on the criterion used can be demonstrated on the data for the eastern north caspian merra 2 mean in table 5 recalculating the corresponding sfdds from fig 5 using the dumanskaya criterion one gets the inverse ratio of the number of mild and moderate winters mild winters 8 34 8 moderate 14 60 9 table 5 our analysis of the air temperature over the north caspian sea derived from merra 2 data for the period 1999 2000 2021 2022 shows neither a decrease in the number of severe winters nor an increase in the number of mild ones only a weak positive trend in the long term air temperature data over the north caspian sea is determined although over this period air temperature did not reach the minimum that was recorded in atyrau in 1954 37 4 c but in astrakhan in 2012 the temperature fell close to the record minimum of 31 5 c the percentage of severe winters obtained in our study 21 7 see fig 5 for daily mean values agrees well with that obtained in the longest 167 year observation period in astrakhan 1845 1846 2011 2012 22 dumanskaya 2014 we noted that since 2011 there have been very sharp interannual fluctuations with large amplitude in our sfdd values figs 5 10 our data cover a relatively short period of time 23 years in the 21st century it is characterized by a cooling phase on average from 1999 2000 to 2011 2012 followed by a warming phase from astrakhan data analysis or stagnation on average with cold winters in 2014 2015 2016 2017 and especially 2020 2021 in the northeastern region and in the entire north caspian fig 5 based on remote sensing data from 1978 1979 to 2001 2002 kouraev et al 2004 showed that no noticeable trend was found in the beginning of the ice period in either the western or eastern parts of the north caspian however a decreasing trend was found in the duration of the ice period and the area of ice cover since the winter of 1993 1994 analysis of the interannual variability of ice cover area and ice duration in the north caspian for the period 1978 2007 kouraev et al 2011 kostianoy et al 2014 showed a positive trend in both in the first half of the 1980s then until 2007 a warming stage was observed on average note that estimates of maximum ice cover areas can vary considerably depending on the dataset used this is evident for example for the winters from 1998 1999 to 2006 2007 from available literature e g kouraev et al 2011 and our own observations we base our study on all available data from satellite radar and ocean color sensors and compare changes in the ice cover areas in different periods rather than the absolute values of these areas the absence of a clear correlation between the duration of the ice period and sddf which is caused by the alternation of periods of ice formation and its melting during sharp changes in air temperature was demonstrated in lavrova et al 2019a such a correlation was observed only in the mild winter of 2015 2016 the harsh winter of 2002 2003 and the very severe winter of 2011 2012 yaitskaya and magaeva 2020 showed a reduction in the number of severe winters and an increase in the number of mild ones in the second half of the 20th century the beginning of the 21st century the ice cover in severe winters is on average about 76 of the total area of the north caspian in moderate winters about 65 in mild ones about 47 with an average long term value for the period 1940 2015 equal to 57 the average duration of the ice season is 81 and 124 days for the meteorological stations kulaly and peshnoy respectively for more than half a century it has decreased by 16 days at the peshnoy meteorological station and by 6 days at astrakhan the average long term ice coverage in the north caspian in the period 1940 2019 according to ogorodov et al 2020 is 57 with interannual changes from 30 to 85 in the winters of 1999 2000 and 1953 1954 respectively average annual ice cover of 57 in the period 1961 1990 decreased to 50 in 1981 2010 ogorodov et al 2020 significant interannual changes in ice cover area in winters from 1998 1999 to 2018 2019 from a minimum value of approximately 44 000 km2 during the mild winter of 1999 2000 up to a maximum of 90 000 km2 during the very severe winter of 2011 2012 were demonstrated in lavrova et al 2019a for comparison in the most severe winter in february 1954 ice cover reached 103 516 km2 terziev et al 1992 the use of high spatial resolution satellite data allowed us to estimate more accurately the duration of ice period and dates of ice freeze onset and melt in the north caspian as compared to the estimates of other authors we found that on average the ice period duration was on the increase until 2012 and on the decrease after that with noticeable interannual variability figs 8 10 the best correspondence between the duration of the ice period maximums and minimums and the sfdd is observed for the winter of 2011 2012 while for example a rather long ice period corresponds to the mild winter of 2003 2004 128 days table 4 the longest period with air temperature below 0 c november 6 march 29 table 4 and the longest ice period 163 days table 4 correspond to the cold winter of 2011 2012 the shortest ice period 86 days table 4 corresponds to the warm winter of 2015 2016 these ice period estimates are in good agreement with ivkina et al 2017 setting aside these anomalous ice periods the average ice duration in the 21st century decreased from 124 days in the first decade to 120 days in the second decade as for the maximum area of the ice cover this parameter can be determined correctly only from satellite data as follows from figs 9 10 and table 4 on average the ice area increases during the cooling phase until 2012 and decreases with noticeable interannual variability further until 2022 the extremums of maximum ice area are generally consistent with those of the sfdd better correspondence with the sfdd for astrakhan the eastern north caspian freezes almost every year though in some winters such as in the mild winter of 2019 2020 with large areas of open water in the 21st century the average maximum ice cover area has decreased from 75 4 thous sq km in the first decade to 71 3 thous sq km in the second decade thus all recent studies indicate a trend towards a decrease in the sfdd warming in the north caspian a decrease in the thickness of ice the area of ice cover and the duration of the ice season a shift in the onset of ice formation towards later dates and ice clearance towards earlier dates considering our results for the relatively small 23 years but recent period 1999 2000 2021 2022 we cannot conclude that there is a shift of the onset of ice freezing towards later dates and ice clearance towards earlier dates table 4 5 conclusions satellite sar and ocean color data were used to study the interannual variability of ice cover of the caspian sea from 1999 to 2022 available satellite data of high and medium spatial resolution allowed determining with great accuracy the dates of ice freeze onset and melt in the north caspian sea ice period duration and maximum ice area in each winter we have found a strong interannual variability of these parameters especially after 2012 with growing amplitude of fluctuations being more accurate compared to optical imagery satellite sar instruments provide daily data coverage including cloudy days with data that enable discrimination between sea ice water and shallow areas high resolution optical images were used to fill gaps between consecutive sar images a new combination of optical bands was tested and applied to correctly detect ice on the sea surface the use of sar imagery and other satellite information allowed us to accurately estimate the annual maximum ice cover as well as to determine the dates of first appearance and last occurrence of ice in the region using high resolution sar data we were able to show that in the 23 year study period there was neither a shift to later dates of ice freezing nor a shift to earlier dates of ice melting see table 4 as some authors stated earlier we do not exclude that such shifts occurred in the 20th century though it is difficult to evaluate in the absence of satellite data of high spatial resolution for that period we found that the longest ice cover period was in 2011 2012 163 days and the shortest one in 2015 2016 86 days the average duration of ice cover during the study period was 124 days heterogeneity of the ice cover the presence of polynyas areas of open water and separate ice fields make an accurate determination of the ice cover a difficult task in our study we used the see the sea information system which allows a clear recognition of such features as ice land and water and determining the area of each the maximum ice coverage for the study period was observed in the winter of 2011 2012 and it was equal to 103 5 thous km2 the minimum annual ice coverage was in the winter of 2019 2020 and it was only 36 thous km2 the average annual ice cover area during the 23 year period was 72 thous km2 our results confirm the conclusions of other authors that the maximum annual area of the ice cover is slowly decreasing but solely due to the ice in the western part of the north caspian the eastern north caspian freezes almost every year but in some years such as 2019 2020 with large areas of open water in the literature winters are usually classified by severity into very severe severe moderate and mild based on sdff the latter is the stumbling point because different authors obtain daily air temperature from different locations and for different time periods months to calculate the sfdd in particular most of the authors use data from astrakhan meteorological station located at the beginning of the volga river delta at a distance of 375 km from the northeastern coast of the north caspian where the ice cover starts to form it would seem that these data are unlikely to adequately reflect seasonal and interannual variability of the caspian ice cover in the present study for the first time we used merra 2 atmospheric reanalysis data obtained specifically over the north caspian sea and separately over its eastern part located to the east of 50 e merra 2 dates of transition to negative temperatures completely correspond to ice freeze onset dates derived from the satellite data the major outcome of our study is the established high correlation between ice cover area in the north caspian sea and winter severity evaluated specifically for the eastern north caspian for the period from 2015 onwards when data from 12 satellite sensors became simultaneously available the datasets of different spectral range and spatial resolution complement each other and allow deriving more accurate information on sea ice cover as concerns the data from ground meteorological stations they can be used to calculate the sfdd and make ice cover comparisons only if obtained from meteorological stations located specifically in the northeastern part of the north caspian like atyrau peshnoy etc nevertheless the interannual variabilities of the sfdd calculated from different data seem to be similar if we don t pay attention to absolute values with the same peaks in certain years regardless the variety of approaches to the determination of sfdd and winter severity there is a general agreement among the researchers which is confirmed by our work that moderate and mild winters prevail one of the most important issues arises when we compare the values of the sfdd and ice cover area and duration sometimes the maximum and minimum peaks in the sfdd do not correspond to the relative peaks of ice cover area and duration sometimes the sfdd peaks of a certain level correspond to different values of ice cover area and duration in different years we suggest that the reason lies in the fact that we as well as all other authors compare ice cover variations only with air temperature factor whereas there are many other important sea and atmosphere factors that can seriously impact the ice regime in the north caspian wind speed and direction and wave height and direction can influence the timing of sea ice as well as its spatial distribution and concentration a significant decrease of the caspian sea level by about 2 m since 1995 ginzburg et al 2021 observed in the shallow north caspian can significantly impact heat capacity of the water column as well as air sea heat exchange and cooling of the surface water till freezing point regional climate change which includes wind forcing serykh and kostianoy 2020 can increase or decrease mass and heat exchange between the warmer middle and the colder north caspian sea due to changes in the intensity of currents the north caspian is the most brackish part of the caspian sea with lowest values of salinity which varies from 0 2 to 11 psu this is the result of the volga and ural rivers runoff to the north caspian thus from year to year the variations in runoff and relative changes in water salinity can seriously impact the freezing point also the heat content of the water column collected during previous to freezing months was never estimated and used as a parameter which may have an impact on the appearance of ice to the above list of factors we can add changes in solar irradiance cloud cover atmospheric precipitation rain snow evaporation humidity etc all these factors which require special attention and research can significantly impact the relationship between the sfdd and the ice cover finally even if a robust correspondence between the sfdd and ice cover regime is established there is still an acute problem of forecasting the ice cover area and duration at least several months before the appearance of ice in the north caspian sea this is a very important issue for well developed offshore oil and gas industry in kazakhstan and russia which includes oil platforms and pipelines as well as ship transportation kostianoy et al 2016 nepomenko et al 2019 and an important task for future research funding this research was funded by
