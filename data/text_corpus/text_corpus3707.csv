18535,n nitrosamines in water have drawn significant concerns for the health of water consumers due to their carcinogenic properties n nitrosamines are formed during disinfection of wastewater as well as different industrial and agricultural processes this study characterized the n nitrosamines compositions in eleven different wastewaters in the pearl river delta prd in southeast china and the spatial distributions and the abundances of n nitrosamines in the pearl river water were detected the results indicated that five n nitrosamines species including n nitrosodimethylamine ndma n nitrosodiethylamine ndea n nitrosopyrrolidine npyr n nitrosomorpholine nmor and n nitrosodibutylamine ndba were found in the industrial wastewater samples in the prd remarkably high concentrations of ndma up to 4000 ng l were found in the wastewaters from the textile printing and dyeing as well as the electroplating whereas ndma ndea and nmor were detected in the domestic wastewaters at concentrations lower than 15 ng l moreover we found that certain treatment processes for the electroplating wastewater could form a significant amount of ndma npyr and nmor analyses of the pearl river water samples showed occurrences of different n nitrosamines species including ndma 5 7 ng l ndea 1 7 ng l npyr 2 2 ng l nmor 2 2 ng l and ndba 4 9 ng l the abundances of n nitrosamines species varied spatially due to the inputs from the different sources thus our study provides unique and valuable information for occurrences abundances and source characteristics of n nitrosamines in the prd graphical abstract image 1 keywords n nitrosamines wastewater wwtps the pearl river source characterization 1 introduction occurrences of n nitrosamines in both drinking water and wastewater have been receiving increasing attention due to their toxic properties and high aqueous mobilities choi and valentine 2002 krasner et al 2013 mitch et al 2003 padhye et al 2009 sedlak et al 2005 zeng and mitch 2015 certain n nitrosamines compounds are even classified as probable human carcinogens and mutagens epa iris 2012 continuous release of these compounds into natural aquatic systems can cause serious health problems for water consumers due to the fact that n nitrosodimethylamine ndma is unlikely to be completely removed this compound is the most frequently detected n nitrosamine in drinking waters hu et al 2008 jurado sánchez et al 2010 kodamatani et al 2009 planas et al 2008 often together with other n nitrosamines species ndma also occurs in wastewater hu et al 2008 jurado sánchez et al 2009

water jurado sánchez et al 2010 walse and mitch 2008 n nitrosamines in water have different sources they are mainly formed during chloramination and ozonation treatment processes of drinking water and wastewater krasner et al 2013 and they are also unintentionally formed through different industrial processes kosaka et al 2010 for instance rubber manufacturing and processing leather tanning metal casting metalworking using semisynthetic cutting fluids and food processing can contribute to n nitrosamines formation ducos et al 1988 epa 2016 who 2002 in domestic sewage both greywater and black water contain n nitrosamines and their precursors among which laundry water serves as a primary source zeng and mitch 2015 the study of sedlak et al 2005 also suggested that domestic sources are also important for n nitrosamines accumulation in wastewater effluents from animal husbandry operations contribute to the formation of ndma n nitrosopyrrolidine npyr and their precursors zeng et al 2016a aquaculture pond also contains high levels of ndma n nitrosodiethylamine ndea and n nitrosodibutylamine ndba chen et al 2017 characterization of different sources compositions of n nitrosamines is of primary importance to control these pollutants in natural aquatic systems numerous studies have attempted to identify n nitrosamines compositions in different wastewaters including influents and effluents from wastewater treatment plants wwtps deng et al 2018 krauss et al 2009 schreiber and mitch 2006 sedlak et al 2005 greywaters and blackwaters zeng and mitch 2015 and direct industrial discharges ma et al 2012 previous studies revealed that ndma was the most abundant n nitrosamine species in effluents of wwtps and the concentration of ndma varied from 5 to 5000 ng l krauss et al 2009 sedlak et al 2005 zhou et al 2009 also different sources might contribute to specific n nitrosamine species the recent studies in china revealed that frequent occurrences of n nitrosamines in rivers were due to contamination by industrial and domestic wastewaters bei et al 2016 ma et al 2012 thus a careful investigation and evaluation of different n nitrosamines sources especially different industrial inputs is urgently needed in china during the last two decades in the pearl river delta prd rapid industrialization intensive agricultural activities municipal developments and increasing utilization of chemicals have caused a series of environmental problems fu et al 2003 xu et al 2007 due to the large population over 40 million as well as the high fraction of untreated wastewater in this region more than 50 occurrences of n nitrosamines in the prd are rising a great concern for public health chen et al 2017 liu et al 2016 xu et al 2007 a previous study detected six n nitrosamines in surface waters and groundwater in the prd region the ndma concentrations were up to 258 ng l while the concentrations of ndea npyr n nitrosomorpholine nmor and ndba were lower than 10 7 ng l chen et al 2017 recently china has carried out very strict environmental laws and regulations to prevent water pollution with a primary focus on waste reduction and development of individual industrial wwtps however untreated discharges from relatively small industries still might pose as important sources for n nitrosamines emissions chen et al 2017 ho and hui 2001 the main industries in the prd region include chemical and biochemical products manufacturing petrochemicals printed circuit board bleaching dyeing pulp and paper pharmaceuticals electroplating and food processing ho and hui 2001 china mee 2019 given the complexities of the wastewater effluents in this region which include industrial domestic and agricultural inputs it is a challenging task to characterize and evaluate the different sources of n nitrosamines although such studies are essential for source allocation and control of n nitrosamines pollution to the best of our knowledge no studies yet investigated n nitrosamines in different industrial or domestic wastewaters in the prd therefore the main goals of this study are 1 to characterize the n nitrosamines species in different wastewaters in the prd 2 to evaluate different sources and wastewater treatment processes for n nitrosamines formation and 3 to investigate the occurrences and abundances of n nitrosamines in the main streams of the pearl river including xijiang river beijiang river and dongjiang river 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and water sampling the prd has a monsoon climate with average annual precipitation between 1600 and 2000 mm as shown in fig 1 the study area is an alluvial plain and it is located in the mainland of the prd southeast china our sampling work was conducted in january 2018 we made sure that there were no rainfall events during the week before each sampling date to avoid dilution effects by rain thirty eight river water samples were collected from the three main rivers including xijiang river x1 13 in fig 1 beijiang river b1 12 and dongjiang river d1 13 the sampling locations are from the upper reaches wuzhou city qingyuan city and heyuan city to the lower reaches near the estuary of the south china sea see fig 1 duplicate samples were taken in the selected sites during sampling to consider river water fluctuation the detailed information of sampling is available in section s1 of the supplementary material wastewater samples were collected from different types of industrial plants domestic sewage treatment plants agricultural wastewaters and paddy field runoff at the center of the prd detailed information available in table 1 the sampling locations are given in fig 1 different treatment processes are applied to the industrial and domestic wastewaters to meet the standards for discharges see table 1 to evaluate the removal efficiencies of wastewater treatments for n nitrosamines duplicate samples were collected from the wastewater inlets and outlets moreover the effluents from the metal surface treatment plant as well as one of the three pharmaceutical plants are discharged into the sewage pipes while the rest are directly discharged into surrounding rivers at each site one liter of water was collected and stored in an amber glass bottle and 100 mg of sodium thiosulfate was immediately added for de chlorination additionally the parameters including ph temperature oxidation reduction potential orp electrical conductivity ec and dissolved oxygen do were monitored in situ by a portable ysi pro 2030 ysi incorporated oh us all samples were transported to the lab on the sampling day stored in the dark at 4 c and analyzed within seven days 2 2 sample pretreatment and analysis the procedures for sample pretreatment and analysis were described in detail previously by chen et al 2017 briefly after filtration of the samples 2 g of nahco3 ph ca 8 and 25 ng of ndma d6 recovery surrogate were added to each sample and then the samples were extracted through activated charcoal cartridges 2 g 6 ml 80 120 mesh anpel laboratory technologies inc shanghai which were preconditioned with dichloromethane methanol and ultrapure water at flow rates of 20 ml min the analytes were eluted from the cartridges with dichloromethane 12 ml and then concentrated under a stream of ultrahigh purity nitrogen 99 99 to a final volume of 500 μl the internal standard ndpa d14 25 ng was added prior to the instrument analysis the extracts were stored at 20 c till analysis the samples were analyzed on an agilent 7890b gas chromatograph gc coupled with an agilent 7000c triple quadrupole mass spectrometer ms ms with tandem capillary columns of agilent db 35 ms and agilent hp 5 ms using the method described in the previous study of chen et al 2017 ultrahigh purity helium 99 99 was used as the carrier gas at constant flows of 2 0 ml min in the db 35 ms and hp 5 ms columns 2 3 quality assurance and quality control the concentrations of the n nitrosamines were quantified by the internal standard isotope dilution method using the average relative response factors determined from the standard calibration runs the absolute recoveries of ndma d6 ranged from 51 to 70 average standard deviation 60 5 a laboratory blank was incorporated into the analytical procedures in every batch of 10 samples no target compounds were detected in the blank samples the method detection limits mdls were calculated by multiplying the standard deviation of seven replicates by the student s t value of 3 14 one side t distribution for six degrees of freedom at the 99 confidence level mcdonald et al 2012 the mdls of the n nitrosamines species are 0 50 ng l ndma 0 60 ng l n nitrosomethylethylamine nmea 0 90 ng l ndea 0 90 ng l n nitrosodi n propylamine ndpa 0 70 ng l nmor 1 1 ng l npyr 0 90 ng l npip and 1 0 ng l ndba respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of n nitrosamines in industrial wastewaters the concentrations of n nitrosamines in the seven types of industrial effluents in the prd are shown in fig 2 data available in table s2 ndma and nmor were detected in all the inlet and outlet samples where the concentrations ranged from 2 3 to 4320 average 754 1450 ng l and from 2 4 to 107 13 25 ng l respectively the variations of ndea npyr and ndba concentrations were 1 7 79 avg 6 4 18 3 9 to 297 19 68 and 3 8 to 19 3 0 4 5 ng l respectively in our case ndma and nmor were ubiquitous in all industrial effluents and they also occurred in the effluents of the domestic wastewaters ndea npyr and ndba were less frequently detected comparing with ndma where the detection frequencies were 44 33 and 28 respectively no significant reduction of n nitrosamines was observed during the wastewater treatments a previous study also found that ndma was not removed efficiently during the secondary effluent treatment sedlak et al 2005 it is noteworthy to mention that a high ndma content up to 4000 ng l was found in the effluents of the textile printing and dyeing as well as the electroplating which might be attributed to the use of ndma as industrial solvents aflaki et al 2017 it was also reported that various industrial sources caused incidental pollution and unusually high concentrations of ndma in wwtps krasner et al 2009 krauss et al 2009 padhye et al 2009 zhou et al 2009 thus direct discharges from industrial wastewaters in the prd serve as important sources for n nitrosamines occurrences in receiving waters textile printing and dyeing wastewater the average concentrations of ndma ndea npyr nmor and ndba in the inlets were 3290 137 79 4 6 9 9 0 8 3 7 0 2 and 19 0 5 ng l respectively fig 2a ndma was the most abundant compound in the inlets accounting for 97 of the total n nitrosamines in addition unusually high conductivity values 5650 μs cm and chemical oxygen demand codcr 218 mg l were obtained in the inlets which might be associated with high levels of sulphur naphthols antiyellowing agents azo dyes aromatic amines acetic acid soaps chromium compounds and heavy metals kosaka et al 2009 oya et al 2008 zhu et al 2018 it was found in a previous study that the high concentration of ndma 10 000 ng l in japan was mainly formed during ozonation of antiyellowing agents as ndma precursors kosaka et al 2009 textile printing and dyeing wastewaters are from washing dyeing and cleaning processes zhu et al 2018 therefore carrying high concentrations of ndma or its precursors kosaka et al 2009 oya et al 2008 after the treatment processes see table 1 the outlet ndma concentration increased to 4320 87 ng l while the concentrations of ndea npyr nmor and ndba dropped down to 15 ng l fig 2a this indicated that the treatment processes were forming ndma the decolorization and disinfection with sodium hypochlorite naclo might be the main reasons for ndma formation this could be explained by contacts of chlorine as oxidants with n nitrosamine precursors a previous study also showed that naclo enhanced the n nitrosamines formation during the wastewater treatment processes garcia rodríguez et al 2014 due to the fact that 627 textile printing and dyeing factories representing about 11 of all the industrial factories have been registered in the prd the effluents directly discharged out of these factories might significantly contribute to the occurrences of ndma in the rivers around this region the information for the licensed industrial factories with the permits for wastewater discharges was summarized in table s3 supplementary material electroplating wastewater this plant is producing circuit board manufacturing with electroplating wastewater discharging directly into surrounding rivers the average ndma and nmor concentrations of the inlets were 1780 192 and 51 3 0 ng l respectively fig 2b after treatment see table 1 the outlet concentrations increased to 3920 84 and 107 2 2 ng l respectively a previous study also indicated that ndma was formed significantly during the printed circuit board manufacturing processes resulting in 139 to 56 000 ng l of ndma in the outlets ocsd 2002 dithiocarbamate solutions used in printed circuit board manufacturing processes are the important precursors and therefore maybe the cause of the high concentrations of ndma sedlak et al 2005 furthermore npyr was formed significantly during the treatment processes and occurred at a concentration of 297 ng l fig 2b the application of naclo as an oxidant could stimulate formation of npyr notably high concentrations of npyr and nmor were obtained in the electroplating effluents this indicated that the formation of nmor might follow a different pathway since nmor is not a typical disinfection byproduct glover et al 2019 the electroplating factories only represent about 0 9 in the total number of industrial factories and these factories are mainly located in qingyuan foshan and zhongshan cities specifically contributing to ndma npyr and nmor in the surrounding rivers metal surface treatment wastewater the average concentrations of ndma ndea npyr and nmor in the inlets of metal surface treatment factory were 21 1 5 3 7 0 2 10 1 4 and 6 1 0 8 ng l respectively fig 2c after the treatment processes table 1 ndma and nmor were detected and decreased to 5 9 0 8 and 2 8 0 2 ng l respectively due to the fact that the metal surface treatment industry is one of the most important industries in the prd representing about 31 of the total industrial factories table s3 it still could be an important source for n nitrosamines in the receiving rivers food processing wastewater during food manufacturing n nitrosamines could be formed by nitrites and secondary amines hinuma et al 1990 the concentrations of ndma ndea npyr and nmor in the inlets were 9 4 0 2 2 7 0 5 5 1 0 8 and 2 3 0 2 ng l respectively fig 2d after treatment only ndma and nmor were detected and decreased to 5 9 0 1 and 4 2 0 9 ng l respectively indicating that the treatment of wastewater was effective for n nitrosamines reduction the food processing factories are mainly located in zhongshan city and makeup around 4 of the total industrial factories table s3 and therefore they serve as the minor sources for ndma and nmor in the river waters pulping wastewater in the pulping wastewater inlets ndma was the most abundant species accounting for 98 and occurred at concentrations of 97 4 8 ng l which was attributed to the high levels of precursors detected in a facility producing papers and printing materials kosaka et al 2014 nmor was also detected in the inlets at 2 4 0 3 ng l fig 2e ndma was reduced by the wastewater treatment processes down to 10 1 0 ng l removal efficiency of 89 indicating that the treatment using activated sludge was efficient for ndma removal see table 1 which was consistent with the findings in the previous study gerrity et al 2015 however formation of ndea nmor and ndba were observed at concentrations of 5 3 0 5 4 4 0 4 and 7 1 0 8 ng l respectively the pulping factories are widespread around the region which is about 10 of the total industrial factories thus the pulping wastewaters might be another major source for ndma ndea nmor and ndba in the pearl river fine chemicals wastewater the manufactured chemicals include organo silicone organo fluorine and surfactants the inlet concentrations of ndma ndea and nmor were 28 1 9 2 6 0 4 and 6 6 0 4 ng l respectively fig 2f after the treatment processes see table 1 ndma levels decreased to 14 0 7 ng l with a removal efficiency of 49 ndea nmor and ndba concentrations were also reduced down to 5 ng l the fine chemical factories are mainly located in zhongshan city and they represent 4 of the total industrial factories table s3 pharmaceutical wastewater previous works have found that the compounds bearing sulfamide hydrazine and carbamate moieties can form ndma during disinfection processes by ozonation kosaka et al 2014 2009 marti et al 2015 schmidt and brauch 2008 precursors of n nitrosamines often occur in wastewaters during manufacturing of pharmaceuticals shen and andrews 2011 and personal care products kemper et al 2010 to evaluate different pharmaceutical wastewaters for n nitrosamines formation we took the samples from the three different types of pharmaceutical effluents fig 2 g1 g3 the average concentrations for ndma and nmor in the outlets of plant a were 2 3 0 2 and 2 4 0 1 ng l respectively which halved those values detected in the inlets the similar results were obtained in the outlets of plant b but the average concentrations of ndma 5 5 0 3 ng l and nmor 4 4 1 1 ng l were slightly higher than those in pant a the ndma npyr and nmor concentrations in the inlets of plant c were 3 6 0 4 3 9 0 1 and 2 8 0 1 ng l respectively after the treatment processes see table 1 the average concentrations of ndma and nmor increased to 28 0 1 and 16 0 8 ng l in plant c respectively but the npyr was not detected the increasing concentrations of ndma and nmor in the outlet of plant c indicated that these compounds were likely formed by the biological treatment processes see table 1 our results confirm that pharmaceutical and personal care products ppcps in the wastewaters serve as the precursors for ndma and nmor formation kemper et al 2010 shen and andrews 2011 3 2 characterization of n nitrosamines in other wastewaters previous studies have investigated the occurrence of n nitrosamines in domestic wastewater krauss et al 2009 schreiber and mitch 2006 zeng and mitch 2015 and agricultural runoff elespuru and lijinsky 1973 pancholy 1978 zeng et al 2016a in order to characterize n nitrosamines species in these types of wastewaters in the prd region we also collected samples from the two domestic sewage treatment plants fig 3 a1 and a2 which were free of industrial effluents in addition we also sampled the swine wastewater fig 3 b the fishery wastewater fig 3 c1and c2 and the agricultural runoff during irrigation fig 3 d domestic sewage in the inlets of plant 1 the average ndma ndea and nmor concentrations were 13 0 9 1 8 0 1 and 7 4 0 4 ng l respectively see fig 3 a1 ndma concentrations after treatment decreased by half 6 9 0 8 ng l whereas ndea and nmor were not efficiently removed occurring at 1 0 and 7 9 0 1 ng l respectively ndma ndea and nmor were obtained in the inlets of plant 2 at 60 0 4 3 4 0 4 and 4 7 0 9 ng l respectively fig 3 a2 after the treatment ndma and nmor in plant 2 were reduced to 9 0 0 1 and 3 0 0 7 ng l respectively however ndea concentrations increased to 11 0 7 ng l thus the treatment processes reduced ndma by 46 85 while ndea and nmor were not efficiently removed since urine feces and gray water wastewater from shower bath and kitchen are major contents of domestic sewage water larsen et al 2009 they might carry and form ndma nmea ndea npyr and npip at various concentrations suzuki and mitsuoka 1985 zeng and mitch 2015 pig farm and aquaculture pond wastewaters the concentrations of n nitrosamines species in the swine wastewaters are shown in fig 3b notably high concentrations of ndma 1110 110 ng l ndea 202 4 3 ng l npyr 245 22 ng l nmor 114 14 ng l npip 168 18 ng l and ndba 226 36 ng l were detected in the swine wastewaters moreover the swine wastewater was directly discharged into the surrounding streams therefore posing as a source for n nitrosamines in the river water in the aquaculture pond ndma ndea and ndba were detected at average concentrations of 43 3 2 14 0 6 and 71 5 9 ng l respectively in which ndba was the most abundant species representing about 47 of the total n nitrosamines fig 3c these results implied that the aquaculture ponds had much higher content of ndba which was almost five times higher than it was in the other types of wastewaters this suggested that the aquaculture wastewaters were the significant source for ndba since this compound was rarely found in other wastewaters we observed that the concentrations of nitrate and doc in these two pond water were up to 41 and 7 8 mg l respectively this might be mainly due to the forages for feeding the aquatic products which were made from dry fish crabs and shells and rich in dissolved primary amines cohen et al 2005 moreover poor water replacements might enhance organic matters in the ponds since chlorine dioxide clo₂ was applied to disinfect the pond water almost every week this could potentially stimulate formation of ndma in waters containing the precursors gan et al 2015 thus intensive aquaculture systems poor water exchange activities and regular disinfection operations using clo2 might be the main reasons for the accumulation of n nitrosamines in the aquaculture pond the prd is the popular region for aquaculture in guangdong province and therefore the discharges from the pond water during the rainy seasons might also be another important source for n nitrosamines agricultural runoff previous works revealed that the reaction of nitrite with the certain herbicides can form n nitrosamines in agricultural soils elespuru and lijinsky 1973 pancholy 1978 to avoid the interference from these potential precursors we ensured that no fecal wastes or pesticides were applied to the field chen and young 2008 leavey roback et al 2016 ndma and ndea were detected in the paddy field runoff at very low concentrations 3 5 ng l fig 3d our results were consistent with the previous study zeng et al 2016b which also found that agricultural runoff contributed much less n nitrosamines to river water comparing with other types of sources 3 3 source evaluation and occurrence of n nitrosamines in the pearl river to estimate the inputs and emissions of the n nitrosamines in industrial and domestic wwtps the daily mass loads and the mass balances were calculated by multiplying the concentrations by the flow rates of wastewater see table 1 and the results were summarized in table 2 in the industrial wastewater daily inputs of individual n nitrosamines in the wwtps ranged from 0 21 to 6590 mg specifically about 7310 mg of ndma entered the nine wwtps daily which was one to two orders of magnitude higher than other n nitrosamines species as indicated by the negative mass loss ratios see table 2 the treatment processes for the textile printing and dyeing the electroplating and the pharmaceutical plant c wastewaters increased the concentration of ndma in the outlets remarkably ndma was significantly enriched during the treatment processes for electroplating and pharmaceutical plant c wastewaters resulting in the mass loss ratios of 120 and 684 respectively as discussed in the previous section this was likely due to the high concentrations of dithiocarbamate and ppcps as the precursors in the influents in addition the treatment by sbr see table 1 efficiently removed 89 3 of ndma in pulping wastewaters it is noteworthy to mention that nmor and npyr were significantly formed during oxidation process with naclo for the electroplating wastewater see table 2 besides that nmor was also formed during the treatment of food processing pulping and pharmaceutical plant c in the domestic wwtps the mass of individual n nitrosamines in the influents of the two wwtps varied from 109 mg d to 5950 mg d daily about 6710 mg of ndma was loaded in the two wwtps the amount of ndma was one order of magnitude higher than ndea and nmor the treatment processes efficiently removed ndma by 80 4 but only removed 15 3 of nmor mass of ndea increased by about four times after the treatment in plant 2 but it was reduced by 47 3 in plant 1 the differences between the two plants on ndea removal efficiencies might be caused by different compositions of the influents as well as the wastewater treatment procedures specifically the biological treatments using anaerobic anoxic oxic aao technique showed a higher removal efficiency of cod as well as ammoniacal nitrogen than using anoxic oxic ao technique zhang et al 1997 the mass of ndma ndea and nmor in the effluents of the domestic wastewater treatment plants were similar ranging from 775 mg d to 1320 mg d this indicated that the domestic wastewaters might be the important sources for ndma ndea and nmor five of the eight target n nitrosamines compounds were found in the pearl river waters including ndma 5 7 6 1 ng l geometric mean ndea 1 7 1 6 ng l npyr 2 2 1 2 ng l nmor 2 2 1 4 ng l and ndba 4 9 174 ng l with the detection frequencies of 81 63 25 34 and 97 respectively we found that ndba was the most abundant n nitrosamines species 45 followed by ndma 41 ndea 9 nmor 3 and npyr 2 respectively the detected species of n nitrosamines in the river water were consistent with the ones we found in the effluents of industrial and domestic wastewater notably high concentration of ndba up to 1090 ng l was found in the dongjiang river at site d9 fig 4 c this site was polluted by industrial wastewater discharged from metallurgy paper making and garment factories we suspect that there were inputs from unknown industries which were not included in our investigations but that might be releasing high concentrations of ndba the observed highest ndma concentration in our study 24 ng l was lower than 100 ng l the health risk thresholds suggested by world health organization who who 2011 due to the fact that the pearl river water is the main drinking water sources in this region occurrences of n nitrosamines in the pearl river have to be monitored and controlled in order to reduce the risk for contamination of drinking water sources considering the geographical distribution of n nitrosamines no significant differences of n nitrosamines anova p 0 05 were observed among the xijiang river beijiang river and dongjiang river data available in table s4 this could be attributed to the close hydraulic connection of the three main rivers at the downstream of the pearl river lu et al 2007 however the compositions of n nitrosamines varied in different rivers in the upper reaches of xijiang and dongjiang river the ndba was dominant in the middle and lower reaches ndma was the most abundant species and it was detected at higher concentrations than those obtained in the upper reaches fig 4 a and c p 0 05 remarkably the highest concentration of ndma was found at site x5 where a civil sludge treatment plant and unknown sludge discharges into xijiang river were found in the upper reaches the lower concentrations were observed in the lower reaches of x5 see fig 3 this might be due to photodegradation of ndma as well as its precursors during transport from x5 to x6 where the half life time about 1 4 0 5 h for ndma photodegradation was similar to the estimated travel time one hour plumlee and reinhard 2007 woods and dickenson 2016 a similar trend was also observed in the lower reaches of d9 and thus we suspected that this might be caused by the dilution from the upper reaches which was indicated in fig 1 moreover the higher detection frequencies of ndea were found in the beijiang 75 and dongjiang rivers 92 in comparison with the one obtained in xijiang river 38 nmor and npyr were exclusively detected in the lower reaches of dongjiang river rather than in other rivers as discussed in section 3 1 this might be due to the inputs from the specific wastewaters including electroplating food processing pulping wastewaters from the cities of dongguan and guangzhou 4 conclusion our study investigated occurrence and source characteristics of n nitrosamines in the prd of china providing the spatial distribution of n nitrosamines in the pearl river as well as the characteristics of the different wastewaters the wastewater samples were collected and analyzed in order to delineate the n nitrosamines compositions the results indicated that ndma and nmor were the most prevalent n nitrosamines species in industrial wastewaters a notably high concentration of ndma up to 4000 ng l was found in the effluents of the textile printing and dyeing as well as the electroplating by comparison other n nitrosamines species were found at concentrations lower than 40 ng l in other types of industrial effluents ndma ndea and nmor occurred in all domestic wastewaters in the aquaculture pond water a remarkably high concentration of ndba was detected moreover a significant amount of ndma npyr and nmor were formed during the treatment processes for the electroplating wastewater this might be due to high levels of their precursors at the influents as well as the utilization of naclo as an oxidant one of the two investigated domestic wwtps was also forming ndea internally leading to about 1180 mg daily emission toward the pearl river a notably high mass load about 10000 mg day was obtained for the wastewater of the textile printing and dyeing as well as the electroplating acting as the major sources for ndma in the pearl river analysis of the water samples collected from the three major rivers including xijiang river beijiang river and dongjiang river showed that ndma ndea npyr nmor and ndba occurred at concentrations below 5 ng l in the pearl river nmor and npyr were found most abundant in the dongjiang river due to the intensive inputs from the surrounding industries in summary our study provides valuable and unique information about the occurrences of n nitrosamines as well as the characteristics of different wastewater sources in the prd region of china acknowledgments we are grateful to the three anonymous reviewers for their

18535,n nitrosamines in water have drawn significant concerns for the health of water consumers due to their carcinogenic properties n nitrosamines are formed during disinfection of wastewater as well as different industrial and agricultural processes this study characterized the n nitrosamines compositions in eleven different wastewaters in the pearl river delta prd in southeast china and the spatial distributions and the abundances of n nitrosamines in the pearl river water were detected the results indicated that five n nitrosamines species including n nitrosodimethylamine ndma n nitrosodiethylamine ndea n nitrosopyrrolidine npyr n nitrosomorpholine nmor and n nitrosodibutylamine ndba were found in the industrial wastewater samples in the prd remarkably high concentrations of ndma up to 4000 ng l were found in the wastewaters from the textile printing and dyeing as well as the electroplating whereas ndma ndea and nmor were detected in the domestic wastewaters at concentrations lower than 15 ng l moreover we found that certain treatment processes for the electroplating wastewater could form a significant amount of ndma npyr and nmor analyses of the pearl river water samples showed occurrences of different n nitrosamines species including ndma 5 7 ng l ndea 1 7 ng l npyr 2 2 ng l nmor 2 2 ng l and ndba 4 9 ng l the abundances of n nitrosamines species varied spatially due to the inputs from the different sources thus our study provides unique and valuable information for occurrences abundances and source characteristics of n nitrosamines in the prd graphical abstract image 1 keywords n nitrosamines wastewater wwtps the pearl river source characterization 1 introduction occurrences of n nitrosamines in both drinking water and wastewater have been receiving increasing attention due to their toxic properties and high aqueous mobilities choi and valentine 2002 krasner et al 2013 mitch et al 2003 padhye et al 2009 sedlak et al 2005 zeng and mitch 2015 certain n nitrosamines compounds are even classified as probable human carcinogens and mutagens epa iris 2012 continuous release of these compounds into natural aquatic systems can cause serious health problems for water consumers due to the fact that n nitrosodimethylamine ndma is unlikely to be completely removed this compound is the most frequently detected n nitrosamine in drinking waters hu et al 2008 jurado sánchez et al 2010 kodamatani et al 2009 planas et al 2008 often together with other n nitrosamines species ndma also occurs in wastewater hu et al 2008 jurado sánchez et al 2009

water jurado sánchez et al 2010 walse and mitch 2008 n nitrosamines in water have different sources they are mainly formed during chloramination and ozonation treatment processes of drinking water and wastewater krasner et al 2013 and they are also unintentionally formed through different industrial processes kosaka et al 2010 for instance rubber manufacturing and processing leather tanning metal casting metalworking using semisynthetic cutting fluids and food processing can contribute to n nitrosamines formation ducos et al 1988 epa 2016 who 2002 in domestic sewage both greywater and black water contain n nitrosamines and their precursors among which laundry water serves as a primary source zeng and mitch 2015 the study of sedlak et al 2005 also suggested that domestic sources are also important for n nitrosamines accumulation in wastewater effluents from animal husbandry operations contribute to the formation of ndma n nitrosopyrrolidine npyr and their precursors zeng et al 2016a aquaculture pond also contains high levels of ndma n nitrosodiethylamine ndea and n nitrosodibutylamine ndba chen et al 2017 characterization of different sources compositions of n nitrosamines is of primary importance to control these pollutants in natural aquatic systems numerous studies have attempted to identify n nitrosamines compositions in different wastewaters including influents and effluents from wastewater treatment plants wwtps deng et al 2018 krauss et al 2009 schreiber and mitch 2006 sedlak et al 2005 greywaters and blackwaters zeng and mitch 2015 and direct industrial discharges ma et al 2012 previous studies revealed that ndma was the most abundant n nitrosamine species in effluents of wwtps and the concentration of ndma varied from 5 to 5000 ng l krauss et al 2009 sedlak et al 2005 zhou et al 2009 also different sources might contribute to specific n nitrosamine species the recent studies in china revealed that frequent occurrences of n nitrosamines in rivers were due to contamination by industrial and domestic wastewaters bei et al 2016 ma et al 2012 thus a careful investigation and evaluation of different n nitrosamines sources especially different industrial inputs is urgently needed in china during the last two decades in the pearl river delta prd rapid industrialization intensive agricultural activities municipal developments and increasing utilization of chemicals have caused a series of environmental problems fu et al 2003 xu et al 2007 due to the large population over 40 million as well as the high fraction of untreated wastewater in this region more than 50 occurrences of n nitrosamines in the prd are rising a great concern for public health chen et al 2017 liu et al 2016 xu et al 2007 a previous study detected six n nitrosamines in surface waters and groundwater in the prd region the ndma concentrations were up to 258 ng l while the concentrations of ndea npyr n nitrosomorpholine nmor and ndba were lower than 10 7 ng l chen et al 2017 recently china has carried out very strict environmental laws and regulations to prevent water pollution with a primary focus on waste reduction and development of individual industrial wwtps however untreated discharges from relatively small industries still might pose as important sources for n nitrosamines emissions chen et al 2017 ho and hui 2001 the main industries in the prd region include chemical and biochemical products manufacturing petrochemicals printed circuit board bleaching dyeing pulp and paper pharmaceuticals electroplating and food processing ho and hui 2001 china mee 2019 given the complexities of the wastewater effluents in this region which include industrial domestic and agricultural inputs it is a challenging task to characterize and evaluate the different sources of n nitrosamines although such studies are essential for source allocation and control of n nitrosamines pollution to the best of our knowledge no studies yet investigated n nitrosamines in different industrial or domestic wastewaters in the prd therefore the main goals of this study are 1 to characterize the n nitrosamines species in different wastewaters in the prd 2 to evaluate different sources and wastewater treatment processes for n nitrosamines formation and 3 to investigate the occurrences and abundances of n nitrosamines in the main streams of the pearl river including xijiang river beijiang river and dongjiang river 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and water sampling the prd has a monsoon climate with average annual precipitation between 1600 and 2000 mm as shown in fig 1 the study area is an alluvial plain and it is located in the mainland of the prd southeast china our sampling work was conducted in january 2018 we made sure that there were no rainfall events during the week before each sampling date to avoid dilution effects by rain thirty eight river water samples were collected from the three main rivers including xijiang river x1 13 in fig 1 beijiang river b1 12 and dongjiang river d1 13 the sampling locations are from the upper reaches wuzhou city qingyuan city and heyuan city to the lower reaches near the estuary of the south china sea see fig 1 duplicate samples were taken in the selected sites during sampling to consider river water fluctuation the detailed information of sampling is available in section s1 of the supplementary material wastewater samples were collected from different types of industrial plants domestic sewage treatment plants agricultural wastewaters and paddy field runoff at the center of the prd detailed information available in table 1 the sampling locations are given in fig 1 different treatment processes are applied to the industrial and domestic wastewaters to meet the standards for discharges see table 1 to evaluate the removal efficiencies of wastewater treatments for n nitrosamines duplicate samples were collected from the wastewater inlets and outlets moreover the effluents from the metal surface treatment plant as well as one of the three pharmaceutical plants are discharged into the sewage pipes while the rest are directly discharged into surrounding rivers at each site one liter of water was collected and stored in an amber glass bottle and 100 mg of sodium thiosulfate was immediately added for de chlorination additionally the parameters including ph temperature oxidation reduction potential orp electrical conductivity ec and dissolved oxygen do were monitored in situ by a portable ysi pro 2030 ysi incorporated oh us all samples were transported to the lab on the sampling day stored in the dark at 4 c and analyzed within seven days 2 2 sample pretreatment and analysis the procedures for sample pretreatment and analysis were described in detail previously by chen et al 2017 briefly after filtration of the samples 2 g of nahco3 ph ca 8 and 25 ng of ndma d6 recovery surrogate were added to each sample and then the samples were extracted through activated charcoal cartridges 2 g 6 ml 80 120 mesh anpel laboratory technologies inc shanghai which were preconditioned with dichloromethane methanol and ultrapure water at flow rates of 20 ml min the analytes were eluted from the cartridges with dichloromethane 12 ml and then concentrated under a stream of ultrahigh purity nitrogen 99 99 to a final volume of 500 μl the internal standard ndpa d14 25 ng was added prior to the instrument analysis the extracts were stored at 20 c till analysis the samples were analyzed on an agilent 7890b gas chromatograph gc coupled with an agilent 7000c triple quadrupole mass spectrometer ms ms with tandem capillary columns of agilent db 35 ms and agilent hp 5 ms using the method described in the previous study of chen et al 2017 ultrahigh purity helium 99 99 was used as the carrier gas at constant flows of 2 0 ml min in the db 35 ms and hp 5 ms columns 2 3 quality assurance and quality control the concentrations of the n nitrosamines were quantified by the internal standard isotope dilution method using the average relative response factors determined from the standard calibration runs the absolute recoveries of ndma d6 ranged from 51 to 70 average standard deviation 60 5 a laboratory blank was incorporated into the analytical procedures in every batch of 10 samples no target compounds were detected in the blank samples the method detection limits mdls were calculated by multiplying the standard deviation of seven replicates by the student s t value of 3 14 one side t distribution for six degrees of freedom at the 99 confidence level mcdonald et al 2012 the mdls of the n nitrosamines species are 0 50 ng l ndma 0 60 ng l n nitrosomethylethylamine nmea 0 90 ng l ndea 0 90 ng l n nitrosodi n propylamine ndpa 0 70 ng l nmor 1 1 ng l npyr 0 90 ng l npip and 1 0 ng l ndba respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of n nitrosamines in industrial wastewaters the concentrations of n nitrosamines in the seven types of industrial effluents in the prd are shown in fig 2 data available in table s2 ndma and nmor were detected in all the inlet and outlet samples where the concentrations ranged from 2 3 to 4320 average 754 1450 ng l and from 2 4 to 107 13 25 ng l respectively the variations of ndea npyr and ndba concentrations were 1 7 79 avg 6 4 18 3 9 to 297 19 68 and 3 8 to 19 3 0 4 5 ng l respectively in our case ndma and nmor were ubiquitous in all industrial effluents and they also occurred in the effluents of the domestic wastewaters ndea npyr and ndba were less frequently detected comparing with ndma where the detection frequencies were 44 33 and 28 respectively no significant reduction of n nitrosamines was observed during the wastewater treatments a previous study also found that ndma was not removed efficiently during the secondary effluent treatment sedlak et al 2005 it is noteworthy to mention that a high ndma content up to 4000 ng l was found in the effluents of the textile printing and dyeing as well as the electroplating which might be attributed to the use of ndma as industrial solvents aflaki et al 2017 it was also reported that various industrial sources caused incidental pollution and unusually high concentrations of ndma in wwtps krasner et al 2009 krauss et al 2009 padhye et al 2009 zhou et al 2009 thus direct discharges from industrial wastewaters in the prd serve as important sources for n nitrosamines occurrences in receiving waters textile printing and dyeing wastewater the average concentrations of ndma ndea npyr nmor and ndba in the inlets were 3290 137 79 4 6 9 9 0 8 3 7 0 2 and 19 0 5 ng l respectively fig 2a ndma was the most abundant compound in the inlets accounting for 97 of the total n nitrosamines in addition unusually high conductivity values 5650 μs cm and chemical oxygen demand codcr 218 mg l were obtained in the inlets which might be associated with high levels of sulphur naphthols antiyellowing agents azo dyes aromatic amines acetic acid soaps chromium compounds and heavy metals kosaka et al 2009 oya et al 2008 zhu et al 2018 it was found in a previous study that the high concentration of ndma 10 000 ng l in japan was mainly formed during ozonation of antiyellowing agents as ndma precursors kosaka et al 2009 textile printing and dyeing wastewaters are from washing dyeing and cleaning processes zhu et al 2018 therefore carrying high concentrations of ndma or its precursors kosaka et al 2009 oya et al 2008 after the treatment processes see table 1 the outlet ndma concentration increased to 4320 87 ng l while the concentrations of ndea npyr nmor and ndba dropped down to 15 ng l fig 2a this indicated that the treatment processes were forming ndma the decolorization and disinfection with sodium hypochlorite naclo might be the main reasons for ndma formation this could be explained by contacts of chlorine as oxidants with n nitrosamine precursors a previous study also showed that naclo enhanced the n nitrosamines formation during the wastewater treatment processes garcia rodríguez et al 2014 due to the fact that 627 textile printing and dyeing factories representing about 11 of all the industrial factories have been registered in the prd the effluents directly discharged out of these factories might significantly contribute to the occurrences of ndma in the rivers around this region the information for the licensed industrial factories with the permits for wastewater discharges was summarized in table s3 supplementary material electroplating wastewater this plant is producing circuit board manufacturing with electroplating wastewater discharging directly into surrounding rivers the average ndma and nmor concentrations of the inlets were 1780 192 and 51 3 0 ng l respectively fig 2b after treatment see table 1 the outlet concentrations increased to 3920 84 and 107 2 2 ng l respectively a previous study also indicated that ndma was formed significantly during the printed circuit board manufacturing processes resulting in 139 to 56 000 ng l of ndma in the outlets ocsd 2002 dithiocarbamate solutions used in printed circuit board manufacturing processes are the important precursors and therefore maybe the cause of the high concentrations of ndma sedlak et al 2005 furthermore npyr was formed significantly during the treatment processes and occurred at a concentration of 297 ng l fig 2b the application of naclo as an oxidant could stimulate formation of npyr notably high concentrations of npyr and nmor were obtained in the electroplating effluents this indicated that the formation of nmor might follow a different pathway since nmor is not a typical disinfection byproduct glover et al 2019 the electroplating factories only represent about 0 9 in the total number of industrial factories and these factories are mainly located in qingyuan foshan and zhongshan cities specifically contributing to ndma npyr and nmor in the surrounding rivers metal surface treatment wastewater the average concentrations of ndma ndea npyr and nmor in the inlets of metal surface treatment factory were 21 1 5 3 7 0 2 10 1 4 and 6 1 0 8 ng l respectively fig 2c after the treatment processes table 1 ndma and nmor were detected and decreased to 5 9 0 8 and 2 8 0 2 ng l respectively due to the fact that the metal surface treatment industry is one of the most important industries in the prd representing about 31 of the total industrial factories table s3 it still could be an important source for n nitrosamines in the receiving rivers food processing wastewater during food manufacturing n nitrosamines could be formed by nitrites and secondary amines hinuma et al 1990 the concentrations of ndma ndea npyr and nmor in the inlets were 9 4 0 2 2 7 0 5 5 1 0 8 and 2 3 0 2 ng l respectively fig 2d after treatment only ndma and nmor were detected and decreased to 5 9 0 1 and 4 2 0 9 ng l respectively indicating that the treatment of wastewater was effective for n nitrosamines reduction the food processing factories are mainly located in zhongshan city and makeup around 4 of the total industrial factories table s3 and therefore they serve as the minor sources for ndma and nmor in the river waters pulping wastewater in the pulping wastewater inlets ndma was the most abundant species accounting for 98 and occurred at concentrations of 97 4 8 ng l which was attributed to the high levels of precursors detected in a facility producing papers and printing materials kosaka et al 2014 nmor was also detected in the inlets at 2 4 0 3 ng l fig 2e ndma was reduced by the wastewater treatment processes down to 10 1 0 ng l removal efficiency of 89 indicating that the treatment using activated sludge was efficient for ndma removal see table 1 which was consistent with the findings in the previous study gerrity et al 2015 however formation of ndea nmor and ndba were observed at concentrations of 5 3 0 5 4 4 0 4 and 7 1 0 8 ng l respectively the pulping factories are widespread around the region which is about 10 of the total industrial factories thus the pulping wastewaters might be another major source for ndma ndea nmor and ndba in the pearl river fine chemicals wastewater the manufactured chemicals include organo silicone organo fluorine and surfactants the inlet concentrations of ndma ndea and nmor were 28 1 9 2 6 0 4 and 6 6 0 4 ng l respectively fig 2f after the treatment processes see table 1 ndma levels decreased to 14 0 7 ng l with a removal efficiency of 49 ndea nmor and ndba concentrations were also reduced down to 5 ng l the fine chemical factories are mainly located in zhongshan city and they represent 4 of the total industrial factories table s3 pharmaceutical wastewater previous works have found that the compounds bearing sulfamide hydrazine and carbamate moieties can form ndma during disinfection processes by ozonation kosaka et al 2014 2009 marti et al 2015 schmidt and brauch 2008 precursors of n nitrosamines often occur in wastewaters during manufacturing of pharmaceuticals shen and andrews 2011 and personal care products kemper et al 2010 to evaluate different pharmaceutical wastewaters for n nitrosamines formation we took the samples from the three different types of pharmaceutical effluents fig 2 g1 g3 the average concentrations for ndma and nmor in the outlets of plant a were 2 3 0 2 and 2 4 0 1 ng l respectively which halved those values detected in the inlets the similar results were obtained in the outlets of plant b but the average concentrations of ndma 5 5 0 3 ng l and nmor 4 4 1 1 ng l were slightly higher than those in pant a the ndma npyr and nmor concentrations in the inlets of plant c were 3 6 0 4 3 9 0 1 and 2 8 0 1 ng l respectively after the treatment processes see table 1 the average concentrations of ndma and nmor increased to 28 0 1 and 16 0 8 ng l in plant c respectively but the npyr was not detected the increasing concentrations of ndma and nmor in the outlet of plant c indicated that these compounds were likely formed by the biological treatment processes see table 1 our results confirm that pharmaceutical and personal care products ppcps in the wastewaters serve as the precursors for ndma and nmor formation kemper et al 2010 shen and andrews 2011 3 2 characterization of n nitrosamines in other wastewaters previous studies have investigated the occurrence of n nitrosamines in domestic wastewater krauss et al 2009 schreiber and mitch 2006 zeng and mitch 2015 and agricultural runoff elespuru and lijinsky 1973 pancholy 1978 zeng et al 2016a in order to characterize n nitrosamines species in these types of wastewaters in the prd region we also collected samples from the two domestic sewage treatment plants fig 3 a1 and a2 which were free of industrial effluents in addition we also sampled the swine wastewater fig 3 b the fishery wastewater fig 3 c1and c2 and the agricultural runoff during irrigation fig 3 d domestic sewage in the inlets of plant 1 the average ndma ndea and nmor concentrations were 13 0 9 1 8 0 1 and 7 4 0 4 ng l respectively see fig 3 a1 ndma concentrations after treatment decreased by half 6 9 0 8 ng l whereas ndea and nmor were not efficiently removed occurring at 1 0 and 7 9 0 1 ng l respectively ndma ndea and nmor were obtained in the inlets of plant 2 at 60 0 4 3 4 0 4 and 4 7 0 9 ng l respectively fig 3 a2 after the treatment ndma and nmor in plant 2 were reduced to 9 0 0 1 and 3 0 0 7 ng l respectively however ndea concentrations increased to 11 0 7 ng l thus the treatment processes reduced ndma by 46 85 while ndea and nmor were not efficiently removed since urine feces and gray water wastewater from shower bath and kitchen are major contents of domestic sewage water larsen et al 2009 they might carry and form ndma nmea ndea npyr and npip at various concentrations suzuki and mitsuoka 1985 zeng and mitch 2015 pig farm and aquaculture pond wastewaters the concentrations of n nitrosamines species in the swine wastewaters are shown in fig 3b notably high concentrations of ndma 1110 110 ng l ndea 202 4 3 ng l npyr 245 22 ng l nmor 114 14 ng l npip 168 18 ng l and ndba 226 36 ng l were detected in the swine wastewaters moreover the swine wastewater was directly discharged into the surrounding streams therefore posing as a source for n nitrosamines in the river water in the aquaculture pond ndma ndea and ndba were detected at average concentrations of 43 3 2 14 0 6 and 71 5 9 ng l respectively in which ndba was the most abundant species representing about 47 of the total n nitrosamines fig 3c these results implied that the aquaculture ponds had much higher content of ndba which was almost five times higher than it was in the other types of wastewaters this suggested that the aquaculture wastewaters were the significant source for ndba since this compound was rarely found in other wastewaters we observed that the concentrations of nitrate and doc in these two pond water were up to 41 and 7 8 mg l respectively this might be mainly due to the forages for feeding the aquatic products which were made from dry fish crabs and shells and rich in dissolved primary amines cohen et al 2005 moreover poor water replacements might enhance organic matters in the ponds since chlorine dioxide clo₂ was applied to disinfect the pond water almost every week this could potentially stimulate formation of ndma in waters containing the precursors gan et al 2015 thus intensive aquaculture systems poor water exchange activities and regular disinfection operations using clo2 might be the main reasons for the accumulation of n nitrosamines in the aquaculture pond the prd is the popular region for aquaculture in guangdong province and therefore the discharges from the pond water during the rainy seasons might also be another important source for n nitrosamines agricultural runoff previous works revealed that the reaction of nitrite with the certain herbicides can form n nitrosamines in agricultural soils elespuru and lijinsky 1973 pancholy 1978 to avoid the interference from these potential precursors we ensured that no fecal wastes or pesticides were applied to the field chen and young 2008 leavey roback et al 2016 ndma and ndea were detected in the paddy field runoff at very low concentrations 3 5 ng l fig 3d our results were consistent with the previous study zeng et al 2016b which also found that agricultural runoff contributed much less n nitrosamines to river water comparing with other types of sources 3 3 source evaluation and occurrence of n nitrosamines in the pearl river to estimate the inputs and emissions of the n nitrosamines in industrial and domestic wwtps the daily mass loads and the mass balances were calculated by multiplying the concentrations by the flow rates of wastewater see table 1 and the results were summarized in table 2 in the industrial wastewater daily inputs of individual n nitrosamines in the wwtps ranged from 0 21 to 6590 mg specifically about 7310 mg of ndma entered the nine wwtps daily which was one to two orders of magnitude higher than other n nitrosamines species as indicated by the negative mass loss ratios see table 2 the treatment processes for the textile printing and dyeing the electroplating and the pharmaceutical plant c wastewaters increased the concentration of ndma in the outlets remarkably ndma was significantly enriched during the treatment processes for electroplating and pharmaceutical plant c wastewaters resulting in the mass loss ratios of 120 and 684 respectively as discussed in the previous section this was likely due to the high concentrations of dithiocarbamate and ppcps as the precursors in the influents in addition the treatment by sbr see table 1 efficiently removed 89 3 of ndma in pulping wastewaters it is noteworthy to mention that nmor and npyr were significantly formed during oxidation process with naclo for the electroplating wastewater see table 2 besides that nmor was also formed during the treatment of food processing pulping and pharmaceutical plant c in the domestic wwtps the mass of individual n nitrosamines in the influents of the two wwtps varied from 109 mg d to 5950 mg d daily about 6710 mg of ndma was loaded in the two wwtps the amount of ndma was one order of magnitude higher than ndea and nmor the treatment processes efficiently removed ndma by 80 4 but only removed 15 3 of nmor mass of ndea increased by about four times after the treatment in plant 2 but it was reduced by 47 3 in plant 1 the differences between the two plants on ndea removal efficiencies might be caused by different compositions of the influents as well as the wastewater treatment procedures specifically the biological treatments using anaerobic anoxic oxic aao technique showed a higher removal efficiency of cod as well as ammoniacal nitrogen than using anoxic oxic ao technique zhang et al 1997 the mass of ndma ndea and nmor in the effluents of the domestic wastewater treatment plants were similar ranging from 775 mg d to 1320 mg d this indicated that the domestic wastewaters might be the important sources for ndma ndea and nmor five of the eight target n nitrosamines compounds were found in the pearl river waters including ndma 5 7 6 1 ng l geometric mean ndea 1 7 1 6 ng l npyr 2 2 1 2 ng l nmor 2 2 1 4 ng l and ndba 4 9 174 ng l with the detection frequencies of 81 63 25 34 and 97 respectively we found that ndba was the most abundant n nitrosamines species 45 followed by ndma 41 ndea 9 nmor 3 and npyr 2 respectively the detected species of n nitrosamines in the river water were consistent with the ones we found in the effluents of industrial and domestic wastewater notably high concentration of ndba up to 1090 ng l was found in the dongjiang river at site d9 fig 4 c this site was polluted by industrial wastewater discharged from metallurgy paper making and garment factories we suspect that there were inputs from unknown industries which were not included in our investigations but that might be releasing high concentrations of ndba the observed highest ndma concentration in our study 24 ng l was lower than 100 ng l the health risk thresholds suggested by world health organization who who 2011 due to the fact that the pearl river water is the main drinking water sources in this region occurrences of n nitrosamines in the pearl river have to be monitored and controlled in order to reduce the risk for contamination of drinking water sources considering the geographical distribution of n nitrosamines no significant differences of n nitrosamines anova p 0 05 were observed among the xijiang river beijiang river and dongjiang river data available in table s4 this could be attributed to the close hydraulic connection of the three main rivers at the downstream of the pearl river lu et al 2007 however the compositions of n nitrosamines varied in different rivers in the upper reaches of xijiang and dongjiang river the ndba was dominant in the middle and lower reaches ndma was the most abundant species and it was detected at higher concentrations than those obtained in the upper reaches fig 4 a and c p 0 05 remarkably the highest concentration of ndma was found at site x5 where a civil sludge treatment plant and unknown sludge discharges into xijiang river were found in the upper reaches the lower concentrations were observed in the lower reaches of x5 see fig 3 this might be due to photodegradation of ndma as well as its precursors during transport from x5 to x6 where the half life time about 1 4 0 5 h for ndma photodegradation was similar to the estimated travel time one hour plumlee and reinhard 2007 woods and dickenson 2016 a similar trend was also observed in the lower reaches of d9 and thus we suspected that this might be caused by the dilution from the upper reaches which was indicated in fig 1 moreover the higher detection frequencies of ndea were found in the beijiang 75 and dongjiang rivers 92 in comparison with the one obtained in xijiang river 38 nmor and npyr were exclusively detected in the lower reaches of dongjiang river rather than in other rivers as discussed in section 3 1 this might be due to the inputs from the specific wastewaters including electroplating food processing pulping wastewaters from the cities of dongguan and guangzhou 4 conclusion our study investigated occurrence and source characteristics of n nitrosamines in the prd of china providing the spatial distribution of n nitrosamines in the pearl river as well as the characteristics of the different wastewaters the wastewater samples were collected and analyzed in order to delineate the n nitrosamines compositions the results indicated that ndma and nmor were the most prevalent n nitrosamines species in industrial wastewaters a notably high concentration of ndma up to 4000 ng l was found in the effluents of the textile printing and dyeing as well as the electroplating by comparison other n nitrosamines species were found at concentrations lower than 40 ng l in other types of industrial effluents ndma ndea and nmor occurred in all domestic wastewaters in the aquaculture pond water a remarkably high concentration of ndba was detected moreover a significant amount of ndma npyr and nmor were formed during the treatment processes for the electroplating wastewater this might be due to high levels of their precursors at the influents as well as the utilization of naclo as an oxidant one of the two investigated domestic wwtps was also forming ndea internally leading to about 1180 mg daily emission toward the pearl river a notably high mass load about 10000 mg day was obtained for the wastewater of the textile printing and dyeing as well as the electroplating acting as the major sources for ndma in the pearl river analysis of the water samples collected from the three major rivers including xijiang river beijiang river and dongjiang river showed that ndma ndea npyr nmor and ndba occurred at concentrations below 5 ng l in the pearl river nmor and npyr were found most abundant in the dongjiang river due to the intensive inputs from the surrounding industries in summary our study provides valuable and unique information about the occurrences of n nitrosamines as well as the characteristics of different wastewater sources in the prd region of china acknowledgments we are grateful to the three anonymous reviewers for their

18536,past waterborne outbreaks have demonstrated that informed vulnerability assessment of drinking water supplies is paramount for the provision of safe drinking water although current monitoring frameworks are not designed to account for short term peak concentrations of fecal microorganisms in source waters the recent development of online microbial monitoring technologies is expected to fill this knowledge gap in this study online near real time monitoring of β d glucuronidase gluc activity was conducted for 1 5 years at an urban drinking water intake impacted by multiple point sources of fecal pollution parallel routine and event based monitoring of e coli and online measurement of physico chemistry were performed at the intake and their dynamics compared over time gluc activity fluctuations ranged from seasonal to hourly time scales all peak contamination episodes occurred between late fall and early spring following intense rainfall and or snowmelt in the absence of rainfall recurrent daily fluctuations in gluc activity and culturable e coli were observed at the intake a pattern otherwise ignored by regulatory monitoring cross correlation analysis of time series retrieved from the drinking water intake and an upstream water resource recovery facility wrrf demonstrated a hydraulic connection between the two sites sewage by passes from the same wrrf were the main drivers of intermittent gluc activity and e coli peaks at the drinking water intake following intense precipitation and or snowmelt near real time monitoring of fecal pollution through gluc activity enabled a thorough characterization of the frequency duration and amplitude of peak contamination periods at the urban drinking water intake while providing crucial information for the identification of the dominant upstream fecal pollution sources to the best of our knowledge this is the first characterization of a hydraulic connection between a wrrf and a downstream drinking water intake across hourly to seasonal timescales using high frequency microbial monitoring data ultimately this should help improve source water protection through catchment mitigation actions especially in a context of de facto wastewater reuse graphical abstract image 1 keywords escherichia coli sewage by pass combined sewer overflows de facto wastewater reuse catchment microbial dynamics online monitoring 1 introduction safe water supply is essential for human health and sustainable growth at a global scale treated surface water from rivers lakes reservoirs accounts for at least 50 of the drinking water needs iwa 2019 yet most of these supplies are affected by fecal pollution and their integrity is increasingly threatened by growing populations urbanization and climate change khan et al 2015 who 2017 consequently unplanned de facto wastewater reuse through abstraction of surface water impacted by treated and or untreated wastewater for drinking water production has become common practice worldwide drewes et al 2017 rice et al 2013 intense precipitation and snowmelt episodes can substantially deteriorate the microbiological quality of source waters as they trigger the release of untreated sewage into the receiving drinking water supplies through combined sewer overflows csos and or water resource recovery facilities wrrfs by passes madoux humery et al 2016 tolouei et al 2019 tornevi et al 2014 young et al 2015 in developed countries large waterborne outbreaks have mainly occurred following extreme water related weather events cann et al 2013 curriero et al 2001 csos and wastewater bypasses typically discharge over the course of a few hours but they can generate rapid short term increases in fecal contaminant concentrations in rivers jalliffier verne et al 2016 madoux humery et al 2015 ouattara et al 2014 weyrauch et al 2010 identifying peak contamination periods and understanding the occurrence fate and transport of fecal contaminants upstream of water abstraction sites is therefore crucial for prioritizing actions towards mitigation of fecal pollution sources and human health protection who 2016 this need becomes even more urgent as the vulnerability of drinking water sources to fecal pollution is expected to grow with global changes jalliffier verne et al 2017 who 2017 current monitoring practices for source waters monthly to weekly daily sampling at best are not suited for reliable identification of hazardous events as infrequent manual sampling easily misses episodic contamination spikes madrid and zayas 2007 signor and ashbolt 2006 stadler et al 2008 this is due to the highly fluctuating nature of microbial temporal dynamics in water boehm 2007 burnet et al 2014 but also to methodological limitations of standard assays which rely on culture based enumeration of fib that require at least 24 h incubation periods madoux humery et al 2016 demonstrated the limitations of current methodologies for reliable identification and characterization of peak e coli concentrations in drinking water supplies impacted by intermittent csos advocating for the need of online monitoring rapid and high frequency monitoring of microbial water quality therefore represents a crucial step towards efficient identification and management of hazardous events in drinking water supplies in recent years online technologies capable of measuring microbial parameters at high frequency hourly have been developed and successfully implemented in various field settings from source to the tap iwa 2018 these technologies include flow cytometry besmer et al 2014 page et al 2017 enzymatic activity ender et al 2017 ryzinska paier et al 2014 stadler et al 2016 tryland et al 2015 as well as optical and humic acid like fluorescence højris et al 2016 sorensen et al 2015 enzyme based assays specifically quantify the occurrence of fecal indicator bacteria fib such as e coli by targeting metabolic enzymes already in use in conventional culture based assays for these bacteria in the case of e coli the activity of β d glucuronidase gluc enzyme is predominantly correlated to the occurrence of e coli in water farnleitner et al 2001 fiksdal et al 1994 garcia armisen et al 2005 although cross reactions with other fecal bacteria exist fiksdal and tryland 2008 recent studies have demonstrated that online gluc activity monitoring provided an unprecedented wealth of information on the temporal dynamics of microbial water quality in various habitats and that gluc activity could represent a valuable early warning tool for fecal pollution of water resources burnet et al 2019 ender et al 2017 ryzinska paier et al 2014 stadler et al 2016 stadler et al 2019a also stadler et al 2019b demonstrated how automated gluc activity monitoring contributed to understanding the sources and pathways of fecal pollution in an agricultural headwater catchment most studies on the use of online gluc activity as biochemical surrogate of fecal pollution have not been conducted in the context of drinking water supply yet near real time monitoring of microbial water quality could provide valuable knowledge on the sources and pathways in these environments and improve water quality assessment and management the objectives of the present study were therefore to gain new insights into the sources and processes driving microbial water quality in an urban drinking water supply using near real time monitoring of gluc activity for more than 1 5 years first we sought to unravel the temporal scales of variation in gluc activity and explicitly characterize peak contamination events secondly we contextualized the short and long term gluc activity trends using available online physico chemistry as well as hydrometeorological and sewershed data in order to understand the drivers of the temporal patterns in microbiological water quality thirdly we investigated the relationships between gluc activity and culturable e coli as well as online physico chemical parameters through routine and event based sampling to evaluate the benefit of online microbial monitoring we finally propose an optimized strategy for targeted collection of microbial water quality data using online monitoring of gluc activity to the best of our knowledge this is the first study using high frequency microbial monitoring in water supplies for the identification of fecal contaminant sources 2 material and methods 2 1 site description the studied drinking water treatment plant dwtp draws water from a 42 km long river located in the greater montreal area in southwestern quebec canada the river originates from the st lawrence ottawa river system and feeds four additional dwtps which serve 556 000 people in total the surrounding catchment adjacent to the river is predominantly characterized by urban land use with a total of 9 water resources recovery facilities wrrfs and 190 combined sewer overflows csos discharging un treated wastewater intermittently to the river among these 4 wrrfs and 37 cso outfalls are located upstream the studied dwtp intake 3 wrrfs and 30 cso outfalls occur within the intermediate protection zone of the intake fig 1 intermediate protection areas of drinking water intakes encompass a 10 km river stretch upstream from the intake mddelcc 2016 although agricultural land is limited in the investigated area additional diffuse sources of e coli could contribute to the faecal pollution load at the dwtp intake based on 26 years of data 1981 2016 the annual average river flowrate ranges from 140 to 315 m3 s 1 and flowrates are highest in april and may and lowest from july to september monthly averages ranging between 380 and 468 m3 s 1 and between 144 and 177 m3 s 1 respectively environment canada 2019 2 2 sampling strategy samples were collected routinely three days per week between monday and thursday and analyzed for e coli concentrations by the dwtp staff over the study period november 2016 to may 2018 additional high frequency sampling was conducted for 24 48 h using an isco 6712 autosampler teledyne in parallel to online monitoring of gluc activity these campaigns were performed under dry weather conditions absence of rainfall or snowmelt 72 h prior sampling and during contamination events following rainfall snowmelt episodes collected samples were selected at bi hourly frequency along the gluc activity pollutograph for further enumeration of culturable e coli online gluc activity measurements do not involve a pre filtration step as for the manual assay garcia armisen et al 2005 therefore we tested for possible soluble interferents that could contribute to the total gluc activity signal fiksdal and tryland 2008 in march 2018 six additional samples one sample every 4 h were filtered through a sterile 47 mm 0 22 μm pore size mixed cellulose ester membrane filter millipore for the measurement of gluc activity in the soluble 0 22 μm fraction of the sample in a subset of collected samples 1 sample every 6 h culturable e coli were also enumerated in triplicate to determine the analytical variability associated with the culture based assay the analytical variability of gluc activity measurements was low not exceeding 5 on average burnet et al 2019 2 3 culture based enumeration of e coli enumeration of culturable e coli during routine and event based monitoring was performed by membrane filtration using usepa method 1604 usepa 2002 during three additional high frequency sampling campaigns temporal fluctuations in e coli concentrations were assessed using defined substrate technology colilert quanti tray 2000 idexx by following the instructions of the manufacturer previous investigations showed that usepa 1604 and colilert assay were highly correlated r 0 9 burnet et al 2019 2 4 online monitoring of β d glucuronidase gluc activity near real time monitoring of β d glucuronidase gluc activity was performed with a coliminder industrial instrument vwm solutions gmbh at the raw water from november 2016 to may 2018 the analytical validation of the technology precision and robustness has been recently completed within the study area burnet et al 2019 the instrument was continuously supplied with raw water from the same pipe used for turbidity conductivity and temperature online monitoring measurement frequency was set at bi hourly frequency 12 measurements per day or hourly frequency during selected peak contamination events raw data were continuously recorded transmitted via a wireless modem and accessed downloaded remotely the rate of fluorescence emitted during the enzymatic reaction in the flow through photometric measurement chamber of the device was expressed in volts per second and converted into modified fishman units per 100 ml mfu 100 ml 1 calibration by the manufacturer used commercial enzyme standards g7396 25ku type ix a β d glucuronidase from e coli sigma aldrich with further details provided by koschelnik et al 2015 as determined by the manufacturer the limit of quantification defined as the reproducible signal exceeding background noise was 0 8 mmfu 100 ml 1 since the measurement process itself is based on light intensity measurements of fluorescence transmission and reference light intensity calibration of instrument sensors and amplification as well as checking of measurement chamber cleanliness was automatically performed every 25 measurements light calibration was intended for removal of any long term effects of changing sensor properties or possible build up of scale on the glass of the measurement chamber the temperature in the measurement chamber was continuously controlled and recorded reagents and buffers were stored as recommended by the manufacturer the fluorogenic substrate cm ec quickdetect reagent a vwm solutions gmbh and buffer cm ec quickdetect reagent b vwm solutions gmbh were stored at 20 c and 4 c respectively before use during the deployment phase as well as during laboratory experiments both solutions were maintained at 4 c in the cooling block of the instruments reagent quality was ensured by vwms quality control process using defined enzyme calibration solutions reagent dosage in the device was verified through blank tests which were automatically carried out with milli q water after 24 measurements to correct for any offset in gluc activity measurements the gluc activity measured during blank tests assay buffer assay substrate milli q water was automatically deducted from the measurement results of raw water samples to eliminate a possible influence of substrate quality and aging ex autohydrolysis of the reagent 2 5 hydrometeorology and online physico chemistry raw water turbidity surface scatter sc turbidimeter hach conductivity temperature and ph sc100 hach were measured online at the intake and operated by the dwtp staff flow rate data were extracted from the public repository of environment canada environment canada 2019 daily rainfall data was obtained from the municipal partner for the closest rain gauge fig 1 2 6 combined sewer overflows wrrf by passes and treated effluent discharges sewershed data were provided by the partner municipality location duration and frequency were gathered whenever available for each combined sewer overflow cso outfall located upstream from the drinking water intake as complete transversal mixing should occur within a distance equal to 100 1 000 river widths jirka et al 2004 and given the proximity of upstream pollution sources to the drinking water intake within the investigated stretch of the river only those discharge points located on the same riverbank were suspected of impacting the dwtp intake fig 1 continuously measured process data online flow rate in raw sewage and uv fluence applied to effluents were obtained for the wrrf located 6 km upstream from the drinking water intake the treatment at this wrrf includes degritting and settling followed by uv disinfection of the primary effluent the residence time in the wrrf averages 2 5 h for an average flow rate of 51 600 m3 day 1 during the study period but it can drop to 1 5 h during peak flow rates of 75 000 m3 day 1 g filiatrault personal communication additional information on the frequency duration and volumes of the sewage by passes recorded at the wrrf during the study period was obtained from the municipality 2 7 statistical analyses cross correlation and linear regression analyses were performed to investigate the dependency between time series for the parameters measured during the study period cross correlation analysis was performed to assess the lag time between time series at the wrrf and at the downstream dwtp for the wrrf discharge rates were only available for the plant inlet raw sewage but were considered representative of treated effluent discharge rates for the dtwp intake online gluc activity measurements were used considering the seasonal patterns of gluc activity these analyses were conducted for two separate periods of the year the first period referred to as high gluc activity encompassed 8 months between fall and early spring after the last snowmelt while the second period referred to as low gluc activity spanned over the remaining 4 months the time lag between the wrrf effluent and the downstream dwtp intake depends both on the discharge rate in the wrrf and the river flow rate as both time series discharge rate in raw sewage and gluc activity at downstream dwtp did not possess the same measurement frequency they were linearly interpolated for a common temporal x axis correlation analysis chatfield 2003 between the variables were then performed using the linear correlation coefficient and linear regression analysis the cross correlation measured the similarity of the first time series and the shifted copies of the second one and the delay between measurements was estimated by selecting the highest cross correlation coefficient 0 94 and 0 84 for high gluc activity and low gluc activity datasets respectively linear regression analyses were performed between gluc activity online physico chemistry e coli river flow rate and wrrf discharge rate for the gluc activity periods as defined above estimated lag times between wrrf effluent and dwtp intake were integrated into regression analyses all statistical analyses were performed in matlab mathworks 3 results 3 1 hydrometeorological conditions fig 2 shows the hydrological and meteorological conditions of the investigated area from november 17 2016 to may 31 2018 in comparison to historical measurements the study period was characterized by higher than average precipitation fig s3a monthly rainfall exceeded the monthly averages 1981 2010 for 14 out of the 19 months of the study this trend was particularly pronounced from january to may 2017 during which monthly rainfall accumulation was 1 5 3 2 fold higher than the 30 year averages the rainiest month of the study was april 2017 169 7 mm and highest daily precipitation was recorded on may 1 2017 58 1 mm the monthly mean snow cover observed during the study ranged between 1 cm november 2017 and 15 cm february 2018 and was similar to the monthly mean cover 30 year average fig s3b highest daily flow rates were recorded in may 2017 1080 m3 s 1 following cumulative snowmelt and rainfall episodes that resulted in the 2017 spring flood in the greater montreal area during and following this spring flood monthly flow rates from may 2017 to july 2017 exceeded historical 1981 2016 monthly averages by 1 4 2 4 times fig s3c lowest monthly flow rates were measured in november 2016 83 m3 s 1 3 2 near real time monitoring of β d glucuronidase activity at the drinking water intake high frequency monitoring of gluc activity yielded a total of 5 992 measurements in addition a total of 223 blank measurements were carried out by the device and generated average gluc activities of 0 7 1 3 mmfu 100 ml 1 which were automatically deducted from raw water gluc activity the latter ranged from 2 2 to 56 6 mmfu 100 ml 1 with an average of 11 3 mmfu 100 ml 1 and a 95th percentile of 27 7 mmfu 100 ml 1 the high gluc activity and low gluc activity periods displayed an average gluc activity of 15 2 7 5 mmfu 100 ml 1 n 3 895 and 5 3 2 1 mmfu 100 ml 1 n 2 097 respectively gluc activities exceeding the 95th percentile value defined here as peaks occurred during 15 time periods over the 1 5 years these gluc activity peaks lasted on average 36 h but could be observed for up to 10 days the longest gluc activity peak episodes occurred following snowmelt events fig 2 gluc activity medians were 2 to 4 times lower in summer compared to the other seasons fig s2 the variability in gluc activities was also lower during summer months compared to the rest of the year daily patterns were recurrently observed at the intake gluc activity increased overnight before decreasing during the day fig 3 a almost 75 of gluc activity daily maxima occurred between 10 p m and 7 a m fig 3b in the absence of rainfall or snowmelt events the amplitude of these daily fluctuations increased from 2 mmfu 100 ml 1 in summer to 5 mmfu 100 ml 1 between fall and spring figs 4 5 figs s4 s5 measurements of gluc activity in the soluble 0 22 μm fraction representing the extracellular gluc activity and or soluble interferents displayed a stable background signal of 2 4 mmfu 100 ml 1 which constituted 15 of the total gluc activity signal fig 3a 3 3 routine and event based monitoring of escherichia coli at the drinking water intake the 1 5 year routine monitoring of e coli at the intake 3 days a week n 220 samples in total yielded a mean concentration of 132 cfu 100 ml 1 min 1 to max 1 100 cfu 100 ml 1 95th percentile of 410 cfu 100 ml 1 and a median concentration of 80 cfu 100 ml 1 the seasonal pattern of e coli concentrations was less pronounced than that observed for gluc activity fig s2 during event based sampling in february march and april 2017 a total of 65 samples were collected along the pollutographs as defined by hourly gluc activity measurements and maximal e coli concentrations reached 2 720 cfu 100 ml 1 during the three event based sampling campaigns peak e coli concentrations were synchronous with peak gluc activities fig 4 3 4 treated wastewater discharges by passes and combined sewer overflows the wrrf located 6 km upstream from the drinking water intake fig 1 released effluents that were uv disinfected all year round but the fluence varied seasonally and was highest from the end of july to early october fig 2 untreated sewage degritting only was released into the river during by pass events recorded for 148 days out of 561 days snowmelt and rainfall accounted for 95 of these by passes while only 5 occurred during dry weather daily by pass volumes caused by rainfall and or snowmelt ranged from 27 to 39 848 m3 average of 8 582 m3 and were higher compared to dry weather by pass events 17 1 877 m3 average of 691 m3 a significant p 0 001 cross correlation was found between the flow rate at the wrrf and the gluc activity measured at the downstream dwtp intake fig 6 for cso discharges located within the intermediate protection area of the intake i e outfalls 5 to 22 fig 1 half of them discharged over the study period accounting for 58 of the discharge events for all 22 csos located on the south riverbank fig s1 among them outfalls 5 7 were the most active accounting for almost 65 of the cso events recorded within the intermediate protection area they were followed by cso no 17 21 which is one of the closest discharge points 2 km upstream from the intake fig 1 volumes discharged by the different csos were not available approximate volumes were estimated by the municipality for the discharge points closest to the intake and they did not exceed 20 m3 for a five year recurrence modified chicago type rainfall episode of 3 h l autixier personal communication time delays between the wrrf and the dwtp measurements were estimated for two different periods winter and summer in winter the cross correlation analysis was performed on data from feb 1 to feb 23 2017 this period was selected to isolate the baseline signals in absence of rainfall snowmelt the similarity between the signals from the wrrf and dwtp was maximal for a 4 h time lag representing the time for the water to travel from the wrrf inlet to the dwtp intake in summer the cross correlation analysis was performed on data from july 1 to august 8 2017 the similarity between the two signals was maximal for a time lag of 8 5 h 3 5 correlations between gluc activity and online physico chemical parameters at the intake relationships between gluc activity and online physico chemical parameters were assessed for two different periods of the year characterized by either high or low gluc activities as defined in section 2 7 and which encompassed fall to early spring and late spring to summer months respectively colored boxes of the correlation matrices fig 7 are significant at the level of α 1 1000 blank boxes indicate the absence of significant relationships at the level of α 1 20 gluc activity was significantly correlated with culturable e coli turbidity conductivity as well as river and raw sewage flow rates although the strength of the relationships varied among parameters and between low gluc activity and high gluc activity periods 4 discussion 4 1 impact of the continuous upstream release of treated effluents on the microbial water quality at the drinking water intake a recurrent daily pattern in gluc activity was observed throughout the year at the intake of the drinking water treatment plant figs 4 5 figs s4 s5 the overall trend consisted in an increase of gluc activity in the evening followed by an overnight peak and a gradual decrease over the day fig 3 in a previous study stadler et al 2016 also reported daily gluc activity fluctuations in a small agricultural catchment but the daily peaks occurred in the late afternoon and were apparently not associated with sewage discharges in a karst spring in vietnam ender et al 2017 observed gluc activity peaks in the evening and suspected anthropogenic activities in the recharge area of the spring to cause these spikes however their observations were based on a limited set of data and the drivers of these daily fluctuations were not explicitly identified in this study the amplitudes of daily gluc activity fluctuations under baseline conditions varied between seasons highest amplitudes were observed from late fall to early spring and lowest in summer figs s4 s5 for a 1 month period representative of winter conditions mid january to mid february 2017 the amplitude averaged 4 7 1 1 mmfu 100 ml 1 during that same period the amplitude of daily water temperature fluctuations averaged 0 1 0 2 c which minimizes the importance of any temperature related processes affecting enzymatic activity bergmeyer 2012 the low and stable gluc activity signal measured in the soluble fraction of intake samples fig 3a leaves out the possibility of measurement interferences by extracellular gluc activity or non target compounds fiksdal and tryland 2008 instead concentrations of culturable e coli displayed similar daily patterns and were significantly correlated to gluc activity fig 3 the hypothesis of a unique and continuous discharge inducing daily microbial water quality fluctuations of river water at the intake was eventually confirmed by cross correlation analysis fig 6 the latter revealed a strong p 0 001 association between the gluc activity time series measured at the intake and the lagged time series for sewage discharge rate at a wrrf located 6 km upstream of the intake this link was more pronounced in winter than in summer as rainfall episodes and resulting increases in treated effluent discharge rates generated higher amplitudes of daily gluc activity fluctuations fig 4 fig s4 daily fluctuation patterns disappeared or were strongly attenuated following major snowmelt runoff episodes illustrating the overlapping drivers of gluc activity dynamics in the catchment fig 5 numerous studies have documented the impact of wrrf effluents on the chemical and microbiological quality of receiving waters jalliffier verne et al 2016 madoux humery et al 2016 ort and siegrist 2009 ouattara et al 2014 to the best of our knowledge though this is the first time that the hydraulic connection between a wrrf and a downstream dwtp is characterized across hourly to seasonal scales using high frequency microbial monitoring data 4 2 impact of intermittent releases of untreated sewage on the microbial water quality at the drinking water intake in addition to the continuous release of treated effluents the wrrf discharged partially treated sewage after degritting into the river at 148 occasions during the study period which triggered major gluc activity peaks fig 2 sewage by passes occurred when the daily capacity of the wrrf 75 000 m3 day 1 was surpassed usually following snowmelt and or intense precipitation episodes during the combined rainfall snowmelt episodes of february and april 2017 discharged sewage volumes exceeded 30 000 m3 day 1 on several occasions which was reflected by rapid increases in gluc activity and culturable e coli at the downstream dwtp intake fig 4 additional releases of raw sewage by combined sewer overflows csos were also observed figs 4 5 s4 s5 most cso events were recorded for outfall 4 fig 1 fig s1 but the latter did not appear to affect gluc activity dynamics likely because of its distance 11 km to the intake in addition estimated discharge volumes for the closest cso outfalls 17 and 20 22 l autixier personal communication were on average more than 500 fold lower than those of sewage by passes at the wrrf although the low number of csos equipped with online recorders hampered the precise assessment of their relative contribution to e coli loads at the intake their impact is expected to be limited compared to the wrrf by passes results from the investigated urban catchment thus underscore the predominant influence of wrrf by passes on the microbial water quality at the intake especially during winter and spring 4 3 local hydrometeorology governs gluc activity short and long term dynamics the seasonality of microbial parameters in water is associated with catchment specific and hydrometeorological driven processes wilkes et al 2009 in our study both gluc activity and e coli concentrations varied seasonally fig s2 peak contamination events and the highest gluc activity amplitudes figs s4 s5 occurred from late fall to early spring when heavy rainfall and or snowmelt episodes contributed to the release of partially treated or untreated sewage into the river through wrrf by passes and csos table 1 in contrast gluc activity and e coli concentrations were comparatively lower during summer despite high precipitation volumes in 2017 fig 2 this could be due to higher settling rates and or prolonged exposure to a combination of biotic grazing and abiotic solar irradiation temperature stressors blaustein et al 2013 servais et al 2009 wanjugi and harwood 2013 given the longer residence times in the river fig 8 in contrast during high river flow rates in winter and early spring dispersion rates increased jalliffier verne et al 2017 in addition the uv mediated inactivation of e coli at the wrrf could have been suboptimal due to higher particle loads in the primary effluent and lower contact times during disinfection örmeci and linden 2002 as shown in fig 2 lowest uv doses at the wrrf effluent were measured during winter and early spring at shorter time scales we identified three weather patterns that triggered gluc activity peaks of different magnitudes and durations at the dwtp intake 1 intense 30 mm day 1 precipitation 2 snowmelt 3 precipitation 10 mm day 1 during snowmelt snowmelt episodes caused progressive gluc activity increases and those contamination events lasted for several days fig 5 in contrast intense precipitation events caused steeper and shorter gluc activity peaks the magnitude of which depended on the river flow rate for instance intense precipitation on dec 2 2016 fig s4 triggered the highest recorded gluc activity peak 55 mmfu 100 ml 1 likely due to limited dilution in the river under unusually low flow rate conditions fig s3c following a precipitation event of similar intensity on june 6 2018 gluc activity peaked only at 10 mmfu 100 ml 1 fig s5 historically high river flow rates were recorded at that time of the year following the worst spring floods in the region since 1976 the latter occurred in may 2017 and resulted from a combination of a relatively deep snowpack saturated soils and precipitation ouranos 2019 with river flow rates exceeding 1 000 m3 s 1 1981 2016 average of 380 m3 s 1 for may the floodwaters were related to regional scale hydrology they were thus not associated with major and episodic gluc activity peaks despite the occurrences of emergency sewage by passes throughout the 2017 spring flood their effect on peak and average gluc activities progressively diminished figs 2 and 4 due to increased dilution by floodwaters snowmelt and intense precipitation have been shown to cause large increases in e coli concentrations in surface waters kistemann et al 2002 tornevi et al 2014 whitman et al 2008 which was also observed in our settings in addition the use of near real time monitoring of gluc activity enabled a more thorough characterization of the frequency magnitude and duration of episodic microbial spikes at the intake under a series of hydrometeorological conditions some of which were historic for the region the availability of online monitoring during the 2017 flood was reassuring for water managers given that it provided real time data during an emergency such information is important for the identification of upstream pollution sources and for better appraisal of the timing and magnitude of hazardous events in the drinking water supply towards improved human health protection who 2016 4 4 online β d glucuronidase monitoring as early warning fecal indicator besides recent technologies for near real time monitoring of microbial parameters such as the one used in this study online sensors for turbidity and conductivity provide rapid and automated high frequency measurements they are routinely used by water utilities for real time monitoring of source water quality and water treatment processes recent studies though have reported the absence or weak association between these parameters and gluc activity stadler et al 2016 ender et al 2017 ryzinska paier et al 2014 stadler et al 2010 our results show that the relationship between online gluc activity and turbidity depended on the period of the year it was moderate r 0 57 during the low gluc activity period late spring to end of summer but much weaker during the high gluc activity period fall to early spring fig 7 during the latter period a lag of 18 to 24 h was observed between most gluc activity and turbidity peaks fig 8 furthermore online turbidity did not reflect daily patterns as those reported by gluc activity conductivity can be indicative of point sources of fecal pollution such as wrrfs de sousa et al 2014 and its strong relationship with gluc activity during the high gluc activity period fig 7 confirmed the impact of wrrf effluents on the drinking water intake ort and siegrist 2009 reported daily conductivity fluctuations in a small creek which were associated with discharge variations from an upstream wrrf in this study we observed daily conductivity variations but their amplitude was much lower than for gluc activity furthermore during local snowmelt isolated conductivity peaks possibly caused riverine inputs of road salt were observed in absence of gluc activity peaks fig s6 during the february 2017 event online conductivity and turbidity values increased over time but their respective peaks were delayed by several hours compared to gluc activity fig 8 considering that e coli concentrations quickly rose by 1 log10 along the gluc activity peak fig 4 reliance on conductivity or turbidity would thus have led to the omission of this episodic fecal pollution spike at the intake significant relationships between gluc activity and culturable e coli have been reported previously especially during contamination peaks burnet et al 2019 ender et al 2017 stadler et al 2016 2019b based on routine and event based monitoring e coli concentrations associated with gluc activities 95th percentile 27 7 mmfu 100 ml 1 ranged from 108 to 2 720 cfu 100 ml 1 this variability in e coli concentrations during gluc activity peaks may have resulted from contrasting compositions in e coli populations in terms of metabolic status garcia armisen et al 2005 in winter and spring e coli concentrations dropped quicker than gluc activities following snowmelt driven contamination peaks fig 4 given that culturable e coli rapidly decline in snow but may remain viable for weeks staley et al 2017 snowmelt runoff could have carried a large proportion of non culturable yet gluc active e coli cells that contributed to the enzymatic signal in contrast synchronous rapid increases in gluc activity and e coli following intense precipitation strongly suggested the transport of recent contamination from local sewage discharges online gluc activity could thus be used as early warning tool for the detection of episodic fecal contamination peaks in the drinking water supply additional research is needed to better understand the potential sources and sinks of non target microorganisms and their effect on gluc activity measurements fiksdal and tryland 2008 the contribution of river sediment resuspension on the mobilization of gluc active microorganisms especially during runoff conditions stadler et al 2019b also warrants further investigations finally data on the persistence of gluc signals in comparison to culturable e coli are needed to determine their respective fate and transport in water this knowledge will provide insights into the applicability of online gluc activity as fecal indicator and early warning system in diverse aquatic environments 4 5 advancing water quality monitoring frameworks using online near real time measurement of gluc activity compliance monitoring frameworks have been inadequate in preventing waterborne disease outbreaks and ensuring safe drinking water supply in developed nations notably because of suboptimal monitoring strategies hrudey et al 2003 the latter do not reliably describe source water quality fluctuations which can influence microbial risk these fluctuations are directly associated with hydrometeorological factors such as intense precipitation and spring snowmelt that have led to major waterborne disease outbreaks within the past three decades curriero et al 2001 thomas et al 2006 even though routine monitoring of e coli in source water occurred more frequently at the studied dwtp than the prescribed weekly sampling most e coli peak concentrations were missed in absence of targeted sample collection figs 2 and 4 as source water protection aims to reduce peak concentrations the representativeness of source water monitoring should be improved by also explicitly targeting peak concentration events we show that near real time monitoring of gluc activity enabled to characterize the frequency duration and magnitude of contamination peaks and provided crucial knowledge on the nature and timing of upstream pollution sources affecting the dwtp intake under baseline and event conditions near real time online information by gluc activity time series will further offer new opportunities for targeted sampling of additional water quality parameters ryzinska paier et al 2014 ongoing work aims at assessing the relationships between gluc activity culturable e coli and the occurrence of waterborne pathogens and fecal source markers under various hydrometeorological settings such data will eventually help assessing the value of online gluc activity in microbial risk assessment and fecal source tracking to help water utilities better track critical situations in their water supply in a context of growing vulnerability of drinking water supplies to global changes source mitigation measures could be better prioritized to efficiently reduce the fecal burden upstream of the drinking water treatment train 5 conclusions online monitoring of gluc activity was performed at bi hourly frequency for 1 5 years to unravel temporal scales of fecal pollution dynamics at an urban drinking water treatment plant dwtp intake gluc activity displayed seasonal to hourly patterns of temporal fluctuation peak contamination episodes being observed from late fall to early spring recurrent daily patterns in gluc activity provided a fingerprint of a continuous impact of treated wastewater effluents on the microbial water quality at the dwtp intake peak contamination episodes were triggered by rainfall and or snowmelt induced sewage by passes from an upstream water resources recovery facility wrrf combined sewer overflows appeared to have a comparatively lower impact than sewage by passes because of their distance to the intake and lower discharged volumes the relationships between gluc activity e coli and online physico chemistry varied seasonally gluc and e coli peaked synchronously

18536,past waterborne outbreaks have demonstrated that informed vulnerability assessment of drinking water supplies is paramount for the provision of safe drinking water although current monitoring frameworks are not designed to account for short term peak concentrations of fecal microorganisms in source waters the recent development of online microbial monitoring technologies is expected to fill this knowledge gap in this study online near real time monitoring of β d glucuronidase gluc activity was conducted for 1 5 years at an urban drinking water intake impacted by multiple point sources of fecal pollution parallel routine and event based monitoring of e coli and online measurement of physico chemistry were performed at the intake and their dynamics compared over time gluc activity fluctuations ranged from seasonal to hourly time scales all peak contamination episodes occurred between late fall and early spring following intense rainfall and or snowmelt in the absence of rainfall recurrent daily fluctuations in gluc activity and culturable e coli were observed at the intake a pattern otherwise ignored by regulatory monitoring cross correlation analysis of time series retrieved from the drinking water intake and an upstream water resource recovery facility wrrf demonstrated a hydraulic connection between the two sites sewage by passes from the same wrrf were the main drivers of intermittent gluc activity and e coli peaks at the drinking water intake following intense precipitation and or snowmelt near real time monitoring of fecal pollution through gluc activity enabled a thorough characterization of the frequency duration and amplitude of peak contamination periods at the urban drinking water intake while providing crucial information for the identification of the dominant upstream fecal pollution sources to the best of our knowledge this is the first characterization of a hydraulic connection between a wrrf and a downstream drinking water intake across hourly to seasonal timescales using high frequency microbial monitoring data ultimately this should help improve source water protection through catchment mitigation actions especially in a context of de facto wastewater reuse graphical abstract image 1 keywords escherichia coli sewage by pass combined sewer overflows de facto wastewater reuse catchment microbial dynamics online monitoring 1 introduction safe water supply is essential for human health and sustainable growth at a global scale treated surface water from rivers lakes reservoirs accounts for at least 50 of the drinking water needs iwa 2019 yet most of these supplies are affected by fecal pollution and their integrity is increasingly threatened by growing populations urbanization and climate change khan et al 2015 who 2017 consequently unplanned de facto wastewater reuse through abstraction of surface water impacted by treated and or untreated wastewater for drinking water production has become common practice worldwide drewes et al 2017 rice et al 2013 intense precipitation and snowmelt episodes can substantially deteriorate the microbiological quality of source waters as they trigger the release of untreated sewage into the receiving drinking water supplies through combined sewer overflows csos and or water resource recovery facilities wrrfs by passes madoux humery et al 2016 tolouei et al 2019 tornevi et al 2014 young et al 2015 in developed countries large waterborne outbreaks have mainly occurred following extreme water related weather events cann et al 2013 curriero et al 2001 csos and wastewater bypasses typically discharge over the course of a few hours but they can generate rapid short term increases in fecal contaminant concentrations in rivers jalliffier verne et al 2016 madoux humery et al 2015 ouattara et al 2014 weyrauch et al 2010 identifying peak contamination periods and understanding the occurrence fate and transport of fecal contaminants upstream of water abstraction sites is therefore crucial for prioritizing actions towards mitigation of fecal pollution sources and human health protection who 2016 this need becomes even more urgent as the vulnerability of drinking water sources to fecal pollution is expected to grow with global changes jalliffier verne et al 2017 who 2017 current monitoring practices for source waters monthly to weekly daily sampling at best are not suited for reliable identification of hazardous events as infrequent manual sampling easily misses episodic contamination spikes madrid and zayas 2007 signor and ashbolt 2006 stadler et al 2008 this is due to the highly fluctuating nature of microbial temporal dynamics in water boehm 2007 burnet et al 2014 but also to methodological limitations of standard assays which rely on culture based enumeration of fib that require at least 24 h incubation periods madoux humery et al 2016 demonstrated the limitations of current methodologies for reliable identification and characterization of peak e coli concentrations in drinking water supplies impacted by intermittent csos advocating for the need of online monitoring rapid and high frequency monitoring of microbial water quality therefore represents a crucial step towards efficient identification and management of hazardous events in drinking water supplies in recent years online technologies capable of measuring microbial parameters at high frequency hourly have been developed and successfully implemented in various field settings from source to the tap iwa 2018 these technologies include flow cytometry besmer et al 2014 page et al 2017 enzymatic activity ender et al 2017 ryzinska paier et al 2014 stadler et al 2016 tryland et al 2015 as well as optical and humic acid like fluorescence højris et al 2016 sorensen et al 2015 enzyme based assays specifically quantify the occurrence of fecal indicator bacteria fib such as e coli by targeting metabolic enzymes already in use in conventional culture based assays for these bacteria in the case of e coli the activity of β d glucuronidase gluc enzyme is predominantly correlated to the occurrence of e coli in water farnleitner et al 2001 fiksdal et al 1994 garcia armisen et al 2005 although cross reactions with other fecal bacteria exist fiksdal and tryland 2008 recent studies have demonstrated that online gluc activity monitoring provided an unprecedented wealth of information on the temporal dynamics of microbial water quality in various habitats and that gluc activity could represent a valuable early warning tool for fecal pollution of water resources burnet et al 2019 ender et al 2017 ryzinska paier et al 2014 stadler et al 2016 stadler et al 2019a also stadler et al 2019b demonstrated how automated gluc activity monitoring contributed to understanding the sources and pathways of fecal pollution in an agricultural headwater catchment most studies on the use of online gluc activity as biochemical surrogate of fecal pollution have not been conducted in the context of drinking water supply yet near real time monitoring of microbial water quality could provide valuable knowledge on the sources and pathways in these environments and improve water quality assessment and management the objectives of the present study were therefore to gain new insights into the sources and processes driving microbial water quality in an urban drinking water supply using near real time monitoring of gluc activity for more than 1 5 years first we sought to unravel the temporal scales of variation in gluc activity and explicitly characterize peak contamination events secondly we contextualized the short and long term gluc activity trends using available online physico chemistry as well as hydrometeorological and sewershed data in order to understand the drivers of the temporal patterns in microbiological water quality thirdly we investigated the relationships between gluc activity and culturable e coli as well as online physico chemical parameters through routine and event based sampling to evaluate the benefit of online microbial monitoring we finally propose an optimized strategy for targeted collection of microbial water quality data using online monitoring of gluc activity to the best of our knowledge this is the first study using high frequency microbial monitoring in water supplies for the identification of fecal contaminant sources 2 material and methods 2 1 site description the studied drinking water treatment plant dwtp draws water from a 42 km long river located in the greater montreal area in southwestern quebec canada the river originates from the st lawrence ottawa river system and feeds four additional dwtps which serve 556 000 people in total the surrounding catchment adjacent to the river is predominantly characterized by urban land use with a total of 9 water resources recovery facilities wrrfs and 190 combined sewer overflows csos discharging un treated wastewater intermittently to the river among these 4 wrrfs and 37 cso outfalls are located upstream the studied dwtp intake 3 wrrfs and 30 cso outfalls occur within the intermediate protection zone of the intake fig 1 intermediate protection areas of drinking water intakes encompass a 10 km river stretch upstream from the intake mddelcc 2016 although agricultural land is limited in the investigated area additional diffuse sources of e coli could contribute to the faecal pollution load at the dwtp intake based on 26 years of data 1981 2016 the annual average river flowrate ranges from 140 to 315 m3 s 1 and flowrates are highest in april and may and lowest from july to september monthly averages ranging between 380 and 468 m3 s 1 and between 144 and 177 m3 s 1 respectively environment canada 2019 2 2 sampling strategy samples were collected routinely three days per week between monday and thursday and analyzed for e coli concentrations by the dwtp staff over the study period november 2016 to may 2018 additional high frequency sampling was conducted for 24 48 h using an isco 6712 autosampler teledyne in parallel to online monitoring of gluc activity these campaigns were performed under dry weather conditions absence of rainfall or snowmelt 72 h prior sampling and during contamination events following rainfall snowmelt episodes collected samples were selected at bi hourly frequency along the gluc activity pollutograph for further enumeration of culturable e coli online gluc activity measurements do not involve a pre filtration step as for the manual assay garcia armisen et al 2005 therefore we tested for possible soluble interferents that could contribute to the total gluc activity signal fiksdal and tryland 2008 in march 2018 six additional samples one sample every 4 h were filtered through a sterile 47 mm 0 22 μm pore size mixed cellulose ester membrane filter millipore for the measurement of gluc activity in the soluble 0 22 μm fraction of the sample in a subset of collected samples 1 sample every 6 h culturable e coli were also enumerated in triplicate to determine the analytical variability associated with the culture based assay the analytical variability of gluc activity measurements was low not exceeding 5 on average burnet et al 2019 2 3 culture based enumeration of e coli enumeration of culturable e coli during routine and event based monitoring was performed by membrane filtration using usepa method 1604 usepa 2002 during three additional high frequency sampling campaigns temporal fluctuations in e coli concentrations were assessed using defined substrate technology colilert quanti tray 2000 idexx by following the instructions of the manufacturer previous investigations showed that usepa 1604 and colilert assay were highly correlated r 0 9 burnet et al 2019 2 4 online monitoring of β d glucuronidase gluc activity near real time monitoring of β d glucuronidase gluc activity was performed with a coliminder industrial instrument vwm solutions gmbh at the raw water from november 2016 to may 2018 the analytical validation of the technology precision and robustness has been recently completed within the study area burnet et al 2019 the instrument was continuously supplied with raw water from the same pipe used for turbidity conductivity and temperature online monitoring measurement frequency was set at bi hourly frequency 12 measurements per day or hourly frequency during selected peak contamination events raw data were continuously recorded transmitted via a wireless modem and accessed downloaded remotely the rate of fluorescence emitted during the enzymatic reaction in the flow through photometric measurement chamber of the device was expressed in volts per second and converted into modified fishman units per 100 ml mfu 100 ml 1 calibration by the manufacturer used commercial enzyme standards g7396 25ku type ix a β d glucuronidase from e coli sigma aldrich with further details provided by koschelnik et al 2015 as determined by the manufacturer the limit of quantification defined as the reproducible signal exceeding background noise was 0 8 mmfu 100 ml 1 since the measurement process itself is based on light intensity measurements of fluorescence transmission and reference light intensity calibration of instrument sensors and amplification as well as checking of measurement chamber cleanliness was automatically performed every 25 measurements light calibration was intended for removal of any long term effects of changing sensor properties or possible build up of scale on the glass of the measurement chamber the temperature in the measurement chamber was continuously controlled and recorded reagents and buffers were stored as recommended by the manufacturer the fluorogenic substrate cm ec quickdetect reagent a vwm solutions gmbh and buffer cm ec quickdetect reagent b vwm solutions gmbh were stored at 20 c and 4 c respectively before use during the deployment phase as well as during laboratory experiments both solutions were maintained at 4 c in the cooling block of the instruments reagent quality was ensured by vwms quality control process using defined enzyme calibration solutions reagent dosage in the device was verified through blank tests which were automatically carried out with milli q water after 24 measurements to correct for any offset in gluc activity measurements the gluc activity measured during blank tests assay buffer assay substrate milli q water was automatically deducted from the measurement results of raw water samples to eliminate a possible influence of substrate quality and aging ex autohydrolysis of the reagent 2 5 hydrometeorology and online physico chemistry raw water turbidity surface scatter sc turbidimeter hach conductivity temperature and ph sc100 hach were measured online at the intake and operated by the dwtp staff flow rate data were extracted from the public repository of environment canada environment canada 2019 daily rainfall data was obtained from the municipal partner for the closest rain gauge fig 1 2 6 combined sewer overflows wrrf by passes and treated effluent discharges sewershed data were provided by the partner municipality location duration and frequency were gathered whenever available for each combined sewer overflow cso outfall located upstream from the drinking water intake as complete transversal mixing should occur within a distance equal to 100 1 000 river widths jirka et al 2004 and given the proximity of upstream pollution sources to the drinking water intake within the investigated stretch of the river only those discharge points located on the same riverbank were suspected of impacting the dwtp intake fig 1 continuously measured process data online flow rate in raw sewage and uv fluence applied to effluents were obtained for the wrrf located 6 km upstream from the drinking water intake the treatment at this wrrf includes degritting and settling followed by uv disinfection of the primary effluent the residence time in the wrrf averages 2 5 h for an average flow rate of 51 600 m3 day 1 during the study period but it can drop to 1 5 h during peak flow rates of 75 000 m3 day 1 g filiatrault personal communication additional information on the frequency duration and volumes of the sewage by passes recorded at the wrrf during the study period was obtained from the municipality 2 7 statistical analyses cross correlation and linear regression analyses were performed to investigate the dependency between time series for the parameters measured during the study period cross correlation analysis was performed to assess the lag time between time series at the wrrf and at the downstream dwtp for the wrrf discharge rates were only available for the plant inlet raw sewage but were considered representative of treated effluent discharge rates for the dtwp intake online gluc activity measurements were used considering the seasonal patterns of gluc activity these analyses were conducted for two separate periods of the year the first period referred to as high gluc activity encompassed 8 months between fall and early spring after the last snowmelt while the second period referred to as low gluc activity spanned over the remaining 4 months the time lag between the wrrf effluent and the downstream dwtp intake depends both on the discharge rate in the wrrf and the river flow rate as both time series discharge rate in raw sewage and gluc activity at downstream dwtp did not possess the same measurement frequency they were linearly interpolated for a common temporal x axis correlation analysis chatfield 2003 between the variables were then performed using the linear correlation coefficient and linear regression analysis the cross correlation measured the similarity of the first time series and the shifted copies of the second one and the delay between measurements was estimated by selecting the highest cross correlation coefficient 0 94 and 0 84 for high gluc activity and low gluc activity datasets respectively linear regression analyses were performed between gluc activity online physico chemistry e coli river flow rate and wrrf discharge rate for the gluc activity periods as defined above estimated lag times between wrrf effluent and dwtp intake were integrated into regression analyses all statistical analyses were performed in matlab mathworks 3 results 3 1 hydrometeorological conditions fig 2 shows the hydrological and meteorological conditions of the investigated area from november 17 2016 to may 31 2018 in comparison to historical measurements the study period was characterized by higher than average precipitation fig s3a monthly rainfall exceeded the monthly averages 1981 2010 for 14 out of the 19 months of the study this trend was particularly pronounced from january to may 2017 during which monthly rainfall accumulation was 1 5 3 2 fold higher than the 30 year averages the rainiest month of the study was april 2017 169 7 mm and highest daily precipitation was recorded on may 1 2017 58 1 mm the monthly mean snow cover observed during the study ranged between 1 cm november 2017 and 15 cm february 2018 and was similar to the monthly mean cover 30 year average fig s3b highest daily flow rates were recorded in may 2017 1080 m3 s 1 following cumulative snowmelt and rainfall episodes that resulted in the 2017 spring flood in the greater montreal area during and following this spring flood monthly flow rates from may 2017 to july 2017 exceeded historical 1981 2016 monthly averages by 1 4 2 4 times fig s3c lowest monthly flow rates were measured in november 2016 83 m3 s 1 3 2 near real time monitoring of β d glucuronidase activity at the drinking water intake high frequency monitoring of gluc activity yielded a total of 5 992 measurements in addition a total of 223 blank measurements were carried out by the device and generated average gluc activities of 0 7 1 3 mmfu 100 ml 1 which were automatically deducted from raw water gluc activity the latter ranged from 2 2 to 56 6 mmfu 100 ml 1 with an average of 11 3 mmfu 100 ml 1 and a 95th percentile of 27 7 mmfu 100 ml 1 the high gluc activity and low gluc activity periods displayed an average gluc activity of 15 2 7 5 mmfu 100 ml 1 n 3 895 and 5 3 2 1 mmfu 100 ml 1 n 2 097 respectively gluc activities exceeding the 95th percentile value defined here as peaks occurred during 15 time periods over the 1 5 years these gluc activity peaks lasted on average 36 h but could be observed for up to 10 days the longest gluc activity peak episodes occurred following snowmelt events fig 2 gluc activity medians were 2 to 4 times lower in summer compared to the other seasons fig s2 the variability in gluc activities was also lower during summer months compared to the rest of the year daily patterns were recurrently observed at the intake gluc activity increased overnight before decreasing during the day fig 3 a almost 75 of gluc activity daily maxima occurred between 10 p m and 7 a m fig 3b in the absence of rainfall or snowmelt events the amplitude of these daily fluctuations increased from 2 mmfu 100 ml 1 in summer to 5 mmfu 100 ml 1 between fall and spring figs 4 5 figs s4 s5 measurements of gluc activity in the soluble 0 22 μm fraction representing the extracellular gluc activity and or soluble interferents displayed a stable background signal of 2 4 mmfu 100 ml 1 which constituted 15 of the total gluc activity signal fig 3a 3 3 routine and event based monitoring of escherichia coli at the drinking water intake the 1 5 year routine monitoring of e coli at the intake 3 days a week n 220 samples in total yielded a mean concentration of 132 cfu 100 ml 1 min 1 to max 1 100 cfu 100 ml 1 95th percentile of 410 cfu 100 ml 1 and a median concentration of 80 cfu 100 ml 1 the seasonal pattern of e coli concentrations was less pronounced than that observed for gluc activity fig s2 during event based sampling in february march and april 2017 a total of 65 samples were collected along the pollutographs as defined by hourly gluc activity measurements and maximal e coli concentrations reached 2 720 cfu 100 ml 1 during the three event based sampling campaigns peak e coli concentrations were synchronous with peak gluc activities fig 4 3 4 treated wastewater discharges by passes and combined sewer overflows the wrrf located 6 km upstream from the drinking water intake fig 1 released effluents that were uv disinfected all year round but the fluence varied seasonally and was highest from the end of july to early october fig 2 untreated sewage degritting only was released into the river during by pass events recorded for 148 days out of 561 days snowmelt and rainfall accounted for 95 of these by passes while only 5 occurred during dry weather daily by pass volumes caused by rainfall and or snowmelt ranged from 27 to 39 848 m3 average of 8 582 m3 and were higher compared to dry weather by pass events 17 1 877 m3 average of 691 m3 a significant p 0 001 cross correlation was found between the flow rate at the wrrf and the gluc activity measured at the downstream dwtp intake fig 6 for cso discharges located within the intermediate protection area of the intake i e outfalls 5 to 22 fig 1 half of them discharged over the study period accounting for 58 of the discharge events for all 22 csos located on the south riverbank fig s1 among them outfalls 5 7 were the most active accounting for almost 65 of the cso events recorded within the intermediate protection area they were followed by cso no 17 21 which is one of the closest discharge points 2 km upstream from the intake fig 1 volumes discharged by the different csos were not available approximate volumes were estimated by the municipality for the discharge points closest to the intake and they did not exceed 20 m3 for a five year recurrence modified chicago type rainfall episode of 3 h l autixier personal communication time delays between the wrrf and the dwtp measurements were estimated for two different periods winter and summer in winter the cross correlation analysis was performed on data from feb 1 to feb 23 2017 this period was selected to isolate the baseline signals in absence of rainfall snowmelt the similarity between the signals from the wrrf and dwtp was maximal for a 4 h time lag representing the time for the water to travel from the wrrf inlet to the dwtp intake in summer the cross correlation analysis was performed on data from july 1 to august 8 2017 the similarity between the two signals was maximal for a time lag of 8 5 h 3 5 correlations between gluc activity and online physico chemical parameters at the intake relationships between gluc activity and online physico chemical parameters were assessed for two different periods of the year characterized by either high or low gluc activities as defined in section 2 7 and which encompassed fall to early spring and late spring to summer months respectively colored boxes of the correlation matrices fig 7 are significant at the level of α 1 1000 blank boxes indicate the absence of significant relationships at the level of α 1 20 gluc activity was significantly correlated with culturable e coli turbidity conductivity as well as river and raw sewage flow rates although the strength of the relationships varied among parameters and between low gluc activity and high gluc activity periods 4 discussion 4 1 impact of the continuous upstream release of treated effluents on the microbial water quality at the drinking water intake a recurrent daily pattern in gluc activity was observed throughout the year at the intake of the drinking water treatment plant figs 4 5 figs s4 s5 the overall trend consisted in an increase of gluc activity in the evening followed by an overnight peak and a gradual decrease over the day fig 3 in a previous study stadler et al 2016 also reported daily gluc activity fluctuations in a small agricultural catchment but the daily peaks occurred in the late afternoon and were apparently not associated with sewage discharges in a karst spring in vietnam ender et al 2017 observed gluc activity peaks in the evening and suspected anthropogenic activities in the recharge area of the spring to cause these spikes however their observations were based on a limited set of data and the drivers of these daily fluctuations were not explicitly identified in this study the amplitudes of daily gluc activity fluctuations under baseline conditions varied between seasons highest amplitudes were observed from late fall to early spring and lowest in summer figs s4 s5 for a 1 month period representative of winter conditions mid january to mid february 2017 the amplitude averaged 4 7 1 1 mmfu 100 ml 1 during that same period the amplitude of daily water temperature fluctuations averaged 0 1 0 2 c which minimizes the importance of any temperature related processes affecting enzymatic activity bergmeyer 2012 the low and stable gluc activity signal measured in the soluble fraction of intake samples fig 3a leaves out the possibility of measurement interferences by extracellular gluc activity or non target compounds fiksdal and tryland 2008 instead concentrations of culturable e coli displayed similar daily patterns and were significantly correlated to gluc activity fig 3 the hypothesis of a unique and continuous discharge inducing daily microbial water quality fluctuations of river water at the intake was eventually confirmed by cross correlation analysis fig 6 the latter revealed a strong p 0 001 association between the gluc activity time series measured at the intake and the lagged time series for sewage discharge rate at a wrrf located 6 km upstream of the intake this link was more pronounced in winter than in summer as rainfall episodes and resulting increases in treated effluent discharge rates generated higher amplitudes of daily gluc activity fluctuations fig 4 fig s4 daily fluctuation patterns disappeared or were strongly attenuated following major snowmelt runoff episodes illustrating the overlapping drivers of gluc activity dynamics in the catchment fig 5 numerous studies have documented the impact of wrrf effluents on the chemical and microbiological quality of receiving waters jalliffier verne et al 2016 madoux humery et al 2016 ort and siegrist 2009 ouattara et al 2014 to the best of our knowledge though this is the first time that the hydraulic connection between a wrrf and a downstream dwtp is characterized across hourly to seasonal scales using high frequency microbial monitoring data 4 2 impact of intermittent releases of untreated sewage on the microbial water quality at the drinking water intake in addition to the continuous release of treated effluents the wrrf discharged partially treated sewage after degritting into the river at 148 occasions during the study period which triggered major gluc activity peaks fig 2 sewage by passes occurred when the daily capacity of the wrrf 75 000 m3 day 1 was surpassed usually following snowmelt and or intense precipitation episodes during the combined rainfall snowmelt episodes of february and april 2017 discharged sewage volumes exceeded 30 000 m3 day 1 on several occasions which was reflected by rapid increases in gluc activity and culturable e coli at the downstream dwtp intake fig 4 additional releases of raw sewage by combined sewer overflows csos were also observed figs 4 5 s4 s5 most cso events were recorded for outfall 4 fig 1 fig s1 but the latter did not appear to affect gluc activity dynamics likely because of its distance 11 km to the intake in addition estimated discharge volumes for the closest cso outfalls 17 and 20 22 l autixier personal communication were on average more than 500 fold lower than those of sewage by passes at the wrrf although the low number of csos equipped with online recorders hampered the precise assessment of their relative contribution to e coli loads at the intake their impact is expected to be limited compared to the wrrf by passes results from the investigated urban catchment thus underscore the predominant influence of wrrf by passes on the microbial water quality at the intake especially during winter and spring 4 3 local hydrometeorology governs gluc activity short and long term dynamics the seasonality of microbial parameters in water is associated with catchment specific and hydrometeorological driven processes wilkes et al 2009 in our study both gluc activity and e coli concentrations varied seasonally fig s2 peak contamination events and the highest gluc activity amplitudes figs s4 s5 occurred from late fall to early spring when heavy rainfall and or snowmelt episodes contributed to the release of partially treated or untreated sewage into the river through wrrf by passes and csos table 1 in contrast gluc activity and e coli concentrations were comparatively lower during summer despite high precipitation volumes in 2017 fig 2 this could be due to higher settling rates and or prolonged exposure to a combination of biotic grazing and abiotic solar irradiation temperature stressors blaustein et al 2013 servais et al 2009 wanjugi and harwood 2013 given the longer residence times in the river fig 8 in contrast during high river flow rates in winter and early spring dispersion rates increased jalliffier verne et al 2017 in addition the uv mediated inactivation of e coli at the wrrf could have been suboptimal due to higher particle loads in the primary effluent and lower contact times during disinfection örmeci and linden 2002 as shown in fig 2 lowest uv doses at the wrrf effluent were measured during winter and early spring at shorter time scales we identified three weather patterns that triggered gluc activity peaks of different magnitudes and durations at the dwtp intake 1 intense 30 mm day 1 precipitation 2 snowmelt 3 precipitation 10 mm day 1 during snowmelt snowmelt episodes caused progressive gluc activity increases and those contamination events lasted for several days fig 5 in contrast intense precipitation events caused steeper and shorter gluc activity peaks the magnitude of which depended on the river flow rate for instance intense precipitation on dec 2 2016 fig s4 triggered the highest recorded gluc activity peak 55 mmfu 100 ml 1 likely due to limited dilution in the river under unusually low flow rate conditions fig s3c following a precipitation event of similar intensity on june 6 2018 gluc activity peaked only at 10 mmfu 100 ml 1 fig s5 historically high river flow rates were recorded at that time of the year following the worst spring floods in the region since 1976 the latter occurred in may 2017 and resulted from a combination of a relatively deep snowpack saturated soils and precipitation ouranos 2019 with river flow rates exceeding 1 000 m3 s 1 1981 2016 average of 380 m3 s 1 for may the floodwaters were related to regional scale hydrology they were thus not associated with major and episodic gluc activity peaks despite the occurrences of emergency sewage by passes throughout the 2017 spring flood their effect on peak and average gluc activities progressively diminished figs 2 and 4 due to increased dilution by floodwaters snowmelt and intense precipitation have been shown to cause large increases in e coli concentrations in surface waters kistemann et al 2002 tornevi et al 2014 whitman et al 2008 which was also observed in our settings in addition the use of near real time monitoring of gluc activity enabled a more thorough characterization of the frequency magnitude and duration of episodic microbial spikes at the intake under a series of hydrometeorological conditions some of which were historic for the region the availability of online monitoring during the 2017 flood was reassuring for water managers given that it provided real time data during an emergency such information is important for the identification of upstream pollution sources and for better appraisal of the timing and magnitude of hazardous events in the drinking water supply towards improved human health protection who 2016 4 4 online β d glucuronidase monitoring as early warning fecal indicator besides recent technologies for near real time monitoring of microbial parameters such as the one used in this study online sensors for turbidity and conductivity provide rapid and automated high frequency measurements they are routinely used by water utilities for real time monitoring of source water quality and water treatment processes recent studies though have reported the absence or weak association between these parameters and gluc activity stadler et al 2016 ender et al 2017 ryzinska paier et al 2014 stadler et al 2010 our results show that the relationship between online gluc activity and turbidity depended on the period of the year it was moderate r 0 57 during the low gluc activity period late spring to end of summer but much weaker during the high gluc activity period fall to early spring fig 7 during the latter period a lag of 18 to 24 h was observed between most gluc activity and turbidity peaks fig 8 furthermore online turbidity did not reflect daily patterns as those reported by gluc activity conductivity can be indicative of point sources of fecal pollution such as wrrfs de sousa et al 2014 and its strong relationship with gluc activity during the high gluc activity period fig 7 confirmed the impact of wrrf effluents on the drinking water intake ort and siegrist 2009 reported daily conductivity fluctuations in a small creek which were associated with discharge variations from an upstream wrrf in this study we observed daily conductivity variations but their amplitude was much lower than for gluc activity furthermore during local snowmelt isolated conductivity peaks possibly caused riverine inputs of road salt were observed in absence of gluc activity peaks fig s6 during the february 2017 event online conductivity and turbidity values increased over time but their respective peaks were delayed by several hours compared to gluc activity fig 8 considering that e coli concentrations quickly rose by 1 log10 along the gluc activity peak fig 4 reliance on conductivity or turbidity would thus have led to the omission of this episodic fecal pollution spike at the intake significant relationships between gluc activity and culturable e coli have been reported previously especially during contamination peaks burnet et al 2019 ender et al 2017 stadler et al 2016 2019b based on routine and event based monitoring e coli concentrations associated with gluc activities 95th percentile 27 7 mmfu 100 ml 1 ranged from 108 to 2 720 cfu 100 ml 1 this variability in e coli concentrations during gluc activity peaks may have resulted from contrasting compositions in e coli populations in terms of metabolic status garcia armisen et al 2005 in winter and spring e coli concentrations dropped quicker than gluc activities following snowmelt driven contamination peaks fig 4 given that culturable e coli rapidly decline in snow but may remain viable for weeks staley et al 2017 snowmelt runoff could have carried a large proportion of non culturable yet gluc active e coli cells that contributed to the enzymatic signal in contrast synchronous rapid increases in gluc activity and e coli following intense precipitation strongly suggested the transport of recent contamination from local sewage discharges online gluc activity could thus be used as early warning tool for the detection of episodic fecal contamination peaks in the drinking water supply additional research is needed to better understand the potential sources and sinks of non target microorganisms and their effect on gluc activity measurements fiksdal and tryland 2008 the contribution of river sediment resuspension on the mobilization of gluc active microorganisms especially during runoff conditions stadler et al 2019b also warrants further investigations finally data on the persistence of gluc signals in comparison to culturable e coli are needed to determine their respective fate and transport in water this knowledge will provide insights into the applicability of online gluc activity as fecal indicator and early warning system in diverse aquatic environments 4 5 advancing water quality monitoring frameworks using online near real time measurement of gluc activity compliance monitoring frameworks have been inadequate in preventing waterborne disease outbreaks and ensuring safe drinking water supply in developed nations notably because of suboptimal monitoring strategies hrudey et al 2003 the latter do not reliably describe source water quality fluctuations which can influence microbial risk these fluctuations are directly associated with hydrometeorological factors such as intense precipitation and spring snowmelt that have led to major waterborne disease outbreaks within the past three decades curriero et al 2001 thomas et al 2006 even though routine monitoring of e coli in source water occurred more frequently at the studied dwtp than the prescribed weekly sampling most e coli peak concentrations were missed in absence of targeted sample collection figs 2 and 4 as source water protection aims to reduce peak concentrations the representativeness of source water monitoring should be improved by also explicitly targeting peak concentration events we show that near real time monitoring of gluc activity enabled to characterize the frequency duration and magnitude of contamination peaks and provided crucial knowledge on the nature and timing of upstream pollution sources affecting the dwtp intake under baseline and event conditions near real time online information by gluc activity time series will further offer new opportunities for targeted sampling of additional water quality parameters ryzinska paier et al 2014 ongoing work aims at assessing the relationships between gluc activity culturable e coli and the occurrence of waterborne pathogens and fecal source markers under various hydrometeorological settings such data will eventually help assessing the value of online gluc activity in microbial risk assessment and fecal source tracking to help water utilities better track critical situations in their water supply in a context of growing vulnerability of drinking water supplies to global changes source mitigation measures could be better prioritized to efficiently reduce the fecal burden upstream of the drinking water treatment train 5 conclusions online monitoring of gluc activity was performed at bi hourly frequency for 1 5 years to unravel temporal scales of fecal pollution dynamics at an urban drinking water treatment plant dwtp intake gluc activity displayed seasonal to hourly patterns of temporal fluctuation peak contamination episodes being observed from late fall to early spring recurrent daily patterns in gluc activity provided a fingerprint of a continuous impact of treated wastewater effluents on the microbial water quality at the dwtp intake peak contamination episodes were triggered by rainfall and or snowmelt induced sewage by passes from an upstream water resources recovery facility wrrf combined sewer overflows appeared to have a comparatively lower impact than sewage by passes because of their distance to the intake and lower discharged volumes the relationships between gluc activity e coli and online physico chemistry varied seasonally gluc and e coli peaked synchronously during episodic contamination events acquisition of high frequency measurement datasets improves our understanding of catchment microbial dynamics through identification and characterization of

18537,stringent regulations and deteriorating source water quality could greatly influence the water production capacity of drinking water treatment plants dwtps using models to predict the performance of dwtps under stress provides valuable information for decision making and future planning a hybrid statistic model named hann was established by combining artificial neural network ann with genetic algorithm ga aiming at forecasting the overall performance of dwtps nationwide in china monthly data from 45 dwtps across china was employed water quality parameters like temperature and chemical oxygen demand cod and operational parameters like electricity consumption and chemical consumption were selected as input variables while drinking water production was employed as the output both preliminary data analysis and principal component analysis pca suggested a clear non linear relationship between the input and output variables the structure of the hann model was optimized by employing the lowest mean squared error mse as the indicator the resultant hann model performed well when simulating the training datasets its predictive accuracy for the independent test datasets was enhanced when feeding more training datasets and the performance was constantly higher than the independent multi layered ann models using the coefficient of determination r2 as the indicator indicating the hann model was capable of capturing complex non linear relationship and extrapolation results from accuracy test garson sensitivity analysis and analysis of variance anova suggested the quantity of water produced by dwtps was closely linked to water quality and operational parameters the scenario analysis showed that the hann model was capable of predicting water production variation based on the parameter variations indicating that the hann model could be a general management tool for decision makers and dwtp managers to make plans in advance of regulatory changes source water quality variations and market demand graphical abstract image 1 keywords artificial neural network genetic algorithm drinking water treatment water production 1 introduction demand for high quality drinking water is growing worldwide because of rapid urbanization and industrialization smeti et al 2009 in china and many other developing areas growing demand for safe drinking water has greatly burdened drinking water treatment plants dwtps chew et al 2018 the gradual deterioration in raw water quality and the requirement for sophisticated water quality control due to the changes in drinking water regulations both put more pressure on current treatment processes rietveld et al 2008 the above changes continue to challenge the capability of dwtps to produce drinking water of proper quality and quantity which not only is an important prerequisite to prosperity and political stability but also fosters the adaptive capacity of the societies wilderer 2004 as a result of these concerns water companies like veolia have highlighted the need and importance of estimating and predicting water production capability this inspires the development of macro scale models for overall management that have the ability to determine the effect of worsening water quality and more stringent regulations on treated water production to confirm whether volume produced will be sufficient when water quality and operational conditions change and to react in advance to cope with the above mentioned problems however the individual processes in dwtps such as coagulation sedimentation filtration and disinfection are inherently complicated and there is a poor understanding of how these unit processes interact with each other when integrated together so it is difficult to describe them quantitatively and accurately with common mechanistic models and simple regression models heddam et al 2012 baxter et al 2001 nandi et al 2010 artificial neural network ann models are data driven models derived from the development of artificial intelligence ai that have become increasingly popular due to their wide range of applicability and their ability to describe complicated and non linear problems without considering the underlying mechanism baxter et al 2001 khataee and kasiri 2011 fan et al 2016 for an ann model to function it requires a large amount of raw data for training validation and testing to accurately capture the non linear relationship between the inputs and outputs so the growing computational speed of modern central process units cpu has facilitated the application of ann models ann models have been employed to tackle numerous environmental issues for example a number of studies have used ann models to predict water resource variables like water quantity and water quality in river systems maier et al 2010 maier and dandy 2000 dawson and wilby 2001 and coastal environments chau 2006 zhang et al 2012 2018 he and he 2008 as well as pollutant removal efficiency in water treatment experiments zhang and pan 2014 elmolla et al 2010 ghaedi and vafaei 2017 the ann models also served as an important part for quantitative structure property relationships qspr calculation borhani et al 2016 ye et al 2017 water treatment plant operators usually store a sufficiently large amount of historical data newhart et al 2019 that is suitable for training validating and testing ann models and thus has been the focus of numerous ann studies previous studies ghaedi and vafaei 2017 guo et al 2015 najafzadeh and zeinolabedini 2019 ju et al 2019 have compared the prediction accuracy and capacity of water treatment plant performance by several machine learning algorithms among which ann provided more precise prediction in most cases than support vector machine svm adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis etc a protocol was introduced by wu et al 2014 for developing ann models and assessing the quality of the ann model development process in drinking water quality modeling al shayji and liu 2002 used an ann model to simulate the performance of some large scale water desalination plants compared to statistical regression model the ann model was more robust and able to enhance the prediction accuracy for the performance of the desalination plants marzouk and elkadi 2016 successfully employed an ann model to estimate costs for water treatment plants a number of specific processes within dtwps have also been modelled using ann model to predict parameters such as water quality and operational demand and the methodology for applying ann models to individual process is available in baxter et al 2002a for example ann models were applied to predict real time coagulant dosage heddam et al 2012 dharman et al 2012 baxter et al 2002b gomes et al 2015 kim and parnichkun 2017 membrane fouling in filtration systems shetty and chellam 2003 bagheri et al 2019 sludge generated in an oxylator unit naeamikhah et al 2017 filtration performance griffiths and andrews 2011 and turbine power requirements for mixing processes sincero 2003 although the use of ann to model overall performance of a dwtp is not common the success of these earlier studies provides ample motivation for applying ann methods to model treated water production ann can be optimized using genetic algorithm ga which is considered a superior optimization method compared to many other heuristic algorithms in consideration of balance of accuracy and time complexity for some complex problems fan et al 2018 kar 2016 ho and pepyne 2002 it was developed based on the law of evolution ga usually starts with a randomly initialized population as solutions and the solutions are assigned a fitness score then after selection crossover mating mutation and evaluation the algorithm finds the best solution to the problem based on the pre set criteria ann models are black box models and connection weights and biases are the only parameters obtained for understanding how the networks function ga has the potential to optimize the weights and biases to aid the network to better describe the relationship between inputs and outputs given the higher tolerance of ga ann models to input data imprecision uncertainty and approximation the adoption of ga to ann is a promising way to increase prediction accuracy and reduce the computational demand of generating predictions for dwtps meanwhile based on the sufficient theory development methodological and application studies on water treatment fan et al 2018 kar 2016 al aani et al 2019 bagheri et al 2016 ga ann is expected to insure prediction robustness and reliability of large scale dwtps performance ga ann combined models can also be powerful tools for investigating the interdependencies among variables through searching large numbers of combinations koc et al 2007 applied ann and ga to optimize whole milk powder plant variables a hybrid model involving ann and ga was developed by burchard levine et al 2014 to give early alerts of river water quality strugholtz et al 2008 employed ann and ga to optimize the performance of a ceramic membrane microfiltration plant so far to the authors knowledge the ann technique has not yet been used to study how resilient a plant s treated water production volume is to changes in water quality and operational parameters such as energy use cost and chemical consumption this may provide water companies with useful information for overall management and decision making in this study data from 45 dwtps in china was used to construct a hybrid artificial neural network hann model enhanced by genetic algorithm to predict overall water production performance of dwtps by connecting water quality and operational parameters with water quantity the raw data was firstly analyzed by preliminary data analysis and principal component analysis and then grouped together as training groups and independent test groups to feed into the hann models and multi layered ann models the input variables included operational parameters and water quality variables and the designated output was water production the proposed model was optimized and comparisons were made to other independent ann models based on different division of data sensitivity analysis was conducted to study the function and relative importance of input variables in the end scenario analysis was performed using the established hann model to predict water production under varying situations 2 materials and methods 2 1 data processing all data from drinking water treatment plants dwtps was provided by veolia the drinking water treatment plants were all located in china and treatment process varied from plant to plant all data from dwtps was in the form of dataset and each dataset used in this study contained average operational parameters water quality parameters and water production of one dwtp in one month of 2015 a total of 498 datasets from 45 dwtps were used after trimming all the invalid datasets raw data was analyzed and grouped to reduce the number of input variables to 11 shown in fig 1 the 11 input variables were total electricity consumption tec which was the electricity consumed for water treatment and pumping δturbidity and δnh4 which were the difference between raw water quality and treated water quality according to the regulations the temperature ph and cod of raw water residual chlorine of treated water lime hydrate dosage coagulant polyaluminum chloride pac active chlorine which was the chlorine used for disinfection tertiary process cost which was the cost of all tertiary treatment processes including but not limited to activated carbon adsorption ion exchange aeration and oxidation the output variable was monthly average water production after preliminary data processing and re arrangement principal component analysis was conducted to evaluate the potential relationship among all input variables to ensure that there was no redundancy in the final input variables based on the contribution of inputs to the calculated principal component in order to ensure all input variables were important rather than descending dimension and feature extraction of the nonlinear correlation inputs by nonlinear pca the principal component regression was conducted to make sure the non linear relationship between the input and output variables which was the pre condition we applied ann for modeling prediction 2 2 modeling methodology the establishment of independent ann models and ga enhanced ann hybrid model denoted hann model was coded and operated in the matlab r2014a environment before modeling all data was normalized to the range of 0 1 in general the whole datasets were randomly divided into training groups for model development training 60 validation 20 and testing 20 and independent test groups to validate the predictive performance of the developed model trial and error was performed to select the optimal data division to be the best representative different data division ratios of 60 training 40 independent test 70 training 30 independent test and 89 training 11 independent test were performed to explore the influence of data divisions on model performance the scheme for hann modeling and coding are illustrated in fig 1 both feed forward back propagation ann model hann and elman back propagation model hann e were employed for comparison during the hann modeling the independent multi layered ann models were developed based on the feed forward back propagation method it consisted of 1 input layer 1 3 hidden layers and 1 output layer a general expression for the ann model was shown in equation 1 and equations 2 and 3 represented the transfer functions for the hidden layer and output layer respectively during the training process the weights and biases in the network were calculated by the ga function eq 4 to monitor the evolution in fitness and the calculation either terminated at the maximum evolution generation or when the fitness met the preset goals the parameters including training algorithm hidden neuron number population size and number of evolution generations were optimized by minimizing the mean squared error mse and fitness until the optimum architecture for the hann model was reached other parameters were pre defined as default values the training algorithms tested in this study were the levenberg marquardt lm algorithm bayesian regulation backpropagation br bfgs quasi newton backpropagation bfg gradient

biases in the neuron networks p is the input variable set independent ann models with 1 2 and 3 hidden layers were created and other optimum architectures were also trained validated and tested for comparison mean squared error mse eq 5 was used as the criteria to compare the performance of each model and the coefficient of determination r2 and mean absolute percentage error mape eq 6 was used to evaluate the predictive performance of the established models 5 m s e i 1 i n s i a i 2 n 6 m a p e 100 n t 1 n a i s i a i where n is the number of datasets s i is the simulated output value for i data point and a i is the actual output value for i data point 2 3 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis was conducted in the matlab r2014a environment using accuracy test garson weight equation and anova test accuracy test was designed specifically for the hann model to evaluate the performance of the model when individual input variables were absent garson weight equation analyzed the relative importance of each input variable with updated weight and bias values the anova test studied the effects of individual input variables and interactions between the input variables on the hann model performance based on pure statistical logic accuracy tests were carried out by assuming one input parameter was missing and set as a default value table 1 the accuracy was calculated using equation 7 7 a k 1 i 1 i n s i k v i i 1 n v i where a k is the accuracy of the hann model when k input variable was missing and replaced with a default value s ik is the simulated output value of all datasets from the hann model for i data point when k input variable was missing and replaced with a default value v i was the actual output value of all datasets for i data point the relative importance of each input parameter was calculated using the garson weight equation eq 8 the weight and bias values were extracted from the optimum hann model for the calculation 8 q i k j 1 l w i j r

neurons and the hidden neuron j wij is the connection weight between the input neuron i and the hidden neuron j v jk is the connection weight between the hidden neuron j and the output neuron k 2 4 scenario analysis scenario tests were conducted to evaluate the uncertainties of the hann model and analyze the performance of the model when water quality and operational parameters were varied according to the results of sensitivity analysis four scenarios were simulated 1 raw water chemical oxygen demand cod variation and cod variation with increased coagulant dosage 2 raw water temperature variation 3 active chlorine dosage variation and 4 electricity consumption variation the input data was varied hypothetically but within the boundary of dwtps involved in this study the simulated water production was calculated using the established hann model 3 results and discussion 3 1 preliminary data analysis and principal component analysis preliminary data analysis and pca study were conducted on data collected from the 45 dwtps nationwide in china to explore the complex underlying relationships among the available parameters and determine the final input variables the variations of the 11 input parameters and water production as the output were selected for modeling are shown in fig 2 parameters such as chemical oxygen demand cod temperature ph of the raw water δnh4 and free chlorine in treated water were normally distributed however others including electricity consumption δturbidity and chemical consumption lime hydrate pac coagulant and active chlorine for water treatment were highly skewed suggesting that the quality of raw water supplying the dwtps was of small variability except for turbidity while electricity consumption and chemical dosage varied significantly from plant to plant and cost for tertiary processes had the least variability those highly skewed parameters were possibly strong indicators for water production of dwtps since the monthly water production of the dwtps was also not normally distributed the pca results are presented in fig 3 eleven input parameters were assigned to 10 pcs as shown the first and second pcs accounted for 26 04 and 16 63 of variance respectively indicating the input variables were poorly correlated with each other fig 3b shows the centered and scaled water production projected onto the first two principal components the dwtps labeled with numbers with large water production over 107 m3 month were more sensitive compared to smaller plants suggesting there were more uncertainties in larger dwtps fig 3c 3d exhibits different loadings of the 11 variables on the first and second pcs indicating complex relationships among input variables the above results of pca showed that the 11 input variables were all of significance for water production and it was unreasonable to exclude any input parameters principal component regression was also conducted to explore possible links between the input variables and water production it revealed the underlying non linear relationships between the input variables and output water production the exhibition of poor correlation between the first two pcs and normalized water output suggested that the complex relationships between the input variables and water production could not be captured by simple multiple regression this result indicated that the use of machine learning methods like ann for more complex pattern recognition would be suitable in this case 3 2 model structure optimization the structure of the hybrid artificial neural network model hann was optimized to reach its maximum performance using mse as the performance indicator fig 4 a presents the model performance under different training algorithms it was shown that the levenberg marquardt lm and bayesian regulation br backpropagation algorithms were more competent than others for the problem these two algorithms were both based on levenberg marquardt optimization the lm algorithm updated weight and bias values at each iteration while the br algorithm also minimized a combination of squared errors and weights in this case direct optimization of weights and biases of input variables was more efficient than other methodologies it was observed in fig 4b that the optimum number of hidden neurons in one hidden layer was 50 the mse dropped rapidly when the number of hidden neurons increased from 10 to 50 however the mse started to increase when the number of hidden neurons increased further this was because excessive hidden neurons usually lead to over fitting of the model wu et al 2014 population size number of evolution generations and the number of hidden neurons were also optimized during ga calculations fig 4c e it was found that population size of 50 300 generations and 50 hidden neurons were optimum for hann calculations although further increasing population size to 60 could reduce fitness slightly it was not cost effective since the time consumed for calculation was greatly lengthened fig 4f shows that the mse of ann models decreased significantly from 0 018 to 2 49 10 6 after increasing the number of hidden layers from one to three suggesting the performance of the ann models was greatly enhanced both hybrid model hann models used in this study employed only one hidden layer the use of ga also improved the performance mse 0 0002 and 0 0005 for hann and hann e models respectively of the hann models to a level similar to that of a 2 layered ann model 3 3 model performance evaluation the established hann model was employed to simulate water production of random dwtps in random months in 2015 the results from 1 layered 2 layered and 3 layered ann models were also used for comparison fig 5 showed that the hann model performed well during training regardless of different data divisions the coefficient of determination r2 reached 0 95 0 95 and 0 96 between the simulated and real output for 60 70 and 89 training groups respectively the performance of hann e model also reached 0 92 as presented in figure s1 although the hann models underestimated the capacity of several large dwtps with monthly water production over 1 5 107 m3 the overall performance of training was satisfactory in addition 40 30 and 11 of independent test datasets were separated from the training datasets to evaluate the predictive strength of each model r2 and mape were used as the performance indicators as presented in fig 6 in the 60 40 group the predictive strengths of the independent ann models were at similar level the hann model performed better than the ann models with r2 reaching 0 71 and mape of 53 0 it was implied that 60 training datasets might not be representative enough for the whole datasets maier et al 2010 abrahart et al 2010 bowden et al 2002 since the values of inputs and output of the dwtps were not all normally distributed fig 2 hence the models developed using only 60 data as training group could be biased for the 70 30 group the accuracy of prediction was enhanced for the three ann models but the hann model still outperformed with r2 reaching 0 89 and mape of 29 3 in addition the three layered ann model exhibited reduced predictive accuracy r2 0 71 compared to single layered one r2 0 77 possibly due to overfitting differently for the 89 11 group although the accuracy of prediction increased when the number of hidden layers increased from one to three r2 increased from 0 67 to 0 70 the predictive efficiency of the 3 layered ann model was still much lower than the hann model r2 0 93 mape 20 3 the hann e model also performed fairly well with r2 of 0 90 figure s2 but still lower than that of the hann model independent ann models tend to underestimate or overestimate the water production by 20 70 the results indicated that independent ann models encountered difficulties when learning to capture the nonlinear relationships between 11 inputs and water production of dwtps although the hann model performed less efficiently than the 3 layered ann model in terms of simulating the training datasets it constantly functioned better when predicting un trained data in all three cases of data divisions the results suggested that with the aid of genetic algorithm the updated weights and biases explained the relationships between 11 input variables and water production with more precision when compared to the multi layered ann models this result was in consistent with previous studies fan et al 2018 kuo et al 2006 where combining the advantages of the highly flexible function approximator of ann with the global solution exploration of ga revealed a better forecasting performance interestingly the performance of the hann model increased significantly from 0 71 to 0 93 r2 by feeding more training data suggesting the hann model was not over trained and the model harbored the potential to be enhanced in the future to more accurately capture complex relationship between inputs and outputs when more data is available the hann model showed stronger capability and robustness in prediction and extrapolation therefore hann model developed under 89 11 group was employed for the following analysis 3 4 sensitivity and scenario analysis the accuracy test results are presented in table 1 this test analyzed the sensitivity of the final hann output results to input variations by resetting them to designated default values it was seen that changes in water quality parameters like δturbidity δnh4 the ph and cod of raw water and the residual chlorine of treated water significantly influenced the accuracy of model simulation whereas temperature only had limited influence on the model performance among operational parameters changes of electricity consumption coagulant and active chlorine dosage greatly affected the model accuracy and active chlorine dosage seemed to have the highest impact in this test lime hydrate dosage and tertiary process had the least impact among all variables the sensitivity of model results to each variable was also studied using garson equation and anova where the relative importance of each variable and interaction between variables were quantified tables 2 and 3 table 2 shows that temperature was the least important variable and active chlorine dosage was most important which was in alignment with the accuracy test however compared to the accuracy test garson analysis underestimated the importance of coagulant dosage and overestimated the importance of tertiary process the anova test also underestimated the significance of coagulant dosage and overestimated the importance of temperature in comparison with results from garson analysis but it was observed that the interactions of significant variables and insignificant variables resulted in significant impact towards model performance this might suggest that when studying complex water treatment systems a sensitivity analysis of model results that focused on individual input parameters was not sufficient and that the input variables could be interdependent with each other the above results implied that besides the chemical and water quality parameters of raw water and treated water operational parameters like energy consumption and tertiary process cost had a significant impact on water production and should be taken into consideration therefore scenario analysis was performed to evaluate the influence of water quality and operational parameters on final water production fig 7 the variation in water production was calculated using the developed hann hybrid model fig 7a exhibits that a dwtp s water production fluctuated along with the increasing and decreasing of cod in raw water which suggested that a dwtp could produce more clean water with the same energy and chemical input with better raw water quality it was observed that by increasing coagulant dosage a dwtp might compensate for the loss of water productivity due to elevated cod concentration but the compensation was limited a possible reason was provided in previous studies zhan et al 2010 zhao et al 2011 which explained that the residual dissolved organic matter dom might have low molecular weight and be hydrophilic and thus be difficult to remove even when more coagulant was added fig 7b shows that a dwtp s water production increased linearly with additional active chlorine dosage assuming there was no maximum water treatment capacity for one dwtp in this case active chlorine was used in all dwtps for disinfection in fig 7c the temperature drop was accompanied by a decrease in water production while temperature rise might lead to a substantial increase in water production one of the possible reasons was that the temperature of the raw water could have a significant effect on coagulation and flocculation performance due to several physio chemical factors hanson and cleasby 1990 duan and gregory 2003 such as particle transport processes particle collision rates hydrolysis reactions and solubility of the metal hydroxide another possibility was that temperature increase was closely linked to increase in water demand causing water production to increase then in summer time high temperature tends to result in higher water usage which would cause dwtps to produce more water during winter low water usage would in turn reduce water production fig 7d presents the relationship between electricity consumption and water production where the water production increased and then dropped rapidly with increasing electricity consumption most electricity consumed in dwtps was used for pumping and the relationship between pumping efficiency and energy input was similar to the trend presented it was speculated that increasing electricity input could enhance water treatment process and pumping efficiency within a certain range but excess electricity input could cause pumping efficiency to decline and then led to a reduction in water production based on the modeling results changes in water quality and operational parameters could significantly affect water production water production exhibited temporal characteristics in relation to temperature variation over the year worsening inlet water quality could cause increased operational cost however higher operational input might not result in higher water production more sophisticated overall management would be required based on the interactions among water quality and operation variations 3 5 future implication the rapid development in artificial intelligence and machine learning offers many opportunities in dwtp modeling and management the underlying mechanisms and interactive relationships among water quality chemical and energy inputs and even external variables such as the demand from population can be captured by tools like hann model with pre set rules and long term high quality data clean water production capacity might limit regional population and economical capacity by revealing the complex relationships between water quality operation and water production dwtps could react in advance to cope with raw water quality deterioration and stricter regulations the data used in this study is limited to dwtps in china however thanks to the different process combinations in different dwtps it could be expected that the model would also work in different dwtps around the world moreover the performance of the developed hann model could be enhanced by feeding more training data which makes the developed model suitable to be a general management tool since more dynamic data input from dwtps and constant self learning and calibration will further improve the predictive accuracy the hann hybrid model 4 conclusions this study developed a prediction tool for the estimation of the monthly water production of drinking water treatment plants through a hybrid artificial neural network hann model enhanced by genetic algorithm the hann model was trained validated and further verified with monthly data from 45 dwtps across china eleven water quality and operational parameters were used as input variables this led to the following key findings the hann model performed well in predicting the overall water production of dwtps by combining water quality and operational parameters with water quantity there has been a need for such a model and the model is novel when compared with the past ones which mainly focused on modeling water quality and operational demands of specific processes within dtwps the hann model combined the advantages of artificial neural network and genetic algorithm showing stronger capability and robustness in extrapolation than the individual ann models the performance of the hann model increased significantly from 0 71 to 0 93 r2 by feeding more training data suggesting hann model has the potential to evolve the water production of dwtps was closely linked to water quality and operational parameters in particular the interactions between input parameters exerted a greater effect than individual ones and energy consumption and tertiary process cost should be considered the hann model could predict variation in water production based on parameter variations through scenario analysis this could be an overall management tool for decision makers and dwtp managers to make plans in advance of changes in water quality standards source water quality and market demand thus increasing resilience of dwtps acknowledgement we

18537,stringent regulations and deteriorating source water quality could greatly influence the water production capacity of drinking water treatment plants dwtps using models to predict the performance of dwtps under stress provides valuable information for decision making and future planning a hybrid statistic model named hann was established by combining artificial neural network ann with genetic algorithm ga aiming at forecasting the overall performance of dwtps nationwide in china monthly data from 45 dwtps across china was employed water quality parameters like temperature and chemical oxygen demand cod and operational parameters like electricity consumption and chemical consumption were selected as input variables while drinking water production was employed as the output both preliminary data analysis and principal component analysis pca suggested a clear non linear relationship between the input and output variables the structure of the hann model was optimized by employing the lowest mean squared error mse as the indicator the resultant hann model performed well when simulating the training datasets its predictive accuracy for the independent test datasets was enhanced when feeding more training datasets and the performance was constantly higher than the independent multi layered ann models using the coefficient of determination r2 as the indicator indicating the hann model was capable of capturing complex non linear relationship and extrapolation results from accuracy test garson sensitivity analysis and analysis of variance anova suggested the quantity of water produced by dwtps was closely linked to water quality and operational parameters the scenario analysis showed that the hann model was capable of predicting water production variation based on the parameter variations indicating that the hann model could be a general management tool for decision makers and dwtp managers to make plans in advance of regulatory changes source water quality variations and market demand graphical abstract image 1 keywords artificial neural network genetic algorithm drinking water treatment water production 1 introduction demand for high quality drinking water is growing worldwide because of rapid urbanization and industrialization smeti et al 2009 in china and many other developing areas growing demand for safe drinking water has greatly burdened drinking water treatment plants dwtps chew et al 2018 the gradual deterioration in raw water quality and the requirement for sophisticated water quality control due to the changes in drinking water regulations both put more pressure on current treatment processes rietveld et al 2008 the above changes continue to challenge the capability of dwtps to produce drinking water of proper quality and quantity which not only is an important prerequisite to prosperity and political stability but also fosters the adaptive capacity of the societies wilderer 2004 as a result of these concerns water companies like veolia have highlighted the need and importance of estimating and predicting water production capability this inspires the development of macro scale models for overall management that have the ability to determine the effect of worsening water quality and more stringent regulations on treated water production to confirm whether volume produced will be sufficient when water quality and operational conditions change and to react in advance to cope with the above mentioned problems however the individual processes in dwtps such as coagulation sedimentation filtration and disinfection are inherently complicated and there is a poor understanding of how these unit processes interact with each other when integrated together so it is difficult to describe them quantitatively and accurately with common mechanistic models and simple regression models heddam et al 2012 baxter et al 2001 nandi et al 2010 artificial neural network ann models are data driven models derived from the development of artificial intelligence ai that have become increasingly popular due to their wide range of applicability and their ability to describe complicated and non linear problems without considering the underlying mechanism baxter et al 2001 khataee and kasiri 2011 fan et al 2016 for an ann model to function it requires a large amount of raw data for training validation and testing to accurately capture the non linear relationship between the inputs and outputs so the growing computational speed of modern central process units cpu has facilitated the application of ann models ann models have been employed to tackle numerous environmental issues for example a number of studies have used ann models to predict water resource variables like water quantity and water quality in river systems maier et al 2010 maier and dandy 2000 dawson and wilby 2001 and coastal environments chau 2006 zhang et al 2012 2018 he and he 2008 as well as pollutant removal efficiency in water treatment experiments zhang and pan 2014 elmolla et al 2010 ghaedi and vafaei 2017 the ann models also served as an important part for quantitative structure property relationships qspr calculation borhani et al 2016 ye et al 2017 water treatment plant operators usually store a sufficiently large amount of historical data newhart et al 2019 that is suitable for training validating and testing ann models and thus has been the focus of numerous ann studies previous studies ghaedi and vafaei 2017 guo et al 2015 najafzadeh and zeinolabedini 2019 ju et al 2019 have compared the prediction accuracy and capacity of water treatment plant performance by several machine learning algorithms among which ann provided more precise prediction in most cases than support vector machine svm adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis etc a protocol was introduced by wu et al 2014 for developing ann models and assessing the quality of the ann model development process in drinking water quality modeling al shayji and liu 2002 used an ann model to simulate the performance of some large scale water desalination plants compared to statistical regression model the ann model was more robust and able to enhance the prediction accuracy for the performance of the desalination plants marzouk and elkadi 2016 successfully employed an ann model to estimate costs for water treatment plants a number of specific processes within dtwps have also been modelled using ann model to predict parameters such as water quality and operational demand and the methodology for applying ann models to individual process is available in baxter et al 2002a for example ann models were applied to predict real time coagulant dosage heddam et al 2012 dharman et al 2012 baxter et al 2002b gomes et al 2015 kim and parnichkun 2017 membrane fouling in filtration systems shetty and chellam 2003 bagheri et al 2019 sludge generated in an oxylator unit naeamikhah et al 2017 filtration performance griffiths and andrews 2011 and turbine power requirements for mixing processes sincero 2003 although the use of ann to model overall performance of a dwtp is not common the success of these earlier studies provides ample motivation for applying ann methods to model treated water production ann can be optimized using genetic algorithm ga which is considered a superior optimization method compared to many other heuristic algorithms in consideration of balance of accuracy and time complexity for some complex problems fan et al 2018 kar 2016 ho and pepyne 2002 it was developed based on the law of evolution ga usually starts with a randomly initialized population as solutions and the solutions are assigned a fitness score then after selection crossover mating mutation and evaluation the algorithm finds the best solution to the problem based on the pre set criteria ann models are black box models and connection weights and biases are the only parameters obtained for understanding how the networks function ga has the potential to optimize the weights and biases to aid the network to better describe the relationship between inputs and outputs given the higher tolerance of ga ann models to input data imprecision uncertainty and approximation the adoption of ga to ann is a promising way to increase prediction accuracy and reduce the computational demand of generating predictions for dwtps meanwhile based on the sufficient theory development methodological and application studies on water treatment fan et al 2018 kar 2016 al aani et al 2019 bagheri et al 2016 ga ann is expected to insure prediction robustness and reliability of large scale dwtps performance ga ann combined models can also be powerful tools for investigating the interdependencies among variables through searching large numbers of combinations koc et al 2007 applied ann and ga to optimize whole milk powder plant variables a hybrid model involving ann and ga was developed by burchard levine et al 2014 to give early alerts of river water quality strugholtz et al 2008 employed ann and ga to optimize the performance of a ceramic membrane microfiltration plant so far to the authors knowledge the ann technique has not yet been used to study how resilient a plant s treated water production volume is to changes in water quality and operational parameters such as energy use cost and chemical consumption this may provide water companies with useful information for overall management and decision making in this study data from 45 dwtps in china was used to construct a hybrid artificial neural network hann model enhanced by genetic algorithm to predict overall water production performance of dwtps by connecting water quality and operational parameters with water quantity the raw data was firstly analyzed by preliminary data analysis and principal component analysis and then grouped together as training groups and independent test groups to feed into the hann models and multi layered ann models the input variables included operational parameters and water quality variables and the designated output was water production the proposed model was optimized and comparisons were made to other independent ann models based on different division of data sensitivity analysis was conducted to study the function and relative importance of input variables in the end scenario analysis was performed using the established hann model to predict water production under varying situations 2 materials and methods 2 1 data processing all data from drinking water treatment plants dwtps was provided by veolia the drinking water treatment plants were all located in china and treatment process varied from plant to plant all data from dwtps was in the form of dataset and each dataset used in this study contained average operational parameters water quality parameters and water production of one dwtp in one month of 2015 a total of 498 datasets from 45 dwtps were used after trimming all the invalid datasets raw data was analyzed and grouped to reduce the number of input variables to 11 shown in fig 1 the 11 input variables were total electricity consumption tec which was the electricity consumed for water treatment and pumping δturbidity and δnh4 which were the difference between raw water quality and treated water quality according to the regulations the temperature ph and cod of raw water residual chlorine of treated water lime hydrate dosage coagulant polyaluminum chloride pac active chlorine which was the chlorine used for disinfection tertiary process cost which was the cost of all tertiary treatment processes including but not limited to activated carbon adsorption ion exchange aeration and oxidation the output variable was monthly average water production after preliminary data processing and re arrangement principal component analysis was conducted to evaluate the potential relationship among all input variables to ensure that there was no redundancy in the final input variables based on the contribution of inputs to the calculated principal component in order to ensure all input variables were important rather than descending dimension and feature extraction of the nonlinear correlation inputs by nonlinear pca the principal component regression was conducted to make sure the non linear relationship between the input and output variables which was the pre condition we applied ann for modeling prediction 2 2 modeling methodology the establishment of independent ann models and ga enhanced ann hybrid model denoted hann model was coded and operated in the matlab r2014a environment before modeling all data was normalized to the range of 0 1 in general the whole datasets were randomly divided into training groups for model development training 60 validation 20 and testing 20 and independent test groups to validate the predictive performance of the developed model trial and error was performed to select the optimal data division to be the best representative different data division ratios of 60 training 40 independent test 70 training 30 independent test and 89 training 11 independent test were performed to explore the influence of data divisions on model performance the scheme for hann modeling and coding are illustrated in fig 1 both feed forward back propagation ann model hann and elman back propagation model hann e were employed for comparison during the hann modeling the independent multi layered ann models were developed based on the feed forward back propagation method it consisted of 1 input layer 1 3 hidden layers and 1 output layer a general expression for the ann model was shown in equation 1 and equations 2 and 3 represented the transfer functions for the hidden layer and output layer respectively during the training process the weights and biases in the network were calculated by the ga function eq 4 to monitor the evolution in fitness and the calculation either terminated at the maximum evolution generation or when the fitness met the preset goals the parameters including training algorithm hidden neuron number population size and number of evolution generations were optimized by minimizing the mean squared error mse and fitness until the optimum architecture for the hann model was reached other parameters were pre defined as default values the training algorithms tested in this study were the levenberg marquardt lm algorithm bayesian regulation backpropagation br bfgs quasi newton backpropagation bfg gradient

comparison mean squared error mse eq 5 was used as the criteria to compare the performance of each model and the coefficient of determination r2 and mean absolute percentage error mape eq 6 was used to evaluate the predictive performance of the established models 5 m s e i 1 i n s i a i 2 n 6 m a p e 100 n t 1 n a i s i a i where n is the number of datasets s i is the simulated output value for i data point and a i is the actual output value for i data point 2 3 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis was conducted in the matlab r2014a environment using accuracy test garson weight equation and anova test accuracy test was designed specifically for the hann model to evaluate the performance of the model when individual input variables were absent garson weight equation analyzed the relative importance of each input variable with updated weight and bias values the anova test studied the effects of individual input variables and interactions between the input variables on the hann model performance based on pure statistical logic accuracy tests were carried out by assuming one input parameter was missing and set as a default value table 1 the accuracy was calculated using equation 7 7 a k 1 i 1 i n s i k v i i 1 n v i where a k is the accuracy of the hann model when k input variable was missing and replaced with a default value s ik is the simulated output value of all datasets from the hann model for i data point when k input variable was missing and replaced with a default value v i was the actual output value of all datasets for i data point the relative importance of each input parameter was calculated using the garson weight equation eq 8 the weight and bias values were extracted from the optimum hann model for the calculation 8 q i k j 1 l w i j r

neurons and the hidden neuron j wij is the connection weight between the input neuron i and the hidden neuron j v jk is the connection weight between the hidden neuron j and the output neuron k 2 4 scenario analysis scenario tests were conducted to evaluate the uncertainties of the hann model and analyze the performance of the model when water quality and operational parameters were varied according to the results of sensitivity analysis four scenarios were simulated 1 raw water chemical oxygen demand cod variation and cod variation with increased coagulant dosage 2 raw water temperature variation 3 active chlorine dosage variation and 4 electricity consumption variation the input data was varied hypothetically but within the boundary of dwtps involved in this study the simulated water production was calculated using the established hann model 3 results and discussion 3 1 preliminary data analysis and principal component analysis preliminary data analysis and pca study were conducted on data collected from the 45 dwtps nationwide in china to explore the complex underlying relationships among the available parameters and determine the final input variables the variations of the 11 input parameters and water production as the output were selected for modeling are shown in fig 2 parameters such as chemical oxygen demand cod temperature ph of the raw water δnh4 and free chlorine in treated water were normally distributed however others including electricity consumption δturbidity and chemical consumption lime hydrate pac coagulant and active chlorine for water treatment were highly skewed suggesting that the quality of raw water supplying the dwtps was of small variability except for turbidity while electricity consumption and chemical dosage varied significantly from plant to plant and cost for tertiary processes had the least variability those highly skewed parameters were possibly strong indicators for water production of dwtps since the monthly water production of the dwtps was also not normally distributed the pca results are presented in fig 3 eleven input parameters were assigned to 10 pcs as shown the first and second pcs accounted for 26 04 and 16 63 of variance respectively indicating the input variables were poorly correlated with each other fig 3b shows the centered and scaled water production projected onto the first two principal components the dwtps labeled with numbers with large water production over 107 m3 month were more sensitive compared to smaller plants suggesting there were more uncertainties in larger dwtps fig 3c 3d exhibits different loadings of the 11 variables on the first and second pcs indicating complex relationships among input variables the above results of pca showed that the 11 input variables were all of significance for water production and it was unreasonable to exclude any input parameters principal component regression was also conducted to explore possible links between the input variables and water production it revealed the underlying non linear relationships between the input variables and output water production the exhibition of poor correlation between the first two pcs and normalized water output suggested that the complex relationships between the input variables and water production could not be captured by simple multiple regression this result indicated that the use of machine learning methods like ann for more complex pattern recognition would be suitable in this case 3 2 model structure optimization the structure of the hybrid artificial neural network model hann was optimized to reach its maximum performance using mse as the performance indicator fig 4 a presents the model performance under different training algorithms it was shown that the levenberg marquardt lm and bayesian regulation br backpropagation algorithms were more competent than others for the problem these two algorithms were both based on levenberg marquardt optimization the lm algorithm updated weight and bias values at each iteration while the br algorithm also minimized a combination of squared errors and weights in this case direct optimization of weights and biases of input variables was more efficient than other methodologies it was observed in fig 4b that the optimum number of hidden neurons in one hidden layer was 50 the mse dropped rapidly when the number of hidden neurons increased from 10 to 50 however the mse started to increase when the number of hidden neurons increased further this was because excessive hidden neurons usually lead to over fitting of the model wu et al 2014 population size number of evolution generations and the number of hidden neurons were also optimized during ga calculations fig 4c e it was found that population size of 50 300 generations and 50 hidden neurons were optimum for hann calculations although further increasing population size to 60 could reduce fitness slightly it was not cost effective since the time consumed for calculation was greatly lengthened fig 4f shows that the mse of ann models decreased significantly from 0 018 to 2 49 10 6 after increasing the number of hidden layers from one to three suggesting the performance of the ann models was greatly enhanced both hybrid model hann models used in this study employed only one hidden layer the use of ga also improved the performance mse 0 0002 and 0 0005 for hann and hann e models respectively of the hann models to a level similar to that of a 2 layered ann model 3 3 model performance evaluation the established hann model was employed to simulate water production of random dwtps in random months in 2015 the results from 1 layered 2 layered and 3 layered ann models were also used for comparison fig 5 showed that the hann model performed well during training regardless of different data divisions the coefficient of determination r2 reached 0 95 0 95 and 0 96 between the simulated and real output for 60 70 and 89 training groups respectively the performance of hann e model also reached 0 92 as presented in figure s1 although the hann models underestimated the capacity of several large dwtps with monthly water production over 1 5 107 m3 the overall performance of training was satisfactory in addition 40 30 and 11 of independent test datasets were separated from the training datasets to evaluate the predictive strength of each model r2 and mape were used as the performance indicators as presented in fig 6 in the 60 40 group the predictive strengths of the independent ann models were at similar level the hann model performed better than the ann models with r2 reaching 0 71 and mape of 53 0 it was implied that 60 training datasets might not be representative enough for the whole datasets maier et al 2010 abrahart et al 2010 bowden et al 2002 since the values of inputs and output of the dwtps were not all normally distributed fig 2 hence the models developed using only 60 data as training group could be biased for the 70 30 group the accuracy of prediction was enhanced for the three ann models but the hann model still outperformed with r2 reaching 0 89 and mape of 29 3 in addition the three layered ann model exhibited reduced predictive accuracy r2 0 71 compared to single layered one r2 0 77 possibly due to overfitting differently for the 89 11 group although the accuracy of prediction increased when the number of hidden layers increased from one to three r2 increased from 0 67 to 0 70 the predictive efficiency of the 3 layered ann model was still much lower than the hann model r2 0 93 mape 20 3 the hann e model also performed fairly well with r2 of 0 90 figure s2 but still lower than that of the hann model independent ann models tend to underestimate or overestimate the water production by 20 70 the results indicated that independent ann models encountered difficulties when learning to capture the nonlinear relationships between 11 inputs and water production of dwtps although the hann model performed less efficiently than the 3 layered ann model in terms of simulating the training datasets it constantly functioned better when predicting un trained data in all three cases of data divisions the results suggested that with the aid of genetic algorithm the updated weights and biases explained the relationships between 11 input variables and water production with more precision when compared to the multi layered ann models this result was in consistent with previous studies fan et al 2018 kuo et al 2006 where combining the advantages of the highly flexible function approximator of ann with the global solution exploration of ga revealed a better forecasting performance interestingly the performance of the hann model increased significantly from 0 71 to 0 93 r2 by feeding more training data suggesting the hann model was not over trained and the model harbored the potential to be enhanced in the future to more accurately capture complex relationship between inputs and outputs when more data is available the hann model showed stronger capability and robustness in prediction and extrapolation therefore hann model developed under 89 11 group was employed for the following analysis 3 4 sensitivity and scenario analysis the accuracy test results are presented in table 1 this test analyzed the sensitivity of the final hann output results to input variations by resetting them to designated default values it was seen that changes in water quality parameters like δturbidity δnh4 the ph and cod of raw water and the residual chlorine of treated water significantly influenced the accuracy of model simulation whereas temperature only had limited influence on the model performance among operational parameters changes of electricity consumption coagulant and active chlorine dosage greatly affected the model accuracy and active chlorine dosage seemed to have the highest impact in this test lime hydrate dosage and tertiary process had the least impact among all variables the sensitivity of model results to each variable was also studied using garson equation and anova where the relative importance of each variable and interaction between variables were quantified tables 2 and 3 table 2 shows that temperature was the least important variable and active chlorine dosage was most important which was in alignment with the accuracy test however compared to the accuracy test garson analysis underestimated the importance of coagulant dosage and overestimated the importance of tertiary process the anova test also underestimated the significance of coagulant dosage and overestimated the importance of temperature in comparison with results from garson analysis but it was observed that the interactions of significant variables and insignificant variables resulted in significant impact towards model performance this might suggest that when studying complex water treatment systems a sensitivity analysis of model results that focused on individual input parameters was not sufficient and that the input variables could be interdependent with each other the above results implied that besides the chemical and water quality parameters of raw water and treated water operational parameters like energy consumption and tertiary process cost had a significant impact on water production and should be taken into consideration therefore scenario analysis was performed to evaluate the influence of water quality and operational parameters on final water production fig 7 the variation in water production was calculated using the developed hann hybrid model fig 7a exhibits that a dwtp s water production fluctuated along with the increasing and decreasing of cod in raw water which suggested that a dwtp could produce more clean water with the same energy and chemical input with better raw water quality it was observed that by increasing coagulant dosage a dwtp might compensate for the loss of water productivity due to elevated cod concentration but the compensation was limited a possible reason was provided in previous studies zhan et al 2010 zhao et al 2011 which explained that the residual dissolved organic matter dom might have low molecular weight and be hydrophilic and thus be difficult to remove even when more coagulant was added fig 7b shows that a dwtp s water production increased linearly with additional active chlorine dosage assuming there was no maximum water treatment capacity for one dwtp in this case active chlorine was used in all dwtps for disinfection in fig 7c the temperature drop was accompanied by a decrease in water production while temperature rise might lead to a substantial increase in water production one of the possible reasons was that the temperature of the raw water could have a significant effect on coagulation and flocculation performance due to several physio chemical factors hanson and cleasby 1990 duan and gregory 2003 such as particle transport processes particle collision rates hydrolysis reactions and solubility of the metal hydroxide another possibility was that temperature increase was closely linked to increase in water demand causing water production to increase then in summer time high temperature tends to result in higher water usage which would cause dwtps to produce more water during winter low water usage would in turn reduce water production fig 7d presents the relationship between electricity consumption and water production where the water production increased and then dropped rapidly with increasing electricity consumption most electricity consumed in dwtps was used for pumping and the relationship between pumping efficiency and energy input was similar to the trend presented it was speculated that increasing electricity input could enhance water treatment process and pumping efficiency within a certain range but excess electricity input could cause pumping efficiency to decline and then led to a reduction in water production based on the modeling results changes in water quality and operational parameters could significantly affect water production water production exhibited temporal characteristics in relation to temperature variation over the year worsening inlet water quality could cause increased operational cost however higher operational input might not result in higher water production more sophisticated overall management would be required based on the interactions among water quality and operation variations 3 5 future implication the rapid development in artificial intelligence and machine learning offers many opportunities in dwtp modeling and management the underlying mechanisms and interactive relationships among water quality chemical and energy inputs and even external variables such as the demand from population can be captured by tools like hann model with pre set rules and long term high quality data clean water production capacity might limit regional population and economical capacity by revealing the complex relationships between water quality operation and water production dwtps could react in advance to cope with raw water quality deterioration and stricter regulations the data used in this study is limited to dwtps in china however thanks to the different process combinations in different dwtps it could be expected that the model would also work in different dwtps around the world moreover the performance of the developed hann model could be enhanced by feeding more training data which makes the developed model suitable to be a general management tool since more dynamic data input from dwtps and constant self learning and calibration will further improve the predictive accuracy the hann hybrid model 4 conclusions this study developed a prediction tool for the estimation of the monthly water production of drinking water treatment plants through a hybrid artificial neural network hann model enhanced by genetic algorithm the hann model was trained validated and further verified with monthly data from 45 dwtps across china eleven water quality and operational parameters were used as input variables this led to the following key findings the hann model performed well in predicting the overall water production of dwtps by combining water quality and operational parameters with water quantity there has been a need for such a model and the model is novel when compared with the past ones which mainly focused on modeling water quality and operational demands of specific processes within dtwps the hann model combined the advantages of artificial neural network and genetic algorithm showing stronger capability and robustness in extrapolation than the individual ann models the performance of the hann model increased significantly from 0 71 to 0 93 r2 by feeding more training data suggesting hann model has the potential to evolve the water production of dwtps was closely linked to water quality and operational parameters in particular the interactions between input parameters exerted a greater effect than individual ones and energy consumption and tertiary process cost should be considered the hann model could predict variation in water production based on parameter variations through scenario analysis this could be an overall management tool for decision makers and dwtp managers to make plans in advance of changes in water quality standards source water quality and market demand thus increasing resilience of dwtps acknowledgement we

18538,utilization of renewable solar energy driven advanced oxidation processes for oil sands process water ospw remediation has received extensive attention naturally existing inorganic photosensitizer in ospw was investigated in this work to provide information about the application of indirect photolysis treatment of organic contaminants in ospw ospw and ospw organic fraction were exposed under uv irradiance with fluence of 10 j cm2 to investigate the effect of ospw inorganic fraction ospw if on the non catalytic photolysis of naphthenic acids nas in ospw the results indicated that the inorganic fraction in ospw enhanced the photodegradation of nas with 24 3 of total na removal in ospw while only 12 4 of total nas were removed in ospw organic fraction moreover the photodegradation of 1 adamantanecarboxylic acid aca dissolved in ospw if or carbonate buffer was conducted to verify the enhanced photodegradation of nas by ospw if the results showed that 30 9 of aca was removed in the ospw if while no aca degradation was observed in carbonate buffer after 60 min of uv exposure indicating that the ospw if induced the photodegradation of aca in addition nitrate was identified to be the photosensitizer in ospw if responsible for the indirect photolysis of aca in the presence of nitrate both hydroxyl radicals oh and reactive nitrogen species were generated where oh was the dominant reactive species that contributed to the degradation of aca ten possible by products ranging from single to multiple hydroxyl nitroso nitro and carbonyl substituted products were

the use of energy are the principal drawbacks of aops for full scale applications oller et al 2011 thus there is considerable interest in the utilization of renewable solar energy driven aops for ospw remediation to remove organic contaminants chan et al 2012 hendrikse et al 2018 shu et al 2014 generally there are two types of photolysis processes for the degradation of organic compounds in natural water direct and indirect photolysis in the direct photolysis process organic compounds absorb photon directly which results in structural transformation in the indirect photolysis process photosensitizers in water absorb light energy to product reactive radicals which induce the photodegradation of organic compounds liu et al 2017 it was reported that nas do not absorb light resulting in a low na degradation efficiency by direct photolysis afzal et al 2012b therefore uv based aops with the generation of active radicals such as hydroxyl radicals oh sulfate radicals so4 and chlorine radicals cl initiated by h2o2 afzal et al 2012b s2o8 2 fang et al 2018 and hocl shu et al 2014 have been studied to improve the organic contaminants degradation efficiency for ospw treatment in addition light absorbing molecules such as natural organic matters humic acids nitrite and nitrate in the water matrix could act as photosensitizers to adsorb uv visible light to produce reactive radicals and achieve the indirect photolysis of organic contaminants li et al 2018 liu et al 2017 vione et al 2014 hereby the photodegradation of organic contaminant in aquatic environments is directly related to water matrix there are a variety of inorganic ions existing in ospw including na2 k ca2 mg2 mn2 cl so4 2 hco3 no3 and some trace metals to date no research has been conducted to investigate whether any inorganic species in ospw could act as photosensitizers to induce or enhance the photodegradation of organic compounds in ospw understanding the existence of photosensitizers

aca buffer was prepared by adding aca directly into ospw if or buffer owing to the low solubility of aca in water the solutions were stirred for 24 h covered with aluminum foil to ensure that aca was completely dissolved all samples were filtered with 0 2 μm nylon membrane before the photodegradation experiments and analyses the ph of aca buffer was adjusted to 8 7 using naoh as to be consistent with the ph of aca ospw if appropriate volume of nano3 cuso4 znso4 mgso4 mnso4 nacl nahco3 and na2so4 from individual stock solutions were added into 40 mg l aca buffer to obtain aca buffer with

photolysis of ospw and ospw of for the removal of natural na mixture direct photolysis of ospw and ospw of was conducted to study the degradation of natural na mixture in the presence and absence of ospw inorganic fraction 24 3 of total nas ox nas of that 46 4 of nas with two oxygen atoms o2 nas 11 2 of nas with three oxygen atoms o3 nas and 9 9 of nas with four oxygen atoms o4 nas in ospw and 12 4 of ox nas of that 29 6 of o2 nas 2 5 of o3 nas and 1 6 of o4 nas in ospw of were degraded after 60 min of direct uv exposure fig 1 a the lower na degradation in ospw of was expected as previous research shown that nas do not absorb light in the solar wavelength which contributed to the inefficient photolysis of nas afzal et al 2012b mcmartin et al 2004 the higher na degradation in ospw 24 3 as compared to ospw of 12 4 indicated that some inorganic species in ospw acted as photosensitizer s that induced or enhanced the photodegradation of nas in addition higher degradation for nas with higher carbon number and double bond equivalence dbe was observed fig 1b which was consistent with previous study about the degradation of nas in ospw in the presence of oh afzal et al 2012b the results indicated that reactive species such as oh may be involved in the photochemical process although the photolysis of ospw of achieved low na removal still trace degradation was observed indicating that some organic compounds extracted from ospw could absorb light and generate reactive species which contributed to the degradation of nas as the focus of his work was on the inorganic photosensitizer s present in ospw further investigation on organic photosensitizer s was not conducted 3 2 the effect of ospw inorganic fraction on the photodegradation of a model na ospw containing only inorganic fraction ospw if was obtained to study its effect on the photodegradation of a model compound aca the chemical and physical properties of ospw and ospw if are listed in table s3 dissolved organic carbon doc in ospw if was 1 81 0 03 mg l after doc was removed by gac there was no significant difference in terms of the main anions and cations concentration ph conductivity and alkalinity between ospw and ospw if indicating that the obtained ospw if was able to represent the condition of ospw containing only inorganics for the following experiments solution of aca 40 mg l in either 3 mm nahco3 buffer aca buffer or ospw if aca ospw if was exposed under uv irradiation to further investigate the role of ospw if on the photodegradation of the model na the results showed a 30 9 degradation of aca in aca ospw if while no degradation of aca in aca buffer solution was observed after 60 min of uv exposure fig 2 indicating that the ospw if induced the photodegradation of aca the results demonstrated the presence of photosensitizer s in ospw if which could produce reactive radicals and induce the degradation of aca in addition the higher absorbance of aca ospw if compared to aca buffer fig s2 also confirmed the existing of photosensitizer s in ospw if in order to clarify the specific ions in ospw that induced the photodegradation of aca main ions with similar concentration in ospw were individually spiked into each aca buffer and exposed under uv irradiation the results fig 2b c showed that all cations as well as cl and so4 2 had no effect on the photodegradation of aca while no3 induced the photodegradation of aca previous work showed that the addition of cl to pure water increased the photolytic rate of thiamphenicol and florfenicol under uv vis irradiation due to the formation of 1o2 ge et al 2009 however the promotion effect of cl on the photodegradation of aca was not observed in this study sanches et al 2011 reported that experiments conducted with different target compounds in different matrices may show contradictory effects in terms of the influence of chloride on the degradation efficiency thus no aca degradation observed in this study with the addition of cl may due to the low reactivity of aca to 1o2 or the low production of 1o2 previous work pointed out that nitrate is an important photosensitizer that is ubiquitous and also the key source of the oh in natural waters brezonik and fulkerson brekken 1998 jacobs et al 2008 consistent with the previous work about the initiation effect of nitrate on the photodegradation of other organic compounds e g benzophenone atenolol pahs and chlorotoluron ge et al 2019 jacobs et al 2008 ji et al 2012 nélieu et al 2009 this study demonstrated the induced effect of nitrate on the indirect photolysis of aca in addition light absorption by the aca in ospw if solution aca ospw if overlapped with the uv vis absorbance spectrum of aca in 0 3 mm nitrate solution aca 0 3 mm nitrate fig s2 strongly suggesting that nitrate was the dominant inorganic photosensitizer in ospw the fluence based pseudo first order decay rate constants k cm2 j of aca in 0 3 mm nitrate and ospw if is indicated by a linear plot of ln c c0 versus the uv dose of fluence fig s3 the rate equation was expressed as 1 d c df k c the k value of aca in 0 3 mm nitrate was 0 0734 cm2 j which was higher than that in ospw if 0 0332 cm2 j indicating that the presence of other water matrix in ospw if may inhibit nitrate induced photodegradation of aca influence of abundance anions existing in ospw cl hco3 and so4 2 on the nitrate induced photodegradation of aca was studied the results showed that cl and so4 2 played a negligible role on the photodegradation of aca in the presence of nitrate while hco3 inhibited the degradation of aca fig s4 similar inhibition effect of hco3 was obtained on the photodegradation of oxytetracycline in the presence of no3 in another study by li et al 2018 the inhibition effect of hco3 owes to its function as a oh scavenger via the following equations eq 2 in addition hydrolysis of hco3 produces co3 2 which is highly reactive with oh eq 3 liu et al 2017 2 hco 3 oh co 3 h 2 o k hco 3 oh 8 5 10 6 m 1 s 1 3 co 3 2 oh co 3 oh k co 3 2 oh 3 9 10 8 m 1 s 1 3 3 exploration of the reaction mechanism of the nitrate induced photodegradation of aca 3 3 1 effect of oh on the no3 induced photodegradation of aca no3 can absorb light and act as a photosensitizer to promote the photoreaction vione et al 2005 the photolysis of no3 leads to the formation of both oh and reactive nitrogen species rns no and no2 via the following photochemical processes eqs 4 7 nélieu et al 2009 the no2 could then recombine to form n2o4 which would degrade back into no3 and no2 eqs 8 and 9 and continue the photolysis process 4 no3 h2o hν no2 oh oh 5 no3 hν no2 o 3p 6 no2 h2o hν no oh oh 7 no2 oh no2 oh 8 2 no2 n2o4 9 n2o4 h2o 2h no2 no3 the produced oh and rns from the photolysis of no3 could oxidize aca and contribute to the indirect photolysis of aca to identify the dominant radicals responsible for the aca degradation in the presence of no3 two radical quenching agents tba and aa were added into the aca solution with 0 3 mm no3 to capture oh and rns the two scavengers have been reported to have different reactivity with oh and no3 specifically the rate constants of tba and aa with oh and no3 a form of rns are as following anbar and neta 1967 feng et al 2015 mezyk et al 2017 10 tba oh intermediates k 2 8 10 8 m 1 s 1 11 tba no 3 intermediates k 5 7 1 3 10 4 m 1 s 1 12 aa oh intermediates k 1 2 10 9 m 1 s 1 13 aa no 3 intermediates k 2 2 0 2 10 8 m 1 s 1 based on these characteristics tba was selected to scavenge oh whereas aa was used to scavenge both oh and rns as shown in fig 3 a the addition of 10 mm aa completely inhibited the photodegradation of aca and 10 mm tba diminishing aca removal to 12 8 after 60 min uv exposure the restrained effect of tba was enhanced with increasing concentration the result indicated that aca was predominantly oxidized by oh similar findings were also obtained by ji et al 2012 who suggested that oh was the dominated radical in the nitrate induced photodegradation of atenolol the completed inhibition of the photodegradation of aca in the presence of 10 mm aa indicated that rns was involved in the degradation of aca although at a much slower rate than oh which was expected due to the much lower redox potential of 1 03 v for no2 as compared to oh 1 8 2 7 v ji et al 2017 moreover as rns were involved in the regeneration of no2 and no3 for the continuous production of oh eqs 4 9 the scavenging of both rns and oh by aa completely quenched the reactive radicals in the system which completely inhibited the photodegradation of aca a positive correlation between nitrate concentration and the production of oh under the exposure of uv lamp was reported previously brezonik and fulkerson brekken 1998 therefore it was expected that increasing the no3 concentration would increasing the production of oh and enhance the degradation of aca however our results showed that with the increasing of no3 concentration from 0 3 mm to 3 mm insignificance increase of aca degradation was observed fig 3b it may be explained by the scavenging effect of no2 on oh with the increasing concentration of no3 excessively no2 was generated which consumed oh and resulted in negligible enhanced aca degradation eq 7 anbar and neta 1967 liu et al 2017 moreover the formation of n2o4 during the photolysis of no3 process contributed to the yield back of no3 and no2 eqs 8 and 9 the regenerated no3 would continue to initiate the production of oh under uv exposure li et al 2018 vione et al 2005 thus in our study no3 concentration was not a key factor on the rate of aca photodegradation the results also showed that no3 acted as an initiator for the indirect photolysis of aca after initiation process the propagation of radicals in the system would continue with the auto oxidation of aca or the regeneration of no3 the study by ji et al 2017 has also shown similar trend where the increase in nitrite no2 concentration did not increase the rate of degradation of phenol but the authors found that the number and concentration of generated nitroaromatic compounds increased with increasing nitrite concentration thus it is also important to investigate the by products formation from the nitrate induced photodegradation of aca natural occurrence concentration of nitrate in ospw was enough and of advantage for the nitrate induced photodegradation of the model compound it was reported that nitrate had a stronger absorption band near 200 nm and a weaker one around 300 nm with the extension towards longer wavelength up to 340 nm which accounted for the ability of nitrate to absorb the uva and uvb regions of sunlight vione et al 2005 niu et al 2013 moreover nitrate induced photodegradation of various organic compounds under the irradiation of sunlight or solar simulator have been studied ge et al 2019 jacobs et al 2008 ji et al 2012 nélieu et al 2009 which demonstrated the feasibility of sunlight nitrate induced photodegradation of nas in ospw however considering the relative low irradiation intensity of natural sunlight in the wavelength range that nitrate has the absorption fig s2 extending the exposure time should be considered in this work solar exposure of ospw and aca in the presence of ospw inorganic fraction was conducted to further study the effect of inorganic photosensitizers in ospw on the photodegradation of nas under solar irradiation produced by a solar simulator the results showed that after 12 h exposure 2 0 of o2 nas in ospw and 4 2 0 9 of aca in the presence of ospw inorganic fraction were degraded the low degradation was expected as the uv irradiance of the solar simulator was much lower 0 018 mw cm2 compared to that of the medium pressure mercury lamp 2 92 mw cm2 the results indicated that the nitrate induced photo oxidation may potentially be used as a low cost passive system for ospw remediation in terms of the degradation of organic contaminants however studies involving more organic compounds would be required moreover the photodegradation rate constant of the organic contaminants at various water depth may be different due to the sunlight attenuation and intensity variation zhou et al 2018 thus more studies with respect to field water bodies could be conducted in the future in addition the relative high absorbance of ospw of in fig s2 and degradation of nas in ospw of fig 1 demonstrated that some natural organic photosensitizers may be present in ospw and could be further investigated and utilized for the implementation of solar driven photolysis of organic contaminants in ospw 3 3 2 identification of degradation by products and pathways samples of aca buffer in the presence of no3 100 mg l aca and 0 8 mm no3 before and after uv irradiation were analyzed by uplc tof ms to identify the by products of the no3 induced photodegradation of aca a longer irradiation time of 120 min and higher concentration of aca 100 mg l and no3 0 8 mm were used to ensure enough concentration of the by products were produced for the identification of the by products meanwhile difference in the by products produced between a short and long irradiation time may be observed with a longer irradiation time three new peaks in the total chromatogram tic were observed at 4 26 4 54 and 4 84 min after the uv irradiation fig s5 indicating that at least three by products were formed based on the elemental formula generated from the measured mass 5 ppm of the new peaks by products with 6 different molecular formulas were produced table s4 one isomer of a by product was presented for illustration proposes table s4 and fig s5 the corresponding theoretical and observed isotope ratio of the proposed by products are listed in fig s6 fig s11 the possible degradation pathways with 120 min exposure were proposed in fig 4 in pathway i the oh attacked a secondary carbon forming a carbon radical which would then react with dissolved oxygen to form carbonylated aca p1 fig 4 and hydroxylated aca p2 1 fig 4 in pathway ii the oh would attack a tertiary carbon forming a carbon radical which react with another oh to form hydroxylated aca p2 2 fig 4 where the hydroxyl was substituted at a tertiary carbon instead of a secondary carbon in p2 1 then oh continued to attack p2 2 at another tertiary carbon to form the hydroxylated aca radical which then combined with no2 to form one hydroxyl and one nitro substituent by product p4 1 fig 4 moreover the reaction between the oh and secondary carbon would continue to form by products with one carbonyl one hydroxyl and one nitro substituents p5 1 as well as two hydroxyl and one nitro substituents p6 1 fig 4 meanwhile for pathway iii the reaction between the oh and secondary or tertiary carbon would continue to form by products with two hydroxyl substituents p3 fig 4 then in the presence of no a two hydroxyl and one nitroso substituents by products p4 2 fig 4 and finally three hydroxyl and one nitroso substituents p5 2 fig 4 as well as two hydroxyl one carbonyl and one nitroso substituents p6 fig 4 were formed as oh is more reactivity towards tertiary carbon due to the formation of more stable intermediate radicals after hydrogen atom abstractions afzal et al 2012b anbar et al 1966 the by products proposed in pathway ii and iii had the substituents at the tertiary carbon the degradation pathways agreed with our earlier finding section 3 3 1 that oh was the key oxidizing species and the change of nitrate concentration had little impact on the degradation rate of aca as the initial step for all the proposed pathways would be the formation aca radical through an electron transfer by oh the plausible reason that the substitution of only one nitro no2 or nitroso no occurred in step 2 in pathway ii and step 3 in pathway iii was that the reactivity of rns was lower than oh where the reactivity to aca be proposed to be oh no2 no as no three hydroxyls only substituent was detected suggesting that pathway ii and iii were stepwise reaction instead of a simultaneous reaction where the substitution of a third hydroxyl group is not favorable p5 and p6 were only detected in the samples that were exposed under uv irradiance for 90 and 120 min while not observed in the samples exposed for 30 and 60 min the result strongly suggested that p5 and p6 were formed after the h abstraction happened at secondary carbon where the reactivity is lower than that at tertiary carbon the formation of nitroso and nitro substituted by products also suggested the possibility of the formation of potentially toxic and carcinogenic by products such as nitroaromatic in the presence of aromatic and nitrosamine if an amine is present in the structure thus further study on the formation of nitrosamine from nitrate induce photo oxidation should be conducted and the toxicity and carcinogenicity of the treated water should be tested 4 conclusions after 60 min of direct exposure under uv irradiation of 2 92 mw cm2 higher degradation of nas in ospw 24 3 as compared to that in ospw of 12 4 showed that some inorganic species in ospw enhanced the photodegradation of nas nas with higher carbon number and dbe were preferentially degraded during the ospw direct photo oxidation process it was also confirmed that some inorganic species in ospw could induce the photodegradation of a model compound aca which was not degradable by the direct photolysis process it was found that no3 was the most likely inorganic ion responsible for the induced photodegradation process as no photodegradation of aca was observed in the presence of other major ions in ospw abundant ions in ospw such as cl and so4 2 showed negligible effect on the nitrate induced photodegradation of aca while hco3 inhibited the photodegradation of aca both oh and rns were generated during the nitrate induced aca photodegradation process where oh was demonstrated to be the dominant reactive species that contributed to the degradation of aca ten by products including a pair of isomers were proposed to be formed during the nitrate induced aca photodegradation process this study showed that the nitrate could be utilized as a natural photosensitizer to induce photo oxidation of organic contaminants in ospw and could potentially be utilized in a low cost passive solar system for the remediation of ospw with extended exposure time as nitrate is known to be ubiquitous in natural aquatic environment nitrate induced photodegradation could also be used in other wastewater treatment systems such as waste stabilization pond and wetland remediation where the wastewaters are exposed for natural degradation in conclusion the results of this research suggest that the photodegradation efficiency of ospw treatment strategies can be enhanced in presence of the inorganic photosensitizer in ospw acknowledgements this work was supported by

photosensitizer in ospw was investigated in this work to provide information about the application of indirect photolysis treatment of organic contaminants in ospw ospw and ospw organic fraction were exposed under uv irradiance with fluence of 10 j cm2 to investigate the effect of ospw inorganic fraction ospw if on the non catalytic photolysis of naphthenic acids nas in ospw the results indicated that the inorganic fraction in ospw enhanced the photodegradation of nas with 24 3 of total na removal in ospw while only 12 4 of total nas were removed in ospw organic fraction moreover the photodegradation of 1 adamantanecarboxylic acid aca dissolved in ospw if or carbonate buffer was conducted to verify the enhanced photodegradation of nas by ospw if the results showed that 30 9 of aca was removed in the ospw if while no aca degradation was observed in carbonate buffer after 60 min of uv exposure indicating that the ospw if induced the photodegradation of aca in addition nitrate was identified to be the photosensitizer in ospw if responsible for the indirect photolysis of aca in the presence of nitrate both hydroxyl radicals oh and reactive nitrogen species were generated where oh was the dominant reactive species that contributed to the degradation of aca ten possible by products ranging from single to multiple hydroxyl nitroso nitro and carbonyl substituted products were proposed to be produced from the nitrate induced photodegradation process through three different pathways this study demonstrated that the photolysis of nas in ospw due to the presence of natural photosensitizers and nitrate could act as a natural photosensitizer for the remediation of ospw by the photo oxidation process graphical abstract image 1 keywords oil sands process water naphthenic

aca buffer was prepared by adding aca directly into ospw if or buffer owing to the low solubility of aca in water the solutions were stirred for 24 h covered with aluminum foil to ensure that aca was completely dissolved all samples were filtered with 0 2 μm nylon membrane before the photodegradation experiments and analyses the ph of aca buffer was adjusted to 8 7 using naoh as to be consistent with the ph of aca ospw if appropriate volume of nano3 cuso4 znso4 mgso4 mnso4 nacl nahco3 and na2so4 from individual stock solutions were added into 40 mg l aca buffer to obtain aca buffer with individual ions whose concentration was similar with that in real ospw table s3 for example 18 mg l no3 0 3 mm of nano3 in aca buffer was prepared based on the nitrate concentration in real ospw 2 3 irradiation experiments uv irradiation experiments were conducted in a 100 ml beaker 5 4 cm diameter with 80 ml sample solution the beaker was placed on a magnetic stirrer under a collimated beam generated by a uv apparatus model psi i 120 calgon carbon corporation pittsburgh pa usa equipped with a medium pressure hg lamp with the emission wavelength from 200 nm to 530 nm as shown in fig s2

photolysis of ospw and ospw of for the removal of natural na mixture direct photolysis of ospw and ospw of was conducted to study the degradation of natural na mixture in the presence and absence of ospw inorganic fraction 24 3 of total nas ox nas of that 46 4 of nas with two oxygen atoms o2 nas 11 2 of nas with three oxygen atoms o3 nas and 9 9 of nas with four oxygen atoms o4 nas in ospw and 12 4 of ox nas of that 29 6 of o2 nas 2 5 of o3 nas and 1 6 of o4 nas in ospw of were degraded after 60 min of direct uv exposure fig 1 a the lower na degradation in ospw of was expected as previous research shown that nas do not absorb light in the solar wavelength which contributed to the inefficient photolysis of nas afzal et al 2012b mcmartin et al 2004 the higher na degradation in ospw 24 3 as compared to ospw of 12 4 indicated that some inorganic species in ospw acted as photosensitizer s that induced or enhanced the photodegradation of nas in addition higher degradation for nas with higher carbon number and double bond equivalence dbe was observed fig 1b which was consistent with previous study about the degradation of nas in ospw in the presence of oh afzal et al 2012b the results indicated that reactive species such as oh may be involved in the photochemical process although the photolysis of ospw of achieved low na removal still trace degradation was observed indicating that some organic compounds extracted from ospw could absorb light and generate reactive species which contributed to the degradation of nas as the focus of his work was on the inorganic photosensitizer s present in ospw further investigation on organic photosensitizer s was not conducted 3 2 the effect of ospw inorganic fraction on the photodegradation of a model na ospw containing only inorganic fraction ospw if was obtained to study its effect on the photodegradation of a model compound aca the chemical and physical properties of ospw and ospw if are listed in table s3 dissolved organic carbon doc in ospw if was 1 81 0 03 mg l after doc was removed by gac there was no significant difference in terms of the main anions and cations concentration ph conductivity and alkalinity between ospw and ospw if indicating that the obtained ospw if was able to represent the condition of ospw containing only inorganics for the following experiments solution of aca 40 mg l in either 3 mm nahco3 buffer aca buffer or ospw if aca ospw if was exposed under uv irradiation to further investigate the role of ospw if on the photodegradation of the model na the results showed a 30 9 degradation of aca in aca ospw if while no degradation of aca in aca buffer solution was observed after 60 min of uv exposure fig 2 indicating that the ospw if induced the photodegradation of aca the results demonstrated the presence of photosensitizer s in ospw if which could produce reactive radicals and induce the degradation of aca in addition the higher absorbance of aca ospw if compared to aca buffer fig s2 also confirmed the existing of photosensitizer s in ospw if in order to clarify the specific ions in ospw that induced the photodegradation of aca main ions with similar concentration in ospw were individually spiked into each aca buffer and exposed under uv irradiation the results fig 2b c showed that all cations as well as cl and so4 2 had no effect on the photodegradation of aca while no3 induced the photodegradation of aca previous work showed that the addition of cl to pure water increased the photolytic rate of thiamphenicol and florfenicol under uv vis irradiation due to the formation of 1o2 ge et al 2009 however the promotion effect of cl on the photodegradation of aca was not observed in this study sanches et al 2011 reported that experiments conducted with different target compounds in different matrices may show contradictory effects in terms of the influence of chloride on the degradation efficiency thus no aca degradation observed in this study with the addition of cl may due to the low reactivity of aca to 1o2 or the low production of 1o2 previous work pointed out that nitrate is an important photosensitizer that is ubiquitous and also the key source of the oh in natural waters brezonik and fulkerson brekken 1998 jacobs et al 2008 consistent with the previous work about the initiation effect of nitrate on the photodegradation of other organic compounds e g benzophenone atenolol pahs and chlorotoluron ge et al 2019 jacobs et al 2008 ji et al 2012 nélieu et al 2009 this study demonstrated the induced effect of nitrate on the indirect photolysis of aca in addition light absorption by the aca in ospw if solution aca ospw if overlapped with the uv vis absorbance spectrum of aca in 0 3 mm nitrate solution aca 0 3 mm nitrate fig s2 strongly suggesting that nitrate was the dominant inorganic photosensitizer in ospw the fluence based pseudo first order decay rate constants k cm2 j of aca in 0 3 mm nitrate and ospw if is indicated by a linear plot of ln c c0 versus the uv dose of fluence fig s3 the rate equation was expressed as 1 d c df k c the k value of aca in 0 3 mm nitrate was 0 0734 cm2 j which was higher than that in ospw if 0 0332 cm2 j indicating that the presence of other water matrix in ospw if may inhibit nitrate induced photodegradation of aca influence of abundance anions existing in ospw cl hco3 and so4 2 on the nitrate induced photodegradation of aca was studied the results showed that cl and so4 2 played a negligible role on the photodegradation of aca in the presence of nitrate while hco3 inhibited the degradation of aca fig s4 similar inhibition effect of hco3 was obtained on the photodegradation of oxytetracycline in the presence of no3 in another study by li et al 2018 the inhibition effect of hco3 owes to its function as a oh scavenger via the following equations eq 2 in addition hydrolysis of hco3 produces co3 2 which is highly reactive with oh eq 3 liu et al 2017 2 hco 3 oh co 3 h 2 o k hco 3 oh 8 5 10 6 m 1 s 1 3 co 3 2 oh co 3 oh k co 3 2 oh 3 9 10 8 m 1 s 1 3 3 exploration of the reaction mechanism of the nitrate induced photodegradation of aca 3 3 1 effect of oh on the no3 induced photodegradation of aca no3 can absorb light and act as a photosensitizer to promote the photoreaction vione et al 2005 the photolysis of no3 leads to the formation of both oh and reactive nitrogen species rns no and no2 via the following photochemical processes eqs 4 7 nélieu et al 2009 the no2 could then recombine to form n2o4 which would degrade back into no3 and no2 eqs 8 and 9 and continue the photolysis process 4 no3 h2o hν no2 oh oh 5 no3 hν no2 o 3p 6 no2 h2o hν no oh oh 7 no2 oh no2 oh 8 2 no2 n2o4 9 n2o4 h2o 2h no2 no3 the produced oh and rns from the photolysis of no3 could oxidize aca and contribute to the indirect photolysis of aca to identify the dominant radicals responsible for the aca degradation in the presence of no3 two radical quenching agents tba and aa were added into the aca solution with 0 3 mm no3 to capture oh and rns the two scavengers have been reported to have different reactivity with oh and no3 specifically the rate constants of tba and aa with oh and no3 a form of rns are as following anbar and neta 1967 feng et al 2015 mezyk et al 2017 10 tba oh intermediates k 2 8 10 8 m 1 s 1 11 tba no 3 intermediates k 5 7 1 3 10 4 m 1 s 1 12 aa oh intermediates k 1 2 10 9 m 1 s 1 13 aa no 3 intermediates k 2 2 0 2 10 8 m 1 s 1 based on these characteristics tba was selected to scavenge oh whereas aa was used to scavenge both oh and rns as shown in fig 3 a the addition of 10 mm aa completely inhibited the photodegradation of aca and 10 mm tba diminishing aca removal to 12 8 after 60 min uv exposure the restrained effect of tba was enhanced with increasing concentration the result indicated that aca was predominantly oxidized by oh similar findings were also obtained by ji et al 2012 who suggested that oh was the dominated radical in the nitrate induced photodegradation of atenolol the completed inhibition of the photodegradation of aca in the presence of 10 mm aa indicated that rns was involved in the degradation of aca although at a much slower rate than oh which was expected due to the much lower redox potential of 1 03 v for no2 as compared to oh 1 8 2 7 v ji et al 2017 moreover as rns were involved in the regeneration of no2 and no3 for the continuous production of oh eqs 4 9 the scavenging of both rns and oh by aa completely quenched the reactive radicals in the system which completely inhibited the photodegradation of aca a positive correlation between nitrate concentration and the production of oh under the exposure of uv lamp was reported previously brezonik and fulkerson brekken 1998 therefore it was expected that increasing the no3 concentration would increasing the production of oh and enhance the degradation of aca however our results showed that with the increasing of no3 concentration from 0 3 mm to 3 mm insignificance increase of aca degradation was observed fig 3b it may be explained by the scavenging effect of no2 on oh with the increasing concentration of no3 excessively no2 was generated which consumed oh and resulted in negligible enhanced aca degradation eq 7 anbar and neta 1967 liu et al 2017 moreover the formation of n2o4 during the photolysis of no3 process contributed to the yield back of no3 and no2 eqs 8 and 9 the regenerated no3 would continue to initiate the production of oh under uv exposure li et al 2018 vione et al 2005 thus in our study no3 concentration was not a key factor on the rate of aca photodegradation the results also showed that no3 acted as an initiator for the indirect photolysis of aca after initiation process the propagation of radicals in the system would continue with the auto oxidation of aca or the regeneration of no3 the study by ji et al 2017 has also shown similar trend where the increase in nitrite no2 concentration did not increase the rate of degradation of phenol but the authors found that the number and concentration of generated nitroaromatic compounds increased with increasing nitrite concentration thus it is also important to investigate the by products formation from the nitrate induced photodegradation of aca natural occurrence concentration of nitrate in ospw was enough and of advantage for the nitrate induced photodegradation of the model compound it was reported that nitrate had a stronger absorption band near 200 nm and a weaker one around 300 nm with the extension towards longer wavelength up to 340 nm which accounted for the ability of nitrate to absorb the uva and uvb regions of sunlight vione et al 2005 niu et al 2013 moreover nitrate induced photodegradation of various organic compounds under the irradiation of sunlight or solar simulator have been studied ge et al 2019 jacobs et al 2008 ji et al 2012 nélieu et al 2009 which demonstrated the feasibility of sunlight nitrate induced photodegradation of nas in ospw however considering the relative low irradiation intensity of natural sunlight in the wavelength range that nitrate has the absorption fig s2 extending the exposure time should be considered in this work solar exposure of ospw and aca in the presence of ospw inorganic fraction was conducted to further study the effect of inorganic photosensitizers in ospw on the photodegradation of nas under solar irradiation produced by a solar simulator the results showed that after 12 h exposure 2 0 of o2 nas in ospw and 4 2 0 9 of aca in the presence of ospw inorganic fraction were degraded the low degradation was expected as the uv irradiance of the solar simulator was much lower 0 018 mw cm2 compared to that of the medium pressure mercury lamp 2 92 mw cm2 the results indicated that the nitrate induced photo oxidation may potentially be used as a low cost passive system for ospw remediation in terms of the degradation of organic contaminants however studies involving more organic compounds would be required moreover the photodegradation rate constant of the organic contaminants at various water depth may be different due to the sunlight attenuation and intensity variation zhou et al 2018 thus more studies with respect to field water bodies could be conducted in the future in addition the relative high absorbance of ospw of in fig s2 and degradation of nas in ospw of fig 1 demonstrated that some natural organic photosensitizers may be present in ospw and could be further investigated and utilized for the implementation of solar driven photolysis of organic contaminants in ospw 3 3 2 identification of degradation by products and pathways samples of aca buffer in the presence of no3 100 mg l aca and 0 8 mm no3 before and after uv irradiation were analyzed by uplc tof ms to identify the by products of the no3 induced photodegradation of aca a longer irradiation time of 120 min and higher concentration of aca 100 mg l and no3 0 8 mm were used to ensure enough concentration of the by products were produced for the identification of the by products meanwhile difference in the by products produced between a short and long irradiation time may be observed with a longer irradiation time three new peaks in the total chromatogram tic were observed at 4 26 4 54 and 4 84 min after the uv irradiation fig s5 indicating that at least three by products were formed based on the elemental formula generated from the measured mass 5 ppm of the new peaks by products with 6 different molecular formulas were produced table s4 one isomer of a by product was presented for illustration proposes table s4 and fig s5 the corresponding theoretical and observed isotope ratio of the proposed by products are listed in fig s6 fig s11 the possible degradation pathways with 120 min exposure were proposed in fig 4 in pathway i the oh attacked a secondary carbon forming a carbon radical which would then react with dissolved oxygen to form carbonylated aca p1 fig 4 and hydroxylated aca p2 1 fig 4 in pathway ii the oh would attack a tertiary carbon forming a carbon radical which react with another oh to form hydroxylated aca p2 2 fig 4 where the hydroxyl was substituted at a tertiary carbon instead of a secondary carbon in p2 1 then oh continued to attack p2 2 at another tertiary carbon to form the hydroxylated aca radical which then combined with no2 to form one hydroxyl and one nitro substituent by product p4 1 fig 4 moreover the reaction between the oh and secondary carbon would continue to form by products with one carbonyl one hydroxyl and one nitro substituents p5 1 as well as two hydroxyl and one nitro substituents p6 1 fig 4 meanwhile for pathway iii the reaction between the oh and secondary or tertiary carbon would continue to form by products with two hydroxyl substituents p3 fig 4 then in the presence of no a two hydroxyl and one nitroso substituents by products p4 2 fig 4 and finally three hydroxyl and one nitroso substituents p5 2 fig 4 as well as two hydroxyl one carbonyl and one nitroso substituents p6 fig 4 were formed as oh is more reactivity towards tertiary carbon due to the formation of more stable intermediate radicals after hydrogen atom abstractions afzal et al 2012b anbar et al 1966 the by products proposed in pathway ii and iii had the substituents at the tertiary carbon the degradation pathways agreed with our earlier finding section 3 3 1 that oh was the key oxidizing species and the change of nitrate concentration had little impact on the degradation rate of aca as the initial step for all the proposed pathways would be the formation aca radical through an electron transfer by oh the plausible reason that the substitution of only one nitro no2 or nitroso no occurred in step 2 in pathway ii and step 3 in pathway iii was that the reactivity of rns was lower than oh where the reactivity to aca be proposed to be oh no2 no as no three hydroxyls only substituent was detected suggesting that pathway ii and iii were stepwise reaction instead of a simultaneous reaction where the substitution of a third hydroxyl group is not favorable p5 and p6 were only detected in the samples that were exposed under uv irradiance for 90 and 120 min while not observed in the samples exposed for 30 and 60 min the result strongly suggested that p5 and p6 were formed after the h abstraction happened at secondary carbon where the reactivity is lower than that at tertiary carbon the formation of nitroso and nitro substituted by products also suggested the possibility of the formation of potentially toxic and carcinogenic by products such as nitroaromatic in the presence of aromatic and nitrosamine if an amine is present in the structure thus further study on the formation of nitrosamine from nitrate induce photo oxidation should be conducted and the toxicity and carcinogenicity of the treated water should be tested 4 conclusions after 60 min of direct exposure under uv irradiation of 2 92 mw cm2 higher degradation of nas in ospw 24 3 as compared to that in ospw of 12 4 showed that some inorganic species in ospw enhanced the photodegradation of nas nas with higher carbon number and dbe were preferentially degraded during the ospw direct photo oxidation process it was also confirmed that some inorganic species in ospw could induce the photodegradation of a model compound aca which was not degradable by the direct photolysis process it was found that no3 was the most likely inorganic ion responsible for the induced photodegradation process as no photodegradation of aca was observed in the presence of other major ions in ospw abundant ions in ospw such as cl and so4 2 showed negligible effect on the nitrate induced photodegradation of aca while hco3 inhibited the photodegradation of aca both oh and rns were generated during the nitrate induced aca photodegradation process where oh was demonstrated to be the dominant reactive species that contributed to the degradation of aca ten by products including a pair of isomers were proposed to be formed during the nitrate induced aca photodegradation process this study showed that the nitrate could be utilized as a natural photosensitizer to induce photo oxidation of organic contaminants in ospw and could potentially be utilized in a low cost passive solar system for the remediation of ospw with extended exposure time as nitrate is known to be ubiquitous in natural aquatic environment nitrate induced photodegradation could also be used in other wastewater treatment systems such as waste stabilization pond and wetland remediation where the wastewaters are exposed for natural degradation in conclusion the results of this research suggest that the photodegradation efficiency of ospw treatment strategies can be enhanced in presence of the inorganic photosensitizer in ospw acknowledgements this work was supported by

18539,ultrasonic humidifier use is a potential source of human exposure to inhalable particulates this research evaluated the behavior of insoluble iron oxide and aluminum oxide particles in water used to fill room sized ultrasonic humidifiers solutions of 10 mg l fe as iron oxide particles or 5 mg l al as aluminum oxide suspension were added into tap water used to fill ultrasonic humidifiers the humidifiers were operated for 14 h samples were obtained over time and monitored for soluble and particulate fe and al as well as particle sizes in the humidifier reservoir and emitted in aerosols denser settleable particles of approximately 1 5 μm diameter of iron or aluminum oxides accumulated at the bottom of the humidifier reservoir smaller suspended metal oxide particles of 0 22 0 57 μm diameter were emitted as aerosols from the humidifier soluble anions and cations in tap water were also present in the aerosols emitted from humidifiers the results indicate that a typical 1 6 mhz ultrasonic humidifier can emit 0 22 0 57 μm particles and dissolved minerals from fill water into breathable air graphical abstract image 1 keywords iron oxide aluminum oxide ultrasonic humidifiers nanoparticles inhalation 1 introduction 1 1 consumer use of ultrasonic humidifiers an increasing area of concern is consumer exposure to contaminants at the air water interface one acknowledged area is consumer exposure to volatile organic chemicals vocs during showering such as inhaling trihalomethanes gordon et al 2006 wang et al 2007 or exposure to industrial chemicals and microbial metabolites chen et al 2019 gallagher et al 2015 phetxumphou et al 2016 another but under studied area within the air water interface is exposure to non volatile contaminants for example minerals emitted by humidifiers highsmith et al 1988 humidifiers are widely used to increase the humidity of indoor air and to prevent dry skin nose and throat since humidifier aerosols and particles are inhaled they represent an exposure route for consumers to potentially unwanted contaminants ultrasonic humidifiers are a common type of cool mist humidifier that use an ultrasonic nebulizer to create aerosols and they constitute 34 5 of the global humidifier market other types include impeller based cool mist humidifiers and warm mist humidifiers that heat water to boiling to form steam technavio 2017 survey data indicated that 15 of american households used humidifiers in 2009 with portable humidifiers representing 96 of the market and whole house humidifiers comprising the rest davis et al 2016 the united states environmental protection agency usepa reported approximately 20 of portable humidifiers in use were ultrasonic models united states environmental protection agency 2012 in south korea the highest usage rate of humidifier was 45 of surveyed population during winter and spring chang et al 2012 usepa recommends the use of distilled water to fill humidifiers and to clean portable units every third day of use to lower risks of inhalation exposure to microorganisms and minerals usepa 1991 although limited research is available on the type of water used by consumers to fill humidifiers indications are that consumers use tap water rather than purchase distilled water highsmith et al 1988 a previous study demonstrated that 85 90 of dissolved inorganic constituents e g calcium magnesium copper in tap waters used to fill ultrasonic humidifiers were expelled in the aerosols sain and dietrich 2015 sain et al 2018 the water in ultrasonic produced aerosols evaporates quickly producing dry inhalable mineral particles from tap water rodes et al 1990 reported studies agreed that the mass concentration of minerals emitted in aerosols from ultrasonic humidifiers was linearly related with total dissolved minerals in fill water highsmith et al 1988 sain and dietrich 2015 particles including asbestos fibers present in fill water were proportionally aerosolized by ultrasonic humidifiers hardy et al 1992 exposure to minerals and particles from ultrasonic humidifiers resulted in deposition of minerals in the lungs of mice umezawa et al 2013 respiratory distress occurred in human children who breathed white dust that formed from aerosolized aqueous minerals daftary and deterding 2011 inhalation of disinfectants added to fill humidifier water to prevent the growth of bacteria mold and algae in humidifiers is acknowledged to cause adverse health effects if aerosolized inhalation of fine particles of humidifier disinfectants was strongly associated with lung injury severe respiratory illness and even death in children and young adults in an epidemiological investigation kim et al 2014 lee et al 2012 ultrasonication is applied to the emission of narrow distributions of nanoparticles from solution when aqueous suspensions of non uniformly distributed aluminum oxide particles were subjected to ultrasonication only particles 1μm were emitted and collected by recondensation larger agglomerated aluminum oxide particles were not emitted kim et al 2017 likewise monodisperse narrow size distributions of polycaprolactone nanoparticles were generated from acetone solutions using 1 6 mhz ultrasonic transducers forde et al 2006 these studies suggest the possibility that particles present in tap water used to fill humidifiers will be emitted into humidified breathing air 1 2 iron and aluminum in tap water most studies to date have focused on dissolved constituents in the water used to fill humidifiers tap waters used in consumers homes are acknowledged to contain particles especially metal oxides a survey found that 84 of usa utilities received consumer complaints of iron rust and 4 received complaints of aluminum particles in their tap water booth and brazos 2004 likewise 37 of consumer complaints in the uk are due to discolored water events frequently due to metal oxide particles vreeburg and boxall 2007 discoloration and

millipore durable membrane filter cat no gvwp04700 pore size 0 1 μm to separate larger micro metal particles whatman membrane filters cat no 6809 6012 pore size 0 22 μm were used 2 2 instrumentation for characterizations of water quality dissolved metals and metal oxide particles thermo scientific x series x 0458 inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms was applied to detect metal and non metals in aqueous solutions in accordance with standard method 3125 b american public health association 2017 the minimum reporting level of iron and aluminum are 0 01 and 0 001 mg l respectively malvern zetasizer nanozs dynamic light scattering dls was applied to determine mean particle diameter and size distributions of iron oxide and aluminum oxide particles in suspension in tap water a hach hq40d portable multi parameter meter was used to measure ph dissolved oxygen and temperature 2 3 humidifier operation and sample collection the humidifier used in this research is ranked a top five portable humidifier and rated a best buy by consumer reports 2015 the filterless humidifier has a reservoir capacity of 3 l the variable output control had a frequency of 1 67 mhz which is consistent with 1 6 mhz ultrasonic transducers typically used in ultrasonic humidifiers to produce water aerosols rodes et al 1990 all experiments were performed at room temperature at maximum output setting to represent a maximum aerosol output per time the humidifier upper reservoir was filled with 3 l of the appropriate water and allowed to operate for 14 h reservoir samples were taken by inserting a pipet 5 cm below the water surface in the lower reservoir consistent with previous research sain and dietrich 2015 kim et al 2017 the emitted aerosols were captured and condensed at room temperature in glass a sample was collected from the condensate column before entering the glass collection bottle by disconnecting the tubing and capturing condensate droplets in a glass beaker fig 1 two glass collection bottles were used as a precaution to collect and condense all water vapors to prevent emission into room air as the experiments used nanoparticles virginia tech health and safety did not allow the aerosols to be emitted into a hood or room for collection of airborne aerosols and particles the humidifier was filled with blacksburg va tap water augmented with micro iron oxide particles nano iron oxide particles or aluminum oxide particles blacksburg uses conventional treatment with about 1 mg l polyaluminum chloride not alum coagulant typical tap water quality data are in table s2 in supplemental material tap water contains 0 01 mg l fe and 0 04 0 01 mg l al separate experiments in triplicates were performed for each micro and nano iron oxide at 10 mg l fe and aluminum oxide at 5 mg l al these concentrations represent metal oxide concentrations during tap water rust or discoloration events samples of 35 ml water were taken using a micro pipet at approximately 2 h intervals from the lower reservoir r and condensate c the reservoir was initially sampled at t 0 h subsequent sampling times for both the reservoir and the condensate were at 1 2 4 6 8 10 12 and 14 h water samples were immediately measured for ph dissolved oxygen and temperature with a hach multiprobe for each unfiltered reservoir and condensate sample both 0 22 μm filtered and unfiltered samples for dissolved and total particulate dissolved iron were digested by adding 5 v v nitric acid and 4 v v hydroxylamine chloride and heated overnight at 55 c before determining total metal by icp ms for each reservoir and condensate sample dissolved iron and total iron were measured particulate iron was calculated as the difference between total and dissolved iron since there were visible black particles at the bottom of reservoir a separate experiment was performed to estimate the percentage of iron oxide particles that settled three liters of tap water and 10 mg l fe of micro iron nano iron oxide or aluminum oxide particles were added into glass vessels and allowed to settle for 14 h in a water bath of 40 c which is the water temperature in the reservoir at steady state see section 3 1 which describes steady state conditions a syringe was used to draw most of the water out thus leaving iron oxide particles that settled at the lower reservoir with some remaining water the particles were acid digested as the method mentioned above aluminum oxide 5 mg l as al particles were added to tap water the white particles were visibly apparent in condensate samples during the experiments the reservoir and condensate water samples were periodically taken as described above samples were centrifuged at 4000 rpm for an hour supernatant solutions were acidified with 10 v v nitric acid and 4 v v hydroxylamine chloride then heated overnight at 55 c before icp ms to measure dissolved aluminum total aluminum was measured in uncentrifuged water samples that were acid digested and heated using the same procedure the differences between total aluminum and dissolved aluminum were particulate aluminum 2 4 characterizations of metal oxide particles dynamic light scattering dls was applied to characterize the size of metal oxide particles in the reservoir and condensate water at steady state and after 4 h of humidifier operation 1 ml water samples were obtained of reservoir and condensate water for micro iron oxide nano iron oxide and aluminum oxide the particle size was immediately characterized by dls in addition the size of aluminum oxide particles was measured hourly for 14 h to determine the effect of ultrasonic energy on aluminum oxide particles the water temperature was measured in the reservoir the temperature of reservoir and condensate water samples in the dls instrument was set to the same value as the reservoir water water samples were obtained and immediately characterized for mean particle diameter a control experiment to determine the effect of only water temperature at 40 c without ultrasonic energy on aluminum oxide particle size was also performed this water was gently stirred at 60 rpm 2 5 data analysis all data analysis and graphs were completed in r r development core team 2017 water quality data mean particle diameters as well as particulate and dissolved iron and aluminum were analyzed by linear regression over operation time a 2 way anova test for overall significance followed by a multiple comparison with tukey s honestly significant difference hsd compared the difference of the mean particle diameters of iron and aluminum oxide particles in the reservoir and in the condensate t tests were applied to compare particulate iron or aluminum concentrations in the reservoir and condensate in addition the ratios of condensate reservoir c r in terms of other dissolved cations in tap water were compared the alpha value was set as 0 05 to determine statistical significance 3 results 3 1 water quality data during operation of the ultrasonic humidifier the reservoir water temperature increased from room temperature to 40 c slope 0 p 0 004 and as expected the do decreased slope 0 p 0 0006 and ph increased slightly slope 0 p 0 014 this same trend and similar magnitudes were present for all experiments with metal oxides and are represented by the data for nano iron oxide in fig 2 the reservoir temperature rose from 20 c to 40 c and ph increased from 7 to 8 while do decreased from 9 to 6 mg l o2 the emitted aerosols collected in the condensate water were at a cooler temperature and contained more dissolved oxygen as expected from re equilibrated with the room atmosphere similar to previous research sain and dietrich 2015 sain et al 2018 the conditions in the ultrasonic humidifier reservoir reached steady state where the temperature stabilized at 35 c at about 2 h additionally consistent with sain and dietrich 2015 85 95 of the cations typically present in the tap water used to fill the reservoir e g na ca mg k were emitted and measured in the condensate even when metal oxide particles were added the water quality data demonstrated consistent trends for the three metal oxide particles fig s1 in supplemental material 3 2 aggregation and size characterization of metal oxides in aqueous solutions as shown in table 1 the particle size range of 0 22 0 57 μm for emitted fe and al oxide particles collected in the condensate was statistically the same and a much narrower size distribution than particles in the reservoir 0 440 1 795 μm this result is consistent with kim et al 2017 and forde et al 2006 as ultrasonication of non uniformly distributed particles in solution results in emitting smaller particles in a narrower range in tap water the 0 3 μm micro iron oxides were present as aggregates with a mean diameter of 1 647 μm which is consistent with other findings of aggregation of iron nanoparticles in aqueous solutions chekli et al 2013 zhang et al 2008 this was confirmed visually as black iron particle clusters increased time in the humidifier reservoir did not significantly alter the mean particle diameter compared to tap water within the no significant difference group a table 1 as visually noted by color only a small fraction of the micro iron oxide particles was emitted from the humidifier the mean diameter of emitted particles was 0 224 μm which was statistically smaller than particles in the reservoir in two significantly different groups a b table 1 before contacting water the dry nano iron oxide particles were 0 05 0 1 μm in contact with tap water the iron oxide particles aggregated to a size of 1 512 μm mean diameter table 1 according to chekli et al 2013 iron oxide nanoparticles would form 1 μm aggregates under soil simulated solutions similar to the micro iron oxides nano iron oxide particles in the condensate were smaller at 0 571 μm mean diameter and fewer than in the reservoir as visually indicated by color a 2 way anova with multiple comparisons revealed that the mean diameters of micro iron oxide and nano iron oxide particles in tap water and in the reservoir were not significantly different but their mean diameters in the condensate were smaller and significantly different from the reservoir statistically iron oxide particles aggregated to approximately 1 6 μm in tap water and in the humidifier reservoir and 0 22 0 57 μm particles were emitted from the humidifier the initial 0 03 0 06 μm aluminum oxide particles also aggregated in contact with tap water to 1 315 μm mean diameter during ultrasonication their size reduced to 0 440 μm mean size this occurred within 15 min of humidifier operation the particles that were aerosolized and then condensed were 0 252 μm mean diameter fig 3 a the 2 way anova test revealed that the diameter of aluminum oxide particles in the condensate was not significantly different from the reservoir within the no significant difference group b table 1 which indicated that the equal sized particles were transported from the reservoir to aerosols it is notable that the aluminum oxide particles both as the initial suspension and as aggregates have a milky white appearance associated with hydrated aluminum oxide the effect of ultrasonication on the size of aluminum oxide particles in the ultrasonic humidifier over time was evaluated fig 3a demonstrates that 1 μm aggregated aluminum oxide particles in tap water were quickly shattered into smaller particles of 0 381 μm mean diameter and consistently maintained that smaller diameter in the reservoir throughout ultrasonication with a frequency of 1 67 mhz in the control experiment with aluminum oxide particles in 40 c tap water without ultrasonication the aluminum oxide particles maintained 1 μm mean diameters which indicated that ultrasonic energy reduced the size of particles in the reservoir polydispersity index pdi is a dimensionless value in the range of 0 1 for which small values represent uniform particle sizes and high values indicate variable particle sizes the dls measurements revealed the uniformity of the size distribution of the aluminum oxide particles fig 3c shows the mean particle diameter and pdi of aluminum oxide during hours 2 12 a pdi of 0 2 0 4 usually indicates a moderate uniform size distribution curve malvern instruments 2007 over operation time the pdi in the reservoir became smaller indicating increased uniformity for aluminum oxide particles being sampled in the condensate the pdi remained relatively stable and smaller than the pdi in reservoir indicating that the particles emitted after steady state were uniform in size linear regression analysis was performed on hours 2 12 data of the mean diameters in the condensate fig 3b since the conditions in the humidifier reservoir reached steady state after 2 h statistically the mean particle diameter in the reservoir was relatively constant at 0 381 μm and did not change after 2 h slope 6 10 6 μm h p 0 95 while the mean particle diameter in the condensate slightly increased from 0 236 to 0 310 μm over operation time slope 0 001 μm h p 0 005 with mean particle diameter over 2 12 h being 0 25 μm the size range of emitted particles is consistent with previous finding of 0 11 0 32 μm highsmith et al 1992 the fitted linear equation is shown in fig 3b the concentration of particulate aluminum also increased over time in the condensate slope 0 05 mg l hr p 0 04 possible reasons for an increase in aluminum oxide particle concentration in the condensate are evaporation of water in the reservoir or larger particles being emitted after 2 h with constant particle number concentration which resulted in more particle mass emitted it is notable that at t 14 h the particulate aluminum concentration jumped up to 5 mg l because there was no water entering the lower reservoir from upper reservoir after 12 h of operation which may have caused the large increase in mean particle diameter in the condensate at the end of operation 3 3 metal oxide particles and dissolved metal concentration in humidifier reservoir and condensate fig 4 shows dissolved and particulate concentrations of micro iron oxide nano iron oxide and aluminum oxide in the reservoir and condensate as a function of humidifier operation time the particulate iron concentrations in the reservoir samples demonstrated high variability the iron oxide particles settled soon after being added to the humidifier reservoir as indicated visually by a layer of black particles on the reservoir bottom mixing in the reservoir did not appear uniform resulting in different amounts of particles being sampled dissolved iron concentrations in the reservoir and condensate fluctuated with a range of 0 01 0 18 mg l for micro iron and 0 01 0 053 mg l for nano iron the dissolved iron in the condensate had a range of 0 01 0 026 mg l for micro iron and 0 01 0 022 mg l for nano iron the ranges of particulate iron concentrations in condensate were 0 01 0 07 mg l for micro iron oxide and 0 01 0 055 mg l for nano iron oxide as shown in fig 4 the 10 mg l micro or nano iron oxide particles added to tap water remained primarily as particles with little dissolution many denser iron oxide particles 5 g ml gravitationally settled in the reservoir approximately 87 for micro iron oxide and 92 for nano iron oxide by difference this resulted in the suspended iron oxides being 13 and 8 of 10 mg l fe which were approximately the mean concentrations of iron particles in measured reservoir samples in condensate water dissolved iron concentrations were typically half the concentrations of suspended particulate iron the aluminum oxide particles demonstrated a different pattern than iron oxides iinitially added at 5 mg l al approximately 1 mg l of aluminum particles were present in the reservoir half of those were expelled into the condensate and the rest gravity settled an increase in particle concentrations was observed for both the reservoir and condensate during the humidifier operation the slight ascending trend in suspended particulate aluminum in both reservoir and condensate may be due to resuspension of settled particulate aluminum that loosely accumulated at the bottom of the reservoir the resuspension of particulate aluminum might also cause the increase in dissolved aluminum as particles partially solubilized the dissolved aluminum concentrations in condensate had a high variability initially and after steady state they stabilized at 0 2 mg l based on average values over 14 h for data presented in fig 4 a b c and the initial added metal oxide concentration fig 4d demonstrates the fate of the metal oxide particles in the humidifier over 14 h of operation less than 10 of the denser than water iron oxide particles remained suspended in solution during humidifier operation and less than 1 dissolved in the water the pattern was different for the less dense and floc like aluminum oxide particles about 40 remained suspended in solution during humidifier operation and about 10 dissolved in the water thus more aluminum was available in the reservoir water to be aerosolized and emitted from the humidifier 3 4 statistical analysis of metal concentrations in reservoir and condensate over time unpaired t tests indicated significant difference between the particulate iron concentrations in the reservoir and in the condensate for micro iron oxide and nano iron oxide p 0 001 to determine the influence of operation time on metal concentrations table 2 presents outputs of linear regression models including intercepts and slopes for the particulate and dissolved metal concentrations presented in fig 4 the fitting of linear regression was poor in all conditions r2 0 4 the slopes of particulate and dissolved iron in the reservoir and in the condensate for both micro and nano iron oxides were very small values and not significantly different from zero this indicated that their concentrations over time were constant therefore it can be concluded that the operation time makes little difference on the emissions of particulate and dissolved iron once steady state was achieved all intercept values were significantly different from zero especially particulate iron and aluminum concentrations in both reservoir and condensate it is noticeable that in the condensate the particulate iron concentration of 0 03 mg l confirmed by both mean values and intercepts was emitted from the humidifier regardless of the particulate iron concentrations present in the reservoir small and insignificant slope values of the models suggested that neither particulate nor dissolved iron concentrations changed over time in either reservoir or condensate aluminum oxide particles in the reservoir and condensate behaved different from iron the aluminum oxide behavior is possibly due to resuspension of particles in the lower reservoir and in the condensate may be due to the resuspended particles being emitted from the humidifier and condensed the significant slopes indicated that the concentrations of aluminum oxide particles increased over operation time particulate and dissolved aluminum were emitted from the humidifier at a factor of ten higher than particulate and dissolved iron respectively t test showed that the particulate aluminum concentrations in the condensate were lower than in the reservoir p 0 003 linear regression models with indicator variables determined the values and significance of the changes to intercepts and slopes of metal concentrations over time table 2 the indicator variable designated location as either the reservoir or condensate in this research the δ values indicate the difference between condensate and reservoir significant δintercepts or δslopes revealed a statistical difference between two intercepts or two slopes no change occurred over time for particulate or dissolved micro and nano iron concentrations there was no statistical difference in the rates for the two locations reservoir or condensate for particulate and dissolved aluminum concentrations increased with time but the slope was statistically lower in the condensate as expected all intercepts were statistically different from zero for both micro and nano iron the δintercepts were statistically different for particulate but not dissolved negative signs of these δintercepts indicate the concentrations of particulate metal was consistently lower in the condensate compared to the reservoir aluminum showed no statistically significant change in the intercepts between two locations significant δintercepts of metal oxide particles indicated that location shift had a significant impact on the iron oxide particle concentrations the data analysis demonstrated that particulate fe and al present in the reservoir would be aerosolized statistically mean values of 0 03 mg l fe oxide particles and 0 8 mg l al oxide particles were emitted from the humidifiers during the 14 h operation time the percent emission ratios c concentration r concentration x 100 of micro iron nano iron and aluminum oxide particles are 3 1 6 7 and 42 respectively size density and form of particles such as solid or floc like fig s2 in supplemental material may cause the obvious difference of the emission ratios between iron and aluminum particles 4 discussion this research investigated the fate and transport of iron oxide and aluminum oxide particles present in ultrasonic humidifier reservoirs and characterized the emitted particles insoluble metal oxide particles that are denser than water and large enough to gravitationally settle will collect at the bottom of the reservoir the iron oxide particles are about 5 times the density of water once settled they are poorly resuspended during humidifier operation low concentrations of iron oxide particles that were of a size too small to gravitationally settle remained suspended in the reservoir water and were emitted in the aerosols sources of iron particles in humidifiers include metal oxides present in the fill water and also in the case of ground water containing soluble ferrous iron ferric oxide particles that form by oxidation during ultrasonication sain and dietrich 2015 the aluminum oxide particles in suspended solutions are about the density of water and some gravitationally settled the 1 67 mhz ultrasonic energy reduced the size of suspended aluminum oxide particles from 1 315 0 056 μm to 0 440 0 027 μm in the humidifier reservoir the suspended floc like aluminum oxide particles of 0 253 0 003 μm were emitted in the aerosols the data demonstrated that some of the settled particles were likely resuspended and emitted during the 14 h humidifier operation particles that are suspended in water and not able to settle can be emitted from an ultrasonic humidifier the metal oxide particle sizes emitted range from 0 22 μm to 0 57 μm table 1 which is much smaller than the respirable fraction of 4 μm acgih 2005 at the end of 14 h operation period the aluminum oxide particle concentrations climaxed in the reservoir which may cause the sudden increase in mean diameter in the condensate therefore it is recommended to use an ultrasonic humidifier only when water is present in the upper reservoir that can fill the lower reservoir the water quality of fill water used in ultrasonic humidifiers has a great impact on the aerosols emitted a concentration of 10 mg l fe as iron oxide particles were added to tap water used to fill ultrasonic humidifiers most of these denser than water particles settled to the bottom of reservoir the suspended iron oxides constituted approximately 0 03 mg l fe and the 0 22 0 57 μm sized iron oxide particles were emitted in the humidifier aerosol when a 5 mg l al as aluminum oxide suspension in tap water was used to fill the humidifier reservoir approximately 1 mg l al particles remained suspended about half of the suspended particles and those with 0 25 μm were emitted in the aerosol the concentrations of aluminum oxide particles in the humidifier reservoir and the emitted aerosols showed a slight increasing trend during the whole operation period while the concentrations of iron oxides particles maintained constant statistically the components of fill water used in ultrasonic humidifiers have an important influence on the emitted aerosols especially dissolved ions and suspended particles as the aerosols formed are of dimensions that can be inhaled into the human lung the fate of the emitted particles in breathing air can be assessed by comparing the time for them to settle against the time for them to be removed from the indoor environment by ventilation table 3 shows settling velocities of the aluminum oxide and iron oxide particles and the corresponding settling times from a height of 0 9 m location of the humidifier outlet when sleeping the minimum settling time is 5 h for iron oxide particles with a diameter of 0 57 μm and a density of 5 g cm3 density this exceeds the typical indoor air residence time of 1 2 h in the us yamamoto et al 2010 this analysis suggests that the particles emitted from ultrasonic humidifiers will remain suspended in air until removal by ventilation and very few will settle to the floor thus the metal oxide particles pose an inhalation risk to humans due to their extremely slow settling velocities a common global phenomenon is metal oxide contaminants from release of iron rust into tap water and red water benson et al 2012 lytle et al 2010 miller et al 1984 corrosion of other metals in the distribution system and plumbing also contributes metal particles to tap water other sources of particles i e microplastics are hard to remove by water treatment plants and would remain suspended in tap water cole et al 2011 it is acknowledged that nanosized magnetite present in dwds can adsorb toxic metal such as pb as cr bliem et al 2015 kumari et al 2015 based on this research 0 22 0 57 μm suspended particles will transport from ultrasonic humidifier reservoir water to aerosols and the particles of this size range have a relatively high deposition rate onto nasal and alveolar region causing adverse health effects dominici et al 2006 oberdörster et al 2005 with the wide use of ultrasonic humidifiers it is a great concern that consumers are exposed to aerosolized and inhalable impurities from drinking water 5 conclusions a commercially available portable 1 67 mhz ultrasonic humidifier was filled with tap water containing added iron or aluminum oxide particles representing drinking water contamination from iron rust or alum floc the metal oxide particles present in the humidifier reservoir had a high polydispersity and ranged from 0 440 to 1 795 μm in diameter the particles emitted from the ultrasonic humidifier had a low polydispersity and fell predominantly in the sub micron range of 0 22 0 57 μm a size which has a relatively high deposition rate into the nasal and alveolar region concentrations of 0 03 mg l fe or 0 8 mg l al oxide particles were emitted when the fill water contains metal oxides of 10 mg l fe or 5 mg l al iron particles had a density of about 5 g cm3 and tended to gravity settle in the humidifier while al particles were a floc like suspension of lower density and settling particles this study provides an insight to the influences of water quality on indoor air quality through the emission of minerals from ultrasonic humidifiers andrea m dietrich 0000 0003 2679

18539,ultrasonic humidifier use is a potential source of human exposure to inhalable particulates this research evaluated the behavior of insoluble iron oxide and aluminum oxide particles in water used to fill room sized ultrasonic humidifiers solutions of 10 mg l fe as iron oxide particles or 5 mg l al as aluminum oxide suspension were added into tap water used to fill ultrasonic humidifiers the humidifiers were operated for 14 h samples were obtained over time and monitored for soluble and particulate fe and al as well as particle sizes in the humidifier reservoir and emitted in aerosols denser settleable particles of approximately 1 5 μm diameter of iron or aluminum oxides accumulated at the bottom of the humidifier reservoir smaller suspended metal oxide particles of 0 22 0 57 μm diameter were emitted as aerosols from the humidifier soluble anions and cations in tap water were also present in the aerosols emitted from humidifiers the results indicate that a typical 1 6 mhz ultrasonic humidifier can emit 0 22 0 57 μm particles and dissolved minerals from fill water into breathable air graphical abstract image 1 keywords iron oxide aluminum oxide ultrasonic humidifiers nanoparticles inhalation 1 introduction 1 1 consumer use of ultrasonic humidifiers an increasing area of concern is consumer exposure to contaminants at the air water interface one acknowledged area is consumer exposure to volatile organic chemicals vocs during showering such as inhaling trihalomethanes gordon et al 2006 wang et al 2007 or exposure to industrial chemicals and microbial metabolites chen et al 2019 gallagher et al 2015 phetxumphou et al 2016 another but under studied area within the air water interface is exposure to non volatile contaminants for example minerals emitted by humidifiers highsmith et al 1988 humidifiers are widely used to increase the humidity of indoor air and to prevent dry skin nose and throat since humidifier aerosols and particles are inhaled they represent an exposure route for consumers to potentially unwanted contaminants ultrasonic humidifiers are a common type of cool mist humidifier that use an ultrasonic nebulizer to create aerosols and they constitute 34 5 of the global humidifier market other types include impeller based cool mist humidifiers and warm mist humidifiers that heat water to boiling to form steam technavio 2017 survey data indicated that 15 of american households used humidifiers in 2009 with portable humidifiers representing 96 of the market and whole house humidifiers comprising the rest davis et al 2016 the united states environmental protection agency usepa reported approximately 20 of portable humidifiers in use were ultrasonic models united states environmental protection agency 2012 in south korea the highest usage rate of humidifier was 45 of surveyed population during winter and spring chang et al 2012 usepa recommends the use of distilled water to fill humidifiers and to clean portable units every third day of use to lower risks of inhalation exposure to microorganisms and minerals usepa 1991 although limited research is available on the type of water used by consumers to fill humidifiers indications are that consumers use tap water rather than purchase distilled water highsmith et al 1988 a previous study demonstrated that 85 90 of dissolved inorganic constituents e g calcium magnesium copper in tap waters used to fill ultrasonic humidifiers were expelled in the aerosols sain and dietrich 2015 sain et al 2018 the water in ultrasonic produced aerosols evaporates quickly producing dry inhalable mineral particles from tap water rodes et al 1990 reported studies agreed that the mass concentration of minerals emitted in aerosols from ultrasonic humidifiers was linearly related with total dissolved minerals in fill water highsmith et al 1988 sain and dietrich 2015 particles including asbestos fibers present in fill water were proportionally aerosolized by ultrasonic humidifiers hardy et al 1992 exposure to minerals and particles from ultrasonic humidifiers resulted in deposition of minerals in the lungs of mice umezawa et al 2013 respiratory distress occurred in human children who breathed white dust that formed from aerosolized aqueous minerals daftary and deterding 2011 inhalation of disinfectants added to fill humidifier water to prevent the growth of bacteria mold and algae in humidifiers is acknowledged to cause adverse health effects if aerosolized inhalation of fine particles of humidifier disinfectants was strongly associated with lung injury severe respiratory illness and even death in children and young adults in an epidemiological investigation kim et al 2014 lee et al 2012 ultrasonication is applied to the emission of narrow distributions of nanoparticles from solution when aqueous suspensions of non uniformly distributed aluminum oxide particles were subjected to ultrasonication only particles 1μm were emitted and collected by recondensation larger agglomerated aluminum oxide particles were not emitted kim et al 2017 likewise monodisperse narrow size distributions of polycaprolactone nanoparticles were generated from acetone solutions using 1 6 mhz ultrasonic transducers forde et al 2006 these studies suggest the possibility that particles present in tap water used to fill humidifiers will be emitted into humidified breathing air 1 2 iron and aluminum in tap water most studies to date have focused on dissolved constituents in the water used to fill humidifiers tap waters used in consumers homes are acknowledged to contain particles especially metal oxides a survey found that 84 of usa utilities received consumer complaints of iron rust and 4 received complaints of aluminum particles in their tap water booth and brazos 2004 likewise 37 of consumer complaints in the uk are due to discolored water events frequently due to metal oxide particles vreeburg and boxall 2007 discoloration and particle events are difficult to predict or study in tap water because they occur over short periods of time in localized areas in many countries iron and aluminum do not have health based regulatory standards although many regulatory agencies provide non enforceable aesthetic guidance for iron and aluminum in tap water dietrich and burlingame 2015 dietrich et al 2019 while iron and aluminum may be monitored at the point of entry to the distribution system on an annual basis european commission 1998 and in the distribution system when high concentrations of iron are indicated data gaps frequently exist for their concentrations at the tap on a day to day basis iron oxides in drinking water distribution systems dwds and tap water cause a series of problems such as metallic taste water discoloration and pipe blockages dietrich and burlingame 2015 sources of iron oxides include source water ferric coagulants and predominantly release from iron distribution pipes after treatment reduced soluble ferrous iron often present in groundwater forms visible iron oxide particles when used in an ultrasonic humidifier sain and dietrich 2015 globally regulatory agencies establish secondary maximum contaminant levels smcls and aesthetic guidelines of 0 2 0 3 mg l fe dietrich and devesa 2019 usepa 2017 which is exceeded when red water events or rust occur macnevin et al 2017 iron oxides exist sometimes exclusively as nanoparticles wigginton et al 2007 and they are found to occur as 10 20 nm nanoparticles in riverine sediments poulton and raiswell 2005 naturally occurring

have been associated with iron oxide dwds materials lytle et al 2004 2010 cadmium chromium manganese nickel uranium and vanadium are also associated with dwds iron oxides peng and korshin 2011 aluminum with an usa smcl of 0 05 0 2 mg l to prevent turbidity naturally occurs in source water and also enters tap water from alum coagulants used in treatment dietrich and burlingame 2015 depending

al 1995 the objectives of this research are 1 to determine the fate and transport of iron and aluminum oxide particles in tap water used to fill an ultrasonic humidifier 2 to characterize the concentration size and shape of metal oxide particles emitted in aerosols from ultrasonic humidifiers 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials commercial iron oxide particles used in this research were

millipore durable membrane filter cat no gvwp04700 pore size 0 1 μm to separate larger micro metal particles whatman membrane filters cat no 6809 6012 pore size 0 22 μm were used 2 2 instrumentation for characterizations of water quality dissolved metals and metal oxide particles thermo scientific x series x 0458 inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms was applied to detect metal and non metals in aqueous solutions in accordance with standard method 3125 b american public health association 2017 the minimum reporting level of iron and aluminum are 0 01 and 0 001 mg l respectively malvern zetasizer nanozs dynamic light scattering dls was applied to determine mean particle diameter and size distributions of iron oxide and aluminum oxide particles in suspension in tap water a hach hq40d portable multi parameter meter was used to measure ph dissolved oxygen and temperature 2 3 humidifier operation and sample collection the humidifier used in this research is ranked a top five portable humidifier and rated a best buy by consumer reports 2015 the filterless humidifier has a reservoir capacity of 3 l the variable output control had a frequency of 1 67 mhz which is consistent with 1 6 mhz ultrasonic transducers typically used in ultrasonic humidifiers to produce water aerosols rodes et al 1990 all experiments were performed at room temperature at maximum output setting to represent a maximum aerosol output per time the humidifier upper reservoir was filled with 3 l of the appropriate water and allowed to operate for 14 h reservoir samples were taken by inserting a pipet 5 cm below the water surface in the lower reservoir consistent with previous research sain and dietrich 2015 kim et al 2017 the emitted aerosols were captured and condensed at room temperature in glass a sample was collected from the condensate column before entering the glass collection bottle by disconnecting the tubing and capturing condensate droplets in a glass beaker fig 1 two glass collection bottles were used as a precaution to collect and condense all water vapors to prevent emission into room air as the experiments used nanoparticles virginia tech health and safety did not allow the aerosols to be emitted into a hood or room for collection of airborne aerosols and particles the humidifier was filled with blacksburg va tap water augmented with micro iron oxide particles nano iron oxide particles or aluminum oxide particles blacksburg uses conventional treatment with about 1 mg l polyaluminum chloride not alum coagulant typical tap water quality data are in table s2 in supplemental material tap water contains 0 01 mg l fe and 0 04 0 01 mg l al separate experiments in triplicates were performed for each micro and nano iron oxide at 10 mg l fe and aluminum oxide at 5 mg l al these concentrations represent metal oxide concentrations during tap water rust or discoloration events samples of 35 ml water were taken using a micro pipet at approximately 2 h intervals from the lower reservoir r and condensate c the reservoir was initially sampled at t 0 h subsequent sampling times for both the reservoir and the condensate were at 1 2 4 6 8 10 12 and 14 h water samples were immediately measured for ph dissolved oxygen and temperature with a hach multiprobe for each unfiltered reservoir and condensate sample both 0 22 μm filtered and unfiltered samples for dissolved and total particulate dissolved iron were digested by adding 5 v v nitric acid and 4 v v hydroxylamine chloride and heated overnight at 55 c before determining total metal by icp ms for each reservoir and condensate sample dissolved iron and total iron were measured particulate iron was calculated as the difference between total and dissolved iron since there were visible black particles at the bottom of reservoir a separate experiment was performed to estimate the percentage of iron oxide particles that settled three liters of tap water and 10 mg l fe of micro iron nano iron oxide or aluminum oxide particles were added into glass vessels and allowed to settle for 14 h in a water bath of 40 c which is the water temperature in the reservoir at steady state see section 3 1 which describes steady state conditions a syringe was used to draw most of the water out thus leaving iron oxide particles that settled at the lower reservoir with some remaining water the particles were acid digested as the method mentioned above aluminum oxide 5 mg l as al particles were added to tap water the white particles were visibly apparent in condensate samples during the experiments the reservoir and condensate water samples were periodically taken as described above samples were centrifuged at 4000 rpm for an hour supernatant solutions were acidified with 10 v v nitric acid and 4 v v hydroxylamine chloride then heated overnight at 55 c before icp ms to measure dissolved aluminum total aluminum was measured in uncentrifuged water samples that were acid digested and heated using the same procedure the differences between total aluminum and dissolved aluminum were particulate aluminum 2 4 characterizations of metal oxide particles dynamic light scattering dls was applied to characterize the size of metal oxide particles in the reservoir and condensate water at steady state and after 4 h of humidifier operation 1 ml water samples were obtained of reservoir and condensate water for micro iron oxide nano iron oxide and aluminum oxide the particle size was immediately characterized by dls in addition the size of aluminum oxide particles was measured hourly for 14 h to determine the effect of ultrasonic energy on aluminum oxide particles the water temperature was measured in the reservoir the temperature of reservoir and condensate water samples in the dls instrument was set to the same value as the reservoir water water samples were obtained and immediately characterized for mean particle diameter a control experiment to determine the effect of only water temperature at 40 c without ultrasonic energy on aluminum oxide particle size was also performed this water was gently stirred at 60 rpm 2 5 data analysis all data analysis and graphs were completed in r r development core team 2017 water quality data mean particle diameters as well as particulate and dissolved iron and aluminum were analyzed by linear regression over operation time a 2 way anova test for overall significance followed by a multiple comparison with tukey s honestly significant difference hsd compared the difference of the mean particle diameters of iron and aluminum oxide particles in the reservoir and in the condensate t tests were applied to compare particulate iron or aluminum concentrations in the reservoir and condensate in addition the ratios of condensate reservoir c r in terms of other dissolved cations in tap water were compared the alpha value was set as 0 05 to determine statistical significance 3 results 3 1 water quality data during operation of the ultrasonic humidifier the reservoir water temperature increased from room temperature to 40 c slope 0 p 0 004 and as expected the do decreased slope 0 p 0 0006 and ph increased slightly slope 0 p 0 014 this same trend and similar magnitudes were present for all experiments with metal oxides and are represented by the data for nano iron oxide in fig 2 the reservoir temperature rose from 20 c to 40 c and ph increased from 7 to 8 while do decreased from 9 to 6 mg l o2 the emitted aerosols collected in the condensate water were at a cooler temperature and contained more dissolved oxygen as expected from re equilibrated with the room atmosphere similar to previous research sain and dietrich 2015 sain et al 2018 the conditions in the ultrasonic humidifier reservoir reached steady state where the temperature stabilized at 35 c at about 2 h additionally consistent with sain and dietrich 2015 85 95 of the cations typically present in the tap water used to fill the reservoir e g na ca mg k were emitted and measured in the condensate even when metal oxide particles were added the water quality data demonstrated consistent trends for the three metal oxide particles fig s1 in supplemental material 3 2 aggregation and size characterization of metal oxides in aqueous solutions as shown in table 1 the particle size range of 0 22 0 57 μm for emitted fe and al oxide particles collected in the condensate was statistically the same and a much narrower size distribution than particles in the reservoir 0 440 1 795 μm this result is consistent with kim et al 2017 and forde et al 2006 as ultrasonication of non uniformly distributed particles in solution results in emitting smaller particles in a narrower range in tap water the 0 3 μm micro iron oxides were present as aggregates with a mean diameter of 1 647 μm which is consistent with other findings of aggregation of iron nanoparticles in aqueous solutions chekli et al 2013 zhang et al 2008 this was confirmed visually as black iron particle clusters increased time in the humidifier reservoir did not significantly alter the mean particle diameter compared to tap water within the no significant difference group a table 1 as visually noted by color only a small fraction of the micro iron oxide particles was emitted from the humidifier the mean diameter of emitted particles was 0 224 μm which was statistically smaller than particles in the reservoir in two significantly different groups a b table 1 before contacting water the dry nano iron oxide particles were 0 05 0 1 μm in contact with tap water the iron oxide particles aggregated to a size of 1 512 μm mean diameter table 1 according to chekli et al 2013 iron oxide nanoparticles would form 1 μm aggregates under soil simulated solutions similar to the micro iron oxides nano iron oxide particles in the condensate were smaller at 0 571 μm mean diameter and fewer than in the reservoir as visually indicated by color a 2 way anova with multiple comparisons revealed that the mean diameters of micro iron oxide and nano iron oxide particles in tap water and in the reservoir were not significantly different but their mean diameters in the condensate were smaller and significantly different from the reservoir statistically iron oxide particles aggregated to approximately 1 6 μm in tap water and in the humidifier reservoir and 0 22 0 57 μm particles were emitted from the humidifier the initial 0 03 0 06 μm aluminum oxide particles also aggregated in contact with tap water to 1 315 μm mean diameter during ultrasonication their size reduced to 0 440 μm mean size this occurred within 15 min of humidifier operation the particles that were aerosolized and then condensed were 0 252 μm mean diameter fig 3 a the 2 way anova test revealed that the diameter of aluminum oxide particles in the condensate was not significantly different from the reservoir within the no significant difference group b table 1 which indicated that the equal sized particles were transported from the reservoir to aerosols it is notable that the aluminum oxide particles both as the initial suspension and as aggregates have a milky white appearance associated with hydrated aluminum oxide the effect of ultrasonication on the size of aluminum oxide particles in the ultrasonic humidifier over time was evaluated fig 3a demonstrates that 1 μm aggregated aluminum oxide particles in tap water were quickly shattered into smaller particles of 0 381 μm mean diameter and consistently maintained that smaller diameter in the reservoir throughout ultrasonication with a frequency of 1 67 mhz in the control experiment with aluminum oxide particles in 40 c tap water without ultrasonication the aluminum oxide particles maintained 1 μm mean diameters which indicated that ultrasonic energy reduced the size of particles in the reservoir polydispersity index pdi is a dimensionless value in the range of 0 1 for which small values represent uniform particle sizes and high values indicate variable particle sizes the dls measurements revealed the uniformity of the size distribution of the aluminum oxide particles fig 3c shows the mean particle diameter and pdi of aluminum oxide during hours 2 12 a pdi of 0 2 0 4 usually indicates a moderate uniform size distribution curve malvern instruments 2007 over operation time the pdi in the reservoir became smaller indicating increased uniformity for aluminum oxide particles being sampled in the condensate the pdi remained relatively stable and smaller than the pdi in reservoir indicating that the particles emitted after steady state were uniform in size linear regression analysis was performed on hours 2 12 data of the mean diameters in the condensate fig 3b since the conditions in the humidifier reservoir reached steady state after 2 h statistically the mean particle diameter in the reservoir was relatively constant at 0 381 μm and did not change after 2 h slope 6 10 6 μm h p 0 95 while the mean particle diameter in the condensate slightly increased from 0 236 to 0 310 μm over operation time slope 0 001 μm h p 0 005 with mean particle diameter over 2 12 h being 0 25 μm the size range of emitted particles is consistent with previous finding of 0 11 0 32 μm highsmith et al 1992 the fitted linear equation is shown in fig 3b the concentration of particulate aluminum also increased over time in the condensate slope 0 05 mg l hr p 0 04 possible reasons for an increase in aluminum oxide particle concentration in the condensate are evaporation of water in the reservoir or larger particles being emitted after 2 h with constant particle number concentration which resulted in more particle mass emitted it is notable that at t 14 h the particulate aluminum concentration jumped up to 5 mg l because there was no water entering the lower reservoir from upper reservoir after 12 h of operation which may have caused the large increase in mean particle diameter in the condensate at the end of operation 3 3 metal oxide particles and dissolved metal concentration in humidifier reservoir and condensate fig 4 shows dissolved and particulate concentrations of micro iron oxide nano iron oxide and aluminum oxide in the reservoir and condensate as a function of humidifier operation time the particulate iron concentrations in the reservoir samples demonstrated high variability the iron oxide particles settled soon after being added to the humidifier reservoir as indicated visually by a layer of black particles on the reservoir bottom mixing in the reservoir did not appear uniform resulting in different amounts of particles being sampled dissolved iron concentrations in the reservoir and condensate fluctuated with a range of 0 01 0 18 mg l for micro iron and 0 01 0 053 mg l for nano iron the dissolved iron in the condensate had a range of 0 01 0 026 mg l for micro iron and 0 01 0 022 mg l for nano iron the ranges of particulate iron concentrations in condensate were 0 01 0 07 mg l for micro iron oxide and 0 01 0 055 mg l for nano iron oxide as shown in fig 4 the 10 mg l micro or nano iron oxide particles added to tap water remained primarily as particles with little dissolution many denser iron oxide particles 5 g ml gravitationally settled in the reservoir approximately 87 for micro iron oxide and 92 for nano iron oxide by difference this resulted in the suspended iron oxides being 13 and 8 of 10 mg l fe which were approximately the mean concentrations of iron particles in measured reservoir samples in condensate water dissolved iron concentrations were typically half the concentrations of suspended particulate iron the aluminum oxide particles demonstrated a different pattern than iron oxides iinitially added at 5 mg l al approximately 1 mg l of aluminum particles were present in the reservoir half of those were expelled into the condensate and the rest gravity settled an increase in particle concentrations was observed for both the reservoir and condensate during the humidifier operation the slight ascending trend in suspended particulate aluminum in both reservoir and condensate may be due to resuspension of settled particulate aluminum that loosely accumulated at the bottom of the reservoir the resuspension of particulate aluminum might also cause the increase in dissolved aluminum as particles partially solubilized the dissolved aluminum concentrations in condensate had a high variability initially and after steady state they stabilized at 0 2 mg l based on average values over 14 h for data presented in fig 4 a b c and the initial added metal oxide concentration fig 4d demonstrates the fate of the metal oxide particles in the humidifier over 14 h of operation less than 10 of the denser than water iron oxide particles remained suspended in solution during humidifier operation and less than 1 dissolved in the water the pattern was different for the less dense and floc like aluminum oxide particles about 40 remained suspended in solution during humidifier operation and about 10 dissolved in the water thus more aluminum was available in the reservoir water to be aerosolized and emitted from the humidifier 3 4 statistical analysis of metal concentrations in reservoir and condensate over time unpaired t tests indicated significant difference between the particulate iron concentrations in the reservoir and in the condensate for micro iron oxide and nano iron oxide p 0 001 to determine the influence of operation time on metal concentrations table 2 presents outputs of linear regression models including intercepts and slopes for the particulate and dissolved metal concentrations presented in fig 4 the fitting of linear regression was poor in all conditions r2 0 4 the slopes of particulate and dissolved iron in the reservoir and in the condensate for both micro and nano iron oxides were very small values and not significantly different from zero this indicated that their concentrations over time were constant therefore it can be concluded that the operation time makes little difference on the emissions of particulate and dissolved iron once steady state was achieved all intercept values were significantly different from zero especially particulate iron and aluminum concentrations in both reservoir and condensate it is noticeable that in the condensate the particulate iron concentration of 0 03 mg l confirmed by both mean values and intercepts was emitted from the humidifier regardless of the particulate iron concentrations present in the reservoir small and insignificant slope values of the models suggested that neither particulate nor dissolved iron concentrations changed over time in either reservoir or condensate aluminum oxide particles in the reservoir and condensate behaved different from iron the aluminum oxide behavior is possibly due to resuspension of particles in the lower reservoir and in the condensate may be due to the resuspended particles being emitted from the humidifier and condensed the significant slopes indicated that the concentrations of aluminum oxide particles increased over operation time particulate and dissolved aluminum were emitted from the humidifier at a factor of ten higher than particulate and dissolved iron respectively t test showed that the particulate aluminum concentrations in the condensate were lower than in the reservoir p 0 003 linear regression models with indicator variables determined the values and significance of the changes to intercepts and slopes of metal concentrations over time table 2 the indicator variable designated location as either the reservoir or condensate in this research the δ values indicate the difference between condensate and reservoir significant δintercepts or δslopes revealed a statistical difference between two intercepts or two slopes no change occurred over time for particulate or dissolved micro and nano iron concentrations there was no statistical difference in the rates for the two locations reservoir or condensate for particulate and dissolved aluminum concentrations increased with time but the slope was statistically lower in the condensate as expected all intercepts were statistically different from zero for both micro and nano iron the δintercepts were statistically different for particulate but not dissolved negative signs of these δintercepts indicate the concentrations of particulate metal was consistently lower in the condensate compared to the reservoir aluminum showed no statistically significant change in the intercepts between two locations significant δintercepts of metal oxide particles indicated that location shift had a significant impact on the iron oxide particle concentrations the data analysis demonstrated that particulate fe and al present in the reservoir would be aerosolized statistically mean values of 0 03 mg l fe oxide particles and 0 8 mg l al oxide particles were emitted from the humidifiers during the 14 h operation time the percent emission ratios c concentration r concentration x 100 of micro iron nano iron and aluminum oxide particles are 3 1 6 7 and 42 respectively size density and form of particles such as solid or floc like fig s2 in supplemental material may cause the obvious difference of the emission ratios between iron and aluminum particles 4 discussion this research investigated the fate and transport of iron oxide and aluminum oxide particles present in ultrasonic humidifier reservoirs and characterized the emitted particles insoluble metal oxide particles that are denser than water and large enough to gravitationally settle will collect at the bottom of the reservoir the iron oxide particles are about 5 times the density of water once settled they are poorly resuspended during humidifier operation low concentrations of iron oxide particles that were of a size too small to gravitationally settle remained suspended in the reservoir water and were emitted in the aerosols sources of iron particles in humidifiers include metal oxides present in the fill water and also in the case of ground water containing soluble ferrous iron ferric oxide particles that form by oxidation during ultrasonication sain and dietrich 2015 the aluminum oxide particles in suspended solutions are about the density of water and some gravitationally settled the 1 67 mhz ultrasonic energy reduced the size of suspended aluminum oxide particles from 1 315 0 056 μm to 0 440 0 027 μm in the humidifier reservoir the suspended floc like aluminum oxide particles of 0 253 0 003 μm were emitted in the aerosols the data demonstrated that some of the settled particles were likely resuspended and emitted during the 14 h humidifier operation particles that are suspended in water and not able to settle can be emitted from an ultrasonic humidifier the metal oxide particle sizes emitted range from 0 22 μm to 0 57 μm table 1 which is much smaller than the respirable fraction of 4 μm acgih 2005 at the end of 14 h operation period the aluminum oxide particle concentrations climaxed in the reservoir which may cause the sudden increase in mean diameter in the condensate therefore it is recommended to use an ultrasonic humidifier only when water is present in the upper reservoir that can fill the lower reservoir the water quality of fill water used in ultrasonic humidifiers has a great impact on the aerosols emitted a concentration of 10 mg l fe as iron oxide particles were added to tap water used to fill ultrasonic humidifiers most of these denser than water particles settled to the bottom of reservoir the suspended iron oxides constituted approximately 0 03 mg l fe and the 0 22 0 57 μm sized iron oxide particles were emitted in the humidifier aerosol when a 5 mg l al as aluminum oxide suspension in tap water was used to fill the humidifier reservoir approximately 1 mg l al particles remained suspended about half of the suspended particles and those with 0 25 μm were emitted in the aerosol the concentrations of aluminum oxide particles in the humidifier reservoir and the emitted aerosols showed a slight increasing trend during the whole operation period while the concentrations of iron oxides particles maintained constant statistically the components of fill water used in ultrasonic humidifiers have an important influence on the emitted aerosols especially dissolved ions and suspended particles as the aerosols formed are of dimensions that can be inhaled into the human lung the fate of the emitted particles in breathing air can be assessed by comparing the time for them to settle against the time for them to be removed from the indoor environment by ventilation table 3 shows settling velocities of the aluminum oxide and iron oxide particles and the corresponding settling times from a height of 0 9 m location of the humidifier outlet when sleeping the minimum settling time is 5 h for iron oxide particles with a diameter of 0 57 μm and a density of 5 g cm3 density this exceeds the typical indoor air residence time of 1 2 h in the us yamamoto et al 2010 this analysis suggests that the particles emitted from ultrasonic humidifiers will remain suspended in air until removal by ventilation and very few will settle to the floor thus the metal oxide particles pose an inhalation risk to humans due to their extremely slow settling velocities a common global phenomenon is metal oxide contaminants from release of iron rust into tap water and red water benson et al 2012 lytle et al 2010 miller et al 1984 corrosion of other metals in the distribution system and plumbing also contributes metal particles to tap water other sources of particles i e microplastics are hard to remove by water treatment plants and would remain suspended in tap water cole et al 2011 it is acknowledged that nanosized magnetite present in dwds can adsorb toxic metal such as pb as cr bliem et al 2015 kumari et al 2015 based on this research 0 22 0 57 μm suspended particles will transport from ultrasonic humidifier reservoir water to aerosols and the particles of this size range have a relatively high deposition rate onto nasal and alveolar region causing adverse health effects dominici et al 2006 oberdörster et al 2005 with the wide use of ultrasonic humidifiers it is a great concern that consumers are exposed to aerosolized and inhalable impurities from drinking water 5 conclusions a commercially available portable 1 67 mhz ultrasonic humidifier was filled with tap water containing added iron or aluminum oxide particles representing drinking water contamination from iron rust or alum floc the metal oxide particles present in the humidifier reservoir had a high polydispersity and ranged from 0 440 to 1 795 μm in diameter the particles emitted from the ultrasonic humidifier had a low polydispersity and fell predominantly in the sub micron range of 0 22 0 57 μm a size which has a relatively high deposition rate into the nasal and alveolar region concentrations of 0 03 mg l fe or 0 8 mg l al oxide particles were emitted when the fill water contains metal oxides of 10 mg l fe or 5 mg l al iron particles had a density of about 5 g cm3 and tended to gravity settle in the humidifier while al particles were a floc like suspension of lower density and settling particles this study provides an insight to the influences of water quality on indoor air quality through the emission of minerals from ultrasonic humidifiers andrea m dietrich 0000 0003 2679
