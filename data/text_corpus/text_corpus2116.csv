10580,shrimp aquaculture is a fast growing industry in many parts of the world the expansion of the industry has raised concerns about its external impacts on the local environment and ecosystems including agriculture this study examines changes over time in land use and soil salinity levels using satellite data and soil sample data from satkhira district in bangladesh moreover the study measures the impact of shrimp aquaculture on soil salinity in neighboring paddy farms and evaluates how this in turn affects paddy farm profits using farm level data from 316 paddy plots results show that the land covered by shrimp ponds almost doubled in terms of percentage of land area expanding from 22 in 1990 to 38 in 2016 soil salinity also increased significantly over the same period farm level analysis shows that salinity levels are relatively higher in paddy plots that are closer to shrimp ponds each additional 1 meter decrease in the distance between paddy plots and shrimp ponds induces a 0 14 increase in soil salinity in both aman rainfed and boro irrigated seasons as salinity is higher in paddy plots closer to shrimp ponds the same percentage change results in a greater absolute increase in salinity levels in nearby paddy plots relative to plots located farther away furthermore due to the higher salinity levels paddy profits per hectare are relatively lower in paddy plots closer to shrimp ponds on average a 1 meter decrease in the distance between paddy plots and shrimp ponds results in a decrease in paddy profits by usd 0 31 and 0 15 per hectare in the aman and boro seasons respectively the findings of this study call for policy measures to address the externalities posed by shrimp aquaculture to paddy farmers keywords paddy profit soil salinity shrimp ponds externality bangladesh 1 introduction shrimp aquaculture is a fast growing industry in many parts of the world including asia and latin america fao 2020 the expansion of the industry has been driven mainly by the demand for shrimp in the international market shrimp accounts for 17 of the total value of internationally traded fish products fao 2019 the growth of shrimp aquaculture has raised concerns about its negative impacts on the environment and ecosystems including mangrove forests wetlands and agriculture and has also contributed to land use conflicts hossain et al 2004 quader et al 2004 ali 2006 chowdhury et al 2006 azad et al 2009 evaluating the external impacts of shrimp aquaculture is important from land use management perspective bangladesh is the twelfth largest producer of farmed shrimp and fifth largest producer of giant tiger prawn in the world kabir 2013 fao 2017 black tiger shrimp bagda is bangladesh s second largest export product after readymade garments and is generating about 6 of the total value of exports marine fresh bangladesh 2018 shrimp aquaculture in coastal bangladesh has expanded significantly with growth in south western coastal bangladesh being particularly high bangladesh has a long history of traditional shrimp aquaculture predominantly in the tidal water fed high saline coastal areas soil and water salinity in the inner coastal areas is increasing by an estimated 146 km2 per year soil resource development institute srdi 2010 which is a result of multiple natural and human induced factors fleming 2004 gain et al 2008 seal and baten 2012 prothom 2017 in these areas a natural adaptation to rising salinity is the rotation between shrimp and paddy by producing shrimp when salinity is high in the dry months and switching to rice and sweet water fish during the less saline monsoon period kabir et al 2016 kais and islam 2018 in other coastal areas where farmland is suitable for paddy farming large land owners and renters have converted farmland into shrimp ponds such land conversion has caused social conflicts because of land grabbing and externalities on neighboring paddy farmers mahmood et al 1994 maniruzzaman 1998 quader et al 2004 chowdhury et al 2006 azad et al 2009 these external impacts imposed by private shrimp farms on private paddy farms are of concern in countries such as bangladesh shrimp aquaculture requires infusion of salt water into ponds which affects neighboring agriculture fields by reducing their productive capacity gujja and finger stich 1996 dewalt et al 1996 flaherty et al 1999 ali 2006 bournazel et al 2015 ilman et al 2016 saline water for shrimp farms is generally brought inland from marine or saline riverine sources to fill shrimp ponds ghers through natural and engineered channels during the high tide and salt water is blocked in during low tide after each cropping season water is pumped out to dry out ponds and refilled in with saline water before new season the saline water intrudes into nearby agricultural land both through natural percolation and overflow during heavy rainfall flooding therefore shrimp aquaculture lowers neighboring soil fertility through salinization which further leads to farmland conversion from paddy to shrimp ali 2006 afroz and alam 2013 making it a problematic form of maladaptation to the rising coastal salinity johnson et al 2016 bangladesh has no specific legal framework for shrimp farm management but existing laws on fisheries apply bangladesh has some sixteen major policies and regulations that protect fish land water and agricultural land however the regulations are applied to shrimp farming in an ad hoc manner afroz and alam 2013 for example the shrimp mohal management policy of 1992 promotes shrimp farming without considering environmental impacts such as the rise in soil salinity contradicting the national environment policy which bars salinization causing land uses hoq 2007 afroz and alam 2013 p 279 there is a broad literature that points to the many negative impacts of shrimp aquaculture e g paprocki and cons 2014 belton 2016 johnson et al 2016 unep 1999 using a cost benefit framework evaluates the public costs of shrimp farming due to agricultural yields reduction reclamation costs water pollution impacts on human health mangrove destruction and biodiversity losses and shows that these public costs are 21 30 higher than the profits from shrimp aquaculture a few studies have quantified the externality costs of shrimp aquaculture associated with mangrove clearance biodiversity and coastal land allocation barbier et al 2002 bhat and bhatta 2004 martinet and blanchard 2009 however very few studies have assessed the externality effects on paddy cultivation and the costs imposed on nearby land uses exceptions are be et al 1999 who show that aquaculture induced salinity has negative effects on paddy farming in the mekong delta of vietnam and umamaheswari et al 2009 who estimate that a 10 increase in shrimp farm associated salinity contributes to 0 6 reduction in paddy yields in south india there have been no previous studies in bangladesh on quantifying the external impacts of shrimp aquaculture on the soil salinity and agricultural profits in the farms located nearby evaluating these external impacts are important for designing policy for land use management in coastal bangladesh where soil salinity is on the rise the main objectives of this study are twofold the first is to examine changes over time in land use and soil salinity levels using satellite data and soil sample data from satkhira district in bangladesh the second is to measure the impact of shrimp aquaculture on soil salinity in neighboring paddy farms and evaluate how this in turn affects paddy farm profits using farm level data from paddy plots in the study area 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the study area of this research is from kaliganj upazila 22 4741 n 89 0562 e a sub district in satkhira district located in southwest coastal bangladesh fig 1 this study was conducted in satkhira district because coastal land use in the district is changing from agriculture to shrimp production with implications for mangroves salinity intrusion and social conflicts ali 2006 doe 2006 islam 2006 aman paddy traditional monsoon rice is cultivated in over a fifth of the land area of satkhira district bbs 2018 the study area is an almost level landscape crossed by interconnected tidal rivers and canals flooding during the monsoon season is common riverine flooding is aggravated by flooding of tidal canals connected to the main river system which impregnate both the top and subsoil with soluble salts soil salinity is an important agricultural issue as it can limit crop growth and arrest yields with varied effects depending on soil quality cultivation methods infestation etc clemont dauphin et al 2010 the soil resource development institute soil resource development institute srdi 2010 citing the brookers tropical soil manual 1991 suggests that low levels of soil salinity an ec range of 2 4 decisiemens per meter dsm 1 negatively affect very sensitive plants while higher ec ranges of 4 8 can have significant negative effects crop yields of different crops are influenced by different threshold salinity levels with yield reductions occurring in some crops at salinity levels lower than the generally accepted standard ec level of 4 soil resource development institute srdi 2010 potassium nitrate association pna 2018 table 1 depicts the major land characteristics of the study area the ph values indicate that the soils of satkhira district are mostly moderate to strongly alkaline with high ph values contributing to micronutrient deficiencies top soils have low organic matter om content indicating poor soil physical condition the soil cation exchange capacity cec is an indicator of finer texture and higher organic matter content as soils having cec below 15 0 moles of electrical charge m e are considered poor singaraval et al 1996 satkhira shows marginal levels of fine soil texture and organic matter haque 2006 along with rising soil salinity the salinity concentration in surface water in the study area has been increasing surface water salinity estimated by the iczmp 2003 in satkhira district to be on average 1 3 ds m 1 is predicted to be close to 2 3 ds m 1 by the end of 2030 seal and baten 2012 to be able to cultivate shrimp in ghers shrimp ponds the ph level in the water has to be in the range of 7 5 8 5 salinity in shrimp ponds in the study area generally ranges from 10 0 35 0 ds m 1 the salinity in river water varies based on the season remaining higher than 5 ds m 1 during the dry season soil resource development institute srdi 2010 2 2 sampling design and data collection 2 2 1 sampling design a multistage sampling design was used to collect data in 2016 in the first stage five villages from kaliganj upazila where paddy farms and commercial shrimp ponds are adjacent to each other were selected namely askerpur tetulia tarali nalta and varashimla in the next stage a shrimp pond cluster in each village was identified where paddy farms are in neighbourhood finally the sample was drawn from that cluster in each village this study uses three types of data soil salinity data satellite data and farm data from paddy farmers 2 2 2 soil salinity and satellite data in order to collect soil salinity data 10 geographic bands each at 10 meter aerial distance around each shrimp pond were drawn and soils data from the paddy fields within these bands were collected fig 2 a total of 241 soil samples were collected with the number of samples per site varying based on site geography and feasibility of data collection for example if there was a road that acted as a natural barrier to salinity penetration no further soil samples were collected beyond the road secondly if there was no agricultural land after a certain distance no data were collected the field samples were collected during the dry winter season january february of 2016 soil and water salinity vary throughout the year in bangladesh in the dry season between december june salinity is generally high while reaching its peak during june thereafter monsoon rainfall causes salinity to dilute from august to december habiba et al 2014 a hi 8033 portable conductivity tds meter and standard recommendations in the manual was used to measure salinity ec from the 241 field samples see hanna instuments 2019 the soils samples were analysed at the laboratory facilities of khulna university of engineering technology kuet details on the salinity distribution in each of the five sites are presented in the supporting maps fig a1 in appendix a the salinity maps are based on remote sensing data which in combination with geographic information systems and statistical methods can be used to predict soil salinity in the absence of detailed field soils data bouaziz et al 2011 morshed et al 2016 in addition the satellite data were also used to predict historical salinity landsat 7 etm images path 138 row 44 were collected from the united states geological survey for 6th january 2016 to match the time when field soil samples were gathered in addition images from 20th january 1990 path 138 and row 44 were collected to understand historical land use the satellite images were corrected for surface features and the data was converted recorded in digital number dn into reflectance the landsat image was corrected using the erdas model maker bouaziz et al 2011 to create salinity maps around each shrimp cluster thirteen salinity indicators from the 2016 landsat imagery were computed following morshed et al 2016 a stepwise regression to identify the combination of spectral bands that were best correlated with plot specific field soil salinity ec were used the regression analysis indicate that current field salinity is highly correlated with three satellite salinity indices infrared bands of the satellite image si2 nir r and savi 1 1 this is based on the regression with the highest r2 value low p and high akaike s information criterion aic value and low standard error at 5 percent significance level si 2 shows the intensity value of the image or soil indices high index value indicates high reflectance and high soil salinity nir r refers to ratio of near infrared nir and red bands the soil adjusted vegetation index savi was developed as a modification of the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi to correct for the influence of soil brightness when vegetative cover is low the savi is structured like the ndvi but with the addition of a soil brightness correction factor a combination of the three indices si2 nir r and savi from the 2016 satellite image predicts plot level soil salinity with 73 accuracy 2 2 salinity 12 53 1108 95 nir 2 73 nir r 717 86 si2 295 7 savi then homogenous bands of salinity around each of the five shrimp pond clusters were created using kriging interpolation a commonly used gis tool the correlation between 2016 plot level and satellite data was applied to the landsat data from 1990 to predict historical soil salinity fig 3 because the study examines a current cross section of satkhira district the purpose of the salinity maps of 1990 and 2016 is to make sure that the area was not saline prior to the arrival of shrimp ponds 2 2 3 farm data from paddy farmers a survey of 225 paddy farmers was undertaken to collect plot level data on farm inputs and output prices farm and household characteristics local leaders school teachers and farmers were contacted to identify all the farmers who cultivate paddy on plots located within the 10 m distance bands used for collecting soils data data from the selected farmers were collected through face to face interviews using a pre tested questionnaire first four enumerators were trained for two days on research objectives and the farm survey the enumerators then pre tested the questionnaire by randomly surveying ten farmers in the study area thereafter the survey questionnaire was finalized second an informative leaflet about the study was distributed among the farmers clarifying that data would be used for research only farmers were then contacted through their cell phones to identify a time for a face to face interview the human involvement during data collection of the project was approved while awarding the research project by the south asian network for environment and development economics sandee s research advisory committee in bangladesh paddy is cultivated in two seasons aman rain fed during august november and boro irrigated during december april data were collected from 150 farmers during the aman season and 75 farmers during the boro season since many farmers had more than one plot plot level farm data on a maximum of three plots per farmer was obtained the survey was conducted during december 2015 january 2016 aman and may 2016 boro because of missing observations the final dataset includes 316 plot level observations with 171 from aman plots and 145 boro plots the respective salinity levels of the aman and boro plots were estimated using the estimated equation 3 3 ibid 2 3 estimation of externality cost 2 3 1 theoretical model the theoretical model for examining the linkages among shrimp aquaculture soil salinity and paddy farm profits is based on vincent 2011 in this model the paddy farm production function is specified as follows 1 q f x e c where q is the quantity of paddy output x is a vector representing input quantities and ec is the environmental quality of land that is not under the control of paddy farmer in the context of this study ec represents soil salinity induced by shrimp pond in the neighbour the paddy farmer s objective is to maximize profit 2 m a x x p f x e c w x where p is the price of output and w is the vector of input prices solving the above profit maximizing problem yields the input demand function for each input j 3 x j g p w e c eq 1 shows that ec affects paddy output furthermore eq 3 shows that ec also affects the optimal quantity of inputs substituting the input demand functions eq 3 into the objective function in eq 2 yields the profit function 4 π π p w e c eq 4 shows that paddy farmer s profits depend on prices as well as shrimp pond induced soil salinity to capture the soil salinity induced by shrimp pond the salinity distance function is specified as follows 5 e c e c d where d denotes the distance between paddy plot and the nearest shrimp pond as saline water spreads through natural percolation paddy plots closest to shrimp ponds are likely to have more saline soils relative to paddy plots that are further away 2 3 2 econometric model this section specifies econometric model to estimate eqs 4 and 5 to estimate the effect of soil salinity on paddy profits the profit function given in eq 4 is specified as follows 6 l n π β 0 β 1 l n e c β 2 l n p r i c e β 3 a g e β 4 a g e 2 β 5 e d u β 6 s p β 7 l 2 β 8 l 3 β 9 l 4 β 10 l 5 ε in eq 6 ln denotes the natural logarithm and paddy farm profit π is measured in us dollars usd per hectare of land and is based on field data on farm output inputs and their prices farm profits are computed as revenue from the sale of the paddy crop minus labour costs non labour costs and fertilizer costs labour costs are the sum of the cost per hectare for land preparation weeding and harvesting non labour costs are the sum of seed fertilizer pesticide and irrigation costs fertilizer costs include costs incurred for urea potash and triple super phosphate tsp purchases ec represents plot level salinity identified through the salinity maps price is the market price of the output measured in usd per kg it reflects the market price associated with the most commonly grown paddy variety variation in output price across paddy farms is a result of differences in the time of harvest or location because there are no significant differences observed in the prices of different inputs in the district input prices were not considered as independent variables in specifying eq 6 several variables are used to control for differences in farm characteristics these include age age and the education level edu of the farmer age is used as a proxy for the managerial ability of the farmers profits are expected to increase with age up to a point and then may decrease education a proxy for human capital is expected to increase profits the scattered plot sp variable refers to whether the paddy plots of a farmer are together or separated this variable controls for the effect of plot specific characteristics on farm profit if the plots are scattered s p takes the value 1 and 0 for otherwise farmers with scattered plots are expected to have less profits as compared to those with joined plots because of the additional effort required in farm management eq 6 includes locational dummy variables varashimla l 1 is the reference site while tetulia l 2 tarali l 3 nalta l 4 and askerpur l 5 are included to control location specific unobservable factors such as elevation distance to the nearest sea or river and other factors to assess the impact of shrimp aquaculture on soil salinity in paddy plots the salinity distance function in eq 5 is specified as follows 7 l n e c α 0 α 1 d α 2 l 2 α 3 l 3 α 4 l 4 α 5 l 5 u where d denotes the distance between paddy plot and the nearest shrimp pond 2 3 3 estimation of econometric model and externality the effect of shrimp aquaculture on soil salinity in paddy plots is estimated using eq 7 where explanatory variable d is the distance between paddy plot and the nearest shrimp pond to estimate the effect of shrimp pond driven changes in soil salinity on paddy profits we estimate eq 6 by instrumental variable approach where eq 7 is used for instrumenting the soil salinity by using the distance as an instrument through this approach the part of the variation in soil salinity that is associated with the distance is used to estimate the effect of soil salinity on paddy profits thus this approach allows us to capture the effect of shrimp pond driven changes in soil salinity on paddy profits estimation of eq 6 by instrumental variable approach also addresses an econometric problem as soil salinity may be correlated with the error term which makes soil salinity an endogenous variable this endogeneity may be due to omitted variables to address this problem the distance is used as an instrumental variable for soil salinity to control for potential endogeneity thus eqs 6 and 7 are estimated simultaneously by an instrumental variable iv approach using a two stage least squares estimator eq 6 is specified as a log log functional form all variables in eq 6 are transformed into natural logarithm except the dummy variables age and edu the data show that all continuous variables in eq 6 have positive values making the logarithm transformation suitable furthermore when the dependent variable takes positive values the logarithm transformation ensures that the predicted values are always positive among the explanatory variables dummy variables cannot be transformed into logs furthermore variables that are measured in years such as age and education are expected to be used in their original form wooldridge 2013 p 193 eq 7 is specified as a log level functional form because salinity is likely to decrease asymptotically with increasing in distance distance is measured in meters furthermore for robustness checks the eqs 6 and 7 were also estimated using linear functional forms eqs 6 and 7 are estimated for both aman and boro paddy seasons separately since paddy profits and salinity level differ across seasons aman is cultivated during the monsoons and hence its profitability depends on rainfall changes in climate irregular rainfall and delays in the start of the season can affect crop yield rainfall also determines soil salinity it is to be noted that the soils are most saline at the start of the aman season and least saline at the beginning of the boro season further boro production in the summer depends on irrigation which can heavily dilute soil salinity the coefficient estimates of eqs 6 and 7 are used to compute the externality cost of a1 meter decrease in the distance between paddy plot and nearest shrimp pond as follows wooldridge 2013 8 e x t e r n a l i t y c o s t e β ˆ 1 α ˆ 1 1 100 where the externality cost is the reduction in percentage in the expected profit in paddy farm induced by a 1 meter decrease in the distance between the paddy plot and the nearest shrimp pond 3 results and discussion 3 0 1 land use and soil salinity changes over time land use has changed significantly in the study area over the last 25 years fig 3 shows changes in the study area based on the soil maps that were generated for 1990 and 2016 as the figure shows land under shrimp ponds increased significantly between 1990 and 2016 table 2 breaks down the evidence from the soil maps into percentage of land cover with different levels of salinity in 1990 22 of land area was covered by water shrimp cultivation and while in 2016 38 of the land cover is under water shrimp cultivation as the table 2 shows areas with salinity ec 4 increased by 11 while areas with very little salinity ec 1 decreased by 30 the gis and remote sensing based estimation of land use change are inline with the findings of parvin et al 2017 that shrimp farming has expanded by replacing paddy farming in the study area to further examine changes in soil salinity over time observed soil salinity based on field samples in 2016 is compared with predicted 1990 soil salinity accuracy 73 based on the soil salinity estimation within reasonable limits fig 4 shows that observed soil salinity in 2016 is higher than predicted historical salinity in 1990 in all 241 data points for which field samples were collected the study confirms previous findings on the increasing salinity trend in the coastal regions of bangladesh see for example soil resource development institute srdi 2010 afroz and alam 2013 johnson et al 2016 clearly salinity is higher now relative to the period when there were very few shrimp ponds however this does not conclusively prove that the salinity increase is due to the growth in shrimp ponds to confirm that shrimp ponds are the source of soil salinity soil salinity at varying distances from shrimp ponds were estimated from the kriging interpolation the data show that soil salinity increases as the distance from shrimp pond decreases table 3 in the next sub section the impact of shrimp ponds on the neighboring paddy plots is analysed using regression analysis 3 0 2 shrimp production soil salinity and farm profits table 4 presents summary statistics on variables included in the regression analyses the average profits across paddy types are usd 691 and 1029 per hectare in aman and boro seasons 4 4 1 usd 76 94 bangladeshi taka bdt as of 15 july 2016 respectively which are similar to profits reported by ahmed and haider 2014 usd 792 and 1057 per hectare in low and moderate saline prone unions of khulna district the market price for boro rice per kilogram is usd 0 33 which is higher than that for aman rice usd 0 27 these market prices are consistent with the literature usd 26 27 per kilogram haider and akter 2018 the average farmer in the sample has around seven years of schooling and is 44 year old therefore the sample of farmers is on average middle aged and has a relatively low level of schooling the average distance of paddy plots from shrimp ponds is 239 and 459 m for aman and boro plots respectively i e boro plots are approximately twice as far as aman plots from shrimp farms for the regression analysis distance is measured in meters as kilometer is too big a unit to communicate the effect of distance on salinity the data show that average salinity level is 2 3 and 1 61 ds m 1 in aman and boro season respectively the reason for the higher salinity level in the aman season relative to the boro season is because farmers irrigate heavily to dilute soil salinity in the boro season to examine the extent to which shrimp culture contributes to an increase in the level of salinity in paddy plots and its effect on farm profitability an instrumental variable iv regression model specified in eqs 6 and 7 was estimated and presented in table 5 fig 5 illustrates the results graphically panel a of table 5 presents estimates of the effect of distance between paddy plot and shrimp pond on plot specific salinity in the paddy plot in the aman model 1 and boro model 2 seasons as shown the estimated coefficient on the distance variable is negative and statistically significant at 1 level in both models the results suggest that if the distance between the paddy plot and nearest shrimp pond decreases by 1 meter paddy plot salinity is expected to increase by 0 14 in both seasons table 5 the negative sign of the coefficient shows that the salinity levels are higher in areas closer to shrimp ponds thus a 0 14 increase in salinity close to a shrimp pond is much higher in absolute value than a 0 14 increase in salinity in fields located further away showing a non linear relationship between distance and salinity levels in terms of changes in the actual levels of salinity a 1 meter decrease in distance increases paddy plot salinity levels on average by 0 0032 and 0 0023 ds m 1 in the aman and boro seasons respectively salinity increases in aman are higher than boro because boro season irrigation dilutes salinity panel b in table 5 reports the regression results of the effects of salinity on farm profits during the aman model 1 and boro model 2 seasons in both models there is a statistically significant 1 level and negative relationship between shrimp pond induced salinity and farm profits a 1 increase in shrimp pond induced salinity is associated with a 0 3 and 0 1 reduction in paddy profits in the aman and boro seasons respectively on average a 1 ds m 1 increase in the salinity level reduces paddy profit by usd 97 and 63 per hectare in the aman and boro seasons respectively as shown in table 5 most of the control variables such as market price dispersed plots age age squared and education levels of the respondents exhibit the expected signs most of the site specific dummy variables are statistically significant the r2 ranges from 58 to 78 thus a significant amount of the variation in salinity is explained by variables in the equation based on the coefficient estimates in table 5 and employing eq 8 a 1 meter decrease in the distance between the paddy plot and the nearest shrimp pond induces a reduction in the expected profit in paddy farms by 0 05 and 0 01 in aman and boro seasons respectively on average a 1 meter decrease in the distance between the paddy plot and the nearest shrimp pond reduces expected profit in paddy farms by usd 0 31 and 0 15 per hectare in the aman and boro seasons respectively this finding of external costs of shrimp aquaculture on paddy farms is consistent with the literature be et al 1999 umamaheswari et al 2009 ahmed and haider 2014 panel c in table 5 presents the results of diagnostic tests to check the validity of iv regression results the weak instrument test using cragg donald wald f test identifies whether the instrument distance is relevant the test results indicate that the instrument is not weak as the f statistic is much greater than the stock yogo critical value for a 10 maximal iv size stock and yogo 2002 the wu hausman f test baum et al 2015 is used to test for endogeneity of the variable salinity where the null hypothesis is that the variable is exogenous the test results show that the f statistic is statistically significant at the 5 level for the boro season however it is not statistically significant at the 5 level for the aman season thus the estimates of the model for the aman season using ordinary least squares ols show similar results to the instrumental variable estimation in table 5 finally for robustness checks the salinity and profit functions were estimated using a linear functional form i e without a logarithm transformation of any of the variables in eqs 6 and 7 table 6 presents marginal effect of distance on salinity and that of salinity on paddy profits for a linear model along with nonlinear model results reported in table 5 for comparison in the first stage based on the linear model it is found that a 1 meter decrease in distance increases salinity level by 0 0023 ds m 1 and 0 0020 ds m 1 in the aman and boro seasons respectively in the second stage a 1 ds m 1 increase in shrimp induced salinity is associated with a usd 123 and 50 reductions in profits per hectare in aman and boro seasons respectively this translates to a 1 meter decrease in distance decreasing paddy profits by usd 0 28 and 0 1 in aman and boro seasons respectively these results show that the estimated marginal effects on average are not too different in linear and nonlinear models 4 conclusions this study examines the changes over time in land use and soil salinity levels in the study area of kaliganj upazila in satkhira district in bangladesh it also evaluates the impact of shrimp aquaculture on soil salinity and profits in neighboring paddy farms satellite data show that the land covered by shrimp ponds as a percentage of land area increased from 22 in 1990 to 38 in 2016 in the study area soil salinity also increased significantly during the same time period thus both the landscape and soil quality of this coastal belt of bangladesh have seen considerable changes over the last two and half decades these quantitative results reinforce a commonly held perspective and growing concern that coastal bangladesh is becoming more saline study results based on soil samples collected around shrimp ponds in kaliganj indicate that salinity levels are relatively higher in paddy plots that are closer to shrimp ponds statistical analyses specifies that each additional 1 meter decrease in the distance between paddy plots and shrimp ponds induces a 0 14 increase in soil salinity in both aman rainfed and boro irrigated seasons higher salinity levels have an adverse effect on paddy profits with per hectare profits being relatively lower in paddy plots closer to shrimp ponds on average a 1 meter decrease in the distance between paddy plots and shrimp ponds leads to a decrease in paddy profits by usd 0 31 and 0 15 per hectare in the aman and boro seasons respectively these findings provide information on farm level changes in bangladesh and also contribute to a relatively small body of global evidence on the external economic costs of shrimp farming shrimp farming in bangladesh presents the case of a private business activity producing environmental changes in neighboring areas that may facilitate its own commercial expansion shrimp induced salinity increases make nearby paddy production less profitable thus the paddy farmland becomes cheaper for shrimp farmers to purchase for enlarging their own business operations which further contributes to the region s soil salinity the co production of shrimp and soil salinity needs to be addressed to tackle the challenges of increasing soil salinity in bangladesh the findings of this study call for careful policy measures and coastal planning to address the externality costs of shrimp aquaculture on neighboring lands declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgement this research project was funded by the

10580,shrimp aquaculture is a fast growing industry in many parts of the world the expansion of the industry has raised concerns about its external impacts on the local environment and ecosystems including agriculture this study examines changes over time in land use and soil salinity levels using satellite data and soil sample data from satkhira district in bangladesh moreover the study measures the impact of shrimp aquaculture on soil salinity in neighboring paddy farms and evaluates how this in turn affects paddy farm profits using farm level data from 316 paddy plots results show that the land covered by shrimp ponds almost doubled in terms of percentage of land area expanding from 22 in 1990 to 38 in 2016 soil salinity also increased significantly over the same period farm level analysis shows that salinity levels are relatively higher in paddy plots that are closer to shrimp ponds each additional 1 meter decrease in the distance between paddy plots and shrimp ponds induces a 0 14 increase in soil salinity in both aman rainfed and boro irrigated seasons as salinity is higher in paddy plots closer to shrimp ponds the same percentage change results in a greater absolute increase in salinity levels in nearby paddy plots relative to plots located farther away furthermore due to the higher salinity levels paddy profits per hectare are relatively lower in paddy plots closer to shrimp ponds on average a 1 meter decrease in the distance between paddy plots and shrimp ponds results in a decrease in paddy profits by usd 0 31 and 0 15 per hectare in the aman and boro seasons respectively the findings of this study call for policy measures to address the externalities posed by shrimp aquaculture to paddy farmers keywords paddy profit soil salinity shrimp ponds

mainly by the demand for shrimp in the international market shrimp accounts for 17 of the total value of internationally traded fish products fao 2019 the growth of shrimp aquaculture has raised concerns about its negative impacts on the environment and ecosystems including mangrove forests wetlands and agriculture and has also contributed to land use conflicts hossain et al 2004 quader et al 2004 ali 2006 chowdhury et al 2006 azad et al 2009 evaluating the external impacts of shrimp aquaculture is important from land use management perspective bangladesh is the twelfth largest producer of farmed shrimp and fifth largest producer of giant tiger prawn in the world kabir 2013 fao 2017 black tiger shrimp bagda is bangladesh s second largest export product after readymade garments and is generating about 6 of the total value of exports marine fresh bangladesh 2018 shrimp aquaculture in coastal bangladesh has expanded significantly with growth in south western coastal bangladesh being particularly high bangladesh has a long history of traditional shrimp aquaculture predominantly in the tidal water fed high saline coastal areas soil and water salinity in the inner coastal areas is increasing by an estimated 146 km2 per year soil resource development institute srdi 2010 which is a result of multiple natural and human induced factors fleming 2004 gain et al 2008 seal and baten 2012 prothom 2017 in these areas a natural adaptation to rising salinity is the rotation between shrimp and paddy by producing shrimp when salinity is high in the dry months and switching to rice and sweet water fish during the less saline monsoon period kabir et al 2016 kais and islam 2018 in other coastal areas where farmland is suitable for paddy farming large land owners and renters have converted farmland into shrimp ponds such land conversion has caused social conflicts because of land grabbing and externalities on neighboring paddy farmers mahmood et al 1994 maniruzzaman 1998 quader et al 2004 chowdhury et al 2006 azad et al 2009 these external impacts imposed by private shrimp farms on private paddy farms are of concern in countries such as bangladesh shrimp aquaculture requires infusion of salt water into ponds which affects neighboring agriculture fields by reducing their productive capacity gujja and finger stich 1996 dewalt et al 1996 flaherty et al 1999 ali 2006 bournazel et al 2015 ilman et al 2016 saline water for shrimp farms is generally brought inland from marine or saline riverine sources to fill shrimp ponds ghers through natural and engineered channels during the high tide and salt water is blocked in during low tide after each cropping season water is pumped out to dry out ponds and refilled in with saline water before new season the saline water intrudes into nearby agricultural land both through natural percolation and overflow during heavy rainfall flooding therefore shrimp aquaculture lowers neighboring soil fertility through salinization which further leads to farmland conversion from paddy to shrimp ali 2006 afroz and alam 2013 making it a problematic form of maladaptation to the rising coastal salinity johnson et al 2016 bangladesh has no specific legal framework for shrimp farm management but existing laws on fisheries apply bangladesh has some sixteen major policies and regulations that protect fish land water and agricultural land however the regulations are applied to shrimp farming in an ad hoc manner afroz and alam 2013 for example the shrimp mohal management policy of 1992 promotes shrimp farming without considering environmental impacts such as the rise in soil salinity contradicting the national environment policy which bars salinization causing land uses hoq 2007 afroz and alam 2013 p 279 there is a broad literature that points to the many negative impacts of shrimp aquaculture e g paprocki and cons 2014 belton 2016 johnson et al 2016 unep 1999 using a cost benefit framework evaluates the public costs of shrimp farming due to agricultural yields reduction reclamation costs water pollution impacts on human health mangrove destruction and biodiversity losses and shows that these public costs are 21 30 higher than the profits from shrimp aquaculture a few studies have quantified the externality costs of shrimp aquaculture associated with mangrove clearance biodiversity and coastal land allocation barbier et al 2002 bhat and bhatta 2004 martinet and blanchard 2009 however very few studies have assessed the externality effects on paddy cultivation and the costs imposed on nearby land uses exceptions are be et al 1999 who show that aquaculture induced salinity has negative effects on paddy farming in the mekong delta of vietnam and umamaheswari et al 2009 who estimate that a 10 increase in shrimp farm associated salinity contributes to 0 6 reduction in paddy yields in south india there have been no previous studies in bangladesh on quantifying the external impacts of shrimp aquaculture on the soil salinity and agricultural profits in the farms located nearby evaluating these external impacts are important for designing policy for land use management in coastal bangladesh where soil salinity is on the rise the main objectives of this study are twofold the first is to examine changes over time in land use and soil salinity levels using satellite data and soil sample data from satkhira district in bangladesh the second is to measure the impact of shrimp aquaculture on soil salinity in neighboring paddy farms and evaluate how this in turn affects paddy farm profits using farm level data from paddy plots in the study area 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the study area of this research is from kaliganj upazila 22 4741 n 89 0562 e a sub district in satkhira district located in southwest coastal bangladesh fig 1 this study was conducted in satkhira district because coastal land use in the district is changing from agriculture to shrimp production with implications for mangroves salinity intrusion and social conflicts ali 2006 doe 2006 islam 2006 aman paddy traditional monsoon rice is cultivated in over a fifth of the land area of satkhira district bbs 2018 the study area is an almost level landscape crossed by interconnected tidal rivers and canals flooding during the monsoon season is common riverine flooding is aggravated by flooding of tidal canals connected to the main river system which impregnate both the top and subsoil with soluble salts soil salinity is an important agricultural issue as it can limit crop growth and arrest yields with varied effects depending on soil quality cultivation methods infestation etc clemont dauphin et al 2010 the soil resource development institute soil resource development institute srdi 2010 citing the brookers tropical soil manual 1991 suggests that low levels of soil salinity an ec range of 2 4 decisiemens per meter dsm 1 negatively affect very sensitive plants while higher ec ranges of 4 8 can have significant negative effects crop yields of different crops are influenced by different threshold salinity levels with yield reductions occurring in some crops at salinity levels lower than the generally accepted standard ec level of 4 soil resource development institute srdi 2010 potassium nitrate association pna 2018 table 1 depicts the major land characteristics of the study area the ph values indicate that the soils of satkhira district are mostly moderate to strongly alkaline with high ph values contributing to micronutrient deficiencies top soils have low organic matter om content indicating poor soil physical condition the soil cation exchange capacity cec is an indicator of finer texture and higher organic matter content as soils having cec below 15 0 moles of electrical charge m e are considered poor singaraval et al 1996 satkhira shows marginal levels of fine soil texture and organic matter haque 2006 along with rising soil salinity the salinity concentration in surface water in the study area has been increasing surface water salinity estimated by the iczmp 2003 in satkhira district to be on average 1 3 ds m 1 is predicted to be close to 2 3 ds m 1 by the end of 2030 seal and baten 2012 to be able to cultivate shrimp in ghers shrimp ponds the ph level in the water has to be in the range of 7 5 8 5 salinity in shrimp ponds in the study area generally ranges from 10 0 35 0 ds m 1 the salinity in river water varies based on the season remaining higher than 5 ds m 1 during the dry season soil resource development institute srdi 2010 2 2 sampling design and data collection 2 2 1 sampling design a multistage sampling design was used to collect data in 2016 in the first stage five villages from kaliganj upazila where paddy farms and commercial shrimp ponds are adjacent to each other were selected namely askerpur tetulia tarali nalta and varashimla in the next stage a shrimp pond cluster in each village was identified where paddy farms are in neighbourhood finally the sample was drawn from that cluster in each village this study uses three types of data soil salinity data satellite data and farm data from paddy farmers 2 2 2 soil salinity and satellite data in order to collect soil salinity data 10 geographic bands each at 10 meter aerial distance around each shrimp pond were drawn and soils data from the paddy fields within these bands were collected fig 2 a total of 241 soil samples were collected with the number of samples per site varying based on site geography and feasibility of data collection for example if there was a road that acted as a natural barrier to salinity penetration no further soil samples were collected beyond the road secondly if there was no agricultural land after a certain distance no data were collected the field samples were collected during the dry winter season january february of 2016 soil and water salinity vary throughout the year in bangladesh in the dry season between december june salinity is generally high while reaching its peak during june thereafter monsoon rainfall causes salinity to dilute from august to december habiba et al 2014 a hi 8033 portable conductivity tds meter and standard recommendations in the manual was used to measure salinity ec from the 241 field samples see hanna instuments 2019 the soils samples were analysed at the laboratory facilities of khulna university of engineering technology kuet details on the salinity distribution in each of the five sites are presented in the supporting maps fig a1 in appendix a the salinity maps are based on remote sensing data which in combination with geographic information systems and statistical methods can be used to predict soil salinity in the absence of detailed field soils data bouaziz et al 2011 morshed et al 2016 in addition the satellite data were also used to predict historical salinity landsat 7 etm images path 138 row 44 were collected from the united states geological survey for 6th january 2016 to match the time when field soil samples were gathered in addition images from 20th january 1990 path 138 and row 44 were collected to understand historical land use the satellite images were corrected for surface features and the data was converted recorded in digital number dn into reflectance the landsat image was corrected using the erdas model maker bouaziz et al 2011 to create salinity maps around each shrimp cluster thirteen salinity indicators from the 2016 landsat imagery were computed following morshed et al 2016 a stepwise regression to identify the combination of spectral bands that were best correlated with plot specific field soil salinity ec were used the regression analysis indicate that current field salinity is highly correlated with three satellite salinity indices infrared bands of the satellite image si2 nir r and savi 1 1 this is based on the regression with the highest r2 value low p and high akaike s information criterion aic value and low standard error at 5 percent significance level si 2 shows the intensity value of the image or soil indices high index value indicates high reflectance and high soil salinity nir r refers to ratio of near infrared nir and red bands the soil adjusted vegetation index savi was developed as a modification of the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi to correct for the influence of soil brightness when vegetative cover is low the savi is structured like the ndvi but with the addition of a soil brightness correction factor a combination of the three indices si2 nir r and savi from the 2016 satellite image predicts plot level soil salinity with 73 accuracy 2 2 salinity 12 53 1108 95 nir 2 73 nir r 717 86 si2 295 7 savi then homogenous bands of salinity around each of the five shrimp pond clusters were created using kriging interpolation a commonly used gis tool the correlation between 2016 plot level and satellite data was applied to the landsat data from 1990 to predict historical soil salinity fig 3 because the study examines a current cross section of satkhira district the purpose of the salinity maps of 1990 and 2016 is to make sure that the area was not saline prior to the arrival of shrimp ponds 2 2 3 farm data from paddy farmers a survey of 225 paddy farmers was undertaken to collect plot level data on farm inputs and output prices farm and household characteristics local leaders school teachers and farmers were contacted to identify all the farmers who cultivate paddy on plots located within the 10 m distance bands used for collecting soils data data from the selected farmers were collected through face to face interviews using a pre tested questionnaire first four enumerators were trained for two days on research objectives and the farm survey the enumerators then pre tested the questionnaire by randomly surveying ten farmers in the study area thereafter the survey questionnaire was finalized second an informative leaflet about the study was distributed among the farmers clarifying that data would be used for research only farmers were then contacted through their cell phones to identify a time for a face to face interview the human involvement during data collection of the project was approved while awarding the research project by the south asian network for environment and development economics sandee s research advisory committee in bangladesh paddy is cultivated in two seasons aman rain fed during august november and boro irrigated during december april data were collected from 150 farmers during the aman season and 75 farmers during the boro season since many farmers had more than one plot plot level farm data on a maximum of three plots per farmer was obtained the survey was conducted during december 2015 january 2016 aman and may 2016 boro because of missing observations the final dataset includes 316 plot level observations with 171 from aman plots and 145 boro plots the respective salinity levels of the aman and boro plots were estimated using the estimated equation 3 3 ibid 2 3 estimation of externality cost 2 3 1 theoretical model the theoretical model for examining the linkages among shrimp aquaculture soil salinity and paddy farm profits is based on vincent 2011 in this model the paddy farm production function is specified as follows 1 q f x e c where q is the quantity of paddy output x is a vector representing input quantities and ec is the environmental quality of land that is not under the control of paddy farmer in the context of this study ec represents soil salinity induced by shrimp pond in the neighbour the paddy farmer s objective is to maximize profit 2 m a x x p f x e c w x where p is the price of output and w is the vector of input prices solving the above profit maximizing problem yields the input demand function for each input j 3 x j g p w e c eq 1 shows that ec affects paddy output furthermore eq 3 shows that ec also affects the optimal quantity of inputs substituting the input demand functions eq 3 into the objective function in eq 2 yields the profit function 4 π π p w e c eq 4 shows that paddy farmer s profits depend on prices as well as shrimp pond induced soil salinity to capture the soil salinity induced by shrimp pond the salinity distance function is specified as follows 5 e c e c d where d denotes the distance between paddy plot and the nearest shrimp pond as saline water spreads through natural percolation paddy plots closest to shrimp ponds are likely to have more saline soils relative to paddy plots that are further away 2 3 2 econometric model this section specifies econometric model to estimate eqs 4 and 5 to estimate the effect of soil salinity on paddy profits the profit function given in eq 4 is specified as follows 6 l n π β 0 β 1 l n e c β 2 l n p r i c e β 3 a g e β 4 a g e 2 β 5 e d u β 6 s p β 7 l 2 β 8 l 3 β 9 l 4 β 10 l 5 ε in eq 6 ln denotes the natural logarithm and paddy farm profit π is measured in us dollars usd per hectare of land and is based on field data on farm output inputs and their prices farm profits are computed as revenue from the sale of the paddy crop minus labour costs non labour costs and fertilizer costs labour costs are the sum of the cost per hectare for land preparation weeding and harvesting non labour costs are the sum of seed fertilizer pesticide and irrigation costs fertilizer costs include costs incurred for urea potash and triple super phosphate tsp purchases ec represents plot level salinity identified through the salinity maps price is the market price of the output measured in usd per kg it reflects the market price associated with the most commonly grown paddy variety variation in output price across paddy farms is a result of differences in the time of harvest or location because there are no significant differences observed in the prices of different inputs in the district input prices were not considered as independent variables in specifying eq 6 several variables are used to control for differences in farm characteristics these include age age and the education level edu of the farmer age is used as a proxy for the managerial ability of the farmers profits are expected to increase with age up to a point and then may decrease education a proxy for human capital is expected to increase profits the scattered plot sp variable refers to whether the paddy plots of a farmer are together or separated this variable controls for the effect of plot specific characteristics on farm profit if the plots are scattered s p takes the value 1 and 0 for otherwise farmers with scattered plots are expected to have less profits as compared to those with joined plots because of the additional effort required in farm management eq 6 includes locational dummy variables varashimla l 1 is the reference site while tetulia l 2 tarali l 3 nalta l 4 and askerpur l 5 are included to control location specific unobservable factors such as elevation distance to the nearest sea or river and other factors to assess the impact of shrimp aquaculture on soil salinity in paddy plots the salinity distance function in eq 5 is specified as follows 7 l n e c α 0 α 1 d α 2 l 2 α 3 l 3 α 4 l 4 α 5 l 5 u where d denotes the distance between paddy plot and the nearest shrimp pond 2 3 3 estimation of econometric model and externality the effect of shrimp aquaculture on soil salinity in paddy plots is estimated using eq 7 where explanatory variable d is the distance between paddy plot and the nearest shrimp pond to estimate the effect of shrimp pond driven changes in soil salinity on paddy profits we estimate eq 6 by instrumental variable approach where eq 7 is used for instrumenting the soil salinity by using the distance as an instrument through this approach the part of the variation in soil salinity that is associated with the distance is used to estimate the effect of soil salinity on paddy profits thus this approach allows us to capture the effect of shrimp pond driven changes in soil salinity on paddy profits estimation of eq 6 by instrumental variable approach also addresses an econometric problem as soil salinity may be correlated with the error term which makes soil salinity an endogenous variable this endogeneity may be due to omitted variables to address this problem the distance is used as an instrumental variable for soil salinity to control for potential endogeneity thus eqs 6 and 7 are estimated simultaneously by an instrumental variable iv approach using a two stage least squares estimator eq 6 is specified as a log log functional form all variables in eq 6 are transformed into natural logarithm except the dummy variables age and edu the data show that all continuous variables in eq 6 have positive values making the logarithm transformation suitable furthermore when the dependent variable takes positive values the logarithm transformation ensures that the predicted values are always positive among the explanatory variables dummy variables cannot be transformed into logs furthermore variables that are measured in years such as age and education are expected to be used in their original form wooldridge 2013 p 193 eq 7 is specified as a log level functional form because salinity is likely to decrease asymptotically with increasing in distance distance is measured in meters furthermore for robustness checks the eqs 6 and 7 were also estimated using linear functional forms eqs 6 and 7 are estimated for both aman and boro paddy seasons separately since paddy profits and salinity level differ across seasons aman is cultivated during the monsoons and hence its profitability depends on rainfall changes in climate irregular rainfall and delays in the start of the season can affect crop yield rainfall also determines soil salinity it is to be noted that the soils are most saline at the start of the aman season and least saline at the beginning of the boro season further boro production in the summer depends on irrigation which can heavily dilute soil salinity the coefficient estimates of eqs 6 and 7 are used to compute the externality cost of a1 meter decrease in the distance between paddy plot and nearest shrimp pond as follows wooldridge 2013 8 e x t e r n a l i t y c o s t e β ˆ 1 α ˆ 1 1 100 where the externality cost is the reduction in percentage in the expected profit in paddy farm induced by a 1 meter decrease in the distance between the paddy plot and the nearest shrimp pond 3 results and discussion 3 0 1 land use and soil salinity changes over time land use has changed significantly in the study area over the last 25 years fig 3 shows changes in the study area based on the soil maps that were generated for 1990 and 2016 as the figure shows land under shrimp ponds increased significantly between 1990 and 2016 table 2 breaks down the evidence from the soil maps into percentage of land cover with different levels of salinity in 1990 22 of land area was covered by water shrimp cultivation and while in 2016 38 of the land cover is under water shrimp cultivation as the table 2 shows areas with salinity ec 4 increased by 11 while areas with very little salinity ec 1 decreased by 30 the gis and remote sensing based estimation of land use change are inline with the findings of parvin et al 2017 that shrimp farming has expanded by replacing paddy farming in the study area to further examine changes in soil salinity over time observed soil salinity based on field samples in 2016 is compared with predicted 1990 soil salinity accuracy 73 based on the soil salinity estimation within reasonable limits fig 4 shows that observed soil salinity in 2016 is higher than predicted historical salinity in 1990 in all 241 data points for which field samples were collected the study confirms previous findings on the increasing salinity trend in the coastal regions of bangladesh see for example soil resource development institute srdi 2010 afroz and alam 2013 johnson et al 2016 clearly salinity is higher now relative to the period when there were very few shrimp ponds however this does not conclusively prove that the salinity increase is due to the growth in shrimp ponds to confirm that shrimp ponds are the source of soil salinity soil salinity at varying distances from shrimp ponds were estimated from the kriging interpolation the data show that soil salinity increases as the distance from shrimp pond decreases table 3 in the next sub section the impact of shrimp ponds on the neighboring paddy plots is analysed using regression analysis 3 0 2 shrimp production soil salinity and farm profits table 4 presents summary statistics on variables included in the regression analyses the average profits across paddy types are usd 691 and 1029 per hectare in aman and boro seasons 4 4 1 usd 76 94 bangladeshi taka bdt as of 15 july 2016 respectively which are similar to profits reported by ahmed and haider 2014 usd 792 and 1057 per hectare in low and moderate saline prone unions of khulna district the market price for boro rice per kilogram is usd 0 33 which is higher than that for aman rice usd 0 27 these market prices are consistent with the literature usd 26 27 per kilogram haider and akter 2018 the average farmer in the sample has around seven years of schooling and is 44 year old therefore the sample of farmers is on average middle aged and has a relatively low level of schooling the average distance of paddy plots from shrimp ponds is 239 and 459 m for aman and boro plots respectively i e boro plots are approximately twice as far as aman plots from shrimp farms for the regression analysis distance is measured in meters as kilometer is too big a unit to communicate the effect of distance on salinity the data show that average salinity level is 2 3 and 1 61 ds m 1 in aman and boro season respectively the reason for the higher salinity level in the aman season relative to the boro season is because farmers irrigate heavily to dilute soil salinity in the boro season to examine the extent to which shrimp culture contributes to an increase in the level of salinity in paddy plots and its effect on farm profitability an instrumental variable iv regression model specified in eqs 6 and 7 was estimated and presented in table 5 fig 5 illustrates the results graphically panel a of table 5 presents estimates of the effect of distance between paddy plot and shrimp pond on plot specific salinity in the paddy plot in the aman model 1 and boro model 2 seasons as shown the estimated coefficient on the distance variable is negative and statistically significant at 1 level in both models the results suggest that if the distance between the paddy plot and nearest shrimp pond decreases by 1 meter paddy plot salinity is expected to increase by 0 14 in both seasons table 5 the negative sign of the coefficient shows that the salinity levels are higher in areas closer to shrimp ponds thus a 0 14 increase in salinity close to a shrimp pond is much higher in absolute value than a 0 14 increase in salinity in fields located further away showing a non linear relationship between distance and salinity levels in terms of changes in the actual levels of salinity a 1 meter decrease in distance increases paddy plot salinity levels on average by 0 0032 and 0 0023 ds m 1 in the aman and boro seasons respectively salinity increases in aman are higher than boro because boro season irrigation dilutes salinity panel b in table 5 reports the regression results of the effects of salinity on farm profits during the aman model 1 and boro model 2 seasons in both models there is a statistically significant 1 level and negative relationship between shrimp pond induced salinity and farm profits a 1 increase in shrimp pond induced salinity is associated with a 0 3 and 0 1 reduction in paddy profits in the aman and boro seasons respectively on average a 1 ds m 1 increase in the salinity level reduces paddy profit by usd 97 and 63 per hectare in the aman and boro seasons respectively as shown in table 5 most of the control variables such as market price dispersed plots age age squared and education levels of the respondents exhibit the expected signs most of the site specific dummy variables are statistically significant the r2 ranges from 58 to 78 thus a significant amount of the variation in salinity is explained by variables in the equation based on the coefficient estimates in table 5 and employing eq 8 a 1 meter decrease in the distance between the paddy plot and the nearest shrimp pond induces a reduction in the expected profit in paddy farms by 0 05 and 0 01 in aman and boro seasons respectively on average a 1 meter decrease in the distance between the paddy plot and the nearest shrimp pond reduces expected profit in paddy farms by usd 0 31 and 0 15 per hectare in the aman and boro seasons respectively this finding of external costs of shrimp aquaculture on paddy farms is consistent with the literature be et al 1999 umamaheswari et al 2009 ahmed and haider 2014 panel c in table 5 presents the results of diagnostic tests to check the validity of iv regression results the weak instrument test using cragg donald wald f test identifies whether the instrument distance is relevant the test results indicate that the instrument is not weak as the f statistic is much greater than the stock yogo critical value for a 10 maximal iv size stock and yogo 2002 the wu hausman f test baum et al 2015 is used to test for endogeneity of the variable salinity where the null hypothesis is that the variable is exogenous the test results show that the f statistic is statistically significant at the 5 level for the boro season however it is not statistically significant at the 5 level for the aman season thus the estimates of the model for the aman season using ordinary least squares ols show similar results to the instrumental variable estimation in table 5 finally for robustness checks the salinity and profit functions were estimated using a linear functional form i e without a logarithm transformation of any of the variables in eqs 6 and 7 table 6 presents marginal effect of distance on salinity and that of salinity on paddy profits for a linear model along with nonlinear model results reported in table 5 for comparison in the first stage based on the linear model it is found that a 1 meter decrease in distance increases salinity level by 0 0023 ds m 1 and 0 0020 ds m 1 in the aman and boro seasons respectively in the second stage a 1 ds m 1 increase in shrimp induced salinity is associated with a usd 123 and 50 reductions in profits per hectare in aman and boro seasons respectively this translates to a 1 meter decrease in distance decreasing paddy profits by usd 0 28 and 0 1 in aman and boro seasons respectively these results show that the estimated marginal effects on average are not too different in linear and nonlinear models 4 conclusions this study examines the changes over time in land use and soil salinity levels in the study area of kaliganj upazila in satkhira district in bangladesh it also evaluates the impact of shrimp aquaculture on soil salinity and profits in neighboring paddy farms satellite data show that the land covered by shrimp ponds as a percentage of land area increased from 22 in 1990 to 38 in 2016 in the study area soil salinity also increased significantly during the same time period thus both the landscape and soil quality of this coastal belt of bangladesh have seen considerable changes over the last two and half decades these quantitative results reinforce a commonly held perspective and growing concern that coastal bangladesh is becoming more saline study results based on soil samples collected around shrimp ponds in kaliganj indicate that salinity levels are relatively higher in paddy plots that are closer to shrimp ponds statistical analyses specifies that each additional 1 meter decrease in the distance between paddy plots and shrimp ponds induces a 0 14 increase in soil salinity in both aman rainfed and boro irrigated seasons higher salinity levels have an adverse effect on paddy profits with per hectare profits being relatively lower in paddy plots closer to shrimp ponds on average a 1 meter decrease in the distance between paddy plots and shrimp ponds leads to a decrease in paddy profits by usd 0 31 and 0 15 per hectare in the aman and boro seasons respectively these findings provide information on farm level changes in bangladesh and also contribute to a relatively small body of global evidence on the external economic costs of shrimp farming shrimp farming in bangladesh presents the case of a private business activity producing environmental changes in neighboring areas that may facilitate its own commercial expansion shrimp induced salinity increases make nearby paddy production less profitable thus the paddy farmland becomes cheaper for shrimp farmers to purchase for enlarging their own business operations which further contributes to the region s soil salinity the co production of shrimp and soil salinity needs to be addressed to tackle the challenges of increasing soil salinity in bangladesh the findings of this study call for careful policy measures and coastal planning to address the externality costs of shrimp aquaculture on neighboring lands declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

10581,in this paper we introduce a hydro economic modeling framework for the management of groundwater resources that are used for irrigated agricultural production the model mod at can be used to study the costs of aquifer depletion and the net benefits of specific aquifer management policies mod at is composed of three components namely an economic component a hydrologic component and an agronomic component a main goal of this paper is to introduce the hydro economic model and describe how it can be transferable to different contexts with this objective in mind we describe model components step by step so that the process of integration can be replicated easily we then apply the model to study the efficacy of a pumping tax in finney county kansas usa which overlies the high plains aquifer the results show that a pumping tax results in an increase in average well capacities in the county over time relative to the status quo which increases the average profitability of agricultural production however the increase in profitability is not uniform across producers and some producers gain more than others under the tax keywords hydro economic modeling ogallala high plains aquifer groundwater management policy analysis irrigation 1 introduction since the advent of pumping technology groundwater has supported agricultural production across the world in areas with and without significant surface water flows rodell et al 2018 the decline of aquifers along with changing climatic conditions has led to concerns about the sustainability of current irrigation practices local communities that rely heavily on groundwater fed agricultural production can be impacted by aquifer depletion almas et al 2004 this is compounded by the fact that aquifers replenish slowly if at all which implies a low threshold for overuse furthermore aquifers are common property resources that are shared among many producers that use groundwater for irrigation groundwater extraction by one user affects aquifer levels at neighboring wells affecting the productivity and profitability of the neighboring wells hydro economic models are important tools for studying the effectiveness of water management policies brown et al 2015 harou et al 2009 these integrated models haacker et al 2019 voinov and shugart 2013 attempt to leverage the strengths of both physical models and economic models to study the costs and benefits of different policies and associated changes in physical and climatic systems adamowicz et al 2019 an ideal hydro economic model for irrigation incorporates the water cycle crop water use and growth and the effect of incentives and externalities resulting from the interplay between the physical systems and producer irrigation decisions traditionally when addressing questions about the trends of aquifer depletion or the effectiveness of aquifer management policies each of the disciplinary literatures in hydrology agronomy and economics have made simplifying assumptions about the elements and parameters of the other models harou et al 2009 for example hydrologic based studies have attempted to calculate the remaining life of the aquifer based on historical patterns without regard to changing incentives from increased extraction costs or decreased well capacities fenichel et al 2016 scanlon et al 2012 steward et al 2013 these hydrologic models often assume that human impacts on fluxes are constant minimal or both they may not respond realistically to variability such as droughts during which farmers often reduce their irrigated acreage in addition to watering more intensely in areas that remain irrigated deines et al 2019 furthermore traditional hydrologic or hydro economic models do not operate at the producer level and units of decision making are often aggregated mulligan et al 2014 this simplification of the behavioral assumptions can result in over estimating or under estimating the rate of aquifer depletion on the other hand economic studies have focused on gains to management by simplifying the representation of hydrologic and agronomic systems in hydro economic modeling endeavors gisser and sánchez 1980 guilfoos et al 2016 simplifying assumptions on hydrological and agronomic processes can result in unrealistic estimates of crop water demand and yield response and incorrect spatial distributions of benefits and costs to producers brozović et al 2010 koundouri 2004 in this paper we introduce a hydro economic framework for irrigation modeling that integrates hydrologic agronomic and economic models named mod at the model integrates three elements that are critical for studying irrigation based agricultural systems a hydrological model modflow an agronomic model decision support system for agrotechnology transfer dssat and a custom economic decision making model the main utility of the mod at model is in how it can be used to empirically study how long term aquifer depletion and different management policies across space and over time affect producers profits mod at makes this possible by modeling changes in aquifer levels and well capacities for all the wells across the aquifer and modeling the effect of changing well capacities on irrigated profits this could allow one to observe declines in the predicted profitability of groundwater use over time as depletion reduces well capacities in addition to introducing the modeling framework we provide some results from model runs with and without a tax on groundwater use we also discuss the challenges that arise when developing such hydro economic models provide a discussion of the trade offs in the form of judgment calls for addressing them and discuss directions for future research we demonstrate our model for a case study of finney county in the southwest of kansas usa which overlies the high plains aquifer hpa however the framework is easily applicable to different study areas given the importance of the hpa for agricultural production in addition to our contributions to hydro economic model development the results from the illustrative case study are also of direct benefit to a wide range of stakeholders in a critical agricultural region within the united states this paper contributes to the hydro economic modeling literature haacker et al 2019 harou et al 2009 george et al 2011 das et al 2013 medellín azuara et al 2015 and more broadly to the integrated modeling literature such as housh et al 2015 by introducing a hydro economic model of groundwater use in agricultural regions that integrates three critical elements that are necessary for modeling an agricultural system namely an economic model of producer decision making at the parcel level a crop simulation model and a model of the physical groundwater system at a parcel level our parcel level production model along with a spatially explicit groundwater model allows us to study the spatial distribution of costs and benefits across groundwater users similar studies such as jaeger et al 2017 have used parcel level hydro economic models but have simplified agricultural producers irrigation decisions mod at includes a structural model of intra seasonal irrigation decision making that utilizes simulated agronomic production relationships generated using dssat as a result we believe that mod at is more suitable than other studies for studying groundwater management in irrigated agricultural regions furthermore groundwater depletion has become a major issue across many aquifers a major utility of hydro economic models is to provide insight into development and analysis of existing and new policies for managing aquifers however an impediment for the adoption of integrated hydro economic models has been the need for development of new software and programs bulatewicz et al 2010 moreover many hydro economic studies rely on very complex models that provide a black box feel they are difficult to fully understand and adapt to other use cases harou et al 2009 kahil et al 2016 voinov and shugart 2013 as a result a model that can easily be used in other contexts could be very important the model presented here uses three open source components i e modflow dssat and an economic model based on r language that are freely available across the world and can easily be modified for different contexts specifically modflow and dssat have been used in many different contexts for hydrological and agricultural analysis and the custom r code and the windows batch code is written by the authors and is publicly available on github https github com manirouhirad modssat the modular nature of mod at also provides the advantage of a high degree of confidence in each model element as they are produced by academics in the respective disciplines macewan et al 2017 the open source nature of our model is similar to that of dogan et al 2018 while they focus on large scale regional planning problems in california our model focuses on groundwater management in agricultural regions with parcel level decision making units 2 study area finney county in the southwest of kansas usa overlies the hpa fig 1 hpa is the largest freshwater aquifer in the world and is the main source of water supply for irrigated agriculture in the county finney county is one of the most intensely irrigated areas overlying the hpa over 25 of the county s area has been dedicated to irrigated agriculture since the 1970 s the most dominant cultivated crops on the irrigated acreage in the county are corn winter wheat and sorghum the hpa is the main source of water supply for irrigation some parcels along the arkansas river historically were irrigated by diverting water from the arkansas river fig 1 however due to lack of flow in the river the amount of groundwater extracted from the hpa increased substantially during the 1970 s whittemore 2012 subsequently saturated thickness levels started declining across the county fig 2 there are seven major soil types in our study area that differ in terms of their productivity table 1 these soil types cover more than 90 of the agricultural acreage in finney county the average annual temperature over the past 30 year period in finney county is 12 36 c while the average 30 year temperature on the high plains portion of kansas overall is 12 33 c average precipitation in the same period over the irrigated portion of ks was 509 mm while 30 year precipitation over the high plains portion of ks was 577 mm average saturated thickness in finney county between 1980 and 2017 was around 140 m over the same period average saturated thickness of the high plains portion of kansas was about 70 m 3 mod at to provide insight into the effects of groundwater conservation policies on producers profits in irrigated areas a hydro economic model for agricultural production is required this model must consist of three main system components a model of water balance and flux a model of plant growth and yield and a model of producer decision making these components i e hydrologic model crop model and economic model are often simulated using independent standalone models from different disciplines fig 3 a the mod at model integrates these elements to create an interactive model of water flow crop water use and irrigation decision making that incorporates the feedbacks between these models fig 3b this explicit integration is the strength of a hydro economic model provided that the conceptual assumptions of each sub model are compatible voinov and shugart 2013 for an integrated model to be effective each element of the model should be considered a valid model within its respective discipline however as mentioned earlier any single component is not enough for providing policy relevant analysis and studying the effects of long term changes such as climate change and aquifer depletion because of the sensitivity to dynamic factors in other parts of the system removing any of the components without proper replacement can result in unrealistic physical or policy outcomes we start by explaining the generation of crop production functions for different crops and under different management strategies we then describe the economic component of the model that includes producers objective function and decision space finally we discuss how these groundwater use decisions affect water levels across the aquifer by describing the hydrologic model 3 1 crop production component crop simulation models csm can be used for research information synthesis as tools for optimizing crop system management and for policy analyses boote et al 1996 these models are physically based models that often involve collections of empirical relationships that are coupled with water and nutrient budgets and can simulate the growth development and yield of a crop monteith 1996 along with the concomitant water cycle and nutrient dynamics csms make it easier for users to select a combination of management practices based on the input data available climatic and soil conditions and conventional water management techniques in mod at we use dssat hoogenboom et al 2017 jones et al 2003 which is one of the most widely used csms for evaluating agricultural management options thorp et al 2008 and for studying the impact of management strategies for different soil and climate conditions mcnider et al 2015 the dssat version 4 7 comprises models for more than 42 crops that simulate crop growth development and yield along with management strategies that involve irrigation fertilizer application crop rotations and others sharda et al 2019 the model calculates crop growth and simulates water and nutrient balance at a daily time step by simulating processes of soil water nutrient and plant growth along with developmental processes for the formation of final crop yield and yield components though dssat has seen wide adoption as a standalone model to study the impact of environmental modifications on crop production systems its application in conjunction with hydro economic models has been limited mcnider et al 2015 several studies have developed water production functions under different irrigation management scenarios to study alternate irrigation strategies araya et al 2018 2019 foster and brozović 2018 mitchel et al 2016 but these studies are limited in terms of their complexity in modeling hydro economic dynamic systems irrigation scenarios in dssat are developed for a unit area a representative hectare using a combination of the critical plant available water p a w c and irrigation frequency ifreq p a w c is the threshold where irrigation is triggered when plant available water in the soil root zone falls below this threshold kisekka et al 2016 each irrigation event can only start after the previous event has irrigated all irrigated acres and when there is enough well capacity ifreq is the minimum number of days between the start of two irrigation applications combinations of p a w c and ifreq determine the timing and duration of irrigation applied triggering irrigation at higher p a w c for a shorter ifreq can be beneficial during certain growth stages of a crop but might not be applicable during a different growth stage or for a different crop a declining well capacity affects ifreq unless the number of irrigated acres is reduced dssat produces water use and crop yield for a unit area a hectare as a result we simulate various combinations of p a w c and ifreq for three of the major crops in our study area namely corn sorghum and wheat to study the effect of changes in well capacity on irrigation and crop yield in order to study the effects of aquifer depletion and declining well capacities on crop yield and profitability in our crop simulations we capture a range of well capacities and irrigated acres by simulating all crop yields and water uses for each crop using combinations of p a w c 25 which means that irrigation is triggered when paw falls below 25 35 45 55 65 and 75 and ifreq of 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 and 24 days these combinations allow us to consider a range of groundwater availability and irrigation management that are consistent with groundwater availability and irrigation decisions in our study area we also consider rainfed production for each crop which does not depend on aquifer levels all dryland simulations and irrigated simulations for the aforementioned combinations of ifreq and p a w c are run for seven different soil types in our study area that are different in terms of their productivity table 1 soil data for crop production models are obtained from the ssurgo database the database includes specific details about soil characteristics such as field capacity wilting point and water content at saturation soil bulk density depth and texture which are required inputs for the dssat csm these soil types cover more than 90 of our study area for climate data for dssat simulations we use average air temperature height of temperature measurements height of wind measurements solar radiation maximum air temperature minimum air temperature precipitation dew point temperature wind velocity and photosynthetic active radiation from a station in finney county 39 n 100 w next we consider a producer s objective function based on the crop production model discussed in this section 3 2 economics component the economics component develops a model of an expected profit maximizing producer considering different irrigation decisions that are available to the producer to apply groundwater we assume that groundwater is the only source of water supply in the region the decision variables in our model include the choice of crops including irrigated and dryland crops acres of land allocated to each crop and p a w c there are several factors that can affect irrigation decisions and profits of a producer in mod at prices of crops costs of producing crops per acre excluding irrigation cost of applying a unit of groundwater climatic conditions and well capacity well capacity is the maximum flow rate that can be extracted from a groundwater well which can be sustained over a cropping season recent literature has shown the importance of having an adequate well capacity for sufficient irrigation supply and how limited well capacity can affect crop yields and profits foster et al 2015 rouhi rad et al 2020 as well as the sensitivity of hydro economic models to well capacity parameters hrozencik et al 2017 we incorporate well capacity as a factor affecting irrigation decisions through its effect on productivity rouhi rad et al 2020 to better study the costs of aquifer depletion and benefits of aquifer management policies a representative producer determines the number of acres and p a w c allocated to each of the n irrigated crops and m dryland crops to maximize the expected profits 1 m a x e π e c l i m a t e i 1 n a i p i f i w i p a w c i i f r e q a a f a l l o w j n 1 n m a j q c l i m a t e s o i l c w i i i j n 1 n m a j p j f j c l i m a t e

the fixed costs per acre and c is the cost of pumping per unit of groundwater that is independent of crop type but can vary with depth to groundwater f i is the production function for an irrigated crop i that generates crop yield as a function of the irrigation to crop i w i irrigation frequency ifreq seasonal climatic variables such as rainfall parcel level characteristics such as soil type and well capacity q w i itself is a function of p a w c i as an increase in p a w c i would result in increases in irrigation the expectation is over the distribution of climatic variables with equal weight assigned to each historical year while most studies within the economics literature consider irrigation as the main decision variable within a stochastic framework in practice irrigation decisions are often made by setting soil moisture targets without perfect foresight about the realization of the weather foster and brozović 2018 it is thus important to consider profit maximizing irrigation decisions that are based on the choice of p a w c with a higher p a w c water application is triggered more frequently during the growing season resulting in greater seasonal irrigation use on the other hand a lower p a w c can decrease crop yield and increase the probability of crop loss well capacity q affects crop yield by affecting the rate that the center pivot system can rotate while applying a given depth of water as a result we use ifreq which is a function of irrigated acres and q as the mechanism through which well capacity affects crop yield the relationship between well capacity irrigation depth ifreq and irrigated acres is given by the following equation 2 i r r i g a t e d a c r e s i r r i g a t i o n d e p t h i f r e q w e l l c a p a c i t y the left hand side of equation 2 is the volume of groundwater applied in terms of area and irrigation depth while the right hand side of the equation shows the volume of groundwater applied in terms of well capacity and the minimum number of days between the start of two irrigation applications in mod at irrigation depth is assumed to be around 25 mm 1 inch because at lower irrigation depths the amount of water absorbed by the crop decreases due to surface runoff holding irrigation depth fixed at 25 mm and taking well capacity and irrigation efficiency as given ifreq and irrigated acres are the factors that can vary to increase crop water availability more specifically a producer can decrease the number of irrigated acres to increase ifreq so that the acres irrigated are irrigated more frequently than if the entire field was irrigated the functional form of equation 2 introduces a trade off between irrigating an additional acre and increasing expected crop yield per acre irrigating one more acre increases i f r e q per acre this means that on average crop yields may be lower for each of the acres irrigated moreover under higher ifreq s crop yield will be more sensitive to variation in annual weather conditions when used within a hydro economic framework the model considers different sources of heterogeneity in physical characteristics of fields including heterogeneity in soil types and well capacity across space and over time while producers start with different well capacities groundwater extraction across space and over time can result in further variation in well capacity across producers in numerically estimating profit maximizing levels of the decision variables in eq 2 a custom r script was written hereafter r code 0 in this script a producer is assumed to irrigate 130 acres which is the typical size of a quarter section center pivot system the smallest unit of decision making in a parcel is a quarter circle 32 5 acres traversed by a typical pivot we divide each parcel into four quarter circles where each quarter circle can have a unique crop planted each year for every well with a given soil type and well capacity based on the prices of each crop and costs of production and irrigation we estimate the following first for each quarter circle we estimate the expected profit for each crop and p a w c we then find the crop p a w c combination that maximizes the expected profit in every quarter circle the sum of irrigation across the four quarter circles determines the field level irrigation volume while the sum of the expected profit across these quarters determines the field level expected profit note that given the non linear effect of well capacity on expected profits for each crop in each quarter circle it is possible that different quarter circles will have different crops planted this nonlinearity results in adjustments in irrigated acres that are different than the one imposed by historical conditions howitt 2005 after the planting and p a w c decisions have been made during the season daily weather outcomes will be realized in our case this is implemented as one of the weather years in the historical weather data the producer then initiates an irrigation event every time paw reaches p a w c and when there is enough well capacity in the next section we describe the elements of the groundwater model that is used for modeling the spatial and temporal variations in groundwater aquifer levels 3 3 hydrology component the groundwater component in mod at is simulated using modflow one of the most widely used groundwater simulation frameworks modflow is a free numerical model developed by the usgs in the 1980 s it utilizes the finite difference technique to solve the groundwater flow equation in three dimensions modflow has a modular structure which enables users to select its different components packages based on their objectives such modular structure facilitates model construction and optimizes execution time all models are simplified versions of reality in modflow the simplifications depend on model packages in other words the choice of packages determines the complexity of the behavior that can be represented our groundwater model builds on the kgs modflow for hpa region in southwest kansas liu et al 2010 while we focus on finney county the kgs modflow model covers parts or all of 23 counties in southwest kansas 3 counties in southeast colorado and 3 counties in the oklahoma panhandle the model is a single layer model and its uniform and equally spaced cells are 1 1 mile in size the model grid consists of 100 rows and 150 columns resulting in 15 000 individual cells of which 12 083 cells are active thus it covers approximately an area of 31 300 square kilometers three different boundary conditions are considered in this model by using the flow and head boundary fhb package a time variant specified head boundary condition is defined for the northern and southern edges of the model domain and a portion of the edges along the bedrock outcrops for the eastern and western edges of the model time variant specified flux is considered as the boundary condition remaining edges along the bedrock outcrop regions are defined as time invariant specified head cells to simulate irrigation events the model uses the well wel package there are 17 711 wells in the southwestern kansas portion of the kgs modflow model of which 1629 irrigation wells are in finney county we locate all irrigation wells in the county again to be able to join them to croplands for field level simulations given the size of cells in the model often more than one well resides in a cell in that case the pumping rate is summed across the wells in a cell to determine the extraction rate for the cell the model utilizes the recharge rch package to simulate recharge from precipitation and irrigation events the stream str package simulates the groundwater surface water intercations along the streams and executes stream flow routing calculations finally to model the evapotranspiration in the main riparian regions e g the arkansas river alluvium the evapotranspiration evt package is used in modflow a stress period is a set duration during which all external factors such as pumping recharge river stage etc can affect groundwater flow movement and or change the amount of water in storage are held constant the kgs modflow model is constructed based on annual stress periods i e it assumes all stresses like pumping and recharge remain constant throughout a year and updates them at the beginning of each year in the kgs modflow model the historical simulation is divided into two main periods of predevelopment 1944 1946 and postdevelopment 1947 2007 a steady state model simulates the predevelopment period to approximate groundwater levels prior to the development of groundwater resources in the region the steady state model provides initial conditions for the postdevelopment period which is simulated by a transient model in this model aquifer hydraulic conductivity aquifer specific yield streambed hydraulic conductivity and recharge are considered as the parameters to be calibrated during the historical period by comparing simulated variables such as groundwater table and stream flow to actual measurements through a trial and error process to facilitate the calibration process of the kgs modflow model pest which is a parameter estimation software doherty 2007 is employed to optimize the model parameters annual pumping at a given well is then distributed evenly throughout the days of the agricultural season which is 123 days may 1 aug 31 so far in sections 3 1 3 3 we have described the components of the mod at model in the next section we describe the mechanics of integration in this model and how these components are linked 3 4 integration the integrated model mod at works by first coupling the crop production model section 3 1 and the economic model section 3 2 the model then couples the generated outcomes of the economic crop model with the hydrology model section 3 3 the crop simulation model dssat generates output pairs in the form of seasonal water use and harvested crop yield for each irrigation management strategy i e ifreq and p a w c for each of the crops for each year that we have weather data as a result a distribution of profits can be generated from irrigation quantity and crop yields furthermore a distribution of maximum profits for each irrigation strategy and weather year can be generated from eq 1 these outputs can be summarized in the form of a lookup table using the lookup table means that for an n year model we only need to run the profit maximization problem explained in section 3 2 once for each well capacity and each soil type to generate the lookup table which is then used in every year of the simulation the lookup table however imposes the behavioral assumption that the expected profit maximizing producer makes part of the irrigation decision at the beginning of the season and part of the irrigation decision during the irrigation season specifically the producer decides the number of acres and the p a w c allocated to each crop based on the historical distribution of weather variables in this case a 30 year period from 1980 to 2009 at the beginning of the season during the season when weather is realized the producer irrigates the field based on the chosen p a w c the total seasonal irrigation amount therefore varies from year to year based on weather the lookup table includes outcomes for every year for which the historical data are available as a result it also allows us to generate realizations of groundwater application and crop yields for any given year specifically the lookup table includes profit maximizing p a w c crop choice crop yield and profit for each year of the historical data it is worth noting that while in reality a producer can operate multiple wells or parcels in the analysis that is done for this representation of the mod at model we assume that each producer operates one well which is tied to one 130 acre parcel which is the size of a typical quarter section center pivot irrigation system across the high plains aquifer 1 1 as a result we use parcel well and producer interchangeably throughout the manuscript furthermore while in theory it is possible to irrigate any portion of the parcel we limit the analysis to 4 quarter circles of 32 5 acres in other words the unit of decision making for a farmer is a quarter of their circle finally the model can be simulated for any number of years however in this analysis we use a baseline of 11 years 1997 2007 where the data for both dssat and modflow exists the 50 year simulation repeats the 11 year weather data while aquifer levels change in response to groundwater extraction it is easy to see that the analysis can be expanded to different situations and decision making units and none of the points mentioned here are a limitation of the mod at model mechanically a windows batch code bat file was written that connects the elements of the model in year 0 the batch code first runs the economics r code 0 that generates the lookup table the r code 0 reads in the outputs of dssat model runs and produces profit maximizing outputs lookup table then in year 1 the batch code runs a second r code based on the weather that is realized in that year and selects from the lookup table parcel level water use and profits water use decisions from this economic model are the inputs to the hydrologic model the batch code runs the modflow model which generates groundwater head levels at every well well capacity which is an input to the economics model is then estimated based on the changes in saturated thickness in every cell of the aquifer the batch code repeats this process for t 2 n it is worth noting that in r code 0 we simulated a limited number of ifreq s section 3 2 we then linearly interpolated between these discrete values to generate production functions for each value of ifreq also running modflow within a loop for years t 2 n requires that a new model is run for each water year using the previous year s water table elevation as an initial condition because the modflow well package is not easily updated during a model run as this simple explanation shows a major appeal of the mod at model is the simplicity of the replication it only needs windows dssat modflow and r dssat and modflow are calibrated for different crops and regions respectively the custom r code can easily be modified for different regions all three components of the model i e dssat modflow and r are freely available to the public 4 results and discussion in this section we provide some results that showcase the output of the mod at model we first discuss the integration of the crop production model and economic model together these two generate a profit maximizing producer s irrigation decisions we then discuss the integration of these decisions with the groundwater hydrology model 4 1 producer decision making as discussed in section 3 a producer makes irrigation decisions in two steps at the beginning of a growing season the producer determines the number of acres to irrigate which crop to plant on each quarter circle 32 5 acres and the p a w c allocated to that crop and quarter circle given well capacity to make these decisions the producer considers the distribution of crop yields and irrigation demand for each crop ifreq and paw fig 4 shows the distribution of crop yields for different ifreq s for the richfield silt loam soil type compared to the rest of the soils in the county this soil type has a relatively higher water holding capacity limited water availability especially during the critical stages of a growing season can significantly affect crop yield when ifreq is higher i e when it takes longer for the center pivot system to irrigate a field and each acre is irrigated less frequently crop yield is very sensitive to variations in annual weather conditions and on average crop yields will be lower on a fixed number of irrigated acres this is shown in fig 4 where lower ifreq s for all three crops corn sorghum and wheat increase average crop yield and reduce the variance of the crop yield distribution also dryland crops show the lowest average and greatest variance in crop yield for all three crops keeping the number of irrigated acres fixed as well capacity declines ifreq increases eq 2 the figure shows that declining well capacities can result in decreased crop yields on average and increased production risk during wet years crop yield is not very sensitive to an increase in ifreq as shown by the upper bound of crop yields 2 2 it is also worth mentioning that ill timed rainfall events may affect crop yields for example large rainfall events near maturity can cause more harm than good however during dry years crop yield is increasingly sensitive to changes in ifreq as shown by the lower bound of crop yield one potential way that a producer can reduce the effects of limited well capacity is by applying more water most studies within the economics literature consider irrigation as the main decision variable within a stochastic framework however in practice irrigation decisions are often made by setting a soil moisture target p a w c without perfect foresight about the realization of the weather foster and brozović 2018 with a higher p a w c water application is triggered more frequently during the growing season kisekka et al 2016 resulting in greater water use on the other hand a lower p a w c can decrease crop yield and increase the probability of crop loss this is shown in fig 5 where expected yields for all three crops are higher under higher p a w c however crop yields seem to be less sensitive to the choice of p a w c compared to the ifreq values this suggests that increasing p a w c alone cannot substitute for reductions in well capacities over time and adjustments of other margins e g reducing irrigated acres is required rouhi rad et al 2020 a p a w c of 50 is often considered as a practical pawc for irrigation klocke et al 2011 here we find that adjusting p a w c could also be one way that a producer can mitigate the costs of aquifer depletion given the distribution of crop yields and water use for different crops ifreq s and p a w c a producer with a given well capacity determines the number of irrigated acres which crops to grow and p a w c from eq 2 fig 6 shows the expected profit maximizing number of acres irrigated expected seasonal irrigation and the expected profit for each 130 acre irrigated field the tabular results are also shown in table 2 the results show that as well capacity declines the profit maximizing producer does not keep irrigated acres fixed and reduces their irrigated acres to be able to keep greater irrigation frequency ifreq on the acres irrigated decreasing irrigated acres reduces demand for groundwater the decline in well capacity also results in a loss of profit for the producer however if the producer does not adjust irrigated acres the loss of profit could be even greater for the richfield silt loam we observe two critical well capacities first we see a decline in the profitability of production as well capacity declines below 600 gpm as the producer decreases groundwater application per acre above 600 gpm declining in well capacity do not significantly affect producer profits as well capacity further declines below 300 gpm the producer reduces the number of irrigated acres this is also where we start to see significant declines in profitability 4 2 integrated model results when integrated with the modflow model the coupled economic crop model can generate aquifer levels well capacities and profits for each well across the aquifer and over time we can also study the benefits generated by groundwater management policies to producers an example of the results of such analysis is shown in figs 7 and 8 each well in the study area has a unique soil type and a unique starting well capacity as aquifer levels at a well change well capacities for that well change and the producer responds by adjusting their irrigation decisions as discussed in section 4 1 a groundwater management policy such as a pumping tax can incentivize profit maximizing producers to reduce their groundwater extraction which can result in higher relative well capacities over time fig 7 shows the decline in average well capacity for wells within finney county under the status quo of no policy and with a pumping tax of 2 per acre inch taxing groundwater use within the county results in a relative increase in average well capacities over time this is due to the slower rate of aquifer depletion as a result of the tax however the increase in average well capacities from the pumping tax is relatively small thus we may expect small changes in profit as a result of the tax fig 8 shows the spatial distribution of undiscounted changes in profitability from the pumping tax the figure shows that while overall the pumping tax increases the profitability of agricultural production the benefits of the policy are not uniformly distributed and some wells experience losses in profitability from the tax the benefits of the policy are higher for producers in the northern part of the county while the goal of this paper is to showcase the value of the mod at model and not to do detailed policy analysis such spatial and temporal analyses of the benefits can help policymakers understand the benefits of different aquifer management policies these results are important for understanding the distributional effects of different policies and to better identify the winners and losers of the policies as the equity impacts of policies gain more attention from policymakers models such as mod at can become increasingly important it is also possible to consider the impacts of other policies such as groundwater quotas with the mod at model in the next section we briefly discuss some of the important elements when building a hydro economic model 5 discussion and conclusion the mod at model developed and described in this study makes it possible to study the costs of long term aquifer depletion and the effects of groundwater management and other agricultural policies it also allows policymakers to understand the spatial distribution of costs and benefits associated with different groundwater management policies each of the components considered in mod at are important for policy analysis removing the hydrological element would be similar to considering simplified hydrological models such as the bathtub aquifer model which assumes water levels change simultaneously for all locations across an aquifer brozović et al 2010 without the hydrological model and based on simplifying assumptions one can analyze the irrigation decisions of a single isolated producer foster et al 2017 however a model of a single producer cannot accurately estimate changes in aquifer levels and irrigation decisions for an entire aquifer where extraction from one well affects groundwater levels at neighboring wells since the effectiveness of a policy depends on the changes in groundwater levels and responsiveness elasticity of groundwater demand among neighboring wells to changes in their groundwater levels manning and suter 2019 ignoring the groundwater model can result in overestimation or underestimation of the policy benefits removing the crop production model means assuming a fixed amount of water applied per acre or fixed crop yield per acre brinegar and ward 2009 fenichel et al 2016 this assumption can result in unrealistic or lack of adjustments in response to changes in water availability for example the model may produce the same number of acres irrigated or the same amount of water applied alternatively the relationship between aquifer water level characteristics or policy variables with well level groundwater use may be estimated using statistical techniques and historical land and water use decisions claassen et al 2017 while this statistical method can be very accurate in estimating mentioned relationships it may not be accurate in extrapolating beyond observed values this especially becomes important when analyzing the effects of a policy where one needs to create counterfactual worlds with and without the policy crop models that include different margins of adjustment can be particularly helpful for studying the effectiveness of different policies ex ante for example these models can help to identify whether the constraints associated with lower well capacities can be mitigated by applying more groundwater by setting higher soil moisture targets our results suggest that this is probably not the case finally crop models can also be important for estimating the effects of climate change as the choice of crops may change over time due to changes in climatic conditions the economics model adds a decision maker to the model without a unit of decision making the model cannot respond to changes to the system this lack of response to incentives often means assuming a constant amount of water use over time or ignoring the available margins that a profit maximizing producer would consider either of these assumptions would result in over estimating rates and costs of aquifer depletion moreover aquifer management policies are often designed to address specific challenges these issues may be different from one aquifer to another for example while groundwater scarcity and long term aquifer depletion may be bigger concerns in one aquifer spatial externalities from groundwater extraction may be the major concern in another aquifer another issue often faced is stream depletion due to groundwater extraction which requires policies that incentivize the reallocation of groundwater extraction away from the river these problems often require different solutions thus it is important to understand the economic incentives behind the problem at hand in order to propose solutions economics can also be useful for comparing different policies each policy involves trade offs in terms of costs and benefits across space and over time since the impacts and fairness of different policies are important policy considerations it is important to understand the costs benefits and distribution of different policies model calibration and sensitivity are also important aspects to consider for linked models doherty 2007 voinov and shugart 2013 when parameters from several systems are included in an integrated framework it becomes more difficult to assess which inputs and parameters are driving the model results in addition when parameters are changed during calibration to fit a validation dataset they can mask the influence of parameters that are not included in the model or inadvertently overfit with measurement noise registered as a signal which diminishes the power of the model to fit out of sample measurements this uncertainty can propagate between systems in integrated models the software pest parameter estimation doherty 2015 is one example of a program that includes methods for model calibration and sensitivity analysis and is not model specific 3 3 pest is available for free from www pesthomepage org all models but particularly integrated models should include methodology for their calibration and sensitivity in their documentation and researchers should consider using a formal framework like pest to evaluate these important aspects of model rigor in developing an integrated modeling framework to study groundwater management there are a number of judgment calls and assumptions that modelers must make an understanding of the potential trade offs associated with these modeling choices and justifications for the assumptions made for mod at provides some insights for future hydro economic model development 4 4 a more detailed description of these judgment calls is provided in the appendix for example when developing a hydro economic model it is important to minimize the effects of outcomes that take place outside the spatial boundary of the model aquifer boundaries provide a reasonable boundary for the hydro economic model assumptions and judgement calls specific to the physical system and climate outcomes are also important when studying the effectiveness of groundwater management policies over the long term groundwater level changes within a growing season may not be very important in such a situation assuming one stress period may be enough in addition there is often significant heterogeneity in soil types in a given region for example there are seven major soil types in finney county these soils however do not change significantly over time on the other hand climatic variables are relatively stable in small geographic regions but change over time thus it is critical to consider the major soil types in the region and changes in climate over time the assumptions related to how agricultural producers behave and how they cope with changes in policy or economic conditions represent critical judgement calls for example as well capacities decline the model must consider how producers adjust critical plant available water thresholds as part of a management strategy assumptions related to the timing of irrigation decisions are also important in practice crops are planted at the beginning of the season while irrigation applications take place during the season our modeling framework assumes that decisions related to the critical plant available water threshold takes place at the beginning of the season when the farmer does not have perfect information about the weather during the growing season this threshold then drives irrigation decisions throughout the season in response to weather realizations additionally producers may form expectations based on different historical periods for example whether they consider a 30 year history of seasonal weather as we assume or a shorter period such as the past 10 years could affect their irrigation decisions and as a result the effectiveness of a groundwater management policy the assumed risk preferences of producers can also affect the results of the policy analysis under well developed markets assuming a risk neutral farmer is reasonable antle and capalbo 2001 and serves to provide initial insights regarding the effectiveness of the policies the sensitivity of the results to these assumptions should be considered in future analysis mod at also has a few limitations that could be improved upon in future modeling efforts first interactions among producers who share a groundwater aquifer could be better represented in future studies from the hydrological modeling point of view groundwater models often rely on large cell sizes that include multiple wells though this aggregation simplifies the computational process it may also result in ignoring some of the spatial interactions that exist in practice among neighboring producers furthermore from an economic point of view these studies often focus on farm level decision making however studies such as pfeiffer and lin 2012 have shown the importance of spatial interactions for groundwater extraction decisions these behavioral responses along with better hydrological modeling can provide better insights on the effectiveness of different policies a global optimum or the first best solution is often difficult to achieve under current models due to the computational costs of the estimation the issue is that aquifer level at each well in the study area is a separate state variable which results in the curse of dimensionality furthermore the non convexity of the problem can also affect the chances of achieving the optimal solution future models with increased computational power can focus on estimating first best solutions as they can provide policymakers with an upper bound of what is possible groundwater resources not only include values for production but they may also generate other values that are not fully captured by the profit maximization process for example producers may also care about the bequest value of groundwater and its availability for future generations suter et al 2020 hydro economic models of groundwater management often ignore such values and only consider production profits future studies could incorporate non market and non use values that affect groundwater use in hydro economic models finally in this paper we have not considered the interaction between surface water and groundwater the incorporation of swat modflow bailey et al 2016 a linked surface and groundwater model will enable a more holistic approach to impacts to the water cycle due to agriculture whether mediated by withdrawals or changes in precipitation partitioning runoff and recharge declaration of interest none appendix a judgment calls judgment call 1 locating the integrated model in space neither the typical crop model nor the typical economic model is specifically rooted in any single location crop models are generally one dimensional and the modeling unit is assumed to have uniform properties economics models often work at the field level for example a producer decides how many acres of a given field they should irrigate hydrologic models on the other hand rely on the spatial characteristics of large physical systems and one of their primary purposes is the calculation of flux from one location to another within the model area this means that the definition of the system in space becomes very important hydro economic models of groundwater management are often implemented within administrative or watershed boundaries bulatewicz et al 2010 regional groundwater flow may not respect such boundaries functionally it means that boundary conditions must be chosen preferably in a location where the other side of the boundary has as little influence as possible on the model outcome for groundwater this is often a river a hydraulic barrier or a geologically defined aquifer boundary like bedrock outcrop a geologic barrier vertical layering may be more difficult to characterize and large scale regional models are often constructed with a single layer representing the effective characteristics of various hydrogeological units that are subsumed within that layer rossman and zlotnik 2013 it is best if the model boundaries are chosen such that the field where irrigation decisions are made are close to the center of the hydrologic model to avoid controlling effects of boundary conditions as they can confound the effects of changes in water availability in the case of the mod at example presented here the boundary conditions are chosen to be the edge of the aquifer materials where possible with an erosional feature that cuts through the aquifer to the bedrock groundwater flux on one side of this boundary is completely independent of the water table on the other side of the ravine in some edges of the model there are no such clear features but boundaries are selected in areas where the model includes changing head boundary conditions over time to try to diminish edge effects this constraint in model boundary selection may make it difficult to predict water levels far into the future since it relies on well measurements to characterize these boundaries judgment call 2 temporal discretization groundwater moves slowly and so hydrologic models tend to have longer timesteps than other models a balance of stress periods is required to compromise between model simplicity and correctness crop models keep track of soil moisture and therefore are sensitive to pumping on a daily time step the danger is in enabling the crop to be watered more frequently than a pivot arm would physically be able to get around the field hydrologic models are more likely to assume constant pumping over the entire growing season so that the growing season can be simulated with a single stress period this may not adequately describe the system from the point of view of the crop and economic components of an integrated model for example some coping strategies might involve planting different irrigated crops at different times of the year so that limited capacity can be used over a longer portion of the growing season however adding such details within a growing season can increase the uncertainty of the model as no model can exactly model the planting days or the days in which irrigation takes place accurately moreover even if such decisions can be modeled their effect on groundwater flow over long time period that are relevant for policy is relatively small for example the effect of irrigating once a week at a given volume and irrigating every day at one seventh of that volume is relatively small at the beginning of the next irrigation season as a result we assume a single stress period for each year judgment call 3 irrigation management strategies different irrigation management strategies can be used to reduce water use or to increase crop yield in mod at we consider p a w c ifreq choice of crops and irrigated acres while there are many other ways to reduce water use these decisions depend on the context for example reducing irrigation depth below 25 mm is not often observed in our study region as a result we assume irrigation depth to be fixed we also note that there are other strategies that may not seem to affect irrigation directly but they can still affect water use examples of such management strategies include changing the planting density of seeds per acre or changing planting and harvest dates these strategies can especially become important under a changing climate in the current version of mo at we do not consider these decisions and we only consider changes in the combination of crops irrigated acres and amount of irrigation applied per acre while it is expected that adding more irrigation and planting decisions can result in lower costs of aquifer depletion and aquifer management policies because producers can respond by changing multiple decisions future studies can study the importance and extent of decisions such as changing planting density for adaptation to declining aquifer levels judgment call 4 which crops to grow a range of crops can be considered for production when it comes to the choice of crops to be considered by the integrated model the objectives of the study are important if the goal is to determine the effectiveness of different policies to reduce water use in the short run it is better to rely on existing crops within the region however if the goals of the policy are to manage water use in the long run we need to consider different crops that can become profitable under different conditions not considering such crops in the decision space can result in over estimating the costs of aquifer depletion furthermore to correctly capture the costs and benefits of producing different crops we need to consider how a producer makes irrigation decisions under uncertainty to do so we need to capture the distribution of crop yields under different weather conditions in this study we use 30 years of historic weather data from 1980 to 2009 to capture the observed long term variability noted in the recent history for three of the major crops in the study area i e corn sorghum and wheat future research could focus on better understanding the distribution of climatic variables that producers consider when making irrigation decisions if producers consider a shorter period of historical weather outcomes this can potentially bias the results generated with the entire range of historical weather outcomes e g the 30 year period considered in this study if the recent weather outcomes are different from the historical weather judgment call 5 heterogeneity of climatic variables across the study area and over time this judgment call is related to both data availability and the importance of heterogeneity of different variables across space and over time crop production models such as dssat often require high quality weather and soils data to simulate daily crop growth modeled climate data such as those generated by the prism group prism 2019 do not include the variables that are needed for the agronomic models as a result the spatial heterogeneity in the effect of climatic variables is limited by the availability of station data furthermore often climate does not vary significantly across a small study area such as the one considered in this paper as a result when the study area is relatively small one can assume a homogeneous climate across the study area however climate does change over time and considering the temporal change in climate could be important for studying trends of aquifer depletion over the long term on the other hand even in small areas biophysical characteristics such as soil type tend to be more heterogeneous these factors often vary at local scales but less so over time and can have important implications for crops water use and productivity for example water holding capacity can vary substantially across soil types which can affect irrigation decisions and crop choice in the analysis in this paper we used seven different soil types that cover more than 90 of the area of finney county however we used climate data only for one weather station within the county judgment call 6 risk preferences of the producers our model assumes a risk neutral producer who is interested in short term gains i e a myopic producer groundwater is a common property resource where property rights for the resource are usually not well defined the groundwater economics literature suggests that under such circumstances the assumption of a myopic producer is reasonable knapp and olson 1995 koundouri 2004 furthermore while there are uncertainties involved in agricultural production conventionally most models assume a risk neutral producer and those that assume risk aversion often find small changes in the value of groundwater management koundouri 2004 uncertainty in weather and surface water availability can be included in the model of irrigation decision making without necessarily considering risk averse producers for example in studying the buffer value of an aquifer tsur and graham tomasi 1991 consider uncertainty independent of risk aversion they show that compared to the deterministic case under uncertainty even when producers are risk neutral groundwater is more valuable in buffering against variations in rainfall this is explained by jensen s inequality for nonlinear functions a function of the mean is different from the mean of the function thus while we can relax risk aversion estimating crop yield and profits for mean climatic variables such as temperature and precipitation results in a biased demand for water crop yields and profits fig a1 furthermore the model of a risk neutral producer may sometimes provide more insight as it reduces the need for strong assumptions regarding the functional form and parameters of risk preferences we also assume constant returns to scale production in irrigated and dryland acres constant returns to scale assumptions mean that land quality is homogeneous for a given parcel more specifically if y is crop yield for an acre of irrigated production adding a irrigated acres would increase harvestable crop biomass by a y while there is often heterogeneity in local land characteristics traditionally within field physical characteristics has been assumed to be homogeneous it is unlike that the profit maximization results are sensitive to such small scale heterogeneity though future research could further explore this sensitivity judgment call 7 timing of irrigation decisions in a growing season another important behavioral assumption is the timing of irrigation decisions one can model certain day to day irrigation decisions however modeling at such fine scales may result in an inaccurate modeling of the decision making process as a result we assume that the producer decides on an irrigation rule ex ante but the amount applied is responsive to weather at the beginning of a growing season a producer makes decisions regarding which crops to grow and acres of land allocated to each crop we also assume that the producer simultaneously determines the p a w c determining p a w c at the beginning of the season creates a trade off on the one hand it assumes that farmers commit to a certain p a w c for each crop at the beginning of the season only adjusting groundwater application based on the weather in that year on the other hand it relaxes the assumption that farmers have perfect foresight about the weather and are willing to adapt their irrigation practices based on field requirements foster and brozović 2018 we believe that correctly capturing the behavioral responses to available weather information is important for reliability of the results however future research can further explore the sensitivity of demand for groundwater when multiple p a w c s during a given growing season is considered judgment call 8 the dependency of irrigation frequency on acres irrigated and well capacity in theory there are two ways that ifreq can affect crop yield depending on crop water demand and irrigation practices first irrigating fewer acres of a parcel can increase the amount of groundwater that can be applied per acre per day second irrigating fewer acres of crop i a i can increase the amount of groundwater that can be applied per acre per day to that crop the difference is whether irrigating the two crops coincide during the growing season in the case that the days that crop 1 is irrigated does not coincide with that of crop 2 one can assume the latter case however it is likely that during the season at least once irrigating crop 1 will coincide with crop 2 in this case it is more conservative to assume that i f r e q for crop i depends on the total number of irrigated acres rather than irrigated acres of crop i however the farmer controls the application rate when the pivot moves from one crop to another through the choice of p a w c this is what we assume in mod at judgment call 9 using a lookup table for the numerical outputs of eq 1 ideally there is a link between day to day irrigation decisions and crop growth however as discussed daily irrigation decisions are not known with certainty and we use seasonal decisions instead as a result we can generate a lookup table table 2 that provides us with groundwater use and crop yield for different well capacities soil types and weather types using a lookup table significantly decreases the computational cost of integration when all the farms are similar in size and have similar choice set i e irrigation decisions such as crops to grow p a w c etc however the computational cost of a look up table may be high when farms have different irrigation strategies available to them in mod at we assume that each parcel is 130 acres and is irrigated with one well judgment call 10 hydro economic model under a changing climate climate change can increase the total volume and variability of rainfall during the growing season pendergrass et al 2017 under such conditions groundwater can play an increasingly important role to buffer against the variations in rainfall including extreme events such as droughts over time producers have increasingly relied on groundwater hornbeck and keskin 2014 making their yield more contingent on stability in the system thus understanding the costs of joint climate change and aquifer depletion is very important hydro economic models can be designed to show a variety of scenarios to quantify impacts to irrigators hurd and rouhi rad 2013 stand alone hydrology and economic models risk missing important processes because of their typical simplifying assumptions the mod at can also be used in estimating the costs of climate change along with aquifer depletion while we have not specifically discussed the incorporation of data from climate simulations to study the potential impacts of climate change as long as the downscaled climate data is generated for the study area that can be used in dssat and modflow we can easily include such data to study the impacts of climate change in that case recharge rates are simulated based on the simulated climate data similarly crop yields and water use values are also updated an interesting question raised here is whether producers take into account the simulated future climate or historical observed climate when making irrigation decisions future research could further explore such behavioral responses finally we should note that the choices that the producers face are often structurally added to the model as a set of choices in the long run producers may adopt different practices such as drought tolerant seed varieties that are not invented yet that reduce the impacts of climate change to the extent that such innovations determine future water use mod at an in general hydro economic models will over estimate the rate of aquifer depletion the economics literature on the impacts of climate change has emphasized the role of adaptation mendelsohn et al 1994 and shows that ignoring adaptation and margins of adjustment can result in over estimating the costs of climate change 
10581,in this paper we introduce a hydro economic modeling framework for the management of groundwater resources that are used for irrigated agricultural production the model mod at can be used to study the costs of aquifer depletion and the net benefits of specific aquifer management policies mod at is composed of three components namely an economic component a hydrologic component and an agronomic component a main goal of this paper is to introduce the hydro economic model and describe how it can be transferable to different contexts with this objective in mind we describe model components step by step so that the process of integration can be replicated easily we then apply the model to study the efficacy of a pumping tax in finney county kansas usa which overlies the high plains aquifer the results show that a pumping tax results in an increase in average well capacities in the county over time relative to the status quo which increases the average profitability of agricultural production however the increase in profitability is not uniform across producers and some producers gain more than others under the tax keywords hydro economic modeling ogallala high plains aquifer groundwater management policy analysis irrigation 1 introduction since the advent of pumping technology groundwater has supported agricultural production across the world in areas with and without significant surface water flows rodell et al 2018 the decline of aquifers along with changing climatic conditions has led to concerns about the sustainability of current irrigation practices local communities that rely heavily on groundwater fed agricultural production can be impacted by aquifer depletion almas et al 2004 this is compounded by the fact that aquifers replenish slowly if at all which implies a low threshold for overuse furthermore aquifers are common property resources that are shared among many producers that use groundwater for irrigation groundwater extraction by one user affects aquifer levels at neighboring wells affecting the productivity and profitability of the neighboring wells hydro economic models are important tools for studying the effectiveness of water management policies brown et al 2015 harou et al 2009 these integrated models haacker et al 2019 voinov and shugart 2013 attempt to leverage the strengths of both physical models and economic models to study the costs and benefits of different policies and associated changes in physical and climatic systems adamowicz et al 2019 an ideal hydro economic model for irrigation incorporates the water cycle crop water use and growth and the effect of incentives and externalities resulting from the interplay between the physical systems and producer irrigation decisions traditionally when addressing questions about the trends of aquifer depletion or the effectiveness of aquifer management policies each of the disciplinary literatures in hydrology agronomy and economics have made simplifying assumptions about the elements and parameters of the other models harou et al 2009 for example hydrologic based studies have attempted to calculate the remaining life of the aquifer based on historical patterns without regard to changing incentives from increased extraction costs or decreased well capacities fenichel et al 2016 scanlon et al 2012 steward et al 2013 these hydrologic models often assume that human impacts on fluxes are constant minimal or both they may not respond realistically to variability such as droughts during which farmers often reduce their irrigated acreage in addition to watering more intensely in areas that remain irrigated deines et al 2019 furthermore traditional hydrologic or hydro economic models do not operate at the producer level and units of decision making are often aggregated mulligan et al 2014 this simplification of the behavioral assumptions can result in over estimating or under estimating the rate of aquifer depletion on the other hand economic studies have focused on gains to management by simplifying the representation of hydrologic and agronomic systems in hydro economic modeling endeavors gisser and sánchez 1980 guilfoos et al 2016 simplifying assumptions on hydrological and agronomic processes can result in unrealistic estimates of crop water demand and yield response and incorrect spatial distributions of benefits and costs to producers brozović et al 2010 koundouri 2004 in this paper we introduce a hydro economic framework for irrigation modeling that integrates hydrologic agronomic and economic models named mod at the model integrates three elements that are critical for studying irrigation based agricultural systems a hydrological model modflow an agronomic model decision support system for agrotechnology transfer dssat and a custom economic decision making model the main utility of the mod at model is in how it can be used to empirically study how long term aquifer depletion and different management policies across space and over time affect producers profits mod at makes this possible by modeling changes in aquifer levels and well capacities for all the wells across the aquifer and modeling the effect of changing well capacities on irrigated profits this could allow one to observe declines in the predicted profitability of groundwater use over time as depletion reduces well capacities in addition to introducing the modeling framework we provide some results from model runs with and without a tax on groundwater use we also discuss the challenges that arise when developing such hydro economic models provide a discussion of the trade offs in the form of judgment calls for addressing them and discuss directions for future research we demonstrate our model for a case study of finney county in the southwest of kansas usa which overlies the high plains aquifer hpa however the framework is easily applicable to different study areas given the importance of the hpa for agricultural production in addition to our contributions to hydro economic model development the results from the illustrative case study are also of direct benefit to a wide range of stakeholders in a critical agricultural region within the united states this paper contributes to the hydro economic modeling literature haacker et al 2019 harou et al 2009 george et al 2011 das et al 2013 medellín azuara et al 2015 and more broadly to the integrated modeling literature such as housh et al 2015 by introducing a hydro economic model of groundwater use in agricultural regions that integrates three critical elements that are necessary for modeling an agricultural system namely an economic model of producer decision making at the parcel level a crop simulation model and a model of the physical groundwater system at a parcel level our parcel level production model along with a spatially explicit groundwater model allows us to study the spatial distribution of costs and benefits across groundwater users similar studies such as jaeger et al 2017 have used parcel level hydro economic models but have simplified agricultural producers irrigation decisions mod at includes a structural model of intra seasonal irrigation decision making that utilizes simulated agronomic production relationships generated using dssat as a result we believe that mod at is more suitable than other studies for studying groundwater management in irrigated agricultural regions furthermore groundwater depletion has become a major issue across many aquifers a major utility of hydro economic models is to provide insight into development and analysis of existing and new policies for managing aquifers however an impediment for the adoption of integrated hydro economic models has been the need for development of new software and programs bulatewicz et al 2010 moreover many hydro economic studies rely on very complex models that provide a black box feel they are difficult to fully understand and adapt to other use cases harou et al 2009 kahil et al 2016 voinov and shugart 2013 as a result a model that can easily be used in other contexts could be very important the model presented here uses three open source components i e modflow dssat and an economic model based on r language that are freely available across the world and can easily be modified for different contexts specifically modflow and dssat have been used in many different contexts for hydrological and agricultural analysis and the custom r code and the windows batch code is written by the authors and is publicly available on github https github com manirouhirad modssat the modular nature of mod at also provides the advantage of a high degree of confidence in each model element as they are produced by academics in the respective disciplines macewan et al 2017 the open source nature of our model is similar to that of dogan et al 2018 while they focus on large scale regional planning problems in california our model focuses on groundwater management in agricultural regions with parcel level decision making units 2 study area finney county in the southwest of kansas usa overlies the hpa fig 1 hpa is the largest freshwater aquifer in the world and is the main source of water supply for irrigated agriculture in the county finney county is one of the most intensely irrigated areas overlying the hpa over 25 of the county s area has been dedicated to irrigated agriculture since the 1970 s the most dominant cultivated crops on the irrigated acreage in the county are corn winter wheat and sorghum the hpa is the main source of water supply for irrigation some parcels along the arkansas river historically were irrigated by diverting water from the arkansas river fig 1 however due to lack of flow in the river the amount of groundwater extracted from the hpa increased substantially during the 1970 s whittemore 2012 subsequently saturated thickness levels started declining across the county fig 2 there are seven major soil types in our study area that differ in terms of their productivity table 1 these soil types cover more than 90 of the agricultural acreage in finney county the average annual temperature over the past 30 year period in finney county is 12 36 c while the average 30 year temperature on the high plains portion of kansas overall is 12 33 c average precipitation in the same period over the irrigated portion of ks was 509 mm while 30 year precipitation over the high plains portion of ks was 577 mm average saturated thickness in finney county between 1980 and 2017 was around 140 m over the same period average saturated thickness of the high plains portion of kansas was about 70 m 3 mod at to provide insight into the effects of groundwater conservation policies on producers profits in irrigated areas a hydro economic model for agricultural production is required this model must consist of three main system components a model of water balance and flux a model of plant growth and yield and a model of producer decision making these components i e hydrologic model crop model and economic model are often simulated using independent standalone models from different disciplines fig 3 a the mod at model integrates these elements to create an interactive model of water flow crop water use and irrigation decision making that incorporates the feedbacks between these models fig 3b this explicit integration is the strength of a hydro economic model provided that the conceptual assumptions of each sub model are compatible voinov and shugart 2013 for an integrated model to be effective each element of the model should be considered a valid model within its respective discipline however as mentioned earlier any single component is not enough for providing policy relevant analysis and studying the effects of long term changes such as climate change and aquifer depletion because of the sensitivity to dynamic factors in other parts of the system removing any of the components without proper replacement can result in unrealistic physical or policy outcomes we start by explaining the generation of crop production functions for different crops and under different management strategies we then describe the economic component of the model that includes producers objective function and decision space finally we discuss how these groundwater use decisions affect water levels across the aquifer by describing the hydrologic model 3 1 crop production component crop simulation models csm can be used for research information synthesis as tools for optimizing crop system management and for policy analyses boote et al 1996 these models are physically based models that often involve collections of empirical relationships that are coupled with water and nutrient budgets and can simulate the growth development and yield of a crop monteith 1996 along with the concomitant water cycle and nutrient dynamics csms make it easier for users to select a combination of management practices based on the input data available climatic and soil conditions and conventional water management techniques in mod at we use dssat hoogenboom et al 2017 jones et al 2003 which is one of the most widely used csms for evaluating agricultural management options thorp et al 2008 and for studying the impact of management strategies for different soil and climate conditions mcnider et al 2015 the dssat version 4 7 comprises models for more than 42 crops that simulate crop growth development and yield along with management strategies that involve irrigation fertilizer application crop rotations and others sharda et al 2019 the model calculates crop growth and simulates water and nutrient balance at a daily time step by simulating processes of soil water nutrient and plant growth along with developmental processes for the formation of final crop yield and yield components though dssat has seen wide adoption as a standalone model to study the impact of environmental modifications on crop production systems its application in conjunction with hydro economic models has been limited mcnider et al 2015 several studies have developed water production functions under different irrigation management scenarios to study alternate irrigation strategies araya et al 2018 2019 foster and brozović 2018 mitchel et al 2016 but these studies are limited in terms of their complexity in modeling hydro economic dynamic systems irrigation scenarios in dssat are developed for a unit area a representative hectare using a combination of the critical plant available water p a w c and irrigation frequency ifreq p a w c is the threshold where irrigation is triggered when plant available water in the soil root zone falls below this threshold kisekka et al 2016 each irrigation event can only start after the previous event has irrigated all irrigated acres and when there is enough well capacity ifreq is the minimum number of days between the start of two irrigation applications combinations of p a w c and ifreq determine the timing and duration of irrigation applied triggering irrigation at higher p a w c for a shorter ifreq can be beneficial during certain growth stages of a crop but might not be applicable during a different growth stage or for a different crop a declining well capacity affects ifreq unless the number of irrigated acres is reduced dssat produces water use and crop yield for a unit area a hectare as a result we simulate various combinations of p a w c and ifreq for three of the major crops in our study area namely corn sorghum and wheat to study the effect of changes in well capacity on irrigation and crop yield in order to study the effects of aquifer depletion and declining well capacities on crop yield and profitability in our crop simulations we capture a range of well capacities and irrigated acres by simulating all crop yields and water uses for each crop using combinations of p a w c 25 which means that irrigation is triggered when paw falls below 25 35 45 55 65 and 75 and ifreq of 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 and 24 days these combinations allow us to consider a range of groundwater availability and irrigation management that are consistent with groundwater availability and irrigation decisions in our study area we also consider rainfed production for each crop which does not depend on aquifer levels all dryland simulations and irrigated simulations for the aforementioned combinations of ifreq and p a w c are run for seven different soil types in our study area that are different in terms of their productivity table 1 soil data for crop production models are obtained from the ssurgo database the database includes specific details about soil characteristics such as field capacity wilting point and water content at saturation soil bulk density depth and texture which are required inputs for the dssat csm these soil types cover more than 90 of our study area for climate data for dssat simulations we use average air temperature height of temperature measurements height of wind measurements solar radiation maximum air temperature minimum air temperature precipitation dew point temperature wind velocity and photosynthetic active radiation from a station in finney county 39 n 100 w next we consider a producer s objective function based on the crop production model discussed in this section 3 2 economics component the economics component develops a model of an expected profit maximizing producer considering different irrigation decisions that are available to the producer to apply groundwater we assume that groundwater is the only source of water supply in the region the decision variables in our model include the choice of crops including irrigated and dryland crops acres of land allocated to each crop and p a w c there are several factors that can affect irrigation decisions and profits of a producer in mod at prices of crops costs of producing crops per acre excluding irrigation cost of applying a unit of groundwater climatic conditions and well capacity well capacity is the maximum flow rate that can be extracted from a groundwater well which can be sustained over a cropping season recent literature has shown the importance of having an adequate well capacity for sufficient irrigation supply and how limited well capacity can affect crop yields and profits foster et al 2015 rouhi rad et al 2020 as well as the sensitivity of hydro economic models to well capacity parameters hrozencik et al 2017 we incorporate well capacity as a factor affecting irrigation decisions through its effect on productivity rouhi rad et al 2020 to better study the costs of aquifer depletion and benefits of aquifer management policies a representative producer determines the number of acres and p a w c allocated to each of the n irrigated crops and m dryland crops to maximize the expected profits 1 m a x e π e c l i m a t e i 1 n a i p i f i w i p a w c i i f r e q a a f a l l o w j n 1 n m a j q c l i m a t e s o i l c w i i i j n 1 n m a j p j f j c l i m a t e

weight assigned to each historical year while most studies within the economics literature consider irrigation as the main decision variable within a stochastic framework in practice irrigation decisions are often made by setting soil moisture targets without perfect foresight about the realization of the weather foster and brozović 2018 it is thus important to consider profit maximizing irrigation decisions that are based on the choice of p a w c with a higher p a w c water application is triggered more frequently during the growing season resulting in greater seasonal irrigation use on the other hand a lower p a w c can decrease crop yield and increase the probability of crop loss well capacity q affects crop yield by affecting the rate that the center pivot system can rotate while applying a given depth of water as a result we use ifreq which is a function of irrigated acres and q as the mechanism through which well capacity affects crop yield the relationship between well capacity irrigation depth ifreq and irrigated acres is given by the following equation 2 i r r i g a t e d a c r e s i r r i g a t i o n d e p t h i f r e q w e l l c a p a c i t y the left hand side of equation 2 is the volume of groundwater applied in terms of area and irrigation depth while the right hand side of the equation shows the volume of groundwater applied in terms of well capacity and the minimum number of days between the start of two irrigation applications in mod at irrigation depth is assumed to be around 25 mm 1 inch because at lower irrigation depths the amount of water absorbed by the crop decreases due to surface runoff holding irrigation depth fixed at 25 mm and taking well capacity and irrigation efficiency as given ifreq and irrigated acres are the factors that can vary to increase crop water availability more specifically a producer can decrease the number of irrigated acres to increase ifreq so that the acres irrigated are irrigated more frequently than if the entire field was irrigated the functional form of equation 2 introduces a trade off between irrigating an additional acre and increasing expected crop yield per acre irrigating one more acre increases i f r e q per acre this means that on average crop yields may be lower for each of the acres irrigated moreover under higher ifreq s crop yield will be more sensitive to variation in annual weather conditions when used within a hydro economic framework the model considers different sources of heterogeneity in physical characteristics of fields including heterogeneity in soil types and well capacity across space and over time while producers start with different well capacities groundwater extraction across space and over time can result in further variation in well capacity across producers in numerically estimating profit maximizing levels of the decision variables in eq 2 a custom r script was written hereafter r code 0 in this script a producer is assumed to irrigate 130 acres which is the typical size of a quarter section center pivot system the smallest unit of decision making in a parcel is a quarter circle 32 5 acres traversed by a typical pivot we divide each parcel into four quarter circles where each quarter circle can have a unique crop planted each year for every well with a given soil type and well capacity based on the prices of each crop and costs of production and irrigation we estimate the following first for each quarter circle we estimate the expected profit for each crop and p a w c we then find the crop p a w c combination that maximizes the expected profit in every quarter circle the sum of irrigation across the four quarter circles determines the field level irrigation volume while the sum of the expected profit across these quarters determines the field level expected profit note that given the non linear effect of well capacity on expected profits for each crop in each quarter circle it is possible that different quarter circles will have different crops planted this nonlinearity results in adjustments in irrigated acres that are different than the one imposed by historical conditions howitt 2005 after the planting and p a w c decisions have been made during the season daily weather outcomes will be realized in our case this is implemented as one of the weather years in the historical weather data the producer then initiates an irrigation event every time paw reaches p a w c and when there is enough well capacity in the next section we describe the elements of the groundwater model that is used for modeling the spatial and temporal variations in groundwater aquifer levels 3 3 hydrology component the groundwater component in mod at is simulated using modflow one of the most widely used groundwater simulation frameworks modflow is a free numerical model developed by the usgs in the 1980 s it utilizes the finite difference technique to solve the groundwater flow equation in three dimensions modflow has a modular structure which enables users to select its different components packages based on their objectives such modular structure facilitates model construction and optimizes execution time all models are simplified versions of reality in modflow the simplifications depend on model packages in other words the choice of packages determines the complexity of the behavior that can be represented our groundwater model builds on the kgs modflow for hpa region in southwest kansas liu et al 2010 while we focus on finney county the kgs modflow model covers parts or all of 23 counties in southwest kansas 3 counties in southeast colorado and 3 counties in the oklahoma panhandle the model is a single layer model and its uniform and equally spaced cells are 1 1 mile in size the model grid consists of 100 rows and 150 columns resulting in 15 000 individual cells of which 12 083 cells are active thus it covers approximately an area of 31 300 square kilometers three different boundary conditions are considered in this model by using the flow and head boundary fhb package a time variant specified head boundary condition is defined for the northern and southern edges of the model domain and a portion of the edges along the bedrock outcrops for the eastern and western edges of the model time variant specified flux is considered as the boundary condition remaining edges along the bedrock outcrop regions are defined as time invariant specified head cells to simulate irrigation events the model uses the well wel package there are 17 711 wells in the southwestern kansas portion of the kgs modflow model of which 1629 irrigation wells are in finney county we locate all irrigation wells in the county again to be able to join them to croplands for field level simulations given the size of cells in the model often more than one well resides in a cell in that case the pumping rate is summed across the wells in a cell to determine the extraction rate for the cell the model utilizes the recharge rch package to simulate recharge from precipitation and irrigation events the stream str package simulates the groundwater surface water intercations along the streams and executes stream flow routing calculations finally to model the evapotranspiration in the main riparian regions e g the arkansas river alluvium the evapotranspiration evt package is used in modflow a stress period is a set duration during which all external factors such as pumping recharge river stage etc can affect groundwater flow movement and or change the amount of water in storage are held constant the kgs modflow model is constructed based on annual stress periods i e it assumes all stresses like pumping and recharge remain constant throughout a year and updates them at the beginning of each year in the kgs modflow model the historical simulation is divided into two main periods of predevelopment 1944 1946 and postdevelopment 1947 2007 a steady state model simulates the predevelopment period to approximate groundwater levels prior to the development of groundwater resources in the region the steady state model provides initial conditions for the postdevelopment period which is simulated by a transient model in this model aquifer hydraulic conductivity aquifer specific yield streambed hydraulic conductivity and recharge are considered as the parameters to be calibrated during the historical period by comparing simulated variables such as groundwater table and stream flow to actual measurements through a trial and error process to facilitate the calibration process of the kgs modflow model pest which is a parameter estimation software doherty 2007 is employed to optimize the model parameters annual pumping at a given well is then distributed evenly throughout the days of the agricultural season which is 123 days may 1 aug 31 so far in sections 3 1 3 3 we have described the components of the mod at model in the next section we describe the mechanics of integration in this model and how these components are linked 3 4 integration the integrated model mod at works by first coupling the crop production model section 3 1 and the economic model section 3 2 the model then couples the generated outcomes of the economic crop model with the hydrology model section 3 3 the crop simulation model dssat generates output pairs in the form of seasonal water use and harvested crop yield for each irrigation management strategy i e ifreq and p a w c for each of the crops for each year that we have weather data as a result a distribution of profits can be generated from irrigation quantity and crop yields furthermore a distribution of maximum profits for each irrigation strategy and weather year can be generated from eq 1 these outputs can be summarized in the form of a lookup table using the lookup table means that for an n year model we only need to run the profit maximization problem explained in section 3 2 once for each well capacity and each soil type to generate the lookup table which is then used in every year of the simulation the lookup table however imposes the behavioral assumption that the expected profit maximizing producer makes part of the irrigation decision at the beginning of the season and part of the irrigation decision during the irrigation season specifically the producer decides the number of acres and the p a w c allocated to each crop based on the historical distribution of weather variables in this case a 30 year period from 1980 to 2009 at the beginning of the season during the season when weather is realized the producer irrigates the field based on the chosen p a w c the total seasonal irrigation amount therefore varies from year to year based on weather the lookup table includes outcomes for every year for which the historical data are available as a result it also allows us to generate realizations of groundwater application and crop yields for any given year specifically the lookup table includes profit maximizing p a w c crop choice crop yield and profit for each year of the historical data it is worth noting that while in reality a producer can operate multiple wells or parcels in the analysis that is done for this representation of the mod at model we assume that each producer operates one well which is tied to one 130 acre parcel which is the size of a typical quarter section center pivot irrigation system across the high plains aquifer 1 1 as a result we use parcel well and producer interchangeably throughout the manuscript furthermore while in theory it is possible to irrigate any portion of the parcel we limit the analysis to 4 quarter circles of 32 5 acres in other words the unit of decision making for a farmer is a quarter of their circle finally the model can be simulated for any number of years however in this analysis we use a baseline of 11 years 1997 2007 where the data for both dssat and modflow exists the 50 year simulation repeats the 11 year weather data while aquifer levels change in response to groundwater extraction it is easy to see that the analysis can be expanded to different situations and decision making units and none of the points mentioned here are a limitation of the mod at model mechanically a windows batch code bat file was written that connects the elements of the model in year 0 the batch code first runs the economics r code 0 that generates the lookup table the r code 0 reads in the outputs of dssat model runs and produces profit maximizing outputs lookup table then in year 1 the batch code runs a second r code based on the weather that is realized in that year and selects from the lookup table parcel level water use and profits water use decisions from this economic model are the inputs to the hydrologic model the batch code runs the modflow model which generates groundwater head levels at every well well capacity which is an input to the economics model is then estimated based on the changes in saturated thickness in every cell of the aquifer the batch code repeats this process for t 2 n it is worth noting that in r code 0 we simulated a limited number of ifreq s section 3 2 we then linearly interpolated between these discrete values to generate production functions for each value of ifreq also running modflow within a loop for years t 2 n requires that a new model is run for each water year using the previous year s water table elevation as an initial condition because the modflow well package is not easily updated during a model run as this simple explanation shows a major appeal of the mod at model is the simplicity of the replication it only needs windows dssat modflow and r dssat and modflow are calibrated for different crops and regions respectively the custom r code can easily be modified for different regions all three components of the model i e dssat modflow and r are freely available to the public 4 results and discussion in this section we provide some results that showcase the output of the mod at model we first discuss the integration of the crop production model and economic model together these two generate a profit maximizing producer s irrigation decisions we then discuss the integration of these decisions with the groundwater hydrology model 4 1 producer decision making as discussed in section 3 a producer makes irrigation decisions in two steps at the beginning of a growing season the producer determines the number of acres to irrigate which crop to plant on each quarter circle 32 5 acres and the p a w c allocated to that crop and quarter circle given well capacity to make these decisions the producer considers the distribution of crop yields and irrigation demand for each crop ifreq and paw fig 4 shows the distribution of crop yields for different ifreq s for the richfield silt loam soil type compared to the rest of the soils in the county this soil type has a relatively higher water holding capacity limited water availability especially during the critical stages of a growing season can significantly affect crop yield when ifreq is higher i e when it takes longer for the center pivot system to irrigate a field and each acre is irrigated less frequently crop yield is very sensitive to variations in annual weather conditions and on average crop yields will be lower on a fixed number of irrigated acres this is shown in fig 4 where lower ifreq s for all three crops corn sorghum and wheat increase average crop yield and reduce the variance of the crop yield distribution also dryland crops show the lowest average and greatest variance in crop yield for all three crops keeping the number of irrigated acres fixed as well capacity declines ifreq increases eq 2 the figure shows that declining well capacities can result in decreased crop yields on average and increased production risk during wet years crop yield is not very sensitive to an increase in ifreq as shown by the upper bound of crop yields 2 2 it is also worth mentioning that ill timed rainfall events may affect crop yields for example large rainfall events near maturity can cause more harm than good however during dry years crop yield is increasingly sensitive to changes in ifreq as shown by the lower bound of crop yield one potential way that a producer can reduce the effects of limited well capacity is by applying more water most studies within the economics literature consider irrigation as the main decision variable within a stochastic framework however in practice irrigation decisions are often made by setting a soil moisture target p a w c without perfect foresight about the realization of the weather foster and brozović 2018 with a higher p a w c water application is triggered more frequently during the growing season kisekka et al 2016 resulting in greater water use on the other hand a lower p a w c can decrease crop yield and increase the probability of crop loss this is shown in fig 5 where expected yields for all three crops are higher under higher p a w c however crop yields seem to be less sensitive to the choice of p a w c compared to the ifreq values this suggests that increasing p a w c alone cannot substitute for reductions in well capacities over time and adjustments of other margins e g reducing irrigated acres is required rouhi rad et al 2020 a p a w c of 50 is often considered as a practical pawc for irrigation klocke et al 2011 here we find that adjusting p a w c could also be one way that a producer can mitigate the costs of aquifer depletion given the distribution of crop yields and water use for different crops ifreq s and p a w c a producer with a given well capacity determines the number of irrigated acres which crops to grow and p a w c from eq 2 fig 6 shows the expected profit maximizing number of acres irrigated expected seasonal irrigation and the expected profit for each 130 acre irrigated field the tabular results are also shown in table 2 the results show that as well capacity declines the profit maximizing producer does not keep irrigated acres fixed and reduces their irrigated acres to be able to keep greater irrigation frequency ifreq on the acres irrigated decreasing irrigated acres reduces demand for groundwater the decline in well capacity also results in a loss of profit for the producer however if the producer does not adjust irrigated acres the loss of profit could be even greater for the richfield silt loam we observe two critical well capacities first we see a decline in the profitability of production as well capacity declines below 600 gpm as the producer decreases groundwater application per acre above 600 gpm declining in well capacity do not significantly affect producer profits as well capacity further declines below 300 gpm the producer reduces the number of irrigated acres this is also where we start to see significant declines in profitability 4 2 integrated model results when integrated with the modflow model the coupled economic crop model can generate aquifer levels well capacities and profits for each well across the aquifer and over time we can also study the benefits generated by groundwater management policies to producers an example of the results of such analysis is shown in figs 7 and 8 each well in the study area has a unique soil type and a unique starting well capacity as aquifer levels at a well change well capacities for that well change and the producer responds by adjusting their irrigation decisions as discussed in section 4 1 a groundwater management policy such as a pumping tax can incentivize profit maximizing producers to reduce their groundwater extraction which can result in higher relative well capacities over time fig 7 shows the decline in average well capacity for wells within finney county under the status quo of no policy and with a pumping tax of 2 per acre inch taxing groundwater use within the county results in a relative increase in average well capacities over time this is due to the slower rate of aquifer depletion as a result of the tax however the increase in average well capacities from the pumping tax is relatively small thus we may expect small changes in profit as a result of the tax fig 8 shows the spatial distribution of undiscounted changes in profitability from the pumping tax the figure shows that while overall the pumping tax increases the profitability of agricultural production the benefits of the policy are not uniformly distributed and some wells experience losses in profitability from the tax the benefits of the policy are higher for producers in the northern part of the county while the goal of this paper is to showcase the value of the mod at model and not to do detailed policy analysis such spatial and temporal analyses of the benefits can help policymakers understand the benefits of different aquifer management policies these results are important for understanding the distributional effects of different policies and to better identify the winners and losers of the policies as the equity impacts of policies gain more attention from policymakers models such as mod at can become increasingly important it is also possible to consider the impacts of other policies such as groundwater quotas with the mod at model in the next section we briefly discuss some of the important elements when building a hydro economic model 5 discussion and conclusion the mod at model developed and described in this study makes it possible to study the costs of long term aquifer depletion and the effects of groundwater management and other agricultural policies it also allows policymakers to understand the spatial distribution of costs and benefits associated with different groundwater management policies each of the components considered in mod at are important for policy analysis removing the hydrological element would be similar to considering simplified hydrological models such as the bathtub aquifer model which assumes water levels change simultaneously for all locations across an aquifer brozović et al 2010 without the hydrological model and based on simplifying assumptions one can analyze the irrigation decisions of a single isolated producer foster et al 2017 however a model of a single producer cannot accurately estimate changes in aquifer levels and irrigation decisions for an entire aquifer where extraction from one well affects groundwater levels at neighboring wells since the effectiveness of a policy depends on the changes in groundwater levels and responsiveness elasticity of groundwater demand among neighboring wells to changes in their groundwater levels manning and suter 2019 ignoring the groundwater model can result in overestimation or underestimation of the policy benefits removing the crop production model means assuming a fixed amount of water applied per acre or fixed crop yield per acre brinegar and ward 2009 fenichel et al 2016 this assumption can result in unrealistic or lack of adjustments in response to changes in water availability for example the model may produce the same number of acres irrigated or the same amount of water applied alternatively the relationship between aquifer water level characteristics or policy variables with well level groundwater use may be estimated using statistical techniques and historical land and water use decisions claassen et al 2017 while this statistical method can be very accurate in estimating mentioned relationships it may not be accurate in extrapolating beyond observed values this especially becomes important when analyzing the effects of a policy where one needs to create counterfactual worlds with and without the policy crop models that include different margins of adjustment can be particularly helpful for studying the effectiveness of different policies ex ante for example these models can help to identify whether the constraints associated with lower well capacities can be mitigated by applying more groundwater by setting higher soil moisture targets our results suggest that this is probably not the case finally crop models can also be important for estimating the effects of climate change as the choice of crops may change over time due to changes in climatic conditions the economics model adds a decision maker to the model without a unit of decision making the model cannot respond to changes to the system this lack of response to incentives often means assuming a constant amount of water use over time or ignoring the available margins that a profit maximizing producer would consider either of these assumptions would result in over estimating rates and costs of aquifer depletion moreover aquifer management policies are often designed to address specific challenges these issues may be different from one aquifer to another for example while groundwater scarcity and long term aquifer depletion may be bigger concerns in one aquifer spatial externalities from groundwater extraction may be the major concern in another aquifer another issue often faced is stream depletion due to groundwater extraction which requires policies that incentivize the reallocation of groundwater extraction away from the river these problems often require different solutions thus it is important to understand the economic incentives behind the problem at hand in order to propose solutions economics can also be useful for comparing different policies each policy involves trade offs in terms of costs and benefits across space and over time since the impacts and fairness of different policies are important policy considerations it is important to understand the costs benefits and distribution of different policies model calibration and sensitivity are also important aspects to consider for linked models doherty 2007 voinov and shugart 2013 when parameters from several systems are included in an integrated framework it becomes more difficult to assess which inputs and parameters are driving the model results in addition when parameters are changed during calibration to fit a validation dataset they can mask the influence of parameters that are not included in the model or inadvertently overfit with measurement noise registered as a signal which diminishes the power of the model to fit out of sample measurements this uncertainty can propagate between systems in integrated models the software pest parameter estimation doherty 2015 is one example of a program that includes methods for model calibration and sensitivity analysis and is not model specific 3 3 pest is available for free from www pesthomepage org all models but particularly integrated models should include methodology for their calibration and sensitivity in their documentation and researchers should consider using a formal framework like pest to evaluate these important aspects of model rigor in developing an integrated modeling framework to study groundwater management there are a number of judgment calls and assumptions that modelers must make an understanding of the potential trade offs associated with these modeling choices and justifications for the assumptions made for mod at provides some insights for future hydro economic model development 4 4 a more detailed description of these judgment calls is provided in the appendix for example when developing a hydro economic model it is important to minimize the effects of outcomes that take place outside the spatial boundary of the model aquifer boundaries provide a reasonable boundary for the hydro economic model assumptions and judgement calls specific to the physical system and climate outcomes are also important when studying the effectiveness of groundwater management policies over the long term groundwater level changes within a growing season may not be very important in such a situation assuming one stress period may be enough in addition there is often significant heterogeneity in soil types in a given region for example there are seven major soil types in finney county these soils however do not change significantly over time on the other hand climatic variables are relatively stable in small geographic regions but change over time thus it is critical to consider the major soil types in the region and changes in climate over time the assumptions related to how agricultural producers behave and how they cope with changes in policy or economic conditions represent critical judgement calls for example as well capacities decline the model must consider how producers adjust critical plant available water thresholds as part of a management strategy assumptions related to the timing of irrigation decisions are also important in practice crops are planted at the beginning of the season while irrigation applications take place during the season our modeling framework assumes that decisions related to the critical plant available water threshold takes place at the beginning of the season when the farmer does not have perfect information about the weather during the growing season this threshold then drives irrigation decisions throughout the season in response to weather realizations additionally producers may form expectations based on different historical periods for example whether they consider a 30 year history of seasonal weather as we assume or a shorter period such as the past 10 years could affect their irrigation decisions and as a result the effectiveness of a groundwater management policy the assumed risk preferences of producers can also affect the results of the policy analysis under well developed markets assuming a risk neutral farmer is reasonable antle and capalbo 2001 and serves to provide initial insights regarding the effectiveness of the policies the sensitivity of the results to these assumptions should be considered in future analysis mod at also has a few limitations that could be improved upon in future modeling efforts first interactions among producers who share a groundwater aquifer could be better represented in future studies from the hydrological modeling point of view groundwater models often rely on large cell sizes that include multiple wells though this aggregation simplifies the computational process it may also result in ignoring some of the spatial interactions that exist in practice among neighboring producers furthermore from an economic point of view these studies often focus on farm level decision making however studies such as pfeiffer and lin 2012 have shown the importance of spatial interactions for groundwater extraction decisions these behavioral responses along with better hydrological modeling can provide better insights on the effectiveness of different policies a global optimum or the first best solution is often difficult to achieve under current models due to the computational costs of the estimation the issue is that aquifer level at each well in the study area is a separate state variable which results in the curse of dimensionality furthermore the non convexity of the problem can also affect the chances of achieving the optimal solution future models with increased computational power can focus on estimating first best solutions as they can provide policymakers with an upper bound of what is possible groundwater resources not only include values for production but they may also generate other values that are not fully captured by the profit maximization process for example producers may also care about the bequest value of groundwater and its availability for future generations suter et al 2020 hydro economic models of groundwater management often ignore such values and only consider production profits future studies could incorporate non market and non use values that affect groundwater use in hydro economic models finally in this paper we have not considered the interaction between surface water and groundwater the incorporation of swat modflow bailey et al 2016 a linked surface and groundwater model will enable a more holistic approach to impacts to the water cycle due to agriculture whether mediated by withdrawals or changes in precipitation partitioning runoff and recharge declaration of interest none appendix a judgment calls judgment call 1 locating the integrated model in space neither the typical crop model nor the typical economic model is specifically rooted in any single location crop models are generally one dimensional and the modeling unit is assumed to have uniform properties economics models often work at the field level for example a producer decides how many acres of a given field they should irrigate hydrologic models on the other hand rely on the spatial characteristics of large physical systems and one of their primary purposes is the calculation of flux from one location to another within the model area this means that the definition of the system in space becomes very important hydro economic models of groundwater management are often implemented within administrative or watershed boundaries bulatewicz et al 2010 regional groundwater flow may not respect such boundaries functionally it means that boundary conditions must be chosen preferably in a location where the other side of the boundary has as little influence as possible on the model outcome for groundwater this is often a river a hydraulic barrier or a geologically defined aquifer boundary like bedrock outcrop a geologic barrier vertical layering may be more difficult to characterize and large scale regional models are often constructed with a single layer representing the effective characteristics of various hydrogeological units that are subsumed within that layer rossman and zlotnik 2013 it is best if the model boundaries are chosen such that the field where irrigation decisions are made are close to the center of the hydrologic model to avoid controlling effects of boundary conditions as they can confound the effects of changes in water availability in the case of the mod at example presented here the boundary conditions are chosen to be the edge of the aquifer materials where possible with an erosional feature that cuts through the aquifer to the bedrock groundwater flux on one side of this boundary is completely independent of the water table on the other side of the ravine in some edges of the model there are no such clear features but boundaries are selected in areas where the model includes changing head boundary conditions over time to try to diminish edge effects this constraint in model boundary selection may make it difficult to predict water levels far into the future since it relies on well measurements to characterize these boundaries judgment call 2 temporal discretization groundwater moves slowly and so hydrologic models tend to have longer timesteps than other models a balance of stress periods is required to compromise between model simplicity and correctness crop models keep track of soil moisture and therefore are sensitive to pumping on a daily time step the danger is in enabling the crop to be watered more frequently than a pivot arm would physically be able to get around the field hydrologic models are more likely to assume constant pumping over the entire growing season so that the growing season can be simulated with a single stress period this may not adequately describe the system from the point of view of the crop and economic components of an integrated model for example some coping strategies might involve planting different irrigated crops at different times of the year so that limited capacity can be used over a longer portion of the growing season however adding such details within a growing season can increase the uncertainty of the model as no model can exactly model the planting days or the days in which irrigation takes place accurately moreover even if such decisions can be modeled their effect on groundwater flow over long time period that are relevant for policy is relatively small for example the effect of irrigating once a week at a given volume and irrigating every day at one seventh of that volume is relatively small at the beginning of the next irrigation season as a result we assume a single stress period for each year judgment call 3 irrigation management strategies different irrigation management strategies can be used to reduce water use or to increase crop yield in mod at we consider p a w c ifreq choice of crops and irrigated acres while there are many other ways to reduce water use these decisions depend on the context for example reducing irrigation depth below 25 mm is not often observed in our study region as a result we assume irrigation depth to be fixed we also note that there are other strategies that may not seem to affect irrigation directly but they can still affect water use examples of such management strategies include changing the planting density of seeds per acre or changing planting and harvest dates these strategies can especially become important under a changing climate in the current version of mo at we do not consider these decisions and we only consider changes in the combination of crops irrigated acres and amount of irrigation applied per acre while it is expected that adding more irrigation and planting decisions can result in lower costs of aquifer depletion and aquifer management policies because producers can respond by changing multiple decisions future studies can study the importance and extent of decisions such as changing planting density for adaptation to declining aquifer levels judgment call 4 which crops to grow a range of crops can be considered for production when it comes to the choice of crops to be considered by the integrated model the objectives of the study are important if the goal is to determine the effectiveness of different policies to reduce water use in the short run it is better to rely on existing crops within the region however if the goals of the policy are to manage water use in the long run we need to consider different crops that can become profitable under different conditions not considering such crops in the decision space can result in over estimating the costs of aquifer depletion furthermore to correctly capture the costs and benefits of producing different crops we need to consider how a producer makes irrigation decisions under uncertainty to do so we need to capture the distribution of crop yields under different weather conditions in this study we use 30 years of historic weather data from 1980 to 2009 to capture the observed long term variability noted in the recent history for three of the major crops in the study area i e corn sorghum and wheat future research could focus on better understanding the distribution of climatic variables that producers consider when making irrigation decisions if producers consider a shorter period of historical weather outcomes this can potentially bias the results generated with the entire range of historical weather outcomes e g the 30 year period considered in this study if the recent weather outcomes are different from the historical weather judgment call 5 heterogeneity of climatic variables across the study area and over time this judgment call is related to both data availability and the importance of heterogeneity of different variables across space and over time crop production models such as dssat often require high quality weather and soils data to simulate daily crop growth modeled climate data such as those generated by the prism group prism 2019 do not include the variables that are needed for the agronomic models as a result the spatial heterogeneity in the effect of climatic variables is limited by the availability of station data furthermore often climate does not vary significantly across a small study area such as the one considered in this paper as a result when the study area is relatively small one can assume a homogeneous climate across the study area however climate does change over time and considering the temporal change in climate could be important for studying trends of aquifer depletion over the long term on the other hand even in small areas biophysical characteristics such as soil type tend to be more heterogeneous these factors often vary at local scales but less so over time and can have important implications for crops water use and productivity for example water holding capacity can vary substantially across soil types which can affect irrigation decisions and crop choice in the analysis in this paper we used seven different soil types that cover more than 90 of the area of finney county however we used climate data only for one weather station within the county judgment call 6 risk preferences of the producers our model assumes a risk neutral producer who is interested in short term gains i e a myopic producer groundwater is a common property resource where property rights for the resource are usually not well defined the groundwater economics literature suggests that under such circumstances the assumption of a myopic producer is reasonable knapp and olson 1995 koundouri 2004 furthermore while there are uncertainties involved in agricultural production conventionally most models assume a risk neutral producer and those that assume risk aversion often find small changes in the value of groundwater management koundouri 2004 uncertainty in weather and surface water availability can be included in the model of irrigation decision making without necessarily considering risk averse producers for example in studying the buffer value of an aquifer tsur and graham tomasi 1991 consider uncertainty independent of risk aversion they show that compared to the deterministic case under uncertainty even when producers are risk neutral groundwater is more valuable in buffering against variations in rainfall this is explained by jensen s inequality for nonlinear functions a function of the mean is different from the mean of the function thus while we can relax risk aversion estimating crop yield and profits for mean climatic variables such as temperature and precipitation results in a biased demand for water crop yields and profits fig a1 furthermore the model of a risk neutral producer may sometimes provide more insight as it reduces the need for strong assumptions regarding the functional form and parameters of risk preferences we also assume constant returns to scale production in irrigated and dryland acres constant returns to scale assumptions mean that land quality is homogeneous for a given parcel more specifically if y is crop yield for an acre of irrigated production adding a irrigated acres would increase harvestable crop biomass by a y while there is often heterogeneity in local land characteristics traditionally within field physical characteristics has been assumed to be homogeneous it is unlike that the profit maximization results are sensitive to such small scale heterogeneity though future research could further explore this sensitivity judgment call 7 timing of irrigation decisions in a growing season another important behavioral assumption is the timing of irrigation decisions one can model certain day to day irrigation decisions however modeling at such fine scales may result in an inaccurate modeling of the decision making process as a result we assume that the producer decides on an irrigation rule ex ante but the amount applied is responsive to weather at the beginning of a growing season a producer makes decisions regarding which crops to grow and acres of land allocated to each crop we also assume that the producer simultaneously determines the p a w c determining p a w c at the beginning of the season creates a trade off on the one hand it assumes that farmers commit to a certain p a w c for each crop at the beginning of the season only adjusting groundwater application based on the weather in that year on the other hand it relaxes the assumption that farmers have perfect foresight about the weather and are willing to adapt their irrigation practices based on field requirements foster and brozović 2018 we believe that correctly capturing the behavioral responses to available weather information is important for reliability of the results however future research can further explore the sensitivity of demand for groundwater when multiple p a w c s during a given growing season is considered judgment call 8 the dependency of irrigation frequency on acres irrigated and well capacity in theory there are two ways that ifreq can affect crop yield depending on crop water demand and irrigation practices first irrigating fewer acres of a parcel can increase the amount of groundwater that can be applied per acre per day second irrigating fewer acres of crop i a i can increase the amount of groundwater that can be applied per acre per day to that crop the difference is whether irrigating the two crops coincide during the growing season in the case that the days that crop 1 is irrigated does not coincide with that of crop 2 one can assume the latter case however it is likely that during the season at least once irrigating crop 1 will coincide with crop 2 in this case it is more conservative to assume that i f r e q for crop i depends on the total number of irrigated acres rather than irrigated acres of crop i however the farmer controls the application rate when the pivot moves from one crop to another through the choice of p a w c this is what we assume in mod at judgment call 9 using a lookup table for the numerical outputs of eq 1 ideally there is a link between day to day irrigation decisions and crop growth however as discussed daily irrigation decisions are not known with certainty and we use seasonal decisions instead as a result we can generate a lookup table table 2 that provides us with groundwater use and crop yield for different well capacities soil types and weather types using a lookup table significantly decreases the computational cost of integration when all the farms are similar in size and have similar choice set i e irrigation decisions such as crops to grow p a w c etc however the computational cost of a look up table may be high when farms have different irrigation strategies available to them in mod at we assume that each parcel is 130 acres and is irrigated with one well judgment call 10 hydro economic model under a changing climate climate change can increase the total volume and variability of rainfall during the growing season pendergrass et al 2017 under such conditions groundwater can play an increasingly important role to buffer against the variations in rainfall including extreme events such as droughts over time producers have increasingly relied on groundwater hornbeck and keskin 2014 making their yield more contingent on stability in the system thus understanding the costs of joint climate change and aquifer depletion is very important hydro economic models can be designed to show a variety of scenarios to quantify impacts to irrigators hurd and rouhi rad 2013 stand alone hydrology and economic models risk missing important processes because of their typical simplifying assumptions the mod at can also be used in estimating the costs of climate change along with aquifer depletion while we have not specifically discussed the incorporation of data from climate simulations to study the potential impacts of climate change as long as the downscaled climate data is generated for the study area that can be used in dssat and modflow we can easily include such data to study the impacts of climate change in that case recharge rates are simulated based on the simulated climate data similarly crop yields and water use values are also updated an interesting question raised here is whether producers take into account the simulated future climate or historical observed climate when making irrigation decisions future research could further explore such behavioral responses finally we should note that the choices that the producers face are often structurally added to the model as a set of choices in the long run producers may adopt different practices such as drought tolerant seed varieties that are not invented yet that reduce the impacts of climate change to the extent that such innovations determine future water use mod at an in general hydro economic models will over estimate the rate of aquifer depletion the economics literature on the impacts of climate change has emphasized the role of adaptation mendelsohn et al 1994 and shows that ignoring adaptation and margins of adjustment can result in over estimating the costs of climate change 
10582,this study was aimed to evaluate the effect of regulated deficit irrigation rdi applied from mid spring to early summer on physiological parameters vegetative growth and productivity in an intensive hedgerow olive orchard located in a non traditional marked winter spring water deficit olive growing region the experiments were carried out during three crop seasons by using four years old 7 m 3 5 m genovesa olive trees three rdi treatments t25 t50 and t75 were applied as a percentage of crop evapotranspiration 25 50 and 75 etc respectively during the period from fruit set to pit hardening also a control treatment was irrigated at 100 etc during the whole crop season under the analyzed environmental conditions stomatal conductance was less sensitive in young leaves than in mature leaves against changes in water availability this fact should be considered when being used as benchmarks in olives trees submitted to water deprivation during periods with marked water constraint regarding vegetative parameters significant reductions in apical vegetative shoot growth trunk cross sectional area and canopy volume were found in less irrigated treatments t25 and t50 with respect to most irrigated ones t75 and t100 moreover the strongest effects of deficit irrigation were observed when pruning was applied at the end of the second crop season evaluated both fruit and oil yields were barely affected by water availability although in the first crop season evaluated the fruit yield was greater in the full irrigation treatment which could be due to the age of the olive trees at the end of the whole experimental period three crop years the mean values from this yield component did not present significant differences among all irrigation treatments similarly water availability did not affect oil yield kg ha no significant differences were found among irrigation treatments in any of the crop seasons analyzed the effects of water availability on productive parameters were more evident when analyzed as an estimated productive response the total water productivity calculated on both fruit weight and oil weight bases gave the highest values in the most restrictive irrigation treatment overall findings from this study could be of interest for olive cultivation in regions with dry spring period and for intensive hedgerow orchards suited to over row harvesters imposing water restriction during this period could be suitable for achieving sustainable fruit and oil productivity while saving considerable amount of irrigation water keywords intensive hedgerow olive orchard regulated deficit irrigation non mediterranean environment physiological parameters vegetative responses water productivity 1 introduction olive olea europaea l is a well adapted crop to the environmental conditions prevailing in regions with typical mediterranean climate characterized by cool wet winters and hot dry summers connor 2005 in the two last decades the increasing demand of olive oil and table olives have encouraged olive cultivation in several regions of the southern hemisphere mainly in arid and semiarid areas from south america and australia torres et al 2017 in general these crop environments do not have typical mediterranean climate and some of them are in the subtropics where the response of the crop to a number of environmental conditions is not completely known yet particularly in the central western and north western regions of argentina where the biggest hectarage for olive cultivation is located approximately 100 000 ha warmed temperatures minimal rainfalls high evapotranspiration and intensifying water deficit take place during the winter and early spring months rousseaux et al 2008 pierantozzi et al 2013 as compared with typical olive growing regions in the mediterranean basin torres et al 2017 although olive is a well adapted crop to xeric environments water shortage is one of the most important constraints to fruit production orgaz and fereres 2008 the beneficial effect of irrigation on both fruit and oil yields is well documented moriana et al 2012 martín vertedor et al 2011 pierantozzi et al 2014 but unfortunately irrigation water availability is limited in most of the olive producing regions of the world regulated deficit irrigation rdi is a common practice used in olive cultivation it consists of a reduction in water supply to below crop water requirements during the most drought resistant phenological stages orgaz and fereres 2008 the main goal is to increase water productivity while providing some economic benefit without the need to maximize yield several rdi strategies varying mainly in the time period and the amount of irrigation water applied have been developed employing a variety of watering methods tognetti et al 2006 melgar et al 2008 iniesta et al 2009 most of these experiences in olive irrigation management were achieved in countries from the mediterranean basin where the soil moisture stored during the winter months is often sufficient to satisfy crop water demand during the spring when flowering and fruit set take place probably due to this fact rdi experiences for that time of the year have been of little concern rdi requires precise knowledge of the crop response to water deficit at different phenological phases to identify the periods when trees are less sensitive although results are far from conclusive because of the limited number of olive cultivars and environments studied a number of works provide some useful insights in that respect previous studies indicate the third phase of olive fruit growth when pit hardening occurs conde et al 2008 as a fruit phenological stage that could be little affected by water restriction goldhamer 1999 tovar et al 2002 thoma et al 2004 cano lamadrid et al 2015 collado gonzález et al 2016 fernández et al 2013 so in this phase it could be possible to save considerable amount of irrigation water without compromising production and even improve some aspects of the olive oil quality caruso et al 2014 dabbou et al 2015 morales sillero et al 2013 while it is true that rdi is mainly aimed to optimize water use in olive production this irrigation strategy has been also used as a management practice aimed to control excessive vegetative growth grattan et al 2006 rufat et al 2014 trentacoste et al 2015 this latter may be particularly important if olive trees cultivated in regions with warm spring temperatures such as those occurring in many regions of argentina and australia torres et al 2017 are maintained with high irrigation rates given that most stem growth takes place during the first two months following flowering rallo and suarez 1989 gómez del campo 2013 it is important to keep the crown volume within certain limits particularly in high density orchards suited to mechanical over row harvesters since high rates of vegetative growth produce greater canopy volume which in turn can hinder management practices and mechanical harvest pastor et al 2005 tognetti et al 2006 lavee et al 2007 therefore in olive trees growing under the aforementioned conditions water deficit applied from mid spring at once fruit set has initiated can be an option because shoots are still growing considering the high evapotranspiration demand and water shortage that take place during winter and spring months at many olive growing sites in the southern hemisphere it is important to improve the knowledge of different points related to the crop functions such as the responses to water deficit in certain phenological periods specifically there is insufficient information about the effect of water shortage during the period covering fruit setting pit hardening a pioneer study based on a single pot trial rapoport et al 2014 suggests that water deficit during early fruit development affects differently the growth rates of mesocarp and endocarp tissues but in any case it reduces the final fruit size ahumada orellana et al 2017 has showed that irrigation cut off applied from fruit set until massive pit hardening does not affect significantly yield components unless severe water deficit levels 5 mpa are reached although all these findings contribute to a better understanding of the fruit growth response to water availability there is still a strong need of research at field scale not only to assess productive parameters but also physiological and vegetative responses a recent study by trentacoste et al 2019 has evaluated the effect of the water deficit on different vegetative growth and reproductive parameters in a mechanically managed olive hedgerow planted at super high density these authors observed that deficit irrigation treatments achieved greater productions and effective control of plant vigour taking into account the previous results the objectives of the study were to evaluate physiological vegetative and productive responses to the different rdi treatments in a hedgerow genovesa olive orchard located in a hot dry region in central western argentina 2 materials and methods 2 1 plant material and experimental design the field experiment was conducted during three consecutive seasons in a commercial olive orchard olea europaea l cv genovesa located near cañada honda 32 01 52 45 s 68 33 38 12 w 618 m above sea level at san juan province in the central western region of argentina the climate of the area is arid with an average annual rainfall of 100 mm mostly concentrated in the summer the absolute maximum temperatures exceed 40 c while the absolute minimum temperatures vary between 5 c and 10 c below zero there is important both annual and daily thermal amplitudes being the highest in argentina the olive grove was established in october of 2009 year trees are spaced 7 m x 3 5 m about 408 trees ha the soil texture is sandy loam with a bulk density of 1 34 g cm3 a field capacity of 15 2 and a wilting point of 4 1 soil ph is typically basic 8 6 and poor in organic matter 0 72 in 0 20 cm depth and 0 26 in 20 80 cm depth the contents of nitrogen phosphorus and potassium are comprised between 300 400 ppm 6 5 7 5 ppm and 160 165 ppm respectively four irrigation treatments were considered including a control treatment irrigated at 100 of etc during the entire year t100 and three rdi treatments irrigated at 25 50 and 75 of etc respectively during a two month period from mid spring to early summer during the rest of the year t25 t50 and t75 treatments were irrigated at 100 of etc a randomized block design with three plots for each irrigation treatment was used each experimental plot consisted of five trees where the three central trees were selected for all measurements water was supplied by two self compensating in line drippers per plant delivering 2 l h each the irrigation requirements were calculated following the methodology proposed by allen et al 1998 using a simplified water balance method the crop evapotranspiration was estimated as etc eto x kc x kr where eto is the reference evapotranspiration kc is the crop coefficient and kr is the coefficient of reduction related to the percentage of area shaded by the canopy the eto was calculated using the penman monteith equation over grass ortega farias et al 1993 allen et al 1998 during the june august period a kc value equal to 0 4 was assumed as suggested by rousseaux et al 2008 for the rest of the year we used a kc value equal to 0 68 as proposed by girona et al 2002 the kr coefficient was calculated using the relation proposed by steduto et al 2012 2 2 stem water potential and gas exchange measurements stem water potential ψstem was measured at midday between 12 00 and 13 00 h every week from the beginning of the experimental treatments using a scholander type pressure chamber biocontrol buenos aires argentina according to pierantozzi et al 2013 the measurements were done on terminal branches that had been bagged in plastic envelopes covered with aluminium foil at least 2 h before measurements from each selected tree two short terminal branches of the current year with four or six fully expanded leaves were used branches were selected from the mid canopy on the shaded zones of the trees after detachment from the canopy branches were immediately enclosed in the pressure chamber stomatal conductance gs was measured using a leaf porometer sc1 decagon devices cambridge uk according to methodology proposed by carmassi et al 2013 measurements were also made once a week between 11 00 and 12 00 h from each selected tree four or two mature and young fully expanded leaves from north exposed mid canopy current year shoot were used pierantozzi et al 2013 2 3 vegetative growth and fruiting measurements the trunk cross sectional area at 40 cm from the ground and the canopy volume were measured essentially as indicated in caruso et al 2014 furthermore during the implementation of irrigation treatments in the spring the shoot length was measured according to the methodology proposed by pierantozzi et al 2014 pit hardening was determined by slicing carefully through the median portion of developing fruits with a scalpel pit hardening was considered to be completed when resistance to cutting through the fruit pulp was detected at harvest time each individual tree was hand harvested and fruit yield was calculated for each irrigation treatment fruit samples 500 g each were milled using a universal cutting mill and then were dried in oven at 80 c until complete dehydration a portion of each dried sample 20 g was used for total oil content determination using soxhlet devices with n hexane as solvent iupac 1992 the solvent was removed using a rotary vacuum evaporator at 40 c and the oil content was gravimetrically determined both fruit and oil yields from each treatment were also estimated as a function of water received irrigation effective rainfall per area these yield estimations are known as water productivity wp and have been reported as useful parameters to evaluate the efficacy of irrigation management strategies correa tedesco et al 2010 pierantozzi et al 2014 2 4 statistical analysis statistical differences among irrigation treatments were estimated from anova test at the 5 level p 0 05 of significance for all parameters evaluated whenever anova indicated a significant difference a pair wise comparison of means by fisher s multiple range test was carried out by using infostat software infostat 2014 http www infostat com ar regression analyses were performed to establish relationships between physiological vegetative and productive parameters these analyses and the resulting plots were made using graphpad prism version 5 01 software graphpad prism software california usa 3 results 3 1 environmental conditions of the study site the three seasons evaluated had similar values of accumulated effective rainfall table 1 which was concentrated mostly during the summer months very little rainfall was registered during the application of the rdi treatments the average monthly values of relative humidity ranged between 38 9 72 3 2013 14 crop season 42 5 70 4 2014 15 and 51 7 74 9 2015 16 showing minimum values from november to january and maximum ones in april excepting february of 2015 16 crop season the highest monthly mean temperatures were recorded during december and january whereas in the period evaluated the lowest ones were registered in september regarding evapotranspiration rates december and april showed the highest and the lowest records in all crop seasons evaluated the total accumulated evapotranspiration demand during the periods evaluated was higher than 1250 mm the greatest value was recorded during the 2013 14 crop season to sum up at this point it could be said that rainfalls are clearly insufficient to compensate the crop evapotranspiration demand in the olive crop environment studied 3 2 plant water relations and gas exchange parameters fig 1 panels a b and c shows data on seasonal evolution of midday stem water potential ψstem from irrigation treatments over three crop seasons in general ψstem values from t75 treatment were fairly constant and close to those from the full irrigated treatment ψstem values from both t50 and t25 treatments were significantly lower than those from both t75 and t100 treatments these differences were noted approximately 30 days after beginning of rdi treatments in t50 the ψstem decreased progressively until values near 3 mpa thus suggesting severe water stress for both the second and the third crop years analyzed the ψstem values in t25 treatment were closed to 4 mpa differences between t50 and t25 treatments increased at the end of the rdi period during the last crop season analyzed fig 1c towards the end of the water stress period all rdi treatments differed significantly in ψstem values in all crop seasons evaluated once the deficit period ended and 15 days after that full irrigation 100 etc was restarted the control and all rdi treatments showed similar ψstem values however none of the treatments recovered the ψstem records measured prior to the beginning of the rdi treatments the ψstem data set obtained from all irrigation treatments during the three crop seasons studied were modeled with soil water content swc values fig 2 data could be adjusted to a bilinear regression with a phase of positive slope break point at ψstem values near 1 9 mpa 7 64 swc followed by a long plateau albeit with rather dispersed data on the other hand ψstem data from t100 irrigation treatment modelled with vapour pressure deficit vpd data adjusted well to a bilinear regression fig 3 a with a first phase in which ψstem values drop sharply break point close to 3 8 kpa of vpd and a second one in which they remain constant table 2 shows data of midday leaf conductance gs values measured in young and mature leaves from trees of the four studied irrigation treatments although this gas exchange parameter was found to be lower at the most stressed trees data from young leaves were not consistent major differences were detected only for mature leaves among all the irrigation treatments evaluated precisely a strong and significant relationship was only found between vpd fig 3b and the relative humidity of air r 0 60 p 0 05 in mature leaves on the contrary in young leaves no significant correlations were observed between these parameters 3 3 vegetative growth data from vegetative shoot growth are presented in fig 4 panels a b and c for this parameter the greatest differences between irrigation treatments were observed during the last crop season evaluated two weeks after the beginning of water deficit application the two most stressed treatments t25 and t50 showed significant decreases in vegetative shoot growth values with respect to those from both t75 and t100 treatments similarly during the first year the former named treatments also differentiated from the two latter ones but significant differences were noted one month after application of rdi treatments during the second year there were no significant variations in vegetative shoot growth among the evaluated irrigation treatments relationships between apical vegetative shoot growth rate and ψstem values from all irrigation treatments in each crop year evaluated fig 5 showed the strongest prediction for data from the 2013 14 crop season r2 0 54 this relationship was weaker r2 0 24 when data of all crop seasons evaluated were combined over the 3 year period full irrigated trees had trunk cross sectional area values higher than those from the deficit irrigated treatments fig 6 a c differences were conspicuous during all years evaluated trunk growth from trees at t25 t50 and t75 treatments decreased 49 23 and 11 in average respectively with respect to trees at t100 considering the whole experimental period three crop years the trunk area increased 243 215 209 and 177 in t100 t75 t50 and t25 treatments respectively in addition a linear relationship was observed between the trunk growth rate and ψstem by combining different levels of irrigation with different crop years fig 7 r2 0 37 fig 8 shows canopy volume data in all irrigation treatments and crop seasons analyzed a small but significant effect was noted in this vegetative growth parameter at the end of the first crop year this effect became far more marked from the second year when a stronger increase in canopy volume was observed according to the rising irrigation water volume at the end of this period the canopy growth of trees from t100 t75 and t50 treatments was 26 32 and 11 higher than that from t25 trees during the third year two months before the application of rdi treatments mechanical pruning was performed in such a way that all the trees had similar canopy volume regardless the received irrigation treatment at the end of this last crop year evaluated canopy growth in the two most irrigated treatments t100 and t75 was found to be significantly higher than those from the least irrigated ones t50 and t25 considering the whole experimental period three crop years the final canopy volume increased by about 500 t100 520 t75 400 t50 and 360 t25 with respect to the corresponding initial values in each irrigation treatment 3 4 productive parameters table 3 reports fruit yield and oil yield data with the exception of the first crop year analyzed in which fruit yield was higher in t100 than in all rdi treatments deficit irrigation did not affect significantly these productive parameters fruit and oil yields were also estimated as a function of the amount of irrigation water applied table 3 during both the first and the second crop seasons evaluated the treatments did not show significant differences in wp either estimated on fruit weight basis or on oil weight basis differently during the third crop season some differences in wp were noted the most stressed irrigation treatment t25 reached the highest records for both estimated wp indicators considering the whole experimental period three crop years this treatment also showed the highest wp calculated on a fruit weight basis fig 9 shows relationships between fruit yield and canopy volume data measured in the fruit set period the model adjusted to a quadratic equation r2 0 79 indicating higher fruit productivity as the canopy volume increases this fact could be observed until a plateau is reached at canopy volume values near to 18 m3 4 discussion a general agreement indicates ψstem values between 1 2 and 1 4 mpa as suitable threshold values for irrigating mature olive orchards moriana et al 2012 in the present study we used a low kc 0 4 value for irrigating at 100 etc for the winter months of june july and august as suggested by rousseaux et al 2008 and pierantozzi et al 2013 for semiarid regions in nw and central argentina and then switched to a higher kc of 0 68 for the rest of the year girona et al 2002 in the most irrigated treatments t75 and t100 such kc values allowed maintaining soil moisture content close to the field capacity on the other hand in the most stressed treatments t25 and t50 the swc 70 or lower correlated negatively with ψstem values for higher swc these latter could be more related to vpd values shackel et al 1998 evaluation of water requirements is a major concern in olive cultivation and ψstem assessment has emerged as a useful tool to monitor the response of the olive tree water status rainfall volume and distribution from many olive cultivation regions in the southern hemisphere are very different to those registered at the major cultivation sites in the mediterranean basin torres et al 2017 in regions with high vapor pressure deficit values such as those from central western and north western argentina ψstem values close to 2 mpa may not be indicative of water stress agüero alcaras et al 2016 in la rioja argentina found similar values to those reported here rallo and provenzano 2012 reported that s fell sharply from a plateau somewhere between 1 5 and 2 0 mpa when a certain threshold for soil water content was reached in our field trial we found values close to 2 mpa even when the swc is close to the field capacity besides that the low ψstem values near or below 2 mpa registered from the t100 treatment at late spring could indicate that the kc values we used would be insufficient to maintain the water status of full irrigated plants at appropriate levels for the environmental conditions of the studied growing site the stomatal conductance gs is other important physiological parameter to be used as a benchmark of water stress in olive giorio et al 1999 olive plants can efficiently satisfy the demand of co2 while restricting the loss of water to acceptable levels diaz espejo 2000 in the present study there were found differences among irrigation treatments 15 days after the water deficit application data not shown differences in gs among treatments were more evident in mature leaves that in young leaves these latter only showed differences between the most stressed treatment t25 and the non stressed one t100 this happened despite fully expanded equally sun exposed leaves were chosen from all irrigation treatments therefore it is suggested that factors other than leaf exposure to solar radiation could be involved in stomatal closure data of gs from mature leaves showed significant correlations with both vpd and relative humidity but no such relationships were found in young leaves all these observations could indicate that olive young leaves present an imperfect stomatal control regarding vegetative parameters data from the most stressed treatment t25 indicated significant reductions in vegetative shoot growth about 30 and 50 during 2013 14 and 2015 16 crop seasons respectively with respect to data from the full irrigation treatment significant decreases were also noted for the t50 treatment 20 and 37 respectively these results are in general agreement with those obtained in olive super intensive hedgerows evaluated in the same productive cycle we studied trentacoste et al 2019 many previous studies show that olive vegetative shoot growth is strongly dependent on the water supply grattan et al 2006 selles et al 2006 gómez del campo et al 2008 melgar et al 2008 puertas 2009 correa tedesco et al 2010 pierantozzi et al 2014 it is important to note however that there is a lack of robust information about the effect of water deficit in the phenological phase of major vegetative growth it should be taking in mind that in mediterranean basin countries autumn and or winter rains provide sufficient water for vegetative shoot growth flowering and subsequent fruit set besides to plant water status the vegetative growth depends from other factors such as temperature crop load and plant nutritional status unlike results from gomez del campo et al 2008 and moriana et al 2012 our data do not allow to clearly define ψstem threshold values below which vegetative shoot growth decreases nevertheless a direct relationship between ψstem and vegetative shoot growth rate is observed in all crop years studied with regard to other vegetative growth parameters both trunk and canopy growth kept a close direct relationship with ψstem the two most restrictive irrigation treatments t50 and t25 showed pronounced drops in ψstem values throughout the rdi periods in all crop years evaluated coincidently olive trees from these treatments showed significant reductions of both vegetative growth measurements in agreement with data reported elsewhere moriana and fereres 2002 iniesta et al 2009 our results on trunk and canopy growth indicate a rapid response of these vegetative growth parameters to irrigation in addition they are in good agreement with findings showing excessive vegetative growth in olive trees growing under warm spring temperatures and high irrigation rates correa tedesco et al 2010 gómez del campo 2013 in particular the canopy growth is particularly important when considering olive orchards trained in hedgerows because excessive crown volume hinders mechanized harvest by over row harvesters in a recent study it has been reported that pruned sides of hedgerow olive orchards are more responsive to irrigation water applied trentacoste et al 2019 in line with this finding we found stronger effects of deficit irrigation on vegetative growth parameters apical shoot growth and canopy volume when pruning was applied this could be due to one of the factors influencing vegetative growth such as the source sink relationship pierantozzi et al 2013 should be also taking in mind when considering pruning in the most irrigated treatments a larger number of potentially productive buds of the following year are pruned in relation to the most restrictive irrigation treatments so although pruning may be necessary it may cause a loss of potentially productive buds for the following year this latter in turn could lead to a source sink imbalance favoring an excessive vegetative growth and making necessary major pruning interventions in addition greater pruning intensity may favour the formation of watersprouts that have lower productive potential albarracín et al 2017 in this sense it creates a vicious circle pruning application should take into account both the crop environment and the crop system evaluated overall all these findings suggest the importance of spring rdi as a management practice to prevent excessive vegetative growth in this crop system evaluated moreover for olive hedgerow orchards growing in dry spring regions the convenience of water deficit during the spring should be considered as it could delay the first pruning of maintenance by at least one year regarding productive parameters data from each deficit irrigation treatment indicate that fruit yield kg ha increased significantly through the three considered years although in the first crop season fruit yield was greater in the full irrigation treatment at the end of the whole experimental period evaluated three crop years the mean values from this yield component did not present significant differences among all irrigation treatments similarly water availability did not affect oil yield kg ha no significant differences were found among irrigation treatments in any of the crop seasons analyzed to conclude at this point it could be said that trees were able to sustain the production potential even under the most stressed condition this could indicate a low sensitivity of fruit productivity to spring water limiting irrigation treatments in intensive hedgerow orchards formed to suit mechanized harvest by over row harvesters in olive trees the period comprising from spring to early summer is considered highly sensitive to water deficit since the actual fruit number is defined in shoots developed during the previous season morettini 1950 as mentioned previously after one year of differential water availability full irrigated trees showed higher fruit yields than deficit irrigated ones but latter fruit productivity tends to be equal this fact could be interpreted by considering the effect of fruit load due to higher fruit load of the previous season trees from the t100 treatment could have reduced fruit productivity starting from the second crop season thus leading to similar yields all over the irrigation treatments in hedgerows olive orchards once the optimum dimensions are reached the vigor control with means such as deficit irrigation other than pruning represents a viable alternative for enhancing productivity oil productivity was barely affected by water availability in spite of greater fruit productivity in full irrigated tress this fact could be explained considering the effect of the source sink ratio pierantozzi et al 2014 studying the effects of spring deficit irrigation in a conventional orchard from a non traditional environment these latter authors have found a compensation between fruit and oil yields in successive crop years thus the greater the amount of fruit produced the smaller the amount of oil obtained in olive water productivity wp has been reported as a useful parameter in order to assess the efficacy of irrigation management strategies moriana et al 2012 orgaz and fereres 2008 pierantozzi et al 2014 water availability did not affect this estimated productive response during the two first crop seasons analyzed however at the end of the last period evaluated estimations of wp based on both fruit weight and oil weight gave the highest values in the most restrictive irrigation treatment the same result was obtained considering averaged values from the whole experimental period three crop seasons studied these results could differ from those obtained in traditional olive orchards pierantozzi et al 2014 these authors found that water deficit imposed to olives trees during a long dry period winter and spring months in central argentina has a clear negative impact on productive parameters probably on a system where the vegetative growth is not limited as in many of the old traditional olive orchards the drought stress during spring would have negative effects on productivity so it is important highlight findings of the present study in light of the environmental conditions the crop system traditional or high density orchards and even of the olive cultivars tested 5 conclusions findings from this study contribute information on physiological vegetative and productive responses to spring deficit irrigation in olive trees under intensive hedgerow planting system under the environmental conditions evaluated high evapotranspiration and minimal rainfall during the spring months the usual ψstem reference values would not be adequate to define olive irrigation scheduling instead gs response from mature leaves appear to be suitable benchmarks of water availability and atmospheric conditions regarding vegetative parameters significant reductions in apical vegetative shoot growth trunk cross sectional area and canopy volume were found in less irrigated treatments t25 and t50 with respect to most irrigated ones t75 and t100 moreover the strongest effects of deficit irrigation were observed when pruning was applied at the end of the second crop season evaluated the effects of water availability on productive parameters were more evident when analyzed as an estimated productive response the so called irrigation water productivity calculated on both fruit weight and oil weight bases gave the highest values in the most restrictive irrigation

10582,this study was aimed to evaluate the effect of regulated deficit irrigation rdi applied from mid spring to early summer on physiological parameters vegetative growth and productivity in an intensive hedgerow olive orchard located in a non traditional marked winter spring water deficit olive growing region the experiments were carried out during three crop seasons by using four years old 7 m 3 5 m genovesa olive trees three rdi treatments t25 t50 and t75 were applied as a percentage of crop evapotranspiration 25 50 and 75 etc respectively during the period from fruit set to pit hardening also a control treatment was irrigated at 100 etc during the whole crop season under the analyzed environmental conditions stomatal conductance was less sensitive in young leaves than in mature leaves against changes in water availability this fact should be considered when being used as benchmarks in olives trees submitted to water deprivation during periods with marked water constraint regarding vegetative parameters significant reductions in apical vegetative shoot growth trunk cross sectional area and canopy volume were found in less irrigated treatments t25 and t50 with respect to most irrigated ones t75 and t100 moreover the strongest effects of deficit irrigation were observed when pruning was applied at the end of the second crop season evaluated both fruit and oil yields were barely affected by water availability although in the first crop season evaluated the fruit yield was greater in the full irrigation treatment which could be due to the age of the olive trees at the end of the whole experimental period three crop years the mean values from this yield component did not present significant differences among all irrigation treatments similarly water availability did not affect oil yield kg ha no significant differences were found among irrigation treatments in any of the crop seasons analyzed the effects of water availability on productive parameters were more evident when analyzed as an estimated productive response the total water productivity calculated on both fruit weight and oil weight bases gave the highest values in the most restrictive irrigation treatment overall findings from this study could be of interest for olive cultivation in regions with dry spring period and for intensive hedgerow orchards suited to over row harvesters imposing water restriction during this period could be suitable for achieving sustainable fruit and oil productivity while saving considerable amount of irrigation water keywords intensive hedgerow olive orchard regulated deficit irrigation non mediterranean environment physiological parameters vegetative responses water productivity 1 introduction olive olea europaea l is a well adapted crop to the environmental conditions prevailing in regions with typical mediterranean climate characterized by cool wet winters and hot dry summers connor 2005 in the two last decades the increasing demand of olive oil and table olives have encouraged olive cultivation in several regions of the southern hemisphere mainly in arid and semiarid areas from south america and australia torres et al 2017 in general these crop environments do not have typical mediterranean climate and some of them are in the subtropics where the response of the crop to a number of environmental conditions is not completely known yet particularly in the central western and north western regions of argentina where the biggest hectarage for olive cultivation is located approximately 100 000 ha warmed temperatures minimal rainfalls high evapotranspiration and intensifying water deficit take place during the winter and early spring months rousseaux et al 2008 pierantozzi et al 2013 as compared with typical olive growing regions in the mediterranean basin torres et al 2017 although olive is a well adapted crop to xeric environments water shortage is one of the most important constraints to fruit production orgaz and fereres 2008 the beneficial effect of irrigation on both fruit and oil yields is well documented moriana et al 2012 martín vertedor et al 2011 pierantozzi et al 2014 but unfortunately irrigation water availability is limited in most of the olive producing regions of the world regulated deficit irrigation rdi is a common practice used in olive cultivation it consists of a reduction in water supply to below crop water requirements during the most drought resistant phenological stages orgaz and fereres 2008 the main goal is to increase water productivity while providing some economic benefit without the need to maximize yield several rdi strategies varying mainly in the time period and the amount of irrigation water applied have been developed employing a variety of watering methods tognetti et al 2006 melgar et al 2008 iniesta et al 2009 most of these experiences in olive irrigation management were achieved in countries from the mediterranean basin where the soil moisture stored during the winter months is often sufficient to satisfy crop water demand during the spring when flowering and fruit set take place probably due to this fact rdi experiences for that time of the year have been of little concern rdi requires precise knowledge of the crop response to water deficit at different phenological phases to identify the periods when trees are less sensitive although results are far from conclusive because of the limited number of olive cultivars and environments studied a number of works provide some useful insights in that respect previous studies indicate the third phase of olive fruit growth when pit hardening occurs conde et al 2008 as a fruit phenological stage that could be little affected by water restriction goldhamer 1999 tovar et al 2002 thoma et al 2004 cano lamadrid et al 2015 collado gonzález et al 2016 fernández et al 2013 so in this phase it could be possible to save considerable amount of irrigation water without compromising production and even improve some aspects of the olive oil quality caruso et al 2014 dabbou et al 2015 morales sillero et al 2013 while it is true that rdi is mainly aimed to optimize water use in olive production this irrigation strategy has been also used as a management practice aimed to control excessive vegetative growth grattan et al 2006 rufat et al 2014 trentacoste et al 2015 this latter may be particularly important if olive trees cultivated in regions with warm spring temperatures such as those occurring in many regions of argentina and australia torres et al 2017 are maintained with high irrigation rates given that most stem growth takes place during the first two months following flowering rallo and suarez 1989 gómez del campo 2013 it is important to keep the crown volume within certain limits particularly in high density orchards suited to mechanical over row harvesters since high rates of vegetative growth produce greater canopy volume which in turn can hinder management practices and mechanical harvest pastor et al 2005 tognetti et al 2006 lavee et al 2007 therefore in olive trees growing under the aforementioned conditions water deficit applied from mid spring at once fruit set has initiated can be an option because shoots are still growing considering the high evapotranspiration demand and water shortage that take place during winter and spring months at many olive growing sites in the southern hemisphere it is important to improve the knowledge of different points related to the crop functions such as the responses to water deficit in certain phenological periods specifically there is insufficient information about the effect of water shortage during the period covering fruit setting pit hardening a pioneer study based on a single pot trial rapoport et al 2014 suggests that water deficit during early fruit development affects differently the growth rates of mesocarp and endocarp tissues but in any case it reduces the final fruit size ahumada orellana et al 2017 has showed that irrigation cut off applied from fruit set until massive pit hardening does not affect significantly yield components unless severe water deficit levels 5 mpa are reached although all these findings contribute to a better understanding of the fruit growth response to water availability there is still a strong need of research at field scale not only to assess productive parameters but also physiological and vegetative responses a recent study by trentacoste et al 2019 has evaluated the effect of the water deficit on different vegetative growth and reproductive parameters in a mechanically managed olive hedgerow planted at super high density these authors observed that deficit irrigation treatments achieved greater productions and effective control of plant vigour taking into account the previous results the objectives of the study were to evaluate physiological vegetative and productive responses to the different rdi treatments in a hedgerow genovesa olive orchard located in a hot dry region in central western argentina 2 materials and methods 2 1 plant material and experimental design the field experiment was conducted during three consecutive seasons in a commercial olive orchard olea europaea l cv genovesa located near cañada honda 32 01 52 45 s 68 33 38 12 w 618 m above sea level at san juan province in the central western region of argentina the climate of the area is arid with an average annual rainfall of 100 mm mostly concentrated in the summer the absolute maximum temperatures exceed 40 c while the absolute minimum temperatures vary between 5 c and 10 c below zero there is important both annual and daily thermal amplitudes being the highest in argentina the olive grove was established in october of 2009 year trees are spaced 7 m x 3 5 m about 408 trees ha the soil texture is sandy loam with a bulk density of 1 34 g cm3 a field capacity of 15 2 and a wilting point of 4 1 soil ph is typically basic 8 6 and poor in organic matter 0 72 in 0 20 cm depth and 0 26 in 20 80 cm depth the contents of nitrogen phosphorus and potassium are comprised between 300 400 ppm 6 5 7 5 ppm and 160 165 ppm respectively four irrigation treatments were considered including a control treatment irrigated at 100 of etc during the entire year t100 and three rdi treatments irrigated at 25 50 and 75 of etc respectively during a two month period from mid spring to early summer during the rest of the year t25 t50 and t75 treatments were irrigated at 100 of etc a randomized block design with three plots for each irrigation treatment was used each experimental plot consisted of five trees where the three central trees were selected for all measurements water was supplied by two self compensating in line drippers per plant delivering 2 l h each the irrigation requirements were calculated following the methodology proposed by allen et al 1998 using a simplified water balance method the crop evapotranspiration was estimated as etc eto x kc x kr where eto is the reference evapotranspiration kc is the crop coefficient and kr is the coefficient of reduction related to the percentage of area shaded by the canopy the eto was calculated using the penman monteith equation over grass ortega farias et al 1993 allen et al 1998 during the june august period a kc value equal to 0 4 was assumed as suggested by rousseaux et al 2008 for the rest of the year we used a kc value equal to 0 68 as proposed by girona et al 2002 the kr coefficient was calculated using the relation proposed by steduto et al 2012 2 2 stem water potential and gas exchange measurements stem water potential ψstem was measured at midday between 12 00 and 13 00 h every week from the beginning of the experimental treatments using a scholander type pressure chamber biocontrol buenos aires argentina according to pierantozzi et al 2013 the measurements were done on terminal branches that had been bagged in plastic envelopes covered with aluminium foil at least 2 h before measurements from each selected tree two short terminal branches of the current year with four or six fully expanded leaves were used branches were selected from the mid canopy on the shaded zones of the trees after detachment from the canopy branches were immediately enclosed in the pressure chamber stomatal conductance gs was measured using a leaf porometer sc1 decagon devices cambridge uk according to methodology proposed by carmassi et al 2013 measurements were also made once a week between 11 00 and 12 00 h from each selected tree four or two mature and young fully expanded leaves from north exposed mid canopy current year shoot were used pierantozzi et al 2013 2 3 vegetative growth and fruiting measurements the trunk cross sectional area at 40 cm from the ground and the canopy volume were measured essentially as indicated in caruso et al 2014 furthermore during the implementation of irrigation treatments in the spring the shoot length was measured according to the methodology proposed by pierantozzi et al 2014 pit hardening was determined by slicing carefully through the median portion of developing fruits with a scalpel pit hardening was considered to be completed when resistance to cutting through the fruit pulp was detected at harvest time each individual tree was hand harvested and fruit yield was calculated for each irrigation treatment fruit samples 500 g each were milled using a universal cutting mill and then were dried in oven at 80 c until complete dehydration a portion of each dried sample 20 g was used for total oil content determination using soxhlet devices with n hexane as solvent iupac 1992 the solvent was removed using a rotary vacuum evaporator at 40 c and the oil content was gravimetrically determined both fruit and oil yields from each treatment were also estimated as a function of water received irrigation effective rainfall per area these yield estimations are known as water productivity wp and have been reported as useful parameters to evaluate the efficacy of irrigation management strategies correa tedesco et al 2010 pierantozzi et al 2014 2 4 statistical analysis statistical differences among irrigation treatments were estimated from anova test at the 5 level p 0 05 of significance for all parameters evaluated whenever anova indicated a significant difference a pair wise comparison of means by fisher s multiple range test was carried out by using infostat software infostat 2014 http www infostat com ar regression analyses were performed to establish relationships between physiological vegetative and productive parameters these analyses and the resulting plots were made using graphpad prism version 5 01 software graphpad prism software california usa 3 results 3 1 environmental conditions of the study site the three seasons evaluated had similar values of accumulated effective rainfall table 1 which was concentrated mostly during the summer months very little rainfall was registered during the application of the rdi treatments the average monthly values of relative humidity ranged between 38 9 72 3 2013 14 crop season 42 5 70 4 2014 15 and 51 7 74 9 2015 16 showing minimum values from november to january and maximum ones in april excepting february of 2015 16 crop season the highest monthly mean temperatures were recorded during december and january whereas in the period evaluated the lowest ones were registered in september regarding evapotranspiration rates december and april showed the highest and the lowest records in all crop seasons evaluated the total accumulated evapotranspiration demand during the periods evaluated was higher than 1250 mm the greatest value was recorded during the 2013 14 crop season to sum up at this point it could be said that rainfalls are clearly insufficient to compensate the crop evapotranspiration demand in the olive crop environment studied 3 2 plant water relations and gas exchange parameters fig 1 panels a b and c shows data on seasonal evolution of midday stem water potential ψstem from irrigation treatments over three crop seasons in general ψstem values from t75 treatment were fairly constant and close to those from the full irrigated treatment ψstem values from both t50 and t25 treatments were significantly lower than those from both t75 and t100 treatments these differences were noted approximately 30 days after beginning of rdi treatments in t50 the ψstem decreased progressively until values near 3 mpa thus suggesting severe water stress for both the second and the third crop years analyzed the ψstem values in t25 treatment were closed to 4 mpa differences between t50 and t25 treatments increased at the end of the rdi period during the last crop season analyzed fig 1c towards the end of the water stress period all rdi treatments differed significantly in ψstem values in all crop seasons evaluated once the deficit period ended and 15 days after that full irrigation 100 etc was restarted the control and all rdi treatments showed similar ψstem values however none of the treatments recovered the ψstem records measured prior to the beginning of the rdi treatments the ψstem data set obtained from all irrigation treatments during the three crop seasons studied were modeled with soil water content swc values fig 2 data could be adjusted to a bilinear regression with a phase of positive slope break point at ψstem values near 1 9 mpa 7 64 swc followed by a long plateau albeit with rather dispersed data on the other hand ψstem data from t100 irrigation treatment modelled with vapour pressure deficit vpd data adjusted well to a bilinear regression fig 3 a with a first phase in which ψstem values drop sharply break point close to 3 8 kpa of vpd and a second one in which they remain constant table 2 shows data of midday leaf conductance gs values measured in young and mature leaves from trees of the four studied irrigation treatments although this gas exchange parameter was found to be lower at the most stressed trees data from young leaves were not consistent major differences were detected only for mature leaves among all the irrigation treatments evaluated precisely a strong and significant relationship was only found between vpd fig 3b and the relative humidity of air r 0 60 p 0 05 in mature leaves on the contrary in young leaves no significant correlations were observed between these parameters 3 3 vegetative growth data from vegetative shoot growth are presented in fig 4 panels a b and c for this parameter the greatest differences between irrigation treatments were observed during the last crop season evaluated two weeks after the beginning of water deficit application the two most stressed treatments t25 and t50 showed significant decreases in vegetative shoot growth values with respect to those from both t75 and t100 treatments similarly during the first year the former named treatments also differentiated from the two latter ones but significant differences were noted one month after application of rdi treatments during the second year there were no significant variations in vegetative shoot growth among the evaluated irrigation treatments relationships between apical vegetative shoot growth rate and ψstem values from all irrigation treatments in each crop year evaluated fig 5 showed the strongest prediction for data from the 2013 14 crop season r2 0 54 this relationship was weaker r2 0 24 when data of all crop seasons evaluated were combined over the 3 year period full irrigated trees had trunk cross sectional area values higher than those from the deficit irrigated treatments fig 6 a c differences were conspicuous during all years evaluated trunk growth from trees at t25 t50 and t75 treatments decreased 49 23 and 11 in average respectively with respect to trees at t100 considering the whole experimental period three crop years the trunk area increased 243 215 209 and 177 in t100 t75 t50 and t25 treatments respectively in addition a linear relationship was observed between the trunk growth rate and ψstem by combining different levels of irrigation with different crop years fig 7 r2 0 37 fig 8 shows canopy volume data in all irrigation treatments and crop seasons analyzed a small but significant effect was noted in this vegetative growth parameter at the end of the first crop year this effect became far more marked from the second year when a stronger increase in canopy volume was observed according to the rising irrigation water volume at the end of this period the canopy growth of trees from t100 t75 and t50 treatments was 26 32 and 11 higher than that from t25 trees during the third year two months before the application of rdi treatments mechanical pruning was performed in such a way that all the trees had similar canopy volume regardless the received irrigation treatment at the end of this last crop year evaluated canopy growth in the two most irrigated treatments t100 and t75 was found to be significantly higher than those from the least irrigated ones t50 and t25 considering the whole experimental period three crop years the final canopy volume increased by about 500 t100 520 t75 400 t50 and 360 t25 with respect to the corresponding initial values in each irrigation treatment 3 4 productive parameters table 3 reports fruit yield and oil yield data with the exception of the first crop year analyzed in which fruit yield was higher in t100 than in all rdi treatments deficit irrigation did not affect significantly these productive parameters fruit and oil yields were also estimated as a function of the amount of irrigation water applied table 3 during both the first and the second crop seasons evaluated the treatments did not show significant differences in wp either estimated on fruit weight basis or on oil weight basis differently during the third crop season some differences in wp were noted the most stressed irrigation treatment t25 reached the highest records for both estimated wp indicators considering the whole experimental period three crop years this treatment also showed the highest wp calculated on a fruit weight basis fig 9 shows relationships between fruit yield and canopy volume data measured in the fruit set period the model adjusted to a quadratic equation r2 0 79 indicating higher fruit productivity as the canopy volume increases this fact could be observed until a plateau is reached at canopy volume values near to 18 m3 4 discussion a general agreement indicates ψstem values between 1 2 and 1 4 mpa as suitable threshold values for irrigating mature olive orchards moriana et al 2012 in the present study we used a low kc 0 4 value for irrigating at 100 etc for the winter months of june july and august as suggested by rousseaux et al 2008 and pierantozzi et al 2013 for semiarid regions in nw and central argentina and then switched to a higher kc of 0 68 for the rest of the year girona et al 2002 in the most irrigated treatments t75 and t100 such kc values allowed maintaining soil moisture content close to the field capacity on the other hand in the most stressed treatments t25 and t50 the swc 70 or lower correlated negatively with ψstem values for higher swc these latter could be more related to vpd values shackel et al 1998 evaluation of water requirements is a major concern in olive cultivation and ψstem assessment has emerged as a useful tool to monitor the response of the olive tree water status rainfall volume and distribution from many olive cultivation regions in the southern hemisphere are very different to those registered at the major cultivation sites in the mediterranean basin torres et al 2017 in regions with high vapor pressure deficit values such as those from central western and north western argentina ψstem values close to 2 mpa may not be indicative of water stress agüero alcaras et al 2016 in la rioja argentina found similar values to those reported here rallo and provenzano 2012 reported that s fell sharply from a plateau somewhere between 1 5 and 2 0 mpa when a certain threshold for soil water content was reached in our field trial we found values close to 2 mpa even when the swc is close to the field capacity besides that the low ψstem values near or below 2 mpa registered from the t100 treatment at late spring could indicate that the kc values we used would be insufficient to maintain the water status of full irrigated plants at appropriate levels for the environmental conditions of the studied growing site the stomatal conductance gs is other important physiological parameter to be used as a benchmark of water stress in olive giorio et al 1999 olive plants can efficiently satisfy the demand of co2 while restricting the loss of water to acceptable levels diaz espejo 2000 in the present study there were found differences among irrigation treatments 15 days after the water deficit application data not shown differences in gs among treatments were more evident in mature leaves that in young leaves these latter only showed differences between the most stressed treatment t25 and the non stressed one t100 this happened despite fully expanded equally sun exposed leaves were chosen from all irrigation treatments therefore it is suggested that factors other than leaf exposure to solar radiation could be involved in stomatal closure data of gs from mature leaves showed significant correlations with both vpd and relative humidity but no such relationships were found in young leaves all these observations could indicate that olive young leaves present an imperfect stomatal control regarding vegetative parameters data from the most stressed treatment t25 indicated significant reductions in vegetative shoot growth about 30 and 50 during 2013 14 and 2015 16 crop seasons respectively with respect to data from the full irrigation treatment significant decreases were also noted for the t50 treatment 20 and 37 respectively these results are in general agreement with those obtained in olive super intensive hedgerows evaluated in the same productive cycle we studied trentacoste et al 2019 many previous studies show that olive vegetative shoot growth is strongly dependent on the water supply grattan et al 2006 selles et al 2006 gómez del campo et al 2008 melgar et al 2008 puertas 2009 correa tedesco et al 2010 pierantozzi et al 2014 it is important to note however that there is a lack of robust information about the effect of water deficit in the phenological phase of major vegetative growth it should be taking in mind that in mediterranean basin countries autumn and or winter rains provide sufficient water for vegetative shoot growth flowering and subsequent fruit set besides to plant water status the vegetative growth depends from other factors such as temperature crop load and plant nutritional status unlike results from gomez del campo et al 2008 and moriana et al 2012 our data do not allow to clearly define ψstem threshold values below which vegetative shoot growth decreases nevertheless a direct relationship between ψstem and vegetative shoot growth rate is observed in all crop years studied with regard to other vegetative growth parameters both trunk and canopy growth kept a close direct relationship with ψstem the two most restrictive irrigation treatments t50 and t25 showed pronounced drops in ψstem values throughout the rdi periods in all crop years evaluated coincidently olive trees from these treatments showed significant reductions of both vegetative growth measurements in agreement with data reported elsewhere moriana and fereres 2002 iniesta et al 2009 our results on trunk and canopy growth indicate a rapid response of these vegetative growth parameters to irrigation in addition they are in good agreement with findings showing excessive vegetative growth in olive trees growing under warm spring temperatures and high irrigation rates correa tedesco et al 2010 gómez del campo 2013 in particular the canopy growth is particularly important when considering olive orchards trained in hedgerows because excessive crown volume hinders mechanized harvest by over row harvesters in a recent study it has been reported that pruned sides of hedgerow olive orchards are more responsive to irrigation water applied trentacoste et al 2019 in line with this finding we found stronger effects of deficit irrigation on vegetative growth parameters apical shoot growth and canopy volume when pruning was applied this could be due to one of the factors influencing vegetative growth such as the source sink relationship pierantozzi et al 2013 should be also taking in mind when considering pruning in the most irrigated treatments a larger number of potentially productive buds of the following year are pruned in relation to the most restrictive irrigation treatments so although pruning may be necessary it may cause a loss of potentially productive buds for the following year this latter in turn could lead to a source sink imbalance favoring an excessive vegetative growth and making necessary major pruning interventions in addition greater pruning intensity may favour the formation of watersprouts that have lower productive potential albarracín et al 2017 in this sense it creates a vicious circle pruning application should take into account both the crop environment and the crop system evaluated overall all these findings suggest the importance of spring rdi as a management practice to prevent excessive vegetative growth in this crop system evaluated moreover for olive hedgerow orchards growing in dry spring regions the convenience of water deficit during the spring should be considered as it could delay the first pruning of maintenance by at least one year regarding productive parameters data from each deficit irrigation treatment indicate that fruit yield kg ha increased significantly through the three considered years although in the first crop season fruit yield was greater in the full irrigation treatment at the end of the whole experimental period evaluated three crop years the mean values from this yield component did not present significant differences among all irrigation treatments similarly water availability did not affect oil yield kg ha no significant differences were found among irrigation treatments in any of the crop seasons analyzed to conclude at this point it could be said that trees were able to sustain the production potential even under the most stressed condition this could indicate a low sensitivity of fruit productivity to spring water limiting irrigation treatments in intensive hedgerow orchards formed to suit mechanized harvest by over row harvesters in olive trees the period comprising from spring to early summer is considered highly sensitive to water deficit since the actual fruit number is defined in shoots developed during the previous season morettini 1950 as mentioned previously after one year of differential water availability full irrigated trees showed higher fruit yields than deficit irrigated ones but latter fruit productivity tends to be equal this fact could be interpreted by considering the effect of fruit load due to higher fruit load of the previous season trees from the t100 treatment could have reduced fruit productivity starting from the second crop season thus leading to similar yields all over the irrigation treatments in hedgerows olive orchards once the optimum dimensions are reached the vigor control with means such as deficit irrigation other than pruning represents a viable alternative for enhancing productivity oil productivity was barely affected by water availability in spite of greater fruit productivity in full irrigated tress this fact could be explained considering the effect of the source sink ratio pierantozzi et al 2014 studying the effects of spring deficit irrigation in a conventional orchard from a non traditional environment these latter authors have found a compensation between fruit and oil yields in successive crop years thus the greater the amount of fruit produced the smaller the amount of oil obtained in olive water productivity wp has been reported as a useful parameter in order to assess the efficacy of irrigation management strategies moriana et al 2012 orgaz and fereres 2008 pierantozzi et al 2014 water availability did not affect this estimated productive response during the two first crop seasons analyzed however at the end of the last period evaluated estimations of wp based on both fruit weight and oil weight gave the highest values in the most restrictive irrigation treatment the same result was obtained considering averaged values from the whole experimental period three crop seasons studied these results could differ from those obtained in traditional olive orchards pierantozzi et al 2014 these authors found that water deficit imposed to olives trees during a long dry period winter and spring months in central argentina has a clear negative impact on productive parameters probably on a system where the vegetative growth is not limited as in many of the old traditional olive orchards the drought stress during spring would have negative effects on productivity so it is important highlight findings of the present study in light of the environmental conditions the crop system traditional or high density orchards and even of the olive cultivars tested 5 conclusions findings from this study contribute information on physiological vegetative and productive responses to spring deficit irrigation in olive trees under intensive hedgerow planting system under the environmental conditions evaluated high evapotranspiration and minimal rainfall during the spring months the usual ψstem reference values would not be adequate to define olive irrigation scheduling instead gs response from mature leaves appear to be suitable benchmarks of water availability and atmospheric conditions regarding vegetative parameters significant reductions in apical vegetative shoot growth trunk cross sectional area and canopy volume were found in less irrigated treatments t25 and t50 with respect to most irrigated ones t75 and t100 moreover the strongest effects of deficit irrigation were observed when pruning was applied at the end of the second crop season evaluated the effects of water availability on productive parameters were more evident when analyzed as an estimated productive response the so called irrigation water productivity calculated on both fruit weight and oil weight bases gave the highest values in the most restrictive irrigation treatment overall the present work suggests the suitability of spring deficit irrigation in intensive hedgerow olive orchards formed to suit mechanized harvest by over row harvesters results demonstrate that it is possible to save considerable amount of irrigation water without affecting productivity so they could be of real practical interest although they should be confirmed in longer irrigation trials the use of other olive cultivars would be also desirable declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

introduction maize zea mays l is one of the most high yielding cereal crops with wide adaptability to diverse farming conditions in the tropical sub tropical and temperate climates jat et al 2006 timsina et al 2011 amiruzzaman and hossain 2015 maize is an excellent human food as well as animal feed and fodder crop ali et al 2009 globally the area under maize cultivation has increased rapidly in the recent past especially in the tropical and sub tropical climates of south and south east asia due to its high yield potential timsina et al 2010 2011 2018 and high demand by the dairy and poultry industries steinfeld et al 2006 thornton 2010 timsina et al 2011 maize is the third most important cereal crop in the world after rice and wheat fayza et al 2016 and is the second most important cereal crop in southeast asia after rice pasuquin et al 2012 in bangladesh a heavily populated country in south asia maize is an emerging cash crop for small and medium farm holders due to its high yield potential and increasing feed demand by poultry and fish industries ali et al 2009 hossain et al 2019 timsina et al 2010 2018 maize area in bangladesh from 2009 to 2018 increased from 0 17 to 0 44 m ha total production from 1 14 to 3 82 m t and average maize yield from 6 53 to 8 76 t ha 1 bbs 2018 the area increase was mainly accomplished by replacing the area under rabi winter crops such as wheat or boro rice water is a scarce resource globally including bangladesh limited water availability for agriculture is increasingly becoming an acute problem worldwide and due to competing uses of water in society it is now becoming a huge challenge to develop sustainable water use plans and to optimize water use for crop production zehnder et al 2003 cornish et al 2004 due to water scarcity only approximately 66 of the total cultivated area in bangladesh is irrigated bbs 2018 water availability is among the major constraints for maize production in the rabi dry season in south asia including bangladesh hence in recent years there has been a renewed and increasing focus to develop the novel irrigation techniques that result in the optimization of both yield and crop water productivity cwp of dry season crops such as maize or wheat timsina et al 2008 sadeghi et al 2015 gheysari et al 2015 in bangladesh maize is grown after rice by planting either in rows on raised beds or by random broadcasting of seeds followed by the traditional furrow or flood irrigation timsina et al 2011 ali et al 2016 sarker et al 2016 the traditional irrigation practices lower maize water productivity increase labor and total production costs with use of excess irrigation oversaturate soil and lower yield maize however cannot tolerate more than 24 h of saturated field conditions amiruzzaman and hossain 2015 maize yield can be reduced due to excess soil water and or nutrient and oxygen unavailability quanqi et al 2008 higher soil temperatures can also increase soil carbon losses soil evaporation and root maintenance and growth respiration costs gheysari et al 2016 due to high water scarcity in the dry season efforts to optimize water use in maize such as deficit irrigation di becomes an important strategy to manage water for maize cultivation di could become a norm in the future over traditional full irrigation under changes in climatic conditions i e declining rainfall and shrinking water sources fereres and siriano 2007 blanco conqui et al 2010 the growing population in south asia and in particular in bangladesh under limited land and water resources is becoming a great challenge together with rapid urbanization industrialization and frequent occurrences of natural hazards to achieve sustainable development sdg goals farmers friendly and sustainable di techniques are necessary for increasing cwp without yield penalty djaman and imrak 2012 however the application of di is lacking in south asia due to the lack of precise knowledge of such techniques di saves water by reducing transpiration through stomata closure and with minimal effect on crop yield kirda 2002 reported that field crops such as maize wheat potato and sunflower can adapt to di practices by reducing crop evapotranspiration during the growing season alternate furrow irrigation afi as an improved method of di could be applied in small scale farming systems where the sources and supplies of irrigation water are limited sarker et al 2016 2019 kang et al 2000 concluded that afi is a technique to reduce irrigation water use by up to 50 while maintaining a high grain yield of maize in arid regions this technique could be introduced for improving water productivity and other constraints associated with environmental and socio economic conditions reynolds et al 2015 the alternate partial root zone drying irrigation technique is not only effective than traditional irrigation for saving water but it is also environmentally friendly due to residual effect of n in the soils kirda et al 2005 the crop water and nutrient requirements are intimately linked with each other uptake of macro and micro nutrients are important for improving crop growth and development wu et al 2016 nutrients promote profuse and deeper root systems which enable crop plants to extract higher quantities of water and nutrients from deeper soil layers in south asia farmers are often tempted to apply more irrigation water leading to leaching down of available nutrients majumdar 2004 the effects of di levels and methods on nutrient uptake by the maize grains under field conditions have not been documented adequately in south asia wu et al 2016 kumari et al 2017 recently reported that rationalized water and nutrient supplies improve nutrient uptake and crop productivity kresovic et al 2016 showed that when irrigation was applied by reducing 25 water maize produced satisfactory grain yield increased water use efficiency and reduced nutrient losses hu et al 2008 reported that plants increase nutrient uptake from the wet part of soil in the rhizosphere to recover the reduced uptake of nutrients from the dry part alternate wetting and drying system can also create the secondary roots that enhance the plant growth by uptake of soil water and nutrients li et al 2007 hu et al 2009 researches have demonstrated that the alternate partial root drying irrigation techniques enhance soil n availability and contribute higher n concentration in maize leaves wang et al 2012 increase n p k ca and mg concentrations and quality in tomatoes sun et al 2014 sarker et al 2016 and increase tuber yield in potatoes sarker et al 2019 while the efficacy of irrigation depends on the type duration and management regime surface irrigation methods typically result in poor efficiency greaves and wang 2017 the afi method could be an alternative option in situations where precipitation labor and access to irrigation infrastructure are limited with this method water is applied alternately in time to furrows that were previously kept dry majumdar 2009 many studies kang et al 2000 kang and zhang 2004 li et al 2007 gheysari et al 2015 2016 have been conducted in asia to save water and improve the water productivity for maize cultivation in those studies partial drying of the root system was found to reduce water use and increase cwp with either a small reduction in or significant increases in yield that was dependent on the irrigation management and type many developed and developing countries have widely studied and reported the results of di the goal of such studies was to increase crop yield and cwp by reducing the number and volume of irrigation water english 1990 english and raja 1996 kang et al 2017 reviewed many studies and reported that the technique of alternate partial root drying irrigation increased cwp by 64 49 and 41 greater than traditional full irrigation for different field crops without any yield loss in bangladesh and largely in south asia though some di practices have been found to increase the cwp of maize khan et al 1992 roy et al 1992 biswas et al 2002 sarkar et al 2012 no peer reviewed studies are evaluating the performance of afi on dry winter season maize which is rapidly expanding in the region the interactive effects of different irrigation methods and irrigation levels have yet to be fully tested against a suite of maize management practices under field conditions identification of optimum irrigation method and irrigation level would help increase yield and save water and expand dry season rabi maize production not only in bangladesh but in south asia as a whole we hypothesize that the alternate root drying through afi and reduced level of irrigation water applied based on field capacity of soil can increase grain yield and water productivity of maize compared to conventional irrigation methods such as traditional furrow or full flood irrigation to test this hypothesis the

and mn in maize grains were determined with standard methods jahan et al 2016 hossain et al 2016 2 6 experimental design this is a factorial experiment with three irrigation levels and three irrigation methods the irrigation levels were aimed at irrigating the crop to maintain soil water at 100 field capacity fc i1 80 fc i2 and 60 fc i3 respectively the three irrigation methods were afi alternate furrow irrigation sffi skip fixed furrow irrigation and tfi traditional furrow irrigation irrigation levels were nested within the irrigation methods the treatments were arranged in a nested plot design with three replications consisting of a total of 27 plots 3 3 3 27 each plot was separated by 2 m as a buffer to prevent the lateral movement of water from one treatment plot to another each plot size was 6 m 3 6 m in the afi treatment water was applied to irrigate the alternative furrows in the sequent irrigation periods water was applied to the furrows that were dry during the previous irrigation event and in the subsequent irrigation the furrows were irrigated while furrows were kept dry and so on in the sffi treatment water was applied to a skip fixed furrow with the two adjacent furrows one on each side remaining dry this approach remained the same from the first to the last irrigation in tfi water was applied in all the furrows in each irrigation period i e water was applied on both sides of the root system in each irrigation period there were four irrigation events applied to all the treatments over the experimental period that were timed to apply irrigation at different growth stages michael 1978 reddi and reddy 1995 the selected growth stages were initial growth 25 30 days after sowing das tasseling 55 60 das silking 85 90 das and grain development 110 115 das the gravimetric soil samples for irrigation were collected from the soil depth of 0 45 cm at the initial stage 0 60 cm at tasseling and silking stage and 0 75 cm at the grain development stage with 15 cm increments 0 15 15 30 30 45 45 60 60 75 cm which are given in the methodological approach 2 7 calculation irrigation water water use efficiency and water savings the amount of irrigation water required to fill the root zone to field capacity was calculated following the procedure of michael 1978 mandal and dutta 1995 and sarker et al 2019 and using the following equation 1 i i 1 n f c i m c i 100 b i d i where i is the depth of irrigation water cm bi is the bulk density of the ith layer of the soil g cm 3 di is the depth of the ith layer of the soil within the root zone to be irrigated cm fci is the soil moisture content at field capacity at each layer mci is the soil moisture content before each irrigation at each layer and n is the number of soil layers in the root zone depth d cm the gravimetric fc was determined by the ponding water method michael 1978 soil samples were collected with the help of a soil augur for estimating gravimetric soil moisture content before each irrigation application in this study we didn t measure the rooting depth of maize but visual observations revealed that most roots were concentrated in surface 0 30 cm depth kuchenbuch et al 2009 and nichols et al 2019 reported that a major part of the maize root system is found in 0 30 cm depth michael 1978 stated that it is not necessarily to the maximum root depth for any given plant about 40 and 30 water uptake by the 1st and 2nd quarter of the root zone in the upper soil layer and 20 and 10 water uptake by the 3rd and 4th quarter of the root zone in the deeper soil layer in this study soil samples were taken for considering the root zone depth of 0 45 cm depth at the initial stage 0 60 cm depth at tasseling and silking stages and 0 75 cm depth at the grain development stage before each irrigation event soils were sampled in 15 cm increments the amount of applied irrigation water i table 2 was the depth of water needed to refill the soil profile 0 45 0 60 and 0 75 cm respectively at the initial tasseling and silking and grain development stages to different levels of fc the estimated amount of irrigation water was measured by the volumetric method and supplied to the experimental plots using a polyethylene hose pipe 50 8 mm inches diameter by pumping water from the underground water sources the water flow meter was used for supplying the calculated amount of irrigation water the seasonal crop water use cwu was calculated as the sum of water inputs from all irrigation events precipitation and soil water contribution i e the difference between the beginning and the end of the study and expressed by the approach of soil water balance equation michael 1978 djaman and irmak 2012 sarker et al 2016 2019 murad et al 2018 2 c w u i p e δ s w c c r d p r o where cwu is crop water use cm dp is deep percolation water cm ro is runoff cr is the amount of capillary rise water cm δ s w c is the change in soil water content between sowing and harvesting cm pe is effective rainfall cm and i is the amount of irrigation water per season cm there was no drainage or deep percolation during each irrigation event because irrigation water was based on soil water content and applied only to fc each plot was separated by 2 m distance with compacted levees to prevent the movement of water from one plot to another hence there was no runoff the capillary rise is closely related to the groundwater table in this study region gazipur under aez 28 the groundwater level generally ranges from 32 5 m in november to 35 2 m in may resulting in the negligible capillary rise parvin et al 2017 therefore parameters of dp ro and cr were considered to be zero effective rainfall pe was calculated as per smith 1992 and alauddin et al 2014 using the following equations 3 p

al 2019 5 δ s w c n i n m c s i m c h i 100 b i d i where mcsi is soil water content at sowing and mch i is soil water content at harvest in the ith layers of soil depth 0 75 cm with 15 cm soil increments the crop water productivity cwp kg m 3 was calculated for evaluating the efficient use of irrigation water for grain production with the following equation mahajan et al 2009 wang et al

nutrient uptake by grain and cwp were statistically analyzed using an analysis of variance anova with r foundation for statistical computing platform r version 3 5 0 all the treatment means were compared for significant differences with an of 1 or 5 and using a p value of 0 01 or 0 05 least square means were generated for treatments irrigation levels and methods that had a significant effect on dry matter grain yield grain nutrient uptake and cwp 3 results and discussion the afi based on partial root zone drying is an innovative water saving irrigation technique that has the potential to increase water productivity without yield reduction kang and zhang 2004 this technique involves approximately half of the root system being exposed to dry soil while the remaining half irrigated normally there are many studies on the effects of partial root zone irrigation on the physiology growth nutrient uptake and water productivity of crops kang and zhang 2004 li et al 2007 hu et al 2009 prolonged soil drying could reduce the mass of succulent roots and make the main roots essentially pipes for water conduction rewetting the soil could then encourage the initiation and growth of secondary roots liang et al 1996 and could recover the roots sensitivity to soil drying zhang and tardieu 1996 besides roots developed under alternate drying and wetting of soil may lead to the better use of soil nutrients from the entire root zone the present study therefore aimed to assess the yield performance nutrient uptake and cwp of maize under three irrigation methods and three irrigations levels with a hypothesis that afi and deficit irrigation can maintain grain yield and increase nutrient uptake and cwp compared to the existing high water requiring methods practiced by farmers 3 1 crop performance 3 1 1 dry matter accumulation there were significant effects of irrigation method and level on dry matter production at different growth stages of maize in both years fig 2 the interactive effects of irrigation level and method also significantly p 0 01 affected the dry matter yield in different stages fig 3 dry matter yield was significantly higher for i1 and decreased when the irrigation level was reduced to i2 to i3 fig 2a c dry matter yield also significantly differed among the irrigation methods fig 2b d methods afi and tfi produced significantly higher dry matter compared to sffi fig 3 the interactive effect of irrigation level and method fig 3 showed that the reduced amount of irrigation water significantly reduced the maize dry matter the same level of irrigation produced dry matter with an insignificant difference between afi and tfi but the effect was significant for sffi the findings of the present study are consistent with earlier studies in which crop yields were higher with the partial root drying technique than with the application of deficit irrigation resulting in significant improvement of cwp kang et al 1998 kirda et al 2005 kang and zhang 2004 liu et al 2007 shahnazari et al 2007 in the partial root dying technique more abscisic acid aba was produced than in the traditional flood irrigation and increased the aba controlled stomata opening and closure through root to shoot signal that leads to increase in biomass of the growing crops which ultimately increases the grain yield kang and zhang 2004 bauerle et al 2006 this phenomenon also controls unwanted vegetative growth as well as reduced leaf expansion of maize bahrun et al 2002 potato liu et al 2006 and tomato topçu et al 2007 through reducing the development of plant root systems grown under drought stress taiz and zeiger 2006 3 1 2 yield and yield contributing parameters there were significant interactive effects of irrigation method and level on the grain yield and yield contributing parameters i e cob length cob diameter and number of grains and grain weight per cob of maize table 3 grain yield under tfi was higher compared to the other two methods when irrigated at 100 of fc during the crop growing season of 2014 2015 the yield contributing parameters were however non significant between afi and tfi at different levels of irrigation but performed better than afi in both years the afi method produced 1 7 higher grain yield than tfi when irrigated up to 100 fc in 2015 16 table 3 the tfi method also produced around 1 table 3 higher grain yield than with afi when irrigated up to 100 of fc the amount of irrigation water used in afi was lower than in tfi at 100 fc in 2014 2015 in the combined analysis there were no significant differences in maize yield between afi 8 13 t ha 1 and tfi 8 10 t ha 1 and no differences in yield contributing characters when irrigated with 100 fc over the two growing seasons table 3 there was a consistent trend for similar yield in afi and tfi and lower yield in sffi when the irrigation level was drastically reduced from i1 to i3 this was due to limited root growth water stress and nutrient uptake for prolonged soil drying in one side of the plant roots the results indicated that when less amount of irrigation water was applied there was no yield reduction with afi but yield reduction was significant with sffi with all levels of irrigation the afi method maintained approximately similar grain yield to tfi but with almost 37 reduction in irrigation water in maize water stress delays silking by increasing the anthesis to silking interval and reduces yield this trait i e anthesis to silking interval is highly correlated with grain yield by increasing ear and kernel numbers per plant cattivelli et al 2008 kang et al 1998 2000 and kang and zhang 2004 also used the partial root drying technique in maize by applying water as alternate wetting and drying consistent with the current study alternate wetting and drying irrigation technique resulted in higher yield with 50 reduction of irrigation water while fixed and traditional root drying irrigation techniques resulted in lower yields similarly inconsistent with our study sepaskhah and khajehabdollahi 2005 also reported that irrigating maize by skipping every furrow alternately maintained yield and reduced the irrigation water by 6 compared with flood irrigation in which every furrow was irrigated at four day intervals 3 2 effect of irrigation level and method on nutrient uptake by maize grain table 4 shows the uptake of macronutrients n p k s ca and mg and micronutrients b zn fe and mn by maize grain at harvest in the two years of experimentation the uptakes of macro and micro nutrients by maize grain were significantly different among the three irrigation levels and three irrigation methods table 4 in both years n uptake by maize grain was not significantly different between afi and tfi when irrigation water was applied at 100 of fc i1 maize grains under afi had greater n uptake with i2 compared to i3 the p uptake by maize grains on the other hand was higher in afi with i2 and ssfi with i1 than in other treatment combinations the k uptake was higher but similar for all three irrigation methods under i1 compared to other combinations the micronutrient uptake by grain was also higher under i1 irrespective of the method of irrigation water application table 4 the grain s uptake was also higher under tfi and afi with either i1 or i2 than other treatment combinations in the second year also there were similar uptakes of macro and micro nutrients though the differences were more conspicuous than in the first year table 4 the results indicated that the uptakes of macro and micro nutrients could be increased when maize is irrigated based on irrigation water application at 100 fc and that the uptakes can decrease when water is applied at less than 100 fc nevertheless the nutrient uptake with 20 reduced irrigation water i e 80 fc was also high for all the irrigation methods employed the results of the current study agree with several findings with deficit irrigation reported in the literature for example an earlier study has shown that the n loss due to leaching during the maize cropping could be reduced by reducing the water application e g gehl et al 2005 others have shown that applying a higher amount of irrigation water to meet crop water requirements could increase the soil residual n after harvest sánchez martín et al 2010 gabriel et al 2012 farooq et al 2009 reported that the crop water and nutrient requirements are closely related and hence fertilizer application has the potential to increase the crop efficiency to utilize the available water it is a proven fact that transpiration can be inhibited by drought but it may not affect nutrient uptake in the same way as transpiration this study indicates that crop yields could be substantially improved by enhancing nutrient efficiency under limited moisture supply in this study applying organic manure probably increased the soil available p content an increase in available p in turn could restrict the phosphatase secreted from maize roots vance et al 2003 studies are demonstrating that the partial root zone irrigation technique in maize can have a greater effect on soil enzyme activities and maize water use efficiency if organic n sources are applied compared to inorganic sources farooq et al 2009 also reported that irrigation method as well as the proportion of inorganic and organic n could affect the soil enzymatic activities this in turn could influence the soil nutrient availability and maize growth and development skinner et al 1999 reported that the afi successfully increased crop n uptake and reduced the potential for no3 leaching likewise in the studies of shi and kang 2000 and han and kang 2002 the ability of roots to absorb nutrients was improved by the alternate wetting and drying in both horizontal and vertical soil profiles han and kang 2002 concluded that the alternate partial root zone irrigation technique increased total n and p uptakes and use efficiencies compared to continuous flood irrigation kumari et al 2017 also reported that when a maize hybrid variety is irrigated based on irrigation scheduling at 25 deficit of available soil moisture it could result in higher yield with higher uptakes of major nutrients 3 3 crop water productivity and water savings the cwp was significantly different between the irrigation methods and irrigation levels in both years the mean cwp over two years ranged from 1 90 to 3 06 kg m 3 table 5 as expected the highest mean cwp 3 09 kg m 3 was obtained with afi due to high yield and low crop water use on the other hand the lowest mean cwp 1 75 2 16 kg m 3 was obtained with tfi table 5 both the irrigation method and irrigation level were important for defining important differences in cwp the cwp was greatest for i1 and lowest for i3 these results are in agreement with previous findings kang et al 1998 2000 kang and zhang 2004 who stated that cwp varied from around 2 7 5 kg m 3 without significant yield reductions the results opined that more water supply does not necessarily result in more crop yield and grain yield is not significantly reduced by afi in the semiarid regions the results of our study indicated that while the irrigation amount drives the patterns for grain yield the irrigation method drives the patterns for cwp table 5 results also showed that the afi technique had the highest cwp compared to tfi due to the lower amount of irrigation water used and higher grain yield table 5 the afi technique had higher cwp compared to the other two methods at the same level of irrigation as these treatments produced nearly similar yield and required a lower amount of irrigation water for maize cultivation table 5 the afi method saved cwu by 39 35 and 33 in 2014 2015 and by 36 34 and 30 in 2015 2016 compared to tfi when irrigated with i1 i2 and i3 respectively table 5 over the two years the afi technique saved cwu by 37 34 and 31 when irrigated with i1 i2 and i3 respectively table 5 the tfi technique noticeably resulted in the lowest cwp as this did not produce significantly higher yield at different levels of irrigation amount these results indicated that the afi technique maintained the desired yield when re watering was carried out alternately as a result the cwp improved substantially with afi on average afi had cwu greater by around 38 33 and 31 than tfi when irrigation water was applied with i1 i2 and i3 respectively table 5 thus afi is an effective water saving irrigation method in which efficient soil moisture utilization improves soil enzymatic activities and crop water use it is a useful irrigation water application method where water resources and the quantity of irrigation water are limited for maize cultivation and hence afi could potentially save large amounts of water for irrigation kang et al 1998 reported that compared to conventional watering alternate partial root zone irrigation apri reduced water consumption of maize by 35 with a total biomass reduction of only 6 11 for field crops such as maize apri could maintain high grain yield with an almost 50 reduction in irrigation water kang et al 2000 indeed partial root zone irrigation creates an uneven distribution of soil moisture that may affect many things including the activities of many soil enzymes li et al 2010 under water stress conditions that are associated with dry soil aba is produced in roots and then is translocated to the leaves this process causes stomata closure and controls transpiration by preventing excess water loss steuer et al 1988 du et al 2015 thus apri may substantially reduce water loss though it would have little effect on the rate of photosynthesis kang and zhang 2004 hence where water resources or irrigation facilities are limited the afi technique could be a potential option for optimizing the maize yield while reducing the irrigation water use and increasing the cwp for maize cultivation in the dry season for the areas with sub tropical climatic conditions in south asia 4 conclusions based on two years study we conclude that the afi technique with irrigation water application at 100 fc is best in terms of saving irrigation water improving the cwp and grain nutrient uptake and increasing grain yield of maize the afi and tfi techniques with irrigation amounting to 100 of fc can result in a similar yield of around 8 1 t ha 1 however compared to tfi afi can save seasonal cwu by 37 34 and 31 when irrigated to 100 80 and 60 of fc respectively the uptakes of macro and micronutrients by maize grain are maintained similarly when it is irrigated with water application at 100 of fc we conclude that under limited water supply conditions afi can substantially improve cwp without significant reductions in grain yield and its components and grain nutrient uptake by maize we therefore suggest that the afi could be recommended for sustainably intensifying the maize production in the sub tropical climates of south asia where the sources and supplies of irrigation water in the dry season are limited financial support this research was undertaken through the core research

10583,water scarcity is becoming a major constraint for maize cultivation and increasing maize yield globally water saving irrigation methods are required to increase crop water productivity cwp without reducing grain yield and nutrient uptake we evaluated the effects of different methods and levels of irrigation on crop dry matter grain yield nutrient uptake and cwp of maize cv bari hybrid bhutta 9 in field condition in a sub tropical environment in bangladesh the experiment was laid out in a nested plot design with three replications during 2014 15 and 2015 16 the treatments were three irrigation levels i1 100 field capacity fc i2 80 fc i3 60 fc and three irrigation methods afi alternate furrow irrigation sffi skip fixed furrow irrigation and tfi traditional furrow irrigation results indicate that both the irrigation method and level had significant effects on dry matter grain yield nutrient uptake and cwp the afi technique maintained similar grain yield 8 1 t ha 1 to tfi but reduced irrigation water by 37 for irrigation applied at 100 of fc both afi and tfi had significantly higher p 0 05 grain yield compared to sffi at the irrigation level of i2 the interactive effect of irrigation level and method also had a significant effect p 0 05 on maize yield the uptakes of macronutrients n p k s ca and mg and micronutrients b zn fe and mn by maize grain were not significantly different between afi and tfi under i1 irrigation level was the main driver for determining the patterns in grain yield but irrigation method controlled the patterns in cwp the afi technique resulted in higher cwp compared to tfi or sffi results demonstrate that afi is an effective water saving technique which can increase the cwp without a significant reduction in grain yield and nutrients uptake by maize grain the afi method in conjunction with a reduced amount of irrigation water can be adapted in the sub tropical climates of south asia where maize production in the dry

introduction maize zea mays l is one of the most high yielding cereal crops with wide adaptability to diverse farming conditions in the tropical sub tropical and temperate climates jat et al 2006 timsina et al 2011 amiruzzaman and hossain 2015 maize is an excellent human food as well as animal feed and fodder crop ali et al 2009 globally the area under maize cultivation has increased rapidly in the recent past especially in the tropical and sub tropical climates of south and south east asia due to its high yield potential timsina et al 2010 2011 2018 and high demand by the dairy and poultry industries steinfeld et al 2006 thornton 2010 timsina et al 2011 maize is the third most important cereal crop in the world after rice and wheat fayza et al 2016 and is the second most important cereal crop in southeast asia after rice pasuquin et al 2012 in bangladesh a heavily populated country in south asia maize is an emerging cash crop for small and medium farm holders due to its high yield potential and increasing feed demand by poultry and fish industries ali et al 2009 hossain et al 2019 timsina et al 2010 2018 maize area in bangladesh from 2009 to 2018 increased from 0 17 to 0 44 m ha total production from 1 14 to 3 82 m t and average maize yield from 6 53 to 8 76 t ha 1 bbs 2018 the area increase was mainly accomplished by replacing the area under rabi winter crops such as wheat or boro rice water is a scarce resource globally including bangladesh limited water availability for agriculture is increasingly becoming an acute problem worldwide and due to competing uses of water in society it is now becoming a huge challenge to develop sustainable water use plans and to optimize water use for crop production zehnder et al 2003 cornish et al 2004 due to water scarcity only approximately 66 of the total cultivated area in bangladesh is irrigated bbs 2018 water availability is among the major constraints for maize production in the rabi dry season in south asia including bangladesh hence in recent years there has been a renewed and increasing focus to develop the novel irrigation techniques that result in the optimization of both yield and crop water productivity cwp of dry season crops such as maize or wheat timsina et al 2008 sadeghi et al 2015 gheysari et al 2015 in bangladesh maize is grown after rice by planting either in rows on raised beds or by random broadcasting of seeds followed by the traditional furrow or flood irrigation timsina et al 2011 ali et al 2016 sarker et al 2016 the traditional irrigation practices lower maize water productivity increase labor and total production costs with use of excess irrigation oversaturate soil and lower yield maize however cannot tolerate more than 24 h of saturated field conditions amiruzzaman and hossain 2015 maize yield can be reduced due to excess soil water and or nutrient and oxygen unavailability quanqi et al 2008 higher soil temperatures can also increase soil carbon losses soil evaporation and root maintenance and growth respiration costs gheysari et al 2016 due to high water scarcity in the dry season efforts to optimize water use in maize such as deficit irrigation di becomes an important strategy to manage water for maize cultivation di could become a norm in the future over traditional full irrigation under changes in climatic conditions i e declining rainfall and shrinking water sources fereres and siriano 2007 blanco conqui et al 2010 the growing population in south asia and in particular in bangladesh under limited land and water resources is becoming a great challenge together with rapid urbanization industrialization and frequent occurrences of natural hazards to achieve sustainable development sdg goals farmers friendly and sustainable di techniques are necessary for increasing cwp without yield penalty djaman and imrak 2012 however the application of di is lacking in south asia due to the lack of precise knowledge of such techniques di saves water by reducing transpiration through stomata closure and with minimal effect on crop yield kirda 2002 reported that field crops such as maize wheat potato and sunflower can adapt to di practices by reducing crop evapotranspiration during the growing season alternate furrow irrigation afi as an improved method of di could be applied in small scale farming systems where the sources and supplies of irrigation water are limited sarker et al 2016 2019 kang et al 2000 concluded that afi is a technique to reduce irrigation water use by up to 50 while maintaining a high grain yield of maize in arid regions this technique could be introduced for improving water productivity and other constraints associated with environmental and socio economic conditions reynolds et al 2015 the alternate partial root zone drying irrigation technique is not only effective than traditional irrigation for saving water but it is also environmentally friendly due to residual effect of n in the soils kirda et al 2005 the crop water and nutrient requirements are intimately linked with each other uptake of macro and micro nutrients are important for improving crop growth and development wu et al 2016 nutrients promote profuse and deeper root systems which enable crop plants to extract higher quantities of water and nutrients from deeper soil layers in south asia farmers are often tempted to apply more irrigation water leading to leaching down of available nutrients majumdar 2004 the effects of di levels and methods on nutrient uptake by the maize grains under field conditions have not been documented adequately in south asia wu et al 2016 kumari et al 2017 recently reported that rationalized water and nutrient supplies improve nutrient uptake and crop productivity kresovic et al 2016 showed that when irrigation was applied by reducing 25 water maize produced satisfactory grain yield increased water use efficiency and reduced nutrient losses hu et al 2008 reported that plants increase nutrient uptake from the wet part of soil in the rhizosphere to recover the reduced uptake of nutrients from the dry part alternate wetting and drying system can also create the secondary roots that enhance the plant growth by uptake of soil water and nutrients li et al 2007 hu et al 2009 researches have demonstrated that the alternate partial root drying irrigation techniques enhance soil n availability and contribute higher n concentration in maize leaves wang et al 2012 increase n p k ca and mg concentrations and quality in tomatoes sun et al 2014 sarker et al 2016 and increase tuber yield in potatoes sarker et al 2019 while the efficacy of irrigation depends on the type duration and management regime surface irrigation methods typically result in poor efficiency greaves and wang 2017 the afi method could be an alternative option in situations where precipitation labor and access to irrigation infrastructure are limited with this method water is applied alternately in time to furrows that were previously kept dry majumdar 2009 many studies kang et al 2000 kang and zhang 2004 li et al 2007 gheysari et al 2015 2016 have been conducted in asia to save water and improve the water productivity for maize cultivation in those studies partial drying of the root system was found to reduce water use and increase cwp with either a small reduction in or significant increases in yield that was dependent on the irrigation management and type many developed and developing countries have widely studied and reported the results of di the goal of such studies was to increase crop yield and cwp by reducing the number and volume of irrigation water english 1990 english and raja 1996 kang et al 2017 reviewed many studies and reported that the technique of alternate partial root drying irrigation increased cwp by 64 49 and 41 greater than traditional full irrigation for different field crops without any yield loss in bangladesh and largely in south asia though some di practices have been found to increase the cwp of maize khan et al 1992 roy et al 1992 biswas et al 2002 sarkar et al 2012 no peer reviewed studies are evaluating the performance of afi on dry winter season maize which is rapidly expanding in the region the interactive effects of different irrigation methods and irrigation levels have yet to be fully tested against a suite of maize management practices under field conditions identification of optimum irrigation method and irrigation level would help increase yield and save water and expand dry season rabi maize production not only in bangladesh but in south asia as a whole we hypothesize that the alternate root drying through afi and reduced level of irrigation water applied based on field capacity of soil can increase grain yield and water productivity of maize compared to conventional irrigation methods such as traditional furrow or full flood irrigation to test this hypothesis the

and mn in maize grains were determined with standard methods jahan et al 2016 hossain et al 2016 2 6 experimental design this is a factorial experiment with three irrigation levels and three irrigation methods the irrigation levels were aimed at irrigating the crop to maintain soil water at 100 field capacity fc i1 80 fc i2 and 60 fc i3 respectively the three irrigation methods were afi alternate furrow irrigation sffi skip fixed furrow irrigation and tfi traditional furrow irrigation irrigation levels were nested within the irrigation methods the treatments were arranged in a nested plot design with three replications consisting of a total of 27 plots 3 3 3 27 each plot was separated by 2 m as a buffer to prevent the lateral movement of water from one treatment plot to another each plot size was 6 m 3 6 m in the afi treatment water was applied to irrigate the alternative furrows in the sequent irrigation periods water was applied to the furrows that were dry during the previous irrigation event and in the subsequent irrigation the furrows were irrigated while furrows were kept dry and so on in the sffi treatment water was applied to a skip fixed furrow with the two adjacent furrows one on each side remaining dry this approach remained the same from the first to the last irrigation in tfi water was applied in all the furrows in each irrigation period i e water was applied on both sides of the root system in each irrigation period there were four irrigation events applied to all the treatments over the experimental period that were timed to apply irrigation at different growth stages michael 1978 reddi and reddy 1995 the selected growth stages were initial growth 25 30 days after sowing das tasseling 55 60 das silking 85 90 das and grain development 110 115 das the gravimetric soil samples for irrigation were collected from the soil depth of 0 45 cm at the initial stage 0 60 cm at tasseling and silking stage and 0 75 cm at the grain development stage with 15 cm increments 0 15 15 30 30 45 45 60 60 75 cm which are given in the methodological approach 2 7 calculation irrigation water water use efficiency and water savings the amount of irrigation water required to fill the root zone to field capacity was calculated following the procedure of michael 1978 mandal and dutta 1995 and sarker et al 2019 and using the following equation 1 i i 1 n f c i m c i 100 b i d i where i is the depth of irrigation water cm bi is the bulk density of the ith layer of the soil g cm 3 di is the depth of the ith layer of the soil within the root zone to be irrigated cm fci is the soil moisture content at field capacity at each layer mci is the soil moisture content before each irrigation at each layer and n is the number of soil layers in the root zone depth d cm the gravimetric fc was determined by the ponding water method michael 1978 soil samples were collected with the help of a soil augur for estimating gravimetric soil moisture content before each irrigation application in this study we didn t measure the rooting depth of maize but visual observations revealed that most roots were concentrated in surface 0 30 cm depth kuchenbuch et al 2009 and nichols et al 2019 reported that a major part of the maize root system is found in 0 30 cm depth michael 1978 stated that it is not necessarily to the maximum root depth for any given plant about 40 and 30 water uptake by the 1st and 2nd quarter of the root zone in the upper soil layer and 20 and 10 water uptake by the 3rd and 4th quarter of the root zone in the deeper soil layer in this study soil samples were taken for considering the root zone depth of 0 45 cm depth at the initial stage 0 60 cm depth at tasseling and silking stages and 0 75 cm depth at the grain development stage before each irrigation event soils were sampled in 15 cm increments the amount of applied irrigation water i table 2 was the depth of water needed to refill the soil profile 0 45 0 60 and 0 75 cm respectively at the initial tasseling and silking and grain development stages to different levels of fc the estimated amount of irrigation water was measured by the volumetric method and supplied to the experimental plots using a polyethylene hose pipe 50 8 mm inches diameter by pumping water from the underground water sources the water flow meter was used for supplying the calculated amount of irrigation water the seasonal crop water use cwu was calculated as the sum of water inputs from all irrigation events precipitation and soil water contribution i e the difference between the beginning and the end of the study and expressed by the approach of soil water balance equation michael 1978 djaman and irmak 2012 sarker et al 2016 2019 murad et al 2018 2 c w u i p e δ s w c c r d p r o where cwu is crop water use cm dp is deep percolation water cm ro is runoff cr is the amount of capillary rise water cm δ s w c is the change in soil water content between sowing and harvesting cm pe is effective rainfall cm and i is the amount of irrigation water per season cm there was no drainage or deep percolation during each irrigation event because irrigation water was based on soil water content and applied only to fc each plot was separated by 2 m distance with compacted levees to prevent the movement of water from one plot to another hence there was no runoff the capillary rise is closely related to the groundwater table in this study region gazipur under aez 28 the groundwater level generally ranges from 32 5 m in november to 35 2 m in may resulting in the negligible capillary rise parvin et al 2017 therefore parameters of dp ro and cr were considered to be zero effective rainfall pe was calculated as per smith 1992 and alauddin et al 2014 using the following equations 3 p

al 2019 5 δ s w c n i n m c s i m c h i 100 b i d i where mcsi is soil water content at sowing and mch i is soil water content at harvest in the ith layers of soil depth 0 75 cm with 15 cm soil increments the crop water productivity cwp kg m 3 was calculated for evaluating the efficient use of irrigation water for grain production with the following equation mahajan et al 2009 wang et al

nutrient uptake by grain and cwp were statistically analyzed using an analysis of variance anova with r foundation for statistical computing platform r version 3 5 0 all the treatment means were compared for significant differences with an of 1 or 5 and using a p value of 0 01 or 0 05 least square means were generated for treatments irrigation levels and methods that had a significant effect on dry matter grain yield grain nutrient uptake and cwp 3 results and discussion the afi based on partial root zone drying is an innovative water saving irrigation technique that has the potential to increase water productivity without yield reduction kang and zhang 2004 this technique involves approximately half of the root system being exposed to dry soil while the remaining half irrigated normally there are many studies on the effects of partial root zone irrigation on the physiology growth nutrient uptake and water productivity of crops kang and zhang 2004 li et al 2007 hu et al 2009 prolonged soil drying could reduce the mass of succulent roots and make the main roots essentially pipes for water conduction rewetting the soil could then encourage the initiation and growth of secondary roots liang et al 1996 and could recover the roots sensitivity to soil drying zhang and tardieu 1996 besides roots developed under alternate drying and wetting of soil may lead to the better use of soil nutrients from the entire root zone the present study therefore aimed to assess the yield performance nutrient uptake and cwp of maize under three irrigation methods and three irrigations levels with a hypothesis that afi and deficit irrigation can maintain grain yield and increase nutrient uptake and cwp compared to the existing high water requiring methods practiced by farmers 3 1 crop performance 3 1 1 dry matter accumulation there were significant effects of irrigation method and level on dry matter production at different growth stages of maize in both years fig 2 the interactive effects of irrigation level and method also significantly p 0 01 affected the dry matter yield in different stages fig 3 dry matter yield was significantly higher for i1 and decreased when the irrigation level was reduced to i2 to i3 fig 2a c dry matter yield also significantly differed among the irrigation methods fig 2b d methods afi and tfi produced significantly higher dry matter compared to sffi fig 3 the interactive effect of irrigation level and method fig 3 showed that the reduced amount of irrigation water significantly reduced the maize dry matter the same level of irrigation produced dry matter with an insignificant difference between afi and tfi but the effect was significant for sffi the findings of the present study are consistent with earlier studies in which crop yields were higher with the partial root drying technique than with the application of deficit irrigation resulting in significant improvement of cwp kang et al 1998 kirda et al 2005 kang and zhang 2004 liu et al 2007 shahnazari et al 2007 in the partial root dying technique more abscisic acid aba was produced than in the traditional flood irrigation and increased the aba controlled stomata opening and closure through root to shoot signal that leads to increase in biomass of the growing crops which ultimately increases the grain yield kang and zhang 2004 bauerle et al 2006 this phenomenon also controls unwanted vegetative growth as well as reduced leaf expansion of maize bahrun et al 2002 potato liu et al 2006 and tomato topçu et al 2007 through reducing the development of plant root systems grown under drought stress taiz and zeiger 2006 3 1 2 yield and yield contributing parameters there were significant interactive effects of irrigation method and level on the grain yield and yield contributing parameters i e cob length cob diameter and number of grains and grain weight per cob of maize table 3 grain yield under tfi was higher compared to the other two methods when irrigated at 100 of fc during the crop growing season of 2014 2015 the yield contributing parameters were however non significant between afi and tfi at different levels of irrigation but performed better than afi in both years the afi method produced 1 7 higher grain yield than tfi when irrigated up to 100 fc in 2015 16 table 3 the tfi method also produced around 1 table 3 higher grain yield than with afi when irrigated up to 100 of fc the amount of irrigation water used in afi was lower than in tfi at 100 fc in 2014 2015 in the combined analysis there were no significant differences in maize yield between afi 8 13 t ha 1 and tfi 8 10 t ha 1 and no differences in yield contributing characters when irrigated with 100 fc over the two growing seasons table 3 there was a consistent trend for similar yield in afi and tfi and lower yield in sffi when the irrigation level was drastically reduced from i1 to i3 this was due to limited root growth water stress and nutrient uptake for prolonged soil drying in one side of the plant roots the results indicated that when less amount of irrigation water was applied there was no yield reduction with afi but yield reduction was significant with sffi with all levels of irrigation the afi method maintained approximately similar grain yield to tfi but with almost 37 reduction in irrigation water in maize water stress delays silking by increasing the anthesis to silking interval and reduces yield this trait i e anthesis to silking interval is highly correlated with grain yield by increasing ear and kernel numbers per plant cattivelli et al 2008 kang et al 1998 2000 and kang and zhang 2004 also used the partial root drying technique in maize by applying water as alternate wetting and drying consistent with the current study alternate wetting and drying irrigation technique resulted in higher yield with 50 reduction of irrigation water while fixed and traditional root drying irrigation techniques resulted in lower yields similarly inconsistent with our study sepaskhah and khajehabdollahi 2005 also reported that irrigating maize by skipping every furrow alternately maintained yield and reduced the irrigation water by 6 compared with flood irrigation in which every furrow was irrigated at four day intervals 3 2 effect of irrigation level and method on nutrient uptake by maize grain table 4 shows the uptake of macronutrients n p k s ca and mg and micronutrients b zn fe and mn by maize grain at harvest in the two years of experimentation the uptakes of macro and micro nutrients by maize grain were significantly different among the three irrigation levels and three irrigation methods table 4 in both years n uptake by maize grain was not significantly different between afi and tfi when irrigation water was applied at 100 of fc i1 maize grains under afi had greater n uptake with i2 compared to i3 the p uptake by maize grains on the other hand was higher in afi with i2 and ssfi with i1 than in other treatment combinations the k uptake was higher but similar for all three irrigation methods under i1 compared to other combinations the micronutrient uptake by grain was also higher under i1 irrespective of the method of irrigation water application table 4 the grain s uptake was also higher under tfi and afi with either i1 or i2 than other treatment combinations in the second year also there were similar uptakes of macro and micro nutrients though the differences were more conspicuous than in the first year table 4 the results indicated that the uptakes of macro and micro nutrients could be increased when maize is irrigated based on irrigation water application at 100 fc and that the uptakes can decrease when water is applied at less than 100 fc nevertheless the nutrient uptake with 20 reduced irrigation water i e 80 fc was also high for all the irrigation methods employed the results of the current study agree with several findings with deficit irrigation reported in the literature for example an earlier study has shown that the n loss due to leaching during the maize cropping could be reduced by reducing the water application e g gehl et al 2005 others have shown that applying a higher amount of irrigation water to meet crop water requirements could increase the soil residual n after harvest sánchez martín et al 2010 gabriel et al 2012 farooq et al 2009 reported that the crop water and nutrient requirements are closely related and hence fertilizer application has the potential to increase the crop efficiency to utilize the available water it is a proven fact that transpiration can be inhibited by drought but it may not affect nutrient uptake in the same way as transpiration this study indicates that crop yields could be substantially improved by enhancing nutrient efficiency under limited moisture supply in this study applying organic manure probably increased the soil available p content an increase in available p in turn could restrict the phosphatase secreted from maize roots vance et al 2003 studies are demonstrating that the partial root zone irrigation technique in maize can have a greater effect on soil enzyme activities and maize water use efficiency if organic n sources are applied compared to inorganic sources farooq et al 2009 also reported that irrigation method as well as the proportion of inorganic and organic n could affect the soil enzymatic activities this in turn could influence the soil nutrient availability and maize growth and development skinner et al 1999 reported that the afi successfully increased crop n uptake and reduced the potential for no3 leaching likewise in the studies of shi and kang 2000 and han and kang 2002 the ability of roots to absorb nutrients was improved by the alternate wetting and drying in both horizontal and vertical soil profiles han and kang 2002 concluded that the alternate partial root zone irrigation technique increased total n and p uptakes and use efficiencies compared to continuous flood irrigation kumari et al 2017 also reported that when a maize hybrid variety is irrigated based on irrigation scheduling at 25 deficit of available soil moisture it could result in higher yield with higher uptakes of major nutrients 3 3 crop water productivity and water savings the cwp was significantly different between the irrigation methods and irrigation levels in both years the mean cwp over two years ranged from 1 90 to 3 06 kg m 3 table 5 as expected the highest mean cwp 3 09 kg m 3 was obtained with afi due to high yield and low crop water use on the other hand the lowest mean cwp 1 75 2 16 kg m 3 was obtained with tfi table 5 both the irrigation method and irrigation level were important for defining important differences in cwp the cwp was greatest for i1 and lowest for i3 these results are in agreement with previous findings kang et al 1998 2000 kang and zhang 2004 who stated that cwp varied from around 2 7 5 kg m 3 without significant yield reductions the results opined that more water supply does not necessarily result in more crop yield and grain yield is not significantly reduced by afi in the semiarid regions the results of our study indicated that while the irrigation amount drives the patterns for grain yield the irrigation method drives the patterns for cwp table 5 results also showed that the afi technique had the highest cwp compared to tfi due to the lower amount of irrigation water used and higher grain yield table 5 the afi technique had higher cwp compared to the other two methods at the same level of irrigation as these treatments produced nearly similar yield and required a lower amount of irrigation water for maize cultivation table 5 the afi method saved cwu by 39 35 and 33 in 2014 2015 and by 36 34 and 30 in 2015 2016 compared to tfi when irrigated with i1 i2 and i3 respectively table 5 over the two years the afi technique saved cwu by 37 34 and 31 when irrigated with i1 i2 and i3 respectively table 5 the tfi technique noticeably resulted in the lowest cwp as this did not produce significantly higher yield at different levels of irrigation amount these results indicated that the afi technique maintained the desired yield when re watering was carried out alternately as a result the cwp improved substantially with afi on average afi had cwu greater by around 38 33 and 31 than tfi when irrigation water was applied with i1 i2 and i3 respectively table 5 thus afi is an effective water saving irrigation method in which efficient soil moisture utilization improves soil enzymatic activities and crop water use it is a useful irrigation water application method where water resources and the quantity of irrigation water are limited for maize cultivation and hence afi could potentially save large amounts of water for irrigation kang et al 1998 reported that compared to conventional watering alternate partial root zone irrigation apri reduced water consumption of maize by 35 with a total biomass reduction of only 6 11 for field crops such as maize apri could maintain high grain yield with an almost 50 reduction in irrigation water kang et al 2000 indeed partial root zone irrigation creates an uneven distribution of soil moisture that may affect many things including the activities of many soil enzymes li et al 2010 under water stress conditions that are associated with dry soil aba is produced in roots and then is translocated to the leaves this process causes stomata closure and controls transpiration by preventing excess water loss steuer et al 1988 du et al 2015 thus apri may substantially reduce water loss though it would have little effect on the rate of photosynthesis kang and zhang 2004 hence where water resources or irrigation facilities are limited the afi technique could be a potential option for optimizing the maize yield while reducing the irrigation water use and increasing the cwp for maize cultivation in the dry season for the areas with sub tropical climatic conditions in south asia 4 conclusions based on two years study we conclude that the afi technique with irrigation water application at 100 fc is best in terms of saving irrigation water improving the cwp and grain nutrient uptake and increasing grain yield of maize the afi and tfi techniques with irrigation amounting to 100 of fc can result in a similar yield of around 8 1 t ha 1 however compared to tfi afi can save seasonal cwu by 37 34 and 31 when irrigated to 100 80 and 60 of fc respectively the uptakes of macro and micronutrients by maize grain are maintained similarly when it is irrigated with water application at 100 of fc we conclude that under limited water supply conditions afi can substantially improve cwp without significant reductions in grain yield and its components and grain nutrient uptake by maize we therefore suggest that the afi could be recommended for sustainably intensifying the maize production in the sub tropical climates of south asia where the sources and supplies of irrigation water in the dry season are limited financial support this research was undertaken through the core research

10584,irrigation scheduling decision support tools can improve water use efficiency by matching irrigation recommendations to prevailing soil and crop conditions within a season yet little research is available on how to support real time precision irrigation that varies within season in both time and space we investigate the integration of remotely sensed ndvi time series soil moisture sensor measurements and root zone simulation forecasts for in season delineation of dynamic management zones mz and for a variable rate irrigation scheduling in order to improve irrigation scheduling and crop performance delineation of mz was conducted in a 5 8 ha maize field during 2018 using sentinel 2 ndvi time series and an unsupervised classification the number and spatial extent of mzs changed through the growing season a network of soil moisture sensors was used to interpret spatiotemporal changes of the ndvi soil water content was a significant contributor to changes in crop vigor across mzs through the growing season real time cluster validity function analysis provided in season evaluation of the mz design for example the total within mz daily soil moisture relative variance decreased from 85 early vegetative stages to below 25 late reproductive stages finally using the hydrus 1d model a workflow for in season optimization of irrigation scheduling and water delivery management was tested data simulations indicated that crop transpiration could be optimized while reducing water applications between 11 and 28 5 across the dynamic mzs the proposed integration of spatiotemporal crop and soil moisture data can be used to support management decisions to effectively control outputs of crop environment management interactions keywords remote sensing spatial variability temporal variability precision agriculture soil moisture hydrus 1d 1 introduction irrigated agriculture is essential to global food production especially because of projected population growth döll 2002 irrigation water is commonly applied uniformly over an entire field yet field soil water content is typically non uniform because of spatial variability in soil hydraulic properties hawley 1983 topography burt and butcher 1985 and vegetation growth le roux et al 1995 when field spatial variability is significant baveye and laba 2014 thorp 2019 differential irrigation water management that accounts for variability may improve the cost effectiveness of irrigation liang et al 2016 martini et al 2017 by increasing for instance water use efficiency and productivity as well as decreasing nutrient leaching precision agriculture seeks to optimize farming operations via site specific management plans that vary the application of nutrients and water across a field based on variations in soil and crop conditions zhang et al 2002 field management is prescribed over contiguous areas that have homogeneous soil properties and crop conditions these areas are called management zones mz different clustering methods including k mean isodata and gaussian mixture are available for delineating mzs based on different data sources galambošová et al 2014 martinez casasnovas et al 2012 schepers et al 2004 commonly yield maps topography remote sensing data and soil apparent electrical conductivity are used to delineate mzs bellvert et al 2012 liu et al 2018 scudiero et al 2018 ohana levi et al 2019 recently open access or low cost remote sensing data are being used in agriculture to obtain spatiotemporal information on biophysical parameters of vegetation fontanet et al 2018 several researchers have defined mzs in specific fields with the goal of increasing yield and decreasing water use inman et al 2008 and schenatto et al 2015 used ndvi and other spectral vegetation indices to delineate mzs with ndvi data and different crop indices liu et al 2018 delineated mzs based on yield and maps of different vegetation indices scudiero et al 2013 argued that spatial information of soil properties known to affect plant growth should guide mz delineation they modeled maize yield spatial variability as a function of salinity texture carbon content and bulk density using geospatial apparent soil electrical conductivity and bare soil reflectance measurements as proxies for these soil properties a similar study was presented by reyes et al 2019 in which mzs were defined using information of both ndvi and soil properties georgi et al 2018 developed an algorithm to delineate mzs automatically based on remote sensing data however one of the disadvantages of this algorithm is that it does not work properly in fields with strong time dependent spatial patterns all the above mentioned studies consider mzs to be static and assume no dynamic pattern during the growing season however in fields where crop spatial patterns change over time some researchers have advocated for mz delineation to also be dynamic cohen et al 2016 evans et al 2013 haghverdi et al 2015 scudiero et al 2018 soil moisture sensors constitute a vital tool for real time monitoring of soil water content dynamics in the field although sensors monitor soil water content at a single point spatial and temporal variations of soil water content and their interactions with crops can be analyzed if several sensors are installed across the field biswas 2014 biswas and si 2011 huang et al 2019 yang et al 2016 these measurements can provide information about the source of variability between different mzs and aid in their delineation in this study we integrate crop spatial and temporal information from high resolution remote sensing soil water sensor data and numerical model simulations to investigate irrigation scheduling for dynamic management zones specifically we i characterize the spatial and temporal dynamics of crop soil water relations of a maize field ii delineate and evaluate temporally dynamic management zones for variable rate irrigation and iii provide a workflow for in season optimization of irrigation scheduling and water delivery management 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the study was carried out in a 5 8 ha maize zea mays l field located in raïmat lleida spain fig 1 the study region has a typical semi arid mediterranean climate with an average summer temperature and rainfall of 24 c and 45 mm the local climate was mediterranean with an average annual rainfall and reference evapotranspiration e t 0 of 341 mm and 1 060 m respectively land use at the study site has changed over the years fig a 1 of appendix a originally the site was a forest where no tillage occurred approximately 30 years ago the land was converted to a vineyard the topography of the field was modified with soil being added or removed in various sections such that the site can now be regarded as having an anthropogenic soil in 2016 two years year before this study grapevines were removed and maize was grown at the site 2 2 sowing and irrigation all agronomic management and design at the field site was implemented by cooperators without our input the field was sectioned into four plots that were each sowed with a different maize variety fig 1 the varieties were from west to east p0937 dupont pioneer johnston ia d6980 dekalb genetics corporation dekalb il p1524 dupont pioneer and d6780 dekalb all plots were sown on may 3 2018 at a sowing density of 90000 seeds ha 1 plants started to emerge on may 12 2018 data from the seed companies indicated that the varieties sowed on the west and east edges p0937 and d6780 had a faster vegetative growth than d6980 and p1524 however all varieties were anticipated to reach full maturity between 125 to165 days after sowing all the varieties were harvested on september 22 2018 the field was irrigated with a solid set sprinkler system nelson irrigation corporation walla walla wa with sprinklers located at a 15 x 15 m spacing water was delivered at a rate of 6 5 l m 2 h 1 irrigation was uniformly applied over the field with scheduling and depths determined using a crop coefficient approach fao56 for most of the site irrigation ended 115 days after sowing but in two 0 3 ha sections at the north east end of the site irrigation was halted 74 days after sowing due to soil waterlogging 2 3 soil environment and crop measurements field data were collected between may and september 2018 soil moisture soil and crop parameters environmental variables and ndvi time series were measured in may 2018 33 capacitive ec 5 soil moisture sensors meter group pullman wa usa were installed at 11 locations named p1 p2 and p11 fig 1 the sensors were installed at 15 35 and 50 cm depths water content data were registered every 30 minutes using an em5b data logger meter group the manufacturer s generic sensor calibration was used which has a reported accuracy 0 03 cm3 cm 3 campbell and devices 1986 at each soil moisture station three disturbed soil samples were collected at 0 5 5 35 and 30 60 cm depth for organic matter om and soil texture analyses the walkley black method was used to measure om nelson and sommers 1996 whereas soil particle size distribution was measured according to the hydrometer method gee and bauder 1986 particles were categorized into the following size classes clay soil particle diameter d 0 002 mm fine silt 0 002 d 0 02 mm coarse silt 0 02 d 0 05 mm and sand 0 05 d 2 mm undisturbed soil cores were also collected at the same locations and depths for measuring soil hydraulic properties saturated hydraulic conductivity was measured with a ksat device meter group soil water retention measurements were obtained using hyprop and wp4c instruments meter group the hyprop device utilizes an evaporation method schelle et al 2013 and was used to obtain retention data from 0 to 85 kpa whereas the wp4c device implements a chilled mirror dew point technique and was used to obtain measurements down to 300 mpa the van genuchten equations van genuchten 1980v were used to model the retention data and the soil unsaturated hydraulic conductivity in the van genuchten model the ks parameter was set to the saturated conductivity measured with the ksat device the saturated water content parameter θ s was set to the soil porosity estimated by the hyprop device and the residual water content parameter θ r was set to the minimum water content recorded by the wp4c device the van genuchten shape parameters α and n were determined by fitting the model retention function to the measured data using the retc software package van genuchten et al 1991v principal component analysis pca abdi and williams 2013 martini et al 2017 was used to investigate the relationships between soil texture om bulk density and hydraulic parameters the pca calculations were done with statistica 12 statsoft inc tulsa ok usa a weather station consisting of an ecrn 100 rain gauge meter group a cup anemometer davis instruments hayward ca usa and pyr pyranometer and vp 4 relative humidity and temperature sensors meter group was installed 150 m from the north east corner of the field the measured temperature wind speed relative humidity and solar radiation were used to calculate daily reference evapotranspiration e t 0 using the penman monteith equation as specified in fao irrigation and drainage paper no 56 allen et al 1998 hereafter fao56 the estimated e t 0 was converted into daily water requirements or potential evapotranspiration e t c using the maize crop coefficient k c from fao56 maximum and minimum daily temperature measurements were used to calculate growing degree days gdd according to fao56 and to determinate reference maize growing stages ritchie et al 1997 remote sensing data obtained from sentinel 2 were used to determine normalized difference vegetation index n d v i eq 1 rouse et al 1974 1 n d v i n i r r e d n i r r e d where n i r and r e d are measured reflectance values in the near infrared and visible red regions respectively n d v i was used to evaluate spatial variability in the field remote sensing data were downloaded with 10 m spatial resolution every 5 days unless there was cloud coverage the first and last images downloaded were the 15th and 135th day after sowing remote sensing data were downloaded from google earth engine web page https earthengine google com 2 4 management zones delineation ndvi was used to characterize the spatial variability of crop vigor through the growing season a k means also known as fuzzy c means unsupervised clustering algorithm odeh et al 2010 was used to classify the ndvi data into temporally dynamic mzs the grouping analysis tool in arcmap 10 4 1 esri redlands ca was used for the mz delineation anytime a new sentinel 2 ndvi scene was available at the site a new mz scheme was delineated designs having 2 to 6 mzs were considered the calinski harabasz criterion c h c harabasz et al 1974 eq 2 was used to evaluate the clusters and mz delineations and select the optimum number of mzs the chc also known as a pseudo f statistic measures the ratio of between mz differences and within mz similarity it is formulated as 2 c h c b m z s s m z n 1 w m z s s n m z n where n is the number of pixels m z n is the number of considered zones b m z s s is the between zones sum of squares and w m z s s is the within zone sum of squares large c h c values indicate high within mz homogeneity and between mz heterogeneity the n d v i averages and maximum and minimum values within each mz were calculated for further comparison between different mzs mzs were not defined for the beginning of the season 0 20 day after sowing because plants had not yet germinated or were not big enough to influence n d v i and for the end of the season beyond 130 days after sowing because in that period the crop is in a late phenological stage and not irrigated differences in soil properties across mzs over time were assessed using a kruskal wallis kruskal and wallis 1952 rank test i e a non parametric analysis of variance calculated with statistica 12 additionally we considered an alternative static delineation scheme subdividing the site into four contiguous fields corresponding to the planted maize varieties the c h c was calculated for each available n d v i scene to compare the variety based mz approach to the dynamic n d v i based mz delineation 2 5 management zone available water soil water status for the mzs was modeled as plant available water a w eq 3 liang et al 2016 vellidis et al 2016

monitoring stations located within the mz note that the mz design changed over the growing season so the mz membership of some stations also changed in addition to the c h c calculation on the n d v i data the spatiotemporal variability of a w was also used for in season evaluation of the dynamic mz design following fraisse et al 2001 we calculated the daily weighted within mz a w variance 4 4 s m

uniformity by dividing the field into mzs fraisse et al 2001 3 results and discussion 3 1 soil properties soil texture organic matter om content and bulk density ρ b values measured at each station are reported in table 1 the soil texture classes usda system of samples taken from the 11 locations were clay loam 42 4 of samples loam 42 4 and silty clay loam 15 2 locations on the east side p1 p6 p7 p11 of the field had on average lower sand and higher silt and clay contents than those on the west side average om contents ranged between 0 57 and 1 96 which is typical for agricultural soils in this region romanyà and rovira 2011 fitted and measured parameters for the soil hydraulic properties at each station are reported in table 2 consistent with the spatial trend in soil texture noted previously the swrcs measured on the east side of the study site stations p1 p6 p7 p11 had lower fitted n values than in the rest of the site on the wet end of a retention curve a lower n value corresponds to a more gradual transition in water content as pressure head changes fig a 2 of appendix a compares swrcs observed at the locations on the west p9 and east p11 sides of the field the principal component analysis pca indicated that eight principal components were needed to explain 95 of the variability in the soil dataset the first three components pc1 30 9 pc2 18 6 and pc3 15 9 explained around two thirds of the variance in the soil dataset particularly pc1 indicated that clay content clustered was positively correlated with θ wp θ fc and α the pc1 also indicated that clay content was negatively correlated with sand content θ r and n further detail about pc1 pc2 and pc3 are reported in fig a 3 of appendix a 3 2 remote sensing and dynamic management zones delineation the site average minimum and maximum n d v i values for each available sentinel 2 scene are reported in fig 2 a changes in averaged n d v i generally corresponded to the evolution of e t c at the site consistent with reports for maize grown in mediterranean climates in other studies segovia cardozo et al 2019 toureiro et al 2017 fig 2b shows that cumulative input water irrigation and precipitation 618 mm exceeded by 10 2 the site wide cumulative e t c 561 mm at the bottom of fig 2 reference growing stages for maize at the site are shown ritchie et al 1997 varieties needed between 120 and 130 days to reach maturity thus we considered the reference growing stages to be representative for all maize varieties grown at the site n d v i and e t c were low during the early vegetative stages had maximum values during the late vegetative stage vt through the beginning of the reproductive stages r1 r6 then decreased after r6 the temporal changes of n d v i at the site are comparable to those observed in other studies on maize viña et al 2004 in the early vegetative stages v0 to v5 the n d v i range of each sentinel 2 scene was narrow in later vegetative stages and early reproductive stages the n d v i ranges were much larger indicating considerable variability in crop status greenness health at the site fig 3 a shows the spatiotemporal changes of n d v i at the sites areas with high and low n d v i were observed at the site throughout the growing season however the n d v i spatial patterns changed over time suggesting that homogeneous or static site specific irrigation management may be inadequate to address crop needs over time at this site fig 3b shows the dynamic mz delineation obtained with unsupervised clustering of the n d v i data the number of mz and its spatial distribution changed throughout the growing season at the beginning of the season until 50 days after sowing it seems that the optimal number of homogeneous mz was three the mz1 covered the north west side of the site and had the highest n d v i values the mz2 had intermediate n d v i and spanned across the south of the site until the 45th day after sowing and after that over the south west only the mz3 had lower n d v i values and was initially the north eastern side of the site then covered the entire western side of the field at 45 days after sowing from the 50th day after sowing the c h c indicated that four clusters were best at identifying areas with homogeneous n d v i mz1 and mz2 remained relatively similar to their early season delineations the mz4 identified an area of moderately low n d v i at the south eastern portion of the site whereas mz3 on the north eastern side of the site was characterized by the lowest n d v i values the spatial patterns of the four mzs changed only slightly over time until the 130th day after sowing when the size of mz3 increased remarkably while mz4 decreased the unsupervised n d v i clustering was compared to dividing the site into four blocks one for each maize variety fig 3c shows the c h c values for n d v i clustering into dynamic mz and into varietal based blocks through the growing season the dynamic mz design strategy had larger c h c values for the entire growing season than the variety block strategy indicating that the dynamic mzs identified by unsupervised clustering had more homogeneous n d v i than the varietal blocks fig 3a shows contrasting n d v i values between the eastern and western side of the field especially visible along the boundary between the d6980 and p1524 varieties the boundary between the d6980 and p1524 varieties seemed to be a big factor in the determination of the boundary between eastern mz1 and mz2 and western mz3 and mz4 zones from 55 to 120 days after sowing fig 3b fig a 1 f of appendix a shows the p1524 and d6780 varieties doing relatively poorly in july 2018 therefore in addition to different soil hydraulic properties on the east side of the field crop genetics e g pest resistance germination rate between the varieties and uneven management e g mechanical sowing fertilization soil tillage could have been contributing factors to the poor performance of the p1524 and d6780 varieties changes in mz delineation over time led to some changes in mz membership for certain soil water monitoring stations table 3 these changes occurred frequently in the early vegetative stages until 54 days after sowing no mz membership change occurred in the late vegetative and reproductive stages the mzs were characterized by contrasting soil properties throughout the season the mz had significantly p 0 05 different pc1 scores throughout the season according to the kruskal wallis test mz1 and mz2 were characterized by low pc1 scores whereas mz3 and mz4 were characterized by the highest pc1 scores fig a 3 of appendix a 3 3 ndvi and water applied changes in n d v i and a w across mzs are depicted in fig 4 a mz1 4b mz2 4c mz3 and 4d mz4 through the growing season n d v i in mz1 and mz2 was higher than in mz3 and mz4 furthermore n d v i was slightly higher in mz1 than in mz2 average a w in mz1 was close to 1 i e water content was near θfc throughout the entire growing season average a w in mz2 was greater than 1 at the beginning of the season until 45 days after sowing and then very close to 1 through the end of the growing season portions of mz3 and mz4 had lower n d v i values than mz1 and mz2 in these areas irrigation was likely excessive a w was considerably higher than 1 for the entire vegetative growth of maize and during the early reproductive stages once irrigation was halted in the northeastern corner of the site i e approximately over the area comprised by mz3 at 74 days after sowing the a w in mz3 gradually decreased until the end of the season while n d v i in mz3 remained stable halting irrigation in the northeastern corner of the site had little to no effect on the spatial extent of mz3 and the other mzs as shown in fig 3b the analysis of the daily total within mz a w variance s 2 provided further support for the use of n d v i to identify areas with similar a w conditions at the site in fig 4e the calculated total mz variance is normalized by the daily whole site a w variance especially beyond 45 days after sowing the beginning of the vt growth stage the normalized within mz variance is much less than 1 showing that a large part of the total a w variance was explained by splitting the site into dynamic mzs delineated based on an analysis of n d v i fraisse et al 2001 used yield within zone variance to evaluate soil derived mzs at the end of the season our results suggest that daily a w s 2 could also be used for in season evaluation of management zone designs the a w and n d v i time series data show that soil water content was a major factor determining n d v i spatiotemporal variability at the site n d v i is an indicator of the canopy vegetative growth and several studies have found positive correlations between n d v i a w and canopy vigor in different crops scudiero et al 2014 west et al 2018 however those studies were for water scarce conditions it is well known that crop water stress and reductions in canopy growth can occur due to either deficit of water or excess of water feddes et al 1978 in the current study where maize was grown under nearly waterlogged conditions for most of the growing season fig 4 changes in n d v i and a w between consecutive sentinel 2 scenes were negatively correlated with pearson r equal to 0 64 mz1 0 87 mz2 0 79 mz3 and 0 83 mz4 all significant at p 0 05 thus as reported in previous studies long et al 2015 quebrajo et al 2018 scudiero et al 2018 shanahan et al 2008 n d v i data alone should not be used to make irrigation management decisions n d v i and or other plant canopy information should be integrated with soil information to properly understand plant processes at a site 3 4 irrigation scheduling simulations with respect to within season management decisions one way to make a connection between n d v i based dynamic management zone delineation and soil conditions would be to use a simulation model to make within season forecasts of soil and crop conditions for different management options several authors have simulated different irrigation strategies for different purposes in order to define the most appropriate irrigation strategy autovino et al 2018 haj amor and bouri 2020 sakaguchi et al 2019 in the remainder of this paper we determine a hypothetical optimal irrigation schedule for each growing stage using the simulation optimization approach developed by fontanet 2019 we first show that a physically based simulation model hydrus 1d šimůnek et al 2016 is consistent with ndvi based zoning by simulating the field experiment and demonstrating agreement between measured aw and simulated available water s a w as well as showing a correspondence between simulated transpiration s t a rates and n d v i next we use the calibrated model to investigate what if irrigation scenarios calculating a hypothetical irrigation scheduling table for each dynamic mz that could have been generated from ndvi within season to guide irrigation 3 4 1 hydrus 1 d available water and transpiration simulations the well known hydrus 1d model solves the richards equation numerically to simulate variably saturated water flow and root water uptake in soils the model inputs and parameterizations used in our simulations are detailed in appendix b simulations of the experiment for differing monitoring locations all used the same inputs and parameters except for i the soil hydraulic properties which were measured at each station during the field campaign table 2 and ii the irrigation boundary condition which differed only for stations p10 and p11 because irrigation was stopped during the experiment in fig 5 daily observed a w for each station is compared with daily simulated available water s a w generally good agreement between a w and s a w existed for all stations although it is acknowledged that the a w time courses were relatively non dynamic still the simulations were done using independently measured hydraulic properties and without any calibration so the agreement is quite good modeling details can be found in appendix b missing data towards the end of the season in p7 was due to rodents chewing on the sensor cables fig 6 shows the weekly simulated actual transpiration s t a at each mz and the potential transpiration t p at the site at mz1 and mz2 s t a weekly averages were always equal or near the potential transpiration at mz3 and mz4 s t a weekly values were remarkably lower than the potential there was good correspondence between s t a and n d v i at each mz with a pearson r of 0 6 mz1 0 51 mz2 0 69 mz3 and 0 82 mz4 in agreement with the results discussed for n d v i and aw data section 3 2 remote sensing and dynamic management zones delineation low s t a values at mz3 and mz4 were due to waterlogging root water uptake and transpiration is reduced in the model whenever simulated soil water content exceeds a threshold value see appendix b stations in mz3 and mz4 see table 3 had a w and s a w over 1 for most of the growing season fig 4 3 4 2 irrigation scheduling for within season decision making we adopted the method of fontanet 2019 to investigate optimal irrigation scheduling for dynamic mzs in this method irrigation of duration τ t is prescribed whenever the soil moisture content decreases below a critical threshold level h t h as indicated by readings from a soil water pressure head sensor s the irrigation rate is assumed to be a fixed constant for a given irrigation system the recommended duration and threshold are determined using a simulation optimization procedure simulations are made using forecasted daily or weekly crop water demand reference et0 and a range of values for the irrigation scheduling parameters h t h and τ the optimal parameter values are those that maximize seasonal transpiration in the simulations transpiration being for many agronomically important crops proportional to marketable yield in adapting the simulation optimization method we make separate recommendations for each mz and update them whenever there is a change in mz station membership the recommended values of h t h and τ for a given mz are the average values determined for monitoring stations within the zone for simplicity we use in this example the known daily potential et0 for the forecasted model boundary condition rather than historical data which would be necessary for actual within season forecasts haghverdi et al 2015 and liang et al 2016 proposed calculating crop water requirements as a function of root growth since the soil depth to refill increases as roots grow deeper similarly in our simulations we triggered irrigation based on readings from progressively deeper sensors as the season progressed in principle when multiple sensor depths are available the sensor depth could be treated as an additional optimization parameter full details on our implementation of the fontanet 2019 procedure are given in appendix c although the fontanet 2019 method prescribes an optimized irrigation schedule in practice a grower may not be able to irrigate exactly according to a schedule and sensor readings particularly when there are multiple management zones therefore we also calculated recommended irrigation durations or equivalently irrigation amounts for soils that have become dryer than the optimal irrigation trigger point the resulting irrigation scheduling calendar for dynamic mz irrigation is presented in table 4 optimal irrigation strategies for each growth stage are shown in bold the other table entries show irrigation recommendations for field sections that are dryer than the optimal trigger point across all mzs the optimal irrigation durations were in the range of 1 9 to 2 6 h however the triggering thresholds varied by location thresholds for mz1 and mz2 were in the range of 18 3 to 30 kpa whereas the range for mz3 and mz4 was 10 to 20 kpa in general the recommendations are for more frequent and slightly shorter irrigations in mz3 and mz4 which are located on the east side of the field and feature finer textured soils with the specific hydrus 1d model parameterization used in the current study uptake and transpiration are penalized whenever any portion of the soil approaches saturation the recommendation of somewhat shorter more frequent irrigations on the east side is due to optimization s aversion to creating overly wet soil conditions near the surface such as may occur albeit briefly during a longer irrigation table 5 compares seasonal transpiration and irrigation simulated with optimal scheduling versus the amounts obtained simulating the field experiment for mz1 and mz2 the optimal schedule recommended 11 to 13 less water and increased transpiration by 5 to 8 for mz3 29 less water was recommended with an increase in transpiration of 24 and for mz4 a 17 reduction in irrigation corresponded to a massive 53 increase in transpiration these results are consistent with our earlier findings and discussion indicating the field was over irrigated especially in mz3 and mz4 4 conclusions irrigation scheduling is complicated due to the spatial and temporal variability of a number of variables and parameters in this work we investigated a workflow for improved precision irrigation scheduling using data from a field where four maize varieties were sown the workflow is based on dynamic mz delineation with unsupervised n d v i clustering this study demonstrates that delineation of mzs based on ndvi clustering was able to statistically represent within field spatial variability better than delineating mzs only based on maize varieties additionally the optimal number and spatial configuration of the mzs were found to change over the growing season the highest number of mzs was four the mz1 and mz2 corresponded to field sections where ndvi values reflected a typical maize crop performance whereas mz3 and mz4 featured relatively low n d v i values indicative of poor maize growth soil water content showed that the variation in crop performance was attributable to soil hydraulic properties soil available water and over irrigation further a relationship existed between ndvi and soil available water the results indicated that soil available water could potentially also be used for or incorporated into in season evaluation of management zone designs lastly we proposed a method of combining dynamic management zone delineation with hydrus 1 d model forecasts for irrigation scheduling the field experiment was first simulated to confirm the model parameterization and demonstrate its consistency with the obtained ndvi and soil water content data we then used model simulations to determine an optimal zonation and irrigation calendar for different crop growth stages that could have been generated and updated in real time during the season simulations with the optimized irrigation schedule produced an increase in transpiration and a decrease in water use as compared to the field trial which again was over irrigated the improvement was especially remarkable for mz3 and mz4 where irrigation was reduced by 28 5 and 16 6 and transpiration increased by 23 9 and 52 6 respectively in summary we note that although ndvi is useful for dynamically delineating management zones for irrigation scheduling it is recommended that ndvi be combined with some additional measure of soil conditions low ndvi values may be indicative of poor crop performance but without other information

10584,irrigation scheduling decision support tools can improve water use efficiency by matching irrigation recommendations to prevailing soil and crop conditions within a season yet little research is available on how to support real time precision irrigation that varies within season in both time and space we investigate the integration of remotely sensed ndvi time series soil moisture sensor measurements and root zone simulation forecasts for in season delineation of dynamic management zones mz and for a variable rate irrigation scheduling in order to improve irrigation scheduling and crop performance delineation of mz was conducted in a 5 8 ha maize field during 2018 using sentinel 2 ndvi time series and an unsupervised classification the number and spatial extent of mzs changed through the growing season a network of soil moisture sensors was used to interpret spatiotemporal changes of the ndvi soil water content was a significant contributor to changes in crop vigor across mzs through the growing season real time cluster validity function analysis provided in season evaluation of the mz design for example the total within mz daily soil moisture relative variance decreased from 85 early vegetative stages to below 25 late reproductive stages finally using the hydrus 1d model a workflow for in season optimization of irrigation scheduling and water delivery management was tested data simulations indicated that crop transpiration could be optimized while reducing water applications between 11 and 28 5 across the dynamic mzs the proposed integration of spatiotemporal crop and soil moisture data can be used to support management decisions to effectively control outputs of crop environment management interactions keywords remote sensing spatial

growth döll 2002 irrigation water is commonly applied uniformly over an entire field yet field soil water content is typically non uniform because of spatial variability in soil hydraulic properties

management that accounts for variability may improve the cost effectiveness of irrigation liang et al 2016 martini et al 2017 by increasing for instance water use efficiency and productivity as well as decreasing nutrient leaching precision agriculture seeks to optimize farming operations via site specific management plans that vary the application of nutrients and water across a field based on variations in soil and crop conditions zhang et al 2002 field management is prescribed over contiguous areas that have homogeneous soil properties and crop conditions these areas are called management zones mz different clustering methods including k mean isodata and gaussian mixture are available for delineating mzs based on different data sources galambošová et al 2014 martinez casasnovas et al 2012 schepers et al 2004 commonly yield maps topography remote sensing data and soil apparent electrical conductivity are used to delineate mzs bellvert et al 2012 liu et al 2018 scudiero et al 2018 ohana levi et al 2019 recently open access or low cost remote sensing data are being used in agriculture to obtain spatiotemporal information on biophysical parameters of vegetation fontanet et al 2018 several researchers have defined mzs in specific fields with the goal of increasing yield and decreasing water use inman et al 2008 and schenatto et al 2015 used ndvi and other spectral vegetation indices to delineate mzs with ndvi data and different crop indices liu et al 2018 delineated mzs based on yield and maps of different vegetation indices scudiero et al 2013 argued that spatial information of soil properties known to affect plant growth should guide mz delineation they modeled maize yield spatial variability as a function of salinity texture carbon content and bulk density using geospatial apparent soil electrical conductivity and bare soil reflectance measurements as proxies for these soil properties a similar study was presented by reyes et al 2019 in which mzs were defined using information of both ndvi and soil properties georgi et al 2018 developed an algorithm to delineate mzs automatically based on remote sensing data however one of the disadvantages of this algorithm is that it does not work properly in fields with strong time dependent spatial patterns all the above mentioned studies consider mzs to be static and assume no dynamic pattern during the growing season however in fields where crop spatial patterns change over time some researchers have advocated for mz delineation to also be dynamic cohen et al 2016 evans et al 2013 haghverdi et al 2015 scudiero et al 2018 soil moisture sensors constitute a vital tool for real time monitoring of soil water content dynamics in the field although sensors monitor soil water content at a single point spatial and temporal variations of soil water content and their interactions with crops can be analyzed if several sensors are installed across the field biswas 2014 biswas and si 2011 huang et al 2019 yang et al 2016 these measurements can provide information about the source of variability between different mzs and aid in their delineation in this study we integrate crop spatial and temporal information from high resolution remote sensing soil water sensor data and numerical model simulations to investigate irrigation scheduling for dynamic management zones specifically we i characterize the spatial and temporal dynamics of crop soil water relations of a maize field ii delineate and evaluate temporally dynamic management zones for variable rate irrigation and iii provide a workflow for in season optimization of irrigation scheduling and water delivery management 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the study was carried out in a 5 8 ha maize zea mays l field located in raïmat lleida spain fig 1 the study region has a typical semi arid mediterranean climate with an average summer temperature and rainfall of 24 c and 45 mm the local climate was mediterranean with an average annual rainfall and reference evapotranspiration e t 0 of 341 mm and 1 060 m respectively land use at the study site has changed over the years fig a 1 of appendix a originally the site was a forest where no tillage occurred approximately 30 years ago the land was converted to a vineyard the topography of the field was modified with soil being added or removed in various sections such that the site can now be regarded as having an anthropogenic soil in 2016 two years year before this study grapevines were removed and maize was grown at the site 2 2 sowing and irrigation all agronomic management and design at the field site was implemented by cooperators without our input the field was sectioned into four plots that were each sowed with a different maize variety fig 1 the varieties were from west to east p0937 dupont pioneer johnston ia d6980 dekalb genetics corporation dekalb il p1524 dupont pioneer and d6780 dekalb all plots were sown on may 3 2018 at a sowing density of 90000 seeds ha 1 plants started to emerge on may 12 2018 data from the seed companies indicated that the varieties sowed on the west and east edges p0937 and d6780 had a faster vegetative growth than d6980 and p1524 however all varieties were anticipated to reach full maturity between 125 to165 days after sowing all the varieties were harvested on september 22 2018 the field was irrigated with a solid set sprinkler system nelson irrigation corporation walla walla wa with sprinklers located at a 15 x 15 m spacing water was delivered at a rate of 6 5 l m 2 h 1 irrigation was uniformly applied over the field with scheduling and depths determined using a crop coefficient approach fao56 for most of the site irrigation ended 115 days after sowing but in two 0 3 ha sections at the north east end of the site irrigation was halted 74 days after sowing due to soil waterlogging 2 3 soil environment and crop measurements field data were collected between may and september 2018 soil moisture soil and crop parameters environmental variables and ndvi time series were measured in may 2018 33 capacitive ec 5 soil moisture sensors meter group pullman wa usa were installed at 11 locations named p1 p2 and p11 fig 1 the sensors were installed at 15 35 and 50 cm depths water content data were registered every 30 minutes using an em5b data

samples were collected at 0 5 5 35 and 30 60 cm depth for organic matter om and soil texture analyses the walkley black method was used to measure om nelson and sommers 1996 whereas soil particle size distribution was measured according to the hydrometer method gee and bauder 1986 particles were categorized into the following size classes clay soil particle diameter d 0 002 mm fine silt 0 002 d 0 02 mm coarse silt 0 02 d 0 05 mm and sand 0 05 d 2 mm undisturbed soil cores were also collected at the same locations and depths for measuring soil hydraulic properties saturated hydraulic conductivity was measured with a ksat device meter group soil water retention measurements were obtained using hyprop and wp4c instruments meter group the hyprop device utilizes an evaporation method schelle et al 2013 and was used to obtain retention data from 0 to 85 kpa whereas the wp4c device implements a chilled mirror dew point technique and was used to obtain measurements down to 300 mpa the van genuchten equations van genuchten 1980v were used to model the retention data and the soil unsaturated hydraulic conductivity in the van genuchten model the ks parameter was set to the saturated conductivity measured with the ksat device the saturated water content parameter θ s was set to the soil porosity estimated by the hyprop device and the residual water content parameter θ r was set to the minimum water content recorded by the wp4c device the van genuchten shape parameters α and n were determined by fitting the model retention function to the measured data using the retc software package van genuchten et al 1991v principal component analysis pca abdi and williams 2013 martini et al 2017 was used to investigate the relationships between soil texture om bulk density and

hayward ca usa and pyr pyranometer and vp 4 relative humidity and temperature sensors meter group was installed 150 m from the north east corner of the field the measured temperature wind speed relative humidity and solar radiation were used to calculate daily reference evapotranspiration e t 0 using the penman monteith equation as specified in fao irrigation and drainage paper no 56 allen et al 1998 hereafter fao56 the estimated e t 0 was converted into daily water requirements or potential evapotranspiration e t c using the maize crop coefficient k c from fao56 maximum and minimum daily temperature measurements were used to calculate growing degree days gdd according to fao56 and to determinate reference maize growing stages ritchie et al 1997 remote sensing data obtained from sentinel 2 were used to determine normalized difference vegetation index n d v i eq 1 rouse et al 1974 1 n d v i n i r r e d n i r r e d where n i r and r e d are measured reflectance values in the near infrared and visible red regions respectively n d v i was used to evaluate spatial variability in the field remote sensing data were downloaded with 10 m spatial resolution every 5 days unless there was cloud coverage the first and last images downloaded were the 15th and 135th day after sowing remote sensing data were downloaded from google earth engine web page https earthengine google com 2 4 management zones delineation ndvi was used to characterize the spatial variability of crop vigor through the growing season a k means also known as fuzzy c means unsupervised clustering algorithm odeh et al 2010 was used to classify the ndvi data into temporally dynamic mzs the grouping analysis tool in arcmap 10 4 1 esri redlands ca was used for the mz delineation anytime a new sentinel 2 ndvi scene was available at the site a new mz scheme was delineated designs having 2 to 6 mzs were considered the calinski harabasz criterion c h c harabasz et al 1974 eq 2 was used to evaluate the clusters and mz delineations and select the optimum number of mzs the chc also known as a pseudo f statistic measures the ratio of between mz differences and within mz similarity it is formulated as 2 c h c b m z s s m z n 1 w m z s s n m z n where n is the number of pixels m z n is the number of considered zones b m z s s is the between zones sum of squares and w m z s s is the within zone sum of squares large c h c values indicate high within mz homogeneity and between mz heterogeneity the n d v i averages and maximum and minimum values within each mz were calculated for further comparison between different mzs mzs were not defined for the beginning of the season 0 20 day after sowing because plants had not yet germinated or were not big enough to influence n d v i and for the end of the season beyond 130 days after sowing because in that period the crop is in a late phenological stage and not irrigated differences in soil properties across mzs over time were assessed using a kruskal wallis kruskal and wallis 1952 rank test i e a non parametric analysis of variance calculated with statistica 12 additionally we considered an alternative static delineation scheme subdividing the site into four contiguous fields corresponding to the planted maize varieties the c h c was calculated for each available n d v i scene to compare the variety based mz approach to the dynamic n d v i based mz delineation 2 5 management zone available water soil water status for the mzs was modeled as plant available water a w eq 3 liang et al 2016 vellidis et al 2016

are reported in table 1 the soil texture classes usda system of samples taken from the 11 locations were clay loam 42 4 of samples loam 42 4 and silty clay loam 15 2 locations on the east side p1 p6 p7 p11 of the field had on average lower sand and higher silt and clay contents than those on the west side average om contents ranged between 0 57 and 1 96 which is typical for agricultural soils in this region romanyà and rovira 2011 fitted and measured parameters for the soil hydraulic properties at each station are reported in table 2 consistent with the spatial trend in soil texture noted previously the swrcs measured on the east side of the study site stations p1 p6 p7 p11 had lower fitted n values than in the rest of the site on the wet end of a retention curve a lower n value corresponds to a more gradual transition in water content as pressure head changes fig a 2 of appendix a compares swrcs observed at the locations on the west p9 and east p11 sides of the field the principal component analysis pca indicated that eight principal components were needed to explain 95 of the variability in the soil dataset the first three components pc1 30 9 pc2 18 6 and pc3 15 9 explained around two thirds of the variance in the soil dataset particularly pc1 indicated that clay content clustered was positively correlated with θ wp θ fc and α the pc1 also indicated that clay content was negatively correlated with sand content θ r and n further detail about pc1 pc2 and pc3 are reported in fig a 3 of appendix a 3 2 remote sensing and dynamic management zones delineation the site average minimum and maximum n d v i values for each available sentinel 2 scene are reported in fig 2 a changes in averaged n d v i generally corresponded to the evolution of e t c at the site consistent with reports for maize grown in mediterranean climates in other studies segovia cardozo et al 2019 toureiro et al 2017 fig 2b shows that cumulative input water irrigation and precipitation 618 mm exceeded by 10 2 the site wide cumulative e t c 561 mm at the bottom of fig 2 reference growing stages for maize at the site are shown ritchie et al 1997 varieties needed between 120 and 130 days to reach maturity thus we considered the reference growing stages to be representative for all maize varieties grown at the site n d v i and e t c were low during the early vegetative stages had maximum values during the late vegetative stage vt through the beginning of the reproductive stages r1 r6 then decreased after r6 the temporal changes of n d v i at the site are comparable to those observed in other studies on maize viña et al 2004 in the early vegetative stages v0 to v5 the n d v i range of each sentinel 2 scene was narrow in later vegetative stages and early reproductive stages the n d v i ranges were much larger indicating considerable variability in crop status greenness health at the site fig 3 a shows the spatiotemporal changes of n d v i at the sites areas with high and low n d v i were observed at the site throughout the growing season however the n d v i spatial patterns changed over time suggesting that homogeneous or static site specific irrigation management may be inadequate to address crop needs over time at this site fig 3b shows the dynamic mz delineation obtained with unsupervised clustering of the n d v i data the number of mz and its spatial distribution changed throughout the growing season at the beginning of the season until 50 days after sowing it seems that the optimal number of homogeneous mz was three the mz1 covered the north west side of the site and had the highest n d v i values the mz2 had intermediate n d v i and spanned across the south of the site until the 45th day after sowing and after that over the south west only the mz3 had lower n d v i values and was initially the north eastern side of the site then covered the entire western side of the field at 45 days after sowing from the 50th day after sowing the c h c indicated that four clusters were best at identifying areas with homogeneous n d v i mz1 and mz2 remained relatively similar to their early season delineations the mz4 identified an area of moderately low n d v i at the south eastern portion of the site whereas mz3 on the north eastern side of the site was characterized by the lowest n d v i values the spatial patterns of the four mzs changed only slightly over time until the 130th day after sowing when the size of mz3 increased remarkably while mz4 decreased the unsupervised n d v i clustering was compared to dividing the site into four blocks one for each maize variety fig 3c shows the c h c values for n d v i clustering into dynamic mz and into varietal based blocks through the growing season the dynamic mz design strategy had larger c h c values for the entire growing season than the variety block strategy indicating that the dynamic mzs identified by unsupervised clustering had more homogeneous n d v i than the varietal blocks fig 3a shows contrasting n d v i values between the eastern and western side of the field especially visible along the boundary between the d6980 and p1524 varieties the boundary between the d6980 and p1524 varieties seemed to be a big factor in the determination of the boundary between eastern mz1 and mz2 and western mz3 and mz4 zones from 55 to 120 days after sowing fig 3b fig a 1 f of appendix a shows the p1524 and d6780 varieties doing relatively poorly in july 2018 therefore in addition to different soil hydraulic properties on the east side of the field crop genetics e g pest resistance germination rate between the varieties and uneven management e g mechanical sowing fertilization soil tillage could have been contributing factors to the poor performance of the p1524 and d6780 varieties changes in mz delineation over time led to some changes in mz membership for certain soil water monitoring stations table 3 these changes occurred frequently in the early vegetative stages until 54 days after sowing no mz membership change occurred in the late vegetative and reproductive stages the mzs were characterized by contrasting soil properties throughout the season the mz had significantly p 0 05 different pc1 scores throughout the season according to the kruskal wallis test mz1 and mz2 were characterized by low pc1 scores whereas mz3 and mz4 were characterized by the highest pc1 scores fig a 3 of appendix a 3 3 ndvi and water applied changes in n d v i and a w across mzs are depicted in fig 4 a mz1 4b mz2 4c mz3 and 4d mz4 through the growing season n d v i in mz1 and mz2 was higher than in mz3 and mz4 furthermore n d v i was slightly higher in mz1 than in mz2 average a w in mz1 was close to 1 i e water content was near θfc throughout the entire growing season average a w in mz2 was greater than 1 at the beginning of the season until 45 days after sowing and then very close to 1 through the end of the growing season portions of mz3 and mz4 had lower n d v i values than mz1 and mz2 in these areas irrigation was likely excessive a w was considerably higher than 1 for the entire vegetative growth of maize and during the early reproductive stages once irrigation was halted in the northeastern corner of the site i e approximately over the area comprised by mz3 at 74 days after sowing the a w in mz3 gradually decreased until the end of the season while n d v i in mz3 remained stable halting irrigation in the northeastern corner of the site had little to no effect on the spatial extent of mz3 and the other mzs as shown in fig 3b the analysis of the daily total within mz a w variance s 2 provided further support for the use of n d v i to identify areas with similar a w conditions at the site in fig 4e the calculated total mz variance is normalized by the daily whole site a w variance especially beyond 45 days after sowing the beginning of the vt growth stage the normalized within mz variance is much less than 1 showing that a large part of the total a w variance was explained by splitting the site into dynamic mzs delineated based on an analysis of n d v i fraisse et al 2001 used yield within zone variance to evaluate soil derived mzs at the end of the season our results suggest that daily a w s 2 could also be used for in season evaluation of management zone designs the a w and n d v i time series data show that soil water content was a major factor determining n d v i spatiotemporal variability at the site n d v i is an indicator of the canopy vegetative growth and several studies have found positive correlations between n d v i a w and canopy vigor in different crops scudiero et al 2014 west et al 2018 however those studies were for water scarce conditions it is well known that crop water stress and reductions in canopy growth can occur due to either deficit of water or excess of water feddes et al 1978 in the current study where maize was grown under nearly waterlogged conditions for most of the growing season fig 4 changes in n d v i and a w between consecutive sentinel 2 scenes were negatively correlated with pearson r equal to 0 64 mz1 0 87 mz2 0 79 mz3 and 0 83 mz4 all significant at p 0 05 thus as reported in previous studies long et al 2015 quebrajo et al 2018 scudiero et al 2018 shanahan et al 2008 n d v i data alone should not be used to make irrigation management decisions n d v i and or other plant canopy information should be integrated with soil information to properly understand plant processes at a site 3 4 irrigation scheduling simulations with respect to within season management decisions one way to make a connection between n d v i based dynamic management zone delineation and soil conditions would be to use a simulation model to make within season forecasts of soil and crop conditions for different management options several authors have simulated different irrigation strategies for different purposes in order to define the most appropriate irrigation strategy autovino et al 2018 haj amor and bouri 2020 sakaguchi et al 2019 in the remainder of this paper we determine a hypothetical optimal irrigation schedule for each growing stage using the simulation optimization approach developed by fontanet 2019 we first show that a physically based simulation model hydrus 1d šimůnek et al 2016 is consistent with ndvi based zoning by simulating the field experiment and demonstrating agreement between measured aw and simulated available water s a w as well as showing a correspondence between simulated transpiration s t a rates and n d v i next we use the calibrated model to investigate what if irrigation scenarios calculating a hypothetical irrigation scheduling table for each dynamic mz that could have been generated from ndvi within season to guide irrigation 3 4 1 hydrus 1 d available water and transpiration simulations the well known hydrus 1d model solves the richards equation numerically to simulate variably saturated water flow and root water uptake in soils the model inputs and parameterizations used in our simulations are detailed in appendix b simulations of the experiment for differing monitoring locations all used the same inputs and parameters except for i the soil hydraulic properties which were measured at each station during the field campaign table 2 and ii the irrigation boundary condition which differed only for stations p10 and p11 because irrigation was stopped during the experiment in fig 5 daily observed a w for each station is compared with daily simulated available water s a w generally good agreement between a w and s a w existed for all stations although it is acknowledged that the a w time courses were relatively non dynamic still the simulations were done using independently measured hydraulic properties and without any calibration so the agreement is quite good modeling details can be found in appendix b missing data towards the end of the season in p7 was due to rodents chewing on the sensor cables fig 6 shows the weekly simulated actual transpiration s t a at each mz and the potential transpiration t p at the site at mz1 and mz2 s t a weekly averages were always equal or near the potential transpiration at mz3 and mz4 s t a weekly values were remarkably lower than the potential there was good correspondence between s t a and n d v i at each mz with a pearson r of 0 6 mz1 0 51 mz2 0 69 mz3 and 0 82 mz4 in agreement with the results discussed for n d v i and aw data section 3 2 remote sensing and dynamic management zones delineation low s t a values at mz3 and mz4 were due to waterlogging root water uptake and transpiration is reduced in the model whenever simulated soil water content exceeds a threshold value see appendix b stations in mz3 and mz4 see table 3 had a w and s a w over 1 for most of the growing season fig 4 3 4 2 irrigation scheduling for within season decision making we adopted the method of fontanet 2019 to investigate optimal irrigation scheduling for dynamic mzs in this method irrigation of duration τ t is prescribed whenever the soil moisture content decreases below a critical threshold level h t h as indicated by readings from a soil water pressure head sensor s the irrigation rate is assumed to be a fixed constant for a given irrigation system the recommended duration and threshold are determined using a simulation optimization procedure simulations are made using forecasted daily or weekly crop water demand reference et0 and a range of values for the irrigation scheduling parameters h t h and τ the optimal parameter values are those that maximize seasonal transpiration in the simulations transpiration being for many agronomically important crops proportional to marketable yield in adapting the simulation optimization method we make separate recommendations for each mz and update them whenever there is a change in mz station membership the recommended values of h t h and τ for a given mz are the average values determined for monitoring stations within the zone for simplicity we use in this example the known daily potential et0 for the forecasted model boundary condition rather than historical data which would be necessary for actual within season forecasts haghverdi et al 2015 and liang et al 2016 proposed calculating crop water requirements as a function of root growth since the soil depth to refill increases as roots grow deeper similarly in our simulations we triggered irrigation based on readings from progressively deeper sensors as the season progressed in principle when multiple sensor depths are available the sensor depth could be treated as an additional optimization parameter full details on our implementation of the fontanet 2019 procedure are given in appendix c although the fontanet 2019 method prescribes an optimized irrigation schedule in practice a grower may not be able to irrigate exactly according to a schedule and sensor readings particularly when there are multiple management zones therefore we also calculated recommended irrigation durations or equivalently irrigation amounts for soils that have become dryer than the optimal irrigation trigger point the resulting irrigation scheduling calendar for dynamic mz irrigation is presented in table 4 optimal irrigation strategies for each growth stage are shown in bold the other table entries show irrigation recommendations for field sections that are dryer than the optimal trigger point across all mzs the optimal irrigation durations were in the range of 1 9 to 2 6 h however the triggering thresholds varied by location thresholds for mz1 and mz2 were in the range of 18 3 to 30 kpa whereas the range for mz3 and mz4 was 10 to 20 kpa in general the recommendations are for more frequent and slightly shorter irrigations in mz3 and mz4 which are located on the east side of the field and feature finer textured soils with the specific hydrus 1d model parameterization used in the current study uptake and transpiration are penalized whenever any portion of the soil approaches saturation the recommendation of somewhat shorter more frequent irrigations on the east side is due to optimization s aversion to creating overly wet soil conditions near the surface such as may occur albeit briefly during a longer irrigation table 5 compares seasonal transpiration and irrigation simulated with optimal scheduling versus the amounts obtained simulating the field experiment for mz1 and mz2 the optimal schedule recommended 11 to 13 less water and increased transpiration by 5 to 8 for mz3 29 less water was recommended with an increase in transpiration of 24 and for mz4 a 17 reduction in irrigation corresponded to a massive 53 increase in transpiration these results are consistent with our earlier findings and discussion indicating the field was over irrigated especially in mz3 and mz4 4 conclusions irrigation scheduling is complicated due to the spatial and temporal variability of a number of variables and parameters in this work we investigated a workflow for improved precision irrigation scheduling using data from a field where four maize varieties were sown the workflow is based on dynamic mz delineation with unsupervised n d v i clustering this study demonstrates that delineation of mzs based on ndvi clustering was able to statistically represent within field spatial variability better than delineating mzs only based on maize varieties additionally the optimal number and spatial configuration of the mzs were found to change over the growing season the highest number of mzs was four the mz1 and mz2 corresponded to field sections where ndvi values reflected a typical maize crop performance whereas mz3 and mz4 featured relatively low n d v i values indicative of poor maize growth soil water content showed that the variation in crop performance was attributable to soil hydraulic properties soil available water and over irrigation further a relationship existed between ndvi and soil available water the results indicated that soil available water could potentially also be used for or incorporated into in season evaluation of management zone designs lastly we proposed a method of combining dynamic management zone delineation with hydrus 1 d model forecasts for irrigation scheduling the field experiment was first simulated to confirm the model parameterization and demonstrate its consistency with the obtained ndvi and soil water content data we then used model simulations to determine an optimal zonation and irrigation calendar for different crop growth stages that could have been generated and updated in real time during the season simulations with the optimized irrigation schedule produced an increase in transpiration and a decrease in water use as compared to the field trial which again was over irrigated the improvement was especially remarkable for mz3 and mz4 where irrigation was reduced by 28 5 and 16 6 and transpiration increased by 23 9 and 52 6 respectively in summary we note that although ndvi is useful for dynamically delineating management zones for irrigation scheduling it is recommended that ndvi be combined with some additional measure of soil conditions low ndvi values may be indicative of poor crop performance but without other information
