keywords traditional fishing boat wooden boat modeling linear regression indonesia 1 introduction shipbuilding is considered a tradition in indonesia where handmade wooden boats are built through techniques passed down by their ancestors jokosisworo and santosa 2015 trimulyono et al 2015 the traditional shipbuilding technique are also passed down without any standardized calculations and are being built in contrary to modern shipbuilding logic where the hull would be made prior to the ships frame stipulating the process of architectural heritage of shipbuilding experiences rather than knowledge in this study insights from several prior studies would be used to provide the underlying theories son and kim 2014 provided the business process management based on job assignment that could be used as an estimate to the man hours needed montwill et al 2018 sharma and gandhi 2017 and liu et al 2018 provided insights into the importance of key phases in shipbuilding the effects of lean principles in shipbuilding and design of the bilge keel in indonesia s east java boats which contributes to their safety performance using the insights provided by prior studies the model being

materials and the total man hours needed for each types of ship tonnage otherwise known as gross tonnage gt furthermore the research would also be conducted in two parts research and modeling with the conclusion limitations and future directions of the research provided at the end further elaboration on the research would also be discussed based on the result of sample profiles ship characters and their production process materials and man hours 2 research methodology 2 1 research design based on fig 1 first the research would start by conducting a survey and observation on traditional shipyard providing a sequential production process that is required in building a ship secondly the characteristic profile of each vessel would be collected based on the eight product quality dimension the data collected would include the size of the vessels and hatches furthermore if the team leader project manager do not know of the size direct measurement would be taken providing a data on their gt and hatches size material cost labor hours and cost would also be calculated at this step third the materials required would be calculated using a linear regression analysis based on the tonnage of the vessel the outcome provided would be the building time of each vessel and the model for multivariate linear regression of the materials required to build the vessel based on their gt finally to ensure practicality and data validation for management use an error forecast would be done on the resulting data gathered through all steps of observations and analysis 2 2 research sample the purposive sampling was applied to collect the data a total of fourteen vessels from eight different traditional shipyards in lamongan were selected as samples fourteen samples were taken because there are merely few traditional shipyards which manufacture the new vessel most of the traditional shipyards are vessel repair in addition the data has been representatives the minimum vessel is 16 gt and the maximum one is 64 gt all the vessels have ijon ijon type which the hull construction shape is u and the vessels do not have a taper pole the ijon ijon type is the uniqueness of hull construction in lamongan regency and east java province in this study we use seven data of traditional fishing boats as a regression model subsequently we validate the model with other data of 7 traditional fishing boats with the same hull construction and fish catching tool the description of each vessel is presented in fig 2 the loa the breadth and the height for each boat are then calculated by using the equation admiralty and maritime law guide 1969 2 1 gt k1 v where k1 0 2 0 02 log v v loa bm hm 0 5 loa length over all bm breadth molded hm height molded the calculation of gt size is summarized in the table 1 2 3 data collection data collection starts with an interview on the project team leader for each vessel type the question are semi structured to record the shipbuilding process other aspects such as worker skill the numbers of workers daily wage working hours and material required are also gathered in this process the characteristic profile for each vessel are collected based on their product quality dimension i e durability performance reliability serviceability features aesthetics perceived quality and conformance furthermore to properly measure the quality criteria the measurements of each factor will be explained in greater detail starting from the durability where the durability of the vessel is based on the length of time the vessel are being used in comparison to their size or gross tonnage the performance index is represented by the number of engines the gearbox ratio engine horsepower the engine rpm rotations per minute engine brand and type engine position inboard outboard propeller diameter boat speed fuel capacity and the number of generator and accumulator the reliability is stated by the travel distance boatload hatches capacity and the holding capacity of ice blocks the serviceability factor is described by the suppliers place of engine propeller wood type and number of crew needed to operate the vessel the features are determined by the availability of different fishing tools capacity of the net and additional equipment such as lamp multimedia and gps the aesthetics of the vessel is described as the shape of hull construction while the perceived quality is reflected by ship owner s quality control finally the conformance is the product assurance to the defined specification 2 4 characteristics profile the vessels being observed in this research are narrowed down to four different sizes with their characteristics displayed in table 2 in observation it is observed that each of the four types have three engines each two working to drive the boat while one is a reserve should any of the other engine happen to fail the engine rpm are at 2400 with mitsubishi and yanmar being the manufacturers behind the engines with propeller diameters of 20 30 32 20 or 38 36 and speed under full load of 5 miles hour 6 miles hour or 7 miles hour their boatload number of ice blocks number of hatches and their size varies depending on gross tonnage with maneuvering characteristic varied between 16 and 28 m in diameter and fuel capacity is linearly correlated to the gt on average the crew needed to operate the vessels is 12 but this is dependent on the types of tools they use to fish i e trawl this would subsequently affect the size of the wheelhouse 2 5 correlation correlation coefficient r is a quantitative measure to indicate the relationship between two variables the relations could start with totally unrelated 1 weakly related or unrelated with coefficient values near 0 and highly related with values nearing 1 or at 1 representing both positive and negative relationship between variables the general equation of correlation coefficient is lind et al 2013 2 2 r n x i y i x i y i n x i 2 x i 2 n y i 2 y i 2 where r coefficient correlation x i independent variable y i dependent variable we used correlation to measure the relationship between the man hours and the gt sizes besides we also measure the relationship between the gt sizes and the number of material used 2 6 simple linear regression regression equation represents the linear relationship between two variables simple linear regression involves one independent variable the general form of simple linear regression is as follows kutner et al 2008 2 3 y ˆ a b x where y ˆ the estimation of y value for each chosen x value a the intercept of y b the gradient x independent variable in this study simple linear regression is used to model the relationship between the gt sizes y and the man hours in shipbuilding x 2 7 multivariate linear regression the general form of multivariate linear regression is kutner et al 2008 2 4 y ˆ a b 1 x 1 b 2 x 2 b 3 x 3 b k x k where a the intercept y b j the delta y when x j increasing one unit with other independent variables are constant k the number of independent variables if there are only two independent variables the multivariate linear regression equation will be 2 5 y ˆ a b 1 x 1 b 2 x 2 in this study multivariate linear regression is used to model the relationship between the gt sizes y and the number of teak wood x 1 and the number of mahogany wood x 2 2 8 standard deviation of error estimation the forecasting result of linear regression is measured by using standard error estimation estimating standard error is dispersion measurement from the observed value around linear regression for each x value the equation of standard error estimation is as follows lind et al 2013 2 6 s y x y y ˆ 2 n s y x the standard error estimation y ˆ predicted value of dependent variable y actual value of dependent variable the standard deviation of error estimation is used to measure the error of forecast by simple and multivariate linear regressions as a result any data that were not utilized in generating the regression equations would be validated 3 results and discussions 3 1 production process of traditional boat based on fig 3 the production process starts from wood cutting requiring four persons with 7m3 day of lumber processed with a width of 4 cm next is the hull construction which is done using no specifications rather using time old knowledge and experience following that is the placement of the frame the unusual process of hull before frame once again is the indication of tradition rather than specification and production process that have to be passed down through generations of shipbuilders bypassing the need for formal education to some degree after the construction of the hull and frame the next step is the installation of the hatches with their numbers depended on the size or gt of the vessel afterwards is the installation of the wheelhouse their size depended on the boat size and the types of tools available for the fishermans after the shipyard finishes the installation of the wheelhouse the ship are then given to a third party service for the installation of both the driving and net engines afterwards the final painting and sea trials are conducted by the workers from the shipyard themselves after finishing the sea trials the fishing vessel are delivered directly to the customers 3 2 man hours consumed in traditional boat building process after the interview done with the shipbuilding leader the man hours necessary for producing a ship is separated into seven activities they are wood cutting hull construction frame construction hatch installation main engine installation net engine installation and wheelhouse building on average the number of workers working at the same time on the project varies between 2 and 7 people and the time taken to finish a section between 2 and 7 days with the most time spent in the hull frame and hatch construction and installation furthermore the man hours needed for the construction are calculated as a multiplication of workers number times the number of day and working hours per day with the working hours starts at 8 a m and finishes at 4 p m including a break of 1 h this resulted in a standard production rate a rate of production in which the ships are being deployed in a unit of ship months which is the number of hours divided by total working day 6 days a week with the assigned number of workers a 53 gt vessel in 7826 h or equal to 7 3 months per ship a 31 gt vessel in 7040 h or equal to 7 9 months per ship a 22 gt vessel in 5194 h or equal to 4 9 months per ship and the 16 gt vessel in 3904 h or equal to 3 4 months it should also be noted that the reason the 31 gt vessel took longer to finished is caused by the lack of manpower assigned to the vessels construction while the 16 gt have an 8 h per day workshifts resulting in a faster production time than other vessels a full description of the observations could be seen on table 3 with the overall man hours consumed for each vessel are summarized in table 4 3 3 the labor cost in the building process of traditional boat in this section this study goes into further detail by separating the cost of labour into three categories beginner medium and expert with the cost components represented for each of the production processes the range of daily wages also differs between each steps and the level of expertise is not necessarily come from the time spent working with the ship building company for greater detail on the amount of salary for all types of vessel it could be seen in table 5 through 8 for the dataset on table 8 it should be noted that the values are taken from another site for ship building which is the lamongan site brondong sub district which is different from the construction site for the 22 to the 53 gt vessels furthermore a summary of total labor cost is also given in table 9 3 4 the material cost in the building process of traditional boat for the material costing the wood cutting division chosen as the observation sample is the brondong sub district lamongan there are 4 classes for each types of wood which is divided by their diameters and length with name assignments of a1 a2 a3 and a4 there are also two types of wood being used teak and mahogany with the sample of the wood with a length of 2 m on average each each wood sample have a diameter ranging from smaller than 20 cm to more 40 cm and the price range of 7 000 000 to 13 000 000 idr and 1 200 000 to 4 000 000 idr for teak and mahogany respectively with the details explained in table 10 furthermore the usage of different types of woods in each vessel type is due to the cost saving factor making the use of teak wood for the hull below the water line and mahogany being used as part of the hull above the water line and the wheelhouse further detail on wood usage and their quantity is detailed in table 11 the reason for the difference in wood type is because teak is waterproof and the fibers would not crack easily under bending pressure with mahogany being a type of wood that is comparatively cheaper than teak 3 5 modeling of the gt size and the composition of wood material type prior to modeling with linear regression the correlation between the gt size and the number of material was calculated the results show that r 2 0 98 or r 0 99 it can be inferred that there is a high correlation between the gt size and the number of teak and mahogany woods subsequently the linear regression between the gt size and the composition of wood material type can be calculated by using the multivariate linear regression the data to generate the model is summarized in table 12 by using the multivariate linear regression in equation 2 5 we obtained the model 3 1 y ˆ 3 64 1 2131 x 1 0 318 x 2 where y ˆ the gt size x 1 the number of teak wood x 2 the number of mahogany wood the output of multivariate linear regression using minitab version 17 0 is summarized in table 13 to validate the multivariate linear regression model the data as described in table 14 are used the data consists of 7 vessels with ijon ijon type the data were selected by purposive sampling to the traditional shipyards in lamongan regency moreover the standard error estimation of the multivariate linear regression y ˆ is calculated by using equation 2 6 the result of error and validation models is shown in tables 15 and 16 by dividing the standard deviation s x y to the average of gross tonnage the measurement error is attained the error estimation in validating the multivariate linear regression is 5 72 comparing to the error of model data i e 8 90 the error of validation is less than the model it can be inferred that the model of the number of material is not over fitting moreover the data also shows that from 14 samples is that the usage of teak wood at least 22 57 of the total number of material meanwhile the rest of the material is mahogany wood which is approximately 43 78 when the owner has a higher capital the use of teak wood could be more than 57 3 6 modeling of the gt size and the man hours in order to get the simple linear regression between gt size and man hours the data as described in table 17 are used the output of simple linear regression by using minitab 17 0 is described in table 18 the results show that r 2 0 95 or r 0 97 it means that there is a significant correlation between gt size and man hours subsequently the linear regression between the gt size and the man hours was modeled by using simple linear regression equation thus the model was obtained as follows 3 2 y ˆ 2822 110 x where y ˆ the man hours hour x the gt size to validate the simple linear regression model the other seven data as described in section 3 8 are used and then summarized in table 19 subsequently the estimation error of the simple linear regression y ˆ was measured by dividing the standard error estimation to the average of man hours the result of error estimation in model and validation is displayed on tables 20 and 21 the error estimation in validating the simple linear regression is 5 78 comparing to the error of model data i e 6 06 the error of validation is less than the model it can be inferred that the model of man hours is not over fitting moreover in traditional shipyard delays could come due to many reasons especially in rainy season where a delay can last for one to two months other reasons for delay could also come from delay in wood shipments failed wood processing painting process and caulking time the reason why rainy season hampers work on vessel is due to electrical machinery used on the making of the vessel are being done outdoors while delay in wood shipment comes from inventory shortages from the suppliers side there are also red tape hampering wood orders from the forestry department which in turn increase lead time the failings in wood processing which in turn increase delay is due to the fact that most treatment are being done traditionally using fire and manual labor while the painting and caulking processes takes time because of the amount of detail and general time needed for trying in terms of paint type there are specific guidelines provided by indonesian classification bureau which specified the standards of paints to be used in the making of the vessel furthermore it should be noted that equations 3 1 and 3 2 are specifically used for fishing vessel above 15 gt and uses trawl as their fishing tool 3 7 the optimization of man hours the function of time consumption t c ˆ of building traditional boats to the gt size is modeled by equation 2 7 2 7 t c ˆ c 1 c 2 c 3 g t a 1 g t e c 1 a 2 g t e c 2 a 3 g t e c 3 a 4 g t e c 1 c 2 2 a 5 g t e c 1 c 3 2 a 6 g t e c 2 c 3 2 a 7 g t e c 1 c 2 c 3 3 where c 1 the number of beginner worker c 2 the number of medium worker c 3 the number of expert worker exponential is used in the model because there are data without any beginner worker as in table 6 from the hull construction stage to the wheelhouse building installation to avoid the division by zero we use an exponential number each own worker performs theirs capability as described in exponents of c 1 c 2 c 3 besides the interaction among beginner medium and expert also influences another worker for example the beginner gets a guidance from the expert or medium workers in hull construction process therefore the exponent with the combination of c 1 and c 2 c 1 and c 3 c 2 and c 3 and c 1 c 2 c 3 are used in the model the optimization of labor cost is multiplication of t c ˆ the labor cost in each skill level and the number of worker as given in equation 2 8 2 8 l c ˆ t c ˆ b c 1 c 1 t c ˆ b c 2 c 2 t c ˆ b c 3 c 3 where l c ˆ labor cost b c 1 the labor cost of beginner per day b c 2 the labor cost of medium per day b c 3 the labor cost of expert per day with c 1 c 2 c 3 is the number of beginner medium and expert worker respectively in this study we set the daily wage of beginner medium and expert levels by rp 125 000 00 rp 150 000 00 and rp 200 000 00 respectively finally the total labor cost tlc is the summation of labor cost and the cost of woods cutting as presented in equation 2 9 2 9 t l c ˆ l c ˆ 85000 g t the cost of woods cutting rp 85 000 00 per gt is obtained by average cost of cutting from tables 5 8 divided by total gt sizes the data of model and observation of determining t c ˆ and t l c ˆ is presented in table 22 table 22 shows the combination of c 1 c 2 c 3 in determining t c ˆ and t l c ˆ for several measurements of 53 gt 31 gt 22 gt and 16 gt the coefficients model of a 1 a 2 a 7 as in eq 2 7 are 2 26 7 54 7 12 8 15 7 26 12 69 34 81 respectively thus the average error of t c ˆ is 4 46 and t l c ˆ is 4 76 these average errors are in tolerance threshold of less than 5 significance level figs 4 and 5 shows the time consumption t c ˆ and the labor cost t l c ˆ between observation and model output with respect to error respectively in searching the minimum labor cost we do the numerical example for traditional fishing boat with the size of 53 gt we assume that the maximum number of expert worker is 2 persons the time consumption t c ˆ for single expert worker c 3 1 is presented in table 23 based on the table 23 and fig 6 the highest t c ˆ is obtained at 461 days with one beginner one medium and one expert workers meanwhile the lowest t c ˆ is attained at 115 days with six beginner two medium and one expert workers however the lowest t c ˆ does not guarantee to achieve the lowest total labor cost t l c ˆ based on table 24 and fig 7 the lowest total labor cost t l c ˆ is obtained by rp 148 260 000 00 with six beginner two medium and one expert workers on the other hand the highest total labor cost is resulted by rp 246 860 000 00 with six beginner six medium and one expert workers it can be inferred that the lowest time consumption and the lowest total labor cost for building traditional boats of 53 gt is at 115 days and at the set of six beginner two medium and one expert workers respectively based on table 25 and fig 8 the highest t c ˆ is obtained at 334 days with one beginner one medium and two expert workers moreover the lowest t c ˆ is attained at 49 days with six beginner alternative of four five or six medium and two expert workers again the lowest t c ˆ could not guarantee for providing the lowest total of labor cost based on table 26 and fig 9 the lowest t l c ˆ is achieved at rp 86 110 000 00 with six beginner three medium and two expert workers meanwhile the highest t l c ˆ is resulted at rp 229 960 000 00 with one beginner one medium and two expert workers it can be inferred that the lowest t c ˆ for double expert workers did not provide the lowest total labor cost t l c ˆ the set of six beginner three medium and two expert workers is the best combination for building traditional boats of 53 gt in 51 days and achieving the lowest labor cost of rp 86 110 000 00 by comparing the total labor cost tlc as shown in table 27 the use of two experts have proven to lower the labor cost for all combinations of workers beginner medium and experts the minimum total labor cost that is the most optimum being 86 110 000 00 idr with a combination of six beginners three medium and two experts 4 conclusion and future research based on the result of the research it is shown that each tonnage type of vessels has different characteristics and in turn they require different amounts of labor and material requirements the process that is observed in this research are separated into wood cutting or processing hull construction frame installation hatches installation wheelhouse installation engines installations in which they are outsourced to a third party provider and finally the painting and sea trials there are four types of vessels being observed 53 gt 31 gt 22 gt and 16 gt with 7826 7040 5194and 3904 total labor hours needed to construct each ship respectively furthermore with the resulting multivariate linear regression for the time and expenses validation error being 5 72 below the model error of 8 9 the result is not over fitting the characteristics profiles of traditional boats in 53 31 22 and 16 gt are presented based on the dimension of product quality several tasks in the building process i e cutting wood hull construction frame installation hatches installation the wheelhouse building installation enginery installation painting and sea trial has been discussed the man hours of all tasks for each vessel have been estimated the results show that the man hours are 7826 7040 5194 and 3904 h for 53 31 22 and 16 gt respectively the number of wood material needed and subsequently forecasted in accordance to the gt size the results provide the multivariate linear regression with the validation error estimates of 5 72 the validation error is lower than model error of 8 9 it means that the multivariate linear regression model is not over fitting the remarkable data of eight different traditional shipyards is that the owner will use the teak wood at least 22 57 of the total number of material meanwhile the rest of material is mahogany wood which is approximately 43 78 thus the material cost is correspondingly increasing to the gt size furthermore the man hours are estimated based on the gt size the results reveal the simple linear regression with the validation error estimates of 5 78 the validation error is lower than model error of 6 06 it means that the simple linear regression model is not over fitting in addition the project can be finished in delay for one month to two months due to the rainy seasons the delay of wood material arrival failing in wood bending and the painting and caulking times besides the labor cost is directly proportional to the gt size this research provides significant contribution to the building of traditional fishing boat that the gt size is larger than 15 gt the type of fish catching tool is trawl and the type of hull construction is ijon ijon the optimization how many beginner medium and expert workers are needed to finish all the tasks to minimize the labor cost and time consumption in building traditional fishing boat has been addressed the modeling of time consumption and total labor cost t l c ˆ give the average error of 4 46 and 4 76 respectively subsequently we also do the numerical example of 53 gt and we use the assumption of maximum 2 expert workers the results show that the double expert workers provide the lower labor cost for any combination of the number of beginner and medium workers furthermore the lowest time consumption and labor cost of 53 gt is attained at 51 days and at rp 86 110 000 00 with the set of six beginner three medium and two expert workers this study gives managerial insight to the traditional shipyard in minimizing the labor cost and estimating the time to build the traditional boats

involves one independent variable the general form of simple linear regression is as follows kutner et al 2008 2 3 y ˆ a b x where y ˆ the estimation of y value for each chosen x value a the intercept of y b the gradient x independent variable in this study simple linear regression is used to model the relationship between the gt sizes y and the man hours in shipbuilding x 2 7 multivariate linear regression the general form of multivariate linear regression is kutner et al 2008 2 4 y ˆ a b 1 x 1 b 2 x 2 b 3 x 3 b k x k where a the intercept y b j the delta y when x j increasing one unit with other independent variables are constant k the number of independent variables if there are only two independent variables the multivariate linear regression equation will be 2 5 y ˆ a b 1 x 1 b 2 x 2 in this study multivariate linear regression is used to model the relationship between the gt sizes y and the number of teak wood x 1 and the number of mahogany wood x 2 2 8 standard deviation of error estimation the forecasting result of linear regression is measured by using standard error estimation estimating standard error is dispersion measurement from the observed value around linear regression for each x value the equation of standard error estimation is as follows lind et al 2013 2 6 s y x y y ˆ 2 n s y x the standard error estimation y ˆ predicted value of dependent variable y actual value of dependent variable the standard deviation of error estimation is used to measure the error of forecast by simple and multivariate linear regressions as a result any data that were not utilized in generating the regression equations would be validated 3 results and discussions 3 1 production process of traditional boat based on fig 3 the production process starts from wood cutting requiring four persons with 7m3 day of lumber processed with a width of 4 cm next is the hull construction which is done using no specifications rather using time old knowledge and experience following that is the placement of the frame the unusual process of hull before frame once again is the indication of tradition rather than specification and production process that have to be passed down through generations of shipbuilders bypassing the need for formal education to some degree after the construction of the hull and frame the next step is the installation of the hatches with their numbers depended on the size or gt of the vessel afterwards is the installation of the wheelhouse their size depended on the boat size and the types of tools available for the fishermans after the shipyard finishes the installation of the wheelhouse the ship are then given to a third party service for the installation of both the driving and net engines afterwards the final painting and sea trials are conducted by the workers from the shipyard themselves after finishing the sea trials the fishing vessel are delivered directly to the customers 3 2 man hours consumed in traditional boat building process after the interview done with the shipbuilding leader the man hours necessary for producing a ship is separated into seven activities they are wood cutting hull construction frame construction hatch installation main engine installation net engine installation and wheelhouse building on average the number of workers working at the same time on the project varies between 2 and 7 people and the time taken to finish a section between 2 and 7 days with the most time spent in the hull frame and hatch construction and installation furthermore the man hours needed for the construction are calculated as a multiplication of workers number times the number of day and working hours per day with the working hours starts at 8 a m and finishes at 4 p m including a break of 1 h this resulted in a standard production rate a rate of production in which the ships are being deployed in a unit of ship months which is the number of hours divided by total working day 6 days a week with the assigned number of workers a 53 gt vessel in 7826 h or equal to 7 3 months per ship a 31 gt vessel in 7040 h or equal to 7 9 months per ship a 22 gt vessel in 5194 h or equal to 4 9 months per ship and the 16 gt vessel in 3904 h or equal to 3 4 months it should also be noted that the reason the 31 gt vessel took longer to finished is caused by the lack of manpower assigned to the vessels construction while the 16 gt have an 8 h per day workshifts resulting in a faster production time than other vessels a full description of the observations could be seen on table 3 with the overall man hours consumed for each vessel are summarized in table 4 3 3 the labor cost in the building process of traditional boat in this section this study goes into further detail by separating the cost of labour into three categories beginner medium and expert with the cost components represented for each of the production processes the range of daily wages also differs between each steps and the level of expertise is not necessarily come from the time spent working with the ship building company for greater detail on the amount of salary for all types of vessel it could be seen in table 5 through 8 for the dataset on table 8 it should be noted that the values are taken from another site for ship building which is the lamongan site brondong sub district which is different from the construction site for the 22 to the 53 gt vessels furthermore a summary of total labor cost is also given in table 9 3 4 the material cost in the building process of traditional boat for the material costing the wood cutting division chosen as the observation sample is the brondong sub district lamongan there are 4 classes for each types of wood which is divided by their diameters and length with name assignments of a1 a2 a3 and a4 there are also two types of wood being used teak and mahogany with the sample of the wood with a length of 2 m on average each each wood sample have a diameter ranging from smaller than 20 cm to more 40 cm and the price range of 7 000 000 to 13 000 000 idr and 1 200 000 to 4 000 000 idr for teak and mahogany respectively with the details explained in table 10 furthermore the usage of different types of woods in each vessel type is due to the cost saving factor making the use of teak wood for the hull below the water line and mahogany being used as part of the hull above the water line and the wheelhouse further detail on wood usage and their quantity is detailed in table 11 the reason for the difference in wood type is because teak is waterproof and the fibers would not crack easily under bending pressure with mahogany being a type of wood that is comparatively cheaper than teak 3 5 modeling of the gt size and the composition of wood material type prior to modeling with linear regression the correlation between the gt size and the number of material was calculated the results show that r 2 0 98 or r 0 99 it can be inferred that there is a high correlation between the gt size and the number of teak and mahogany woods subsequently the linear regression between the gt size and the composition of wood material type can be calculated by using the multivariate linear regression the data to generate the model is summarized in table 12 by using the multivariate linear regression in equation 2 5 we obtained the model 3 1 y ˆ 3 64 1 2131 x 1 0 318 x 2 where y ˆ the gt size x 1 the number of teak wood x 2 the number of mahogany wood the output of multivariate linear regression using minitab version 17 0 is summarized in table 13 to validate the multivariate linear regression model the data as described in table 14 are used the data consists of 7 vessels with ijon ijon type the data were selected by purposive sampling to the traditional shipyards in lamongan regency moreover the standard error estimation of the multivariate linear regression y ˆ is calculated by using equation 2 6 the result of error and validation models is shown in tables 15 and 16 by dividing the standard deviation s x y to the average of gross tonnage the measurement error is attained the error estimation in validating the multivariate linear regression is 5 72 comparing to the error of model data i e 8 90 the error of validation is less than the model it can be inferred that the model of the number of material is not over fitting moreover the data also shows that from 14 samples is that the usage of teak wood at least 22 57 of the total number of material meanwhile the rest of the material is mahogany wood which is approximately 43 78 when the owner has a higher capital the use of teak wood could be more than 57 3 6 modeling of the gt size and the man hours in order to get the simple linear regression between gt size and man hours the data as described in table 17 are used the output of simple linear regression by using minitab 17 0 is described in table 18 the results show that r 2 0 95 or r 0 97 it means that there is a significant correlation between gt size and man hours subsequently the linear regression between the gt size and the man hours was modeled by using simple linear regression equation thus the model was obtained as follows 3 2 y ˆ 2822 110 x where y ˆ the man hours hour x the gt size to validate the simple linear regression model the other seven data as described in section 3 8 are used and then summarized in table 19 subsequently the estimation error of the simple linear regression y ˆ was measured by dividing the standard error estimation to the average of man hours the result of error estimation in model and validation is displayed on tables 20 and 21 the error estimation in validating the simple linear regression is 5 78 comparing to the error of model data i e 6 06 the error of validation is less than the model it can be inferred that the model of man hours is not over fitting moreover in traditional shipyard delays could come due to many reasons especially in rainy season where a delay can last for one to two months other reasons for delay could also come from delay in wood shipments failed wood processing painting process and caulking time the reason why rainy season hampers work on vessel is due to electrical machinery used on the making of the vessel are being done outdoors while delay in wood shipment comes from inventory shortages from the suppliers side there are also red tape hampering wood orders from the forestry department which in turn increase lead time the failings in wood processing which in turn increase delay is due to the fact that most treatment are being done traditionally using fire and manual labor while the painting and caulking processes takes time because of the amount of detail and general time needed for trying in terms of paint type there are specific guidelines provided by indonesian classification bureau which specified the standards of paints to be used in the making of the vessel furthermore it should be noted that equations 3 1 and 3 2 are specifically used for fishing vessel above 15 gt and uses trawl as their fishing tool 3 7 the optimization of man hours the function of time consumption t c ˆ of building traditional boats to the gt size is modeled by equation 2 7 2 7 t c ˆ c 1 c 2 c 3 g t a 1 g t e c 1 a 2 g t e c 2 a 3 g t e c 3 a 4 g t e c 1 c 2 2 a 5 g t e c 1 c 3 2 a 6 g t e c 2 c 3 2 a 7 g t e c 1 c 2 c 3 3 where c 1 the number of beginner worker c 2 the number of medium worker c 3 the number of expert worker exponential is used in the model because there are data without any beginner worker as in table 6 from the hull construction stage to the wheelhouse building installation to avoid the division by zero we use an exponential number each own worker performs theirs capability as described in exponents of c 1 c 2 c 3 besides the interaction among beginner medium and expert also influences another worker for example the beginner gets a guidance from the expert or medium workers in hull construction process therefore the exponent with the combination of c 1 and c 2 c 1 and c 3 c 2 and c 3 and c 1 c 2 c 3 are used in the model the optimization of labor cost is multiplication of t c ˆ the labor cost in each skill level and the number of worker as given in equation 2 8 2 8 l c ˆ t c ˆ b c 1 c 1 t c ˆ b c 2 c 2 t c ˆ b c 3 c 3 where l c ˆ labor cost b c 1 the labor cost of beginner per day b c 2 the labor cost of medium per day b c 3 the labor cost of expert per day with c 1 c 2 c 3 is the number of beginner medium and expert worker respectively in this study we set the daily wage of beginner medium and expert levels by rp 125 000 00 rp 150 000 00 and rp 200 000 00 respectively finally the total labor cost tlc is the summation of labor cost and the cost of woods cutting as presented in equation 2 9 2 9 t l c ˆ l c ˆ 85000 g t the cost of woods cutting rp 85 000 00 per gt is obtained by average cost of cutting from tables 5 8 divided by total gt sizes the data of model and observation of determining t c ˆ and t l c ˆ is presented in table 22 table 22 shows the combination of c 1 c 2 c 3 in determining t c ˆ and t l c ˆ for several measurements of 53 gt 31 gt 22 gt and 16 gt the coefficients model of a 1 a 2 a 7 as in eq 2 7 are 2 26 7 54 7 12 8 15 7 26 12 69 34 81 respectively thus the average error of t c ˆ is 4 46 and t l c ˆ is 4 76 these average errors are in tolerance threshold of less than 5 significance level figs 4 and 5 shows the time consumption t c ˆ and the labor cost t l c ˆ between observation and model output with respect to error respectively in searching the minimum labor cost we do the numerical example for traditional fishing boat with the size of 53 gt we assume that the maximum number of expert worker is 2 persons the time consumption t c ˆ for single expert worker c 3 1 is presented in table 23 based on the table 23 and fig 6 the highest t c ˆ is obtained at 461 days with one beginner one medium and one expert workers meanwhile the lowest t c ˆ is attained at 115 days with six beginner two medium and one expert workers however the lowest t c ˆ does not guarantee to achieve the lowest total labor cost t l c ˆ based on table 24 and fig 7 the lowest total labor cost t l c ˆ is obtained by rp 148 260 000 00 with six beginner two medium and one expert workers on the other hand the highest total labor cost is resulted by rp 246 860 000 00 with six beginner six medium and one expert workers it can be inferred that the lowest time consumption and the lowest total labor cost for building traditional boats of 53 gt is at 115 days and at the set of six beginner two medium and one expert workers respectively based on table 25 and fig 8 the highest t c ˆ is obtained at 334 days with one beginner one medium and two expert workers moreover the lowest t c ˆ is attained at 49 days with six beginner alternative of four five or six medium and two expert workers again the lowest t c ˆ could not guarantee for providing the lowest total of labor cost based on table 26 and fig 9 the lowest t l c ˆ is achieved at rp 86 110 000 00 with six beginner three medium and two expert workers meanwhile the highest t l c ˆ is resulted at rp 229 960 000 00 with one beginner one medium and two expert workers it can be inferred that the lowest t c ˆ for double expert workers did not provide the lowest total labor cost t l c ˆ the set of six beginner three medium and two expert workers is the best combination for building traditional boats of 53 gt in 51 days and achieving the lowest labor cost of rp 86 110 000 00 by comparing the total labor cost tlc as shown in table 27 the use of two experts have proven to lower the labor cost for all combinations of workers beginner medium and experts the minimum total labor cost that is the most optimum being 86 110 000 00 idr with a combination of six beginners three medium and two experts 4 conclusion and future research based on the result of the research it is shown that each tonnage type of vessels has different characteristics and in turn they require different amounts of labor and material requirements the process that is observed in this research are separated into wood cutting or processing hull construction frame installation hatches installation wheelhouse installation engines installations in which they are outsourced to a third party provider and finally the painting and sea trials there are four types of vessels being observed 53 gt 31 gt 22 gt and 16 gt with 7826 7040 5194and 3904 total labor hours needed to construct each ship respectively furthermore with the resulting multivariate linear regression for the time and expenses validation error being 5 72 below the model error of 8 9 the result is not over fitting the characteristics profiles of traditional boats in 53 31 22 and 16 gt are presented based on the dimension of product quality several tasks in the building process i e cutting wood hull construction frame installation hatches installation the wheelhouse building installation enginery installation painting and sea trial has been discussed the man hours of all tasks for each vessel have been estimated the results show that the man hours are 7826 7040 5194 and 3904 h for 53 31 22 and 16 gt respectively the number of wood material needed and subsequently forecasted in accordance to the gt size the results provide the multivariate linear regression with the validation error estimates of 5 72 the validation error is lower than model error of 8 9 it means that the multivariate linear regression model is not over fitting the remarkable data of eight different traditional shipyards is that the owner will use the teak wood at least 22 57 of the total number of material meanwhile the rest of material is mahogany wood which is approximately 43 78 thus the material cost is correspondingly increasing to the gt size furthermore the man hours are estimated based on the gt size the results reveal the simple linear regression with the validation error estimates of 5 78 the validation error is lower than model error of 6 06 it means that the simple linear regression model is not over fitting in addition the project can be finished in delay for one month to two months due to the rainy seasons the delay of wood material arrival failing in wood bending and the painting and caulking times besides the labor cost is directly proportional to the gt size this research provides significant contribution to the building of traditional fishing boat that the gt size is larger than 15 gt the type of fish catching tool is trawl and the type of hull construction is ijon ijon the optimization how many beginner medium and expert workers are needed to finish all the tasks to minimize the labor cost and time consumption in building traditional fishing boat has been addressed the modeling of time consumption and total labor cost t l c ˆ give the average error of 4 46 and 4 76 respectively subsequently we also do the numerical example of 53 gt and we use the assumption of maximum 2 expert workers the results show that the double expert workers provide the lower labor cost for any combination of the number of beginner and medium workers furthermore the lowest time consumption and labor cost of 53 gt is attained at 51 days and at rp 86 110 000 00 with the set of six beginner three medium and two expert workers this study gives managerial insight to the traditional shipyard in minimizing the labor cost and estimating the time to build the traditional boats

22496,intense seismic excitations might be considered as one of the most important loading cases imposed on offshore jacket platforms to perform seismic assessments for these structures appropriate suites of ground motions can be selected by different methodologies since time history analyses of fixed offshore platforms are truly time consuming number of selected records can considerably change the computational expenses this paper quantitatively investigates the effects of sample size of records on seismic performance of these structures thus several record suites with different sample sizes are selected from a target population with 40 records so that the differences between the logarithmic mean and standard deviation of their response spectra become minimum using genetic algorithm the results show that the fragility curves based on the suites with larger sample sizes are closer to the target fragility nevertheless according to the results of the investigated case study some suites with smaller sample sizes e g 20 or 25 could lead to relatively acceptable accuracy at almost half the computational expenses also the correlation coefficients between the collapse fragilities of the selected record sets and the target one are very close to unity indicating that these collapse fragilities are linearly correlated with the target one keywords seismic fragility offshore jacket platform genetic algorithm incremental dynamic analysis sample size 1 introduction during the last recent decades offshore structural engineering has become strictly highlighted in the field of crude oil and gas industry as it is one of the decisive components of the world s economy the financial and environmental consequences of catastrophic failures of offshore structures have made researchers improve the analytical procedures for evaluating the structural performance of such structures in this regard earthquake is one of the most destructive natural disasters which may cause severe damages to the existing structures also the very unpredictability of earthquake has made it much more difficult for the engineers to exactly estimate the seismic behavior of the complex structural systems in 2010 asgarian and ajamy 2010 performed incremental dynamic analysis ida vamvatsikos 2002 vamvatsikos and cornell 2002 to investigate the seismic performance of 3 jacket type offshore platforms jtops subjected to a suite of 20 far field ground motions this record suite belongs to a bin with relatively large magnitudes of 6 5 6 9 and moderate distances all the motions are recorded on firm soil with no mark of directivity effects vamvatsikos 2002 vamvatsikos and cornell 2002 they used the story drift as the engineering demand parameter edp and first mode spectral acceleration as the intensity measure im ajamy et al 2014 proposed a comprehensive extended ida method to incorporate different sources of uncertainty associated with seismic loading modeling parameters and soil properties in the stochastic seismic analysis of jtops they employed a combination of latin hypercube sampling lhs method mckay et al 1979 and simulated annealing sa technique vorechovsky and novak 2009 to model the epistemic uncertainties of 5 different parameters yield strength elasticity modulus shear wave velocity shear modulus reduction curve and critical damping ratio and a set of 10 far field ground motions to account for the aleatoric uncertainties the selected records belong to a set of earthquake events with relatively large magnitudes of 6 0 7 3 large source to site distances 20 km and 70 km reverse or reverse oblique faulting mechanisms and pga values between 0 15g and 0 60g further heidary torkamani et al 2014 calculated the seismic fragility curves for an idealized pile supported wharf with batter piles using three different edps as displacement ductility factor differential settlement between deck and behind land and normalized residual horizontal displacement they derived the ida curves for a suite of 8 ground motion records selected from a record set with loose sand and the lowest shear wave speed around 203 5 m s sharifian et al 2015 studied the seismic behavior and capacity of the jtops by conducting ida and using a suite of 10 near fault ground motion records these records were selected from a suite of 40 near field ground motions collected by baker et al 2011 in such a way that their statistical features mean and standard deviation in logarithmic coordinates are almost the same el din and kim 2014 investigated the sensitivity of the seismic response parameters to the uncertain modeling variables of jtops by tornado diagram and first order second moment fosm techniques considering the epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties they selected a set of 30 records from the pacific earthquake engineering research peer ground motion database to take the random nature of earthquake into consideration these 30 records with the magnitude between 7 1 and 7 6 and the closest distance to the normal fault varying from 2 2 to 293 km are selected in such a way that the geometric mean of their response spectra matches the uniform hazard spectrum uhs with 2 probability of exceedance in 50 years in another research zarrin et al 2017 evaluated the variability of seismic demand and capacity of a case study jacket platform considering different sources of uncertainty to this end the sensitivity analysis was conducted not only in the particular earthquake level but also in other ranges of intensity using ida for a suite of 20 near fault ground motion records which were selected utilizing a similar approach as described in sharifian et al 2015 abyani et al 2017 investigated the assumption of lognormal hypothesis for the drift demand of jtops at two different regions of im as 1 low intensity levels without any case of global dynamic instability 2 higher im levels with some cases of global dynamic instability employing anderson darling ad goodness of fit test anderson and darling 1954 to this purpose they implemented ida procedure for a sample jtop using a 40 far field ground motion suite suggested by baker et al 2011 elsayed et al 2014 presented an approach for the reliability assessment of a fixed offshore jacket platform against earthquake collapse with consideration of pile soil interaction effects using first and second order reliability methods to compute the safety and reliability indices they selected 10 earthquake records so that the mean squared error mse between the considered target spectrum and the mean spectrum of the selected time series become minimum moreover el din and kim 2016 developed a simple methodology for seismic life cycle cost lcc estimation of steel jacket platforms they utilized equivalent single degree of freedom system instead of the main structure and eliminated the full ida and fragility analysis instead approximate fragility curves and localized ida curves for two sets of 10 ground motions representing strength level earthquake sle and ductility level earthquake dle were derived as well as a probabilistic simple closed form solution for loss estimation more recently ajamy et al 2018 worked on an analytical approach to develop seismic fragility curves for an existing jtop located in persian gulf utilizing the same record set as described in ajamy et al 2014 the approach is based on comprehensive interaction ida method considering the effects of both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties on probabilistic seismic performance of the jtop generally several approaches for ground motion selection such as generation of simulated records spectrum matching methods spectrum simulation and scaling methods have been addressed in the literature kiani and khanmohammadi 2015 kohrangi et al 2017 naeim et al 2004 more specifically baker 2011 employed the conditional mean spectrum cms method to determine the site specific target mean acceleration and target variance to this end monte carlo simulation mcs lemaire et al 2005 was applied to generate a set of response spectra that matches the target geometric mean and variance spectrum furthermore jayaram et al 2011 presented a computationally efficient and theoretically consistent algorithm to select a set of records which match the target response spectrum mean and variance by implementing a greedy optimization technique to improve the matching process their proposed methodology was improved by the approach suggested by baker and lee 2017 moschen et al 2017 introduced a ground motion selection process in which records are selected in a way that their first and second order statistics satisfy the predefined spectrum targets over a wide range of period employing multi objective genetic algorithm moga they used rudolph s algorithm rodulph 1999 referred to as nsga ii which has been recently improved by song and chen 2018 this paper aims to study the effects of sample size of ground motions on probabilistic seismic performance and fragility curves of offshore jacket platforms regarding the 3 dimensional numerical models of jtops with a lot of nonlinear structural elements the computational expenses of time history analyses for such infrastructures are too high this is one of the main reasons why sample size of record suites is important for the time consuming seismic assessments of these complicated structures in this process ida has been conducted considering a suite of 40 far field ground motions selected as explained in abyani et al 2017 baker et al 2011 to model the aleatoric variability of the records the changes in intensity and frequency content of the earthquake motions due to propagation of seismic waves in soil layers commonly referred to as site effects have direct impacts on structural responses during an earthquake event one dimensional site response analysis methods are widely used to quantify the effects of soil deposits on propagated ground motions these effects may lead to some amplification in responses which should be accurately assessed the site response analysis includes such steps as selecting a set of ground motions which are recorded on rock sites applying the rock outcrop motions and computing soil layers deposit responses and applying the responses of various soil layers to the fixed nodes of p y near field elements buratti et al 2010 has reported that using a well chosen record set with small number of ground motions may lead to accurate structural responses therefore an important question is raised how much error will be introduced in the seismic fragility curves of jtops in case of using record suites with different number of ground motions the present paper aims at finding some scientific answers to this question hence it is required to evaluate the bias induced on the probabilistic seismic performance of the structure by comparing the results of different record sets selected from a target population so a standardized ground motion set recorded on rock site baker et al 2011 is considered as the target suite and several sample sets of records with different sample sizes are selected from this target suite using genetic algorithm ga in fact it is intended to minimize the root mean squared error between the statistical properties logarithmic mean and standard deviation of the response spectra of the target and selected record suites by ga with aggregation functions as it is much easier to be implemented to avoid selecting repetitive ground motions in each suite a new type of mutation technique named targeted mutation has been utilized in each generation in the rest of the paper a brief description of the sample platform as well as its numerical model is presented afterward the record selection process and each step of the implemented ga is described in details in addition the site specific probabilistic seismic hazard curve corresponding to the fundamental period of the structure is computed by probabilistic seismic hazard analysis psha bazzurro and cornell 1999 finally the results including the ida and the summarized ida curves drift cumulative distribution functions cdfs collapse fragility curves their ad p values for each record suite and some other statistical measures are discussed followed by the conclusions 2 description of the sample jacket platform and its numerical model the comprehensive description of the jacket platform configuration is presented in a previous work of the authors zarrin et al 2017 herein only a summarized description of the sample platform as well as its numerical modeling procedure is presented the sample platform is a four leg jacket supported by four piles and is located approximately at 100 km distance offshore in the persian gulf one of the jacket face rows is vertical with only single batter at 1 8 and the other one is double battered at 1 8 the jacket module of the platform has four braced story levels see fig 1 the soil stratigraphic conditions are firm to stiff clay in shallow depths followed by very stiff clay and hard clay in deeper layers all the structural elements and joints are checked in compliance with the technical considerations of api rp 2a wsd 2000 and aisc 2003 codes lumped mass method has been used to simulate the mass of the platform components in the dynamic analyses entrapped water of flooded members and added mass for all the members below the sea level are also assigned to the corresponding member joints in addition the masses of secondary and nonstructural items are lumped to the nearest jacket structural nodes in order to perform the ida a numerical model of the sample jtop has been created in opensees software mazzoni et al 2007 the nonlinear distributed plasticity beam column element model has been applied to model the jacket and pile elements additionally a beam on nonlinear winkler foundation bnwf numerical model is supposed to perform uncoupled seismic soil pile superstructure interaction spsi analysis memarpour et al 2012 the pysimple1 uniaxial material model class is utilized to mimic the lateral behavior of near field soil boulanger et al 1999 the t z materials were incorporated into zero length elements to model skin friction on the pile the q z element is also installed under the pile to account for end bearing reaction the following subsections are supposed to explain how to take the hydrodynamic damping into account in the numerical model of the jacket platform and it is noted again that all the details of the numerical modeling process has been comprehensively addressed in abyani et al 2017 zarrin et al 2017 2 1 the morison equation the total hydro dynamic force acting on a cylinder in the in line direction per unit span f when the body moves relative to the flow in the inline direction this may occur when the structure is subjected to seismic loads is calculated by eq 1 first term of the equation is related to the drag force the second and third ones refer to the hydro dynamic mass and froude krylov forces respectively mutlu and fredsoe 1997 the forth term is attributed to external seismic loading 1 f 1 2 ρ c d d y y b y y b ρ c m a y y b ρ a y m y g ρ c d and c m represent the fluid density drag coefficient and the hydrodynamic mass coefficient respectively d and a are the diameter and the cross sectional area of the cylindrical body y y y b and y b denote the fluid velocity acceleration and the velocity and acceleration of the body respectively m and y g represent the mass of the structure and the input ground motion acceleration when the structure experiences seismic vibrations in still fluid y y 0 assuming that the seismic and wave loadings do not occur simultaneously api rp2a wsd the equation of motion will be in the form 2 m y b c y b k y b f in which c and k are the damping and elastic stiffness of the structure and y b is the displacement of the structure combining eq 1 and eq 2 will result in the following equation where m is the hydrodynamic mass per unit span that equals ρ c m a 3 m m y b c y b 1 2 ρ c d d y b y b k y b m y g eq 3 could be used to estimate the damping ratio considering the following points which both increase the total damping mutlu and fredsoe 1997 1 the total mass is no longer m and hydrodynamic mass is added as well in this study the mentioned added mass has been explicitly calculated and also considered in the numerical model of the sample platform in opensees software 2 there is an additional resistance force equal to 1 2 ρ c d d y b y b as can be seen this term is related to velocity similar to the structural damping term c y b hence as an equivalent approach for considering the latter type of damping the damping ratio ζ c 2 m ω ω is the angular frequency has been increased from 2 to 5 to compensate this term api rp2a wsd charney 2008 2 2 rayleigh damping damping as presented in eq 4 is referred to rayleigh proportional damping charney 2008 which has been widely used in various studies asgarian and ajamy 2010 ajamy et al 2014 el din and kim 2014 abyani et al 2017 zarrin et al 2017 ajamy et al 2018 4 c a 0 m a 1 k the first term of the aforementioned equation is the stiffness proportional term and the second one is the mass proportional term which almost simulates the condition that the structure is submerged in a viscous fluid when the fluid imposes drag force to the structure this is the reason of employing rayleigh damping in the numerical model of offshore structures a 0 and a 1 are the proportional coefficients which are determined by specifying the damping ratio in any two vibration modes charney 2008 it is declared that when the system responds nonlinearly the stiffness term indicated in eq 4 changes so in order to deal with nonlinear responses the proportional coefficients a 0 and a 1 are computed based on the initial stiffness and the damping matrix is updated each time the tangent stiffness changes in this case the damping matrix will be classical at each step of the analysis as the current mode shapes will diagonalize the updated stiffness matrix charney 2008 3 record selection and site specific seismic hazard curve as mentioned in the introduction baker et al 2011 selected a set of 40 unscaled three component far field records so that their horizontal response spectra match the target mean and standard deviation in logarithmic scales at the period range of 0 5s the set was predicted for a specific scenario earthquake with a magnitude m of 7 strike slip earthquake at a distance r of 10 km the target response spectrum represents the high seismicity sites that may experience strong ground motions from mid to large magnitude earthquakes at close distances the site vs30 average shear wave velocity in the top 30 m was assumed to be 750 m s representing a rock site which is intended to be used as bedrock level ground motion for site response analysis baker et al 2011 this 40 record suite is a standardized set of ground motions selected as a part of the peer transportation systems research program tsrp with the goal of studying a wide variety of structural and geotechnical systems at a wide range of locations in active seismic regions baker et al 2011 since the ground motion set is neither structure specific nor site specific the selected records have a variety of spectral shapes over a wide range of period and it has a large and approximately constant variance around the mean spectral values of different periods from another perspective when investigating the nonlinear behavior of the structure near its final capacity as the case in this study the sensitivity of the structure to the excitation at a wide range of period increases hence a record suite with efficient variance in a broad band would be beneficial for highlighting various modes of structural behavior the seismic characteristics of the 40 record suite are tabulated in table 1 in this step it is intended to select several samples of ground motions with different sample sizes ss from the target population the aforementioned 40 record suite to investigate the effect of ss the number of selected ground motions on the probabilistic seismic performance of the sample jtop to this purpose genetic algorithm ga with aggregation functions has been employed to minimize the following error function baker et al 2011 5 r m s e 1 n w μ i 1 n μ t i μ s i 2 w σ i 1 n σ t i σ s i 2 where rmse is the total root mean squared error weighted error between the target denoted by the index t and selected suite denoted by the index s in the period range of interest that starts from 0 1 to 5 by an increment of 0 1s n 5 0 1 0 1 1 50 μ t and μ s represent the logarithm mean of the spectral acceleration of the target population ss 40 and the selected record suite σ t and σ s are the logarithm standard deviation of the spectral acceleration of the target population and the selected record suite respectively since the variation range of μ and σ are not the same their influence on numerical value of rmse can be substantially different consequently w μ and w σ are defined as the constant weights of μ and σ to balance the effects of either one on rmse it should be noted that the constant values of w μ and w σ can be found and updated by try and error and their initial values equal unity in this study the considered sample sizes are ss 7 the minimum required number of records for performing dynamic earthquake analysis introduced by asce 7 05 2006 10 15 20 25 30 35 and 40 in fact it is supposed to minimize the rmse for each value of ss by ga 3 1 description of ga despite the fact that the applicable functions of ga have been provided in matlab or some other commercial software packages this subsection explains the details of sequential steps of the utilized ga developed by the authors in matlab software as it might be useful for other researches the ga flowchart is demonstrated in fig 2 it is necessary to describe each step of the ga flowchart as follows 1 in the first step the initial population generation mitchell 1996 with a specified number of chromosomes are randomly generated each chromosome contains 40 genes and the value of each gene is either 0 or 1 the i th record is selected if the value of the i th i 1 2 3 40 gene equals 1 and otherwise if the value of i th gene is 0 that record is not selected so as an essential condition for each chromosome the sum of the values of all the genes svg must be equal to ss see fig 3 otherwise the number of selected records does not equal the ss 2 the numerical values of rmse as the fitness function ff for each chromosome is calculated 3 if rmse value is small enough or any other stopping criterion is satisfied the ga can be terminated otherwise go to the following step 4 the best chromosome elitist of the generation the chromosome with the minimum ff value is sent directly to the next generation without any change mitchell 1996 5 considering a constant value for probability of crossover pc some chromosomes with smaller values of ff are selected for single point crossover using roulette wheel selection method mitchell 1996 6 after crossover new offspring are produced 7 the new produced offspring must be standard offspring st off suppose that two chromosomes illustrated in fig 4 have been selected for crossover and ss 20 as is seen the sum of the values of the genes placed in the left hand side of section a a svgl in these two chromosomes are not the same thus these two chromosomes are known as non standard offspring nst off as they definitely lead to svg values other than ss 20 after crossover in fact in this step there are three possible conditions as follows a if the new produced offspring are st off go to step 8 b if the new produced offspring are nst off go back to step 6 for a maximum of 1000 times k 1000 c if the new produced offspring are nst off and k 1000 reduce the value of pc with an increment of 0 1 and go back to step 5 8 fig 5 clarifies that even after producing st off there is still a possibility that the svg values of some chromosomes are not equal to the ss in this example it is supposed that each chromosome has 15 genes and ss 7 as observed after crossover the 9th gene of the first chromosome is selected twice and as a consequence s v g 6 which is not equal to s s 7 9 in order to solve the problem of the previous step a new type of mutation named targeted mutation technique is proposed which randomly changes the values of some zero genes of such chromosomes to unity so that their svg values become equal to ss see fig 6 in the previous example one of the zero genes 4th gene has been randomly selected and its value is changed from zero to unity and consequently its svg becomes equal to ss 6 1 7 3 2 presentation of the selected suites of records the statistical properties mean and standard deviation of the logarithmic response spectra of the selected suites are compared with the target suite ss 40 in fig 7 a as is qualitatively observed the differences between the logarithmic mean and standard deviation of the selected record suites and the target one decreases as the ss increases in order to compare the final rmse values of the selected record suites with different sss rmse has been calculated based on the assumption that w μ 1 and w σ 1 r m s e c and illustrated in fig 7 b it should be emphasized that w μ and w σ are not equal to unity in the optimization process and their values are tabulated in table 2 in other words r m s e c criterion is calculated only to compare the error of ga for each ss this figure quantitatively confirms that the r m s e c values reduce as the ss increases and it is obvious that for the ss 40 the value of r m s e c becomes zero the selected record numbers values of p c w μ w σ and the number of generated chromosomes ngc for each ss are all tabulated in table 2 3 3 site specific seismic hazard curve the site specific probabilistic seismic hazard curve corresponding to the fundamental period of the structure t1 2 15s is assessed by psha bazzurro and cornell 1999 and depicted in fig 8 furthermore the values of the mean annual frequency of exceedance mafe as well as the spectral accelerations corresponding to 400 and 2500 year return period earthquakes s a 400 and s a 2500 are all shown on the same figure api 2000 4 results and discussion as the first result presentation the ida curves for the target record suite ss 40 as well as the summarized ida curves 16 50 and 84 percentiles are all plotted in fig 9 a in these ida curves maximum interstory drift ratio midr of the jacket and the 5 damped elastic spectral acceleration at the fundamental period of the structure s a t 1 5 are the edp and im respectively in addition depicted in fig 9 b and c are the 16 84 percentiles and the 50 percentiles of the ida curves for all the sss respectively as seen the dispersion values of the ida percentile curves for different sss raise at higher im levels as the records reach their global instability gi vamvatsikos 2002 vamvatsikos and cornell 2002 limit states at these levels also at low im levels the discrepancies between the percentile curves of all the selected record suites except ss 7 and the target one are not considerable 4 1 estimation of midr cdf for the sample platform seismic fragility evaluation is the core of probabilistic safety assessment of structures which can be expressed through a fragility curve a fragility function demonstrates the conditional probability that the structural capacity fails to resist the structural demand given the seismic intensity celik and ellingwood 2010 prior to deriving the fragility curves of drift demand for all the selected record sets the lognormal hypothesis null hypothesis for the midr demand at two underlying s a levels s a 400 and s a 2500 should be checked abyani et al 2019 cornell et al 2002 jalayer 2003 shome 1999 by anderson darling ad goodness of fit test anderson and darling 1954 the ad p values of the mentioned test for all the sss are shown in fig 10 a and b in these figures the green dashed lines represent the ad p values of the target record suite ss 40 assuming the significance level α 0 05 soong 2004 walpole et al 2002 since all the computed ad p values are greater than α the lognormal hypothesis is not rejected for any of these samples generally null hypothesis significance testing nhst might be regarded as the most frequently used approach in hypothesis evaluation nickerson 2000 in this respect p value is a powerful statistical measure which has a controversial concept as the non rigorous derivation and interpretation of p value could lead to widespread misleading results goutis et al 1996 more specifically p value is a function of sample size royall 1986 and when the sample sizes are not the same it is not much reasonable to compare their p values in order to provide evidence for or against either one for instance from fig 10 a it can be seen that the ad p value of the midr demand at s a 400 for the selected record suite with ss 7 is very close to unity greater than the other ones this observation does not provide strong evidence for the mentioned record suite or against the other ones it only shows that the null hypothesis for this sample will be rejected at higher significance levels considering lognormal distribution for the midr demand at the mentioned s a levels their cdfs are plotted in fig 11 a and b it could be observed that the differences between the cdf curves and the target one become less as the sample size of the selected suites increases it is stated that such qualitative remark might be predicted without conducting this investigation but the main purpose of this study is to quantitatively investigate the effects of sample size on probabilistic seismic performance of jtops thus to quantitatively compare these cdf curves two statistical measures can be applied 1 rmse between each cdf and the target one 2 correlation coefficient cc values between each cdf and the target one these two measures have been computed for each ss at both s a levels and demonstrated in fig 12 smaller values of rmse dissimilarity index indicate that the estimated cdf curves based on their selected record set are closer to the target one on the contrary larger values of cc similarity index show that the cdf curves estimated based on the selected and the target record suites are more linearly correlated it is evident that the rmse values reduce as the ss of the selected record suites increases fig 12 a however there are some local fluctuations in rmse values which cause both curves not to be strictly descending for example for ss 10 and 30 at s a 400 and for ss 15 at s a 2500 some increments are observed in the rmse values despite the fact that in the applied ga the r m s e c is strictly descending see fig 7 b further all these cdfs are linearly correlated with the target one as their cc values are so close to unity and cc values follow an ascending order except for the aforementioned sample sizes fig 12 b thus the results of rmse and cc curves are almost consistent 4 2 estimation of collapse fragility curves for the sample platform generally for huge infrastructures such as fixed offshore platforms gi or collapse capacity is the most critical limit state that should be quantitatively investigated in the design stage in the context of performance based design pbd atc 40 1996 utilizing ida as the structural analysis methodology the im values associated with the final points where the ida curves flatten are defined as the gi limit state vamvatsikos 2002 vamvatsikos and cornell 2002 in this regard the statistical properties logarithmic mean and standard deviation of the collapse ims for all the sss are shown in fig 13 a and b as is evident by the figure the logarithmic mean and standard deviation values of the suites with different sss fluctuate randomly around the green dashed lines without any monotonic order unexpectedly the values of the log standard deviation of the suite with ss 7 is almost as same as the target one contrary to its log mean that is considerably greater than the target one the similarity between the log standard deviation values for these sss could be justified by the concept of equifinality which declares that different parametric conditions of a mathematical or conceptual model can lead to same results beven 2006 and this concept could be generalized to ga applications additionally the difference between the logarithmic mean of the set with ss 15 and the target one is greater than the set with ss 10 nevertheless its logarithmic standard deviation is slightly closer to the target one compared to the set with ss 10 similarly these two statistical estimators get closer to the target ones except for the mentioned sample sizes prior to computing the collapse gi fragility curves of all the selected record sets the lognormal hypothesis null hypothesis of the im values associated with gi limit state should be checked abyani et al 2019 cornell et al 2002 jalayer 2003 shome 1999 by ad goodness of fit test anderson and darling 1954 the ad p values of the mentioned test for all the sss are depicted in fig 14 a defining the significance level α 0 05 soong 2004 walpole et al 2002 since all the computed ad p values are greater than α the lognormal hypothesis can be accepted for all these samples thereafter the analytical collapse fragility curves with different sss are qualitatively compared with the target one in fig 14 b it seems that the collapse fragility curves get closer to the target one as the ss of the selected record suite increases also the discrepancies between the fragility curves of the selected suites with different sss could be notable see the interval 1 5 s a 3 in this step the quantile quantile q q plot wilk and gnanadesikan 1968 compares the quantiles of collapse fragility of each selected record suite represented by the horizontal axis with the target one represented by the vertical axis as demonstrated in fig 15 the figure reveals that increase in the values of ss can reduce the differences between the fragility quantiles of the selected record suites and the target one as their predicted reference lines fit their data more precisely wilk and gnanadesikan 1968 it is worthwhile to mention that the deviations of the q q plots of fig 15 a and b from the bisector are observed in both low and high fragility values nonetheless by increasing ss high values of fragility converge to the bisector more rapidly than their low values overall the q q plots present almost the same results obtained from the qualitative comparison between the analytical collapse fragilities fig 14 b in order to make a quantitative comparison rmse and cc between the analytical collapse fragility of each record suite and the target one are calculated and illustrated in fig 16 a and b from fig 16 a it is again deduced that the rmse values decrease as the ss is raised despite the fact that some increments at ss 10 and 25 are observed fig 16 b shows that collapse fragility curves of the selected record suites are highly correlated with the target suite as their cc values are very close to unity also the results of both figures are fairly consistent with similar fluctuations at almost same sample sizes it is advantageous to note that the values of these statistical measures are strictly dependent on the weights of the aggregation functions w μ and w σ in table 2 and the fitness function of the implemented ga eq 1 in other words the rmse values between the mean and standard deviation of the logarithmic response spectra of the selected suites and the target suite are supposed to be minimized however because of the random variability in frequency content of ground motions other seismic characteristics of the selected records may not be analogous to solve this problem some other statistical kernels such as mutual information mi kraskov et al 2003 can be employed as the fitness function of ga and it is mentioned that this paper does not proceed to this issue also record selection based on cms baker 2011 could be preferable to the one based on the scenario ground motion baker et al 2011 despite the fact that deriving the cms for a specific site requires an extensive database 5 summary and conclusions in this study the effects of ground motion sample size on seismic fragility curves of offshore jacket platforms have been investigated considering a set of 40 far field ground motion records as the target population 7 record suites with different sample sizes 7 10 15 20 25 30 and 35 have been selected using ga with aggregation functions the employed ga minimizes the rmse between the mean and standard deviation of the logarithmic response spectra of the selected suites and the target one in the period range of interest the justifications are drawn as follows 1 the rmse values between the logarithmic mean and standard deviation of the response spectra of the selected record suites and the target one decreases as the sample size increases as expected the rmse values for the 7 and 10 record suites are greater compared to the other ones 2 the dispersion values of the ida percentile curves for different sss increase at higher im levels on the other hand at lower im levels the percentile curves of all the selected record suites except for ss 7 and 10 are closer to the target ones 3 the lognormal hypothesis can be accepted for the midr demand at s a 400 and s a 2500 as well as the collapse ims as their ad p values for all the sample sizes are greater than the significance level since the concept of p value is highly controversial it is not reasonable to compare the p values of these samples with each other and the higher p value only shows that its corresponding ad test might be rejected at higher significance levels 4 the rmse values between the midr cdfs or the collapse fragility curves of the selected record suites and the target one decrease as the sample size increases despite the fact that there are some limited fluctuations in the rmse values moreover the cc values between the midr cdfs or collapse fragilities of the selected record sets and the target one are very close to unity which clarifies that all these fragility curves are linearly correlated with the target collapse fragility in addition to this the variation of cc and the rmse values are almost consistent with each other 5 the results of q q plots illustrate that the fragility quantiles of the record suites with the sample sizes greater than 15 are closer to the target one compared to the other samples as their predicted reference lines fit their data more precisely 6 since performing time history analyses especially ida for the jtops with a lot of nonlinear structural elements are truly time consuming selecting appropriate record suites with smaller sample sizes significantly reduce the computational expenses the results of the considered case study reveals that sample sizes equal to 20 and 25 could lead to relatively acceptable accuracy in the final results of the probabilistic seismic performance of the investigated jtop at approximately half the computational time and cost 
22496,intense seismic excitations might be considered as one of the most important loading cases imposed on offshore jacket platforms to perform seismic assessments for these structures appropriate suites of ground motions can be selected by different methodologies since time history analyses of fixed offshore platforms are truly time consuming number of selected records can considerably change the computational expenses this paper quantitatively investigates the effects of sample size of records on seismic performance of these structures thus several record suites with different sample sizes are selected from a target population with 40 records so that the differences between the logarithmic mean and standard deviation of their response spectra become minimum using genetic algorithm the results show that the fragility curves based on the suites with larger sample sizes are closer to the target fragility nevertheless according to the results of the investigated case study some suites with smaller sample sizes e g 20 or 25 could lead to relatively acceptable accuracy at almost half the computational expenses also the correlation coefficients between the collapse fragilities of the selected record sets and the target one are very close to unity indicating that these collapse fragilities are linearly correlated with the target one keywords seismic fragility offshore jacket platform genetic algorithm incremental dynamic analysis sample size 1 introduction during the last recent decades offshore structural engineering has become strictly highlighted in the field of crude oil and gas industry as it is one of the decisive components of the world s economy the financial and environmental consequences of catastrophic failures of offshore structures have made researchers improve the analytical procedures for evaluating the structural performance of such structures in this regard earthquake is one of the most destructive natural disasters which may cause severe damages to the existing structures also the very unpredictability of earthquake has made it much more difficult for the engineers to exactly estimate the seismic behavior of the complex structural systems in 2010 asgarian and ajamy 2010 performed incremental dynamic analysis ida vamvatsikos 2002 vamvatsikos and cornell 2002 to investigate the seismic performance of 3 jacket type offshore platforms jtops subjected to a suite of 20 far field ground motions this record suite belongs to a bin with relatively large magnitudes of 6 5 6 9 and moderate distances all the motions are recorded on firm soil with no mark of directivity effects vamvatsikos 2002 vamvatsikos and cornell 2002 they used the story drift as the engineering demand parameter edp and first mode spectral acceleration as the intensity measure im ajamy et al 2014 proposed a comprehensive extended ida method to incorporate different sources of uncertainty associated with seismic loading modeling parameters and soil properties in the stochastic seismic analysis of jtops they employed a combination of latin hypercube sampling lhs method mckay et al 1979 and simulated annealing sa technique vorechovsky and novak 2009 to model the epistemic uncertainties of 5 different parameters yield strength elasticity modulus shear wave velocity shear modulus reduction curve and critical damping ratio and a set of 10 far field ground motions to account for the aleatoric uncertainties the selected records belong to a set of earthquake events with relatively large magnitudes of 6 0 7 3 large source to site distances 20 km and 70 km reverse or reverse oblique faulting mechanisms and pga values between 0 15g and 0 60g further heidary torkamani et al 2014 calculated the seismic fragility curves for an idealized pile supported wharf with batter piles using three different edps as displacement ductility factor differential settlement between deck and behind land and normalized residual horizontal displacement they derived the ida curves for a suite of 8 ground motion records selected from a record set with loose sand and the lowest shear wave speed around 203 5 m s sharifian et al 2015 studied the seismic behavior and capacity of the jtops by conducting ida and using a suite of 10 near fault ground motion records these records were selected from a suite of 40 near field ground motions collected by baker et al 2011 in such a way that their statistical features mean and standard deviation in logarithmic coordinates are almost the same el din and kim 2014 investigated the sensitivity of the seismic response parameters to the uncertain modeling variables of jtops by tornado diagram and first order second moment fosm techniques considering the epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties they selected a set of 30 records from the pacific earthquake engineering research peer ground motion database to take the random nature of earthquake into consideration these 30 records with the magnitude between 7 1 and 7 6 and the closest distance to the normal fault varying from 2 2 to 293 km are selected in such a way that the geometric mean of their response spectra matches the uniform hazard spectrum uhs with 2 probability of exceedance in 50 years in another research zarrin et al 2017 evaluated the variability of seismic demand and capacity of a case study jacket platform considering different sources of uncertainty to this end the sensitivity analysis was conducted not only in the particular earthquake level but also in other ranges of intensity using ida for a suite of 20 near fault ground motion records which were selected utilizing a similar approach as described in sharifian et al 2015 abyani et al 2017 investigated the assumption of lognormal hypothesis for the drift demand of jtops at two different regions of im as 1 low intensity levels without any case of global dynamic instability 2 higher im levels with some cases of global dynamic instability employing anderson darling ad goodness of fit test anderson and darling 1954 to this purpose they implemented ida procedure for a sample jtop using a 40 far field ground motion suite suggested by baker et al 2011 elsayed et al 2014 presented an approach for the reliability assessment of a fixed offshore jacket platform against earthquake collapse with consideration of pile soil interaction effects using first and second order reliability methods to compute the safety and reliability indices they selected 10 earthquake records so that the mean squared error mse between the considered target spectrum and the mean spectrum of the selected time series become minimum moreover el din and kim 2016 developed a simple methodology for seismic life cycle cost lcc estimation of steel jacket platforms they utilized equivalent single degree of freedom system instead of the main structure and eliminated the full ida and fragility analysis instead approximate fragility curves and localized ida curves for two sets of 10 ground motions representing strength level earthquake sle and ductility level earthquake dle were derived as well as a probabilistic simple closed form solution for loss estimation more recently ajamy et al 2018 worked on an analytical approach to develop seismic fragility curves for an existing jtop located in persian gulf utilizing the same record set as described in ajamy et al 2014 the approach is based on comprehensive interaction ida method considering the effects of both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties on probabilistic seismic performance of the jtop generally several approaches for ground motion selection such as generation of simulated records spectrum matching methods spectrum simulation and scaling methods have been addressed in the literature kiani and khanmohammadi 2015 kohrangi et al 2017 naeim et al 2004 more specifically baker 2011 employed the conditional mean spectrum cms method to determine the site specific target mean acceleration and target variance to this end monte carlo simulation mcs lemaire et al 2005 was applied to generate a set of response spectra that matches the target geometric mean and variance spectrum furthermore jayaram et al 2011 presented a computationally efficient and theoretically consistent algorithm to select a set of records which match the target response spectrum mean and variance by implementing a greedy optimization technique to improve the matching process their proposed methodology was improved by the approach suggested by baker and lee 2017 moschen et al 2017 introduced a ground motion selection process in which records are selected in a way that their first and second order statistics satisfy the predefined spectrum targets over a wide range of period employing multi objective genetic algorithm moga they used rudolph s algorithm rodulph 1999 referred to as nsga ii which has been recently improved by song and chen 2018 this paper aims to study the effects of sample size of ground motions on probabilistic seismic performance and fragility curves of offshore jacket platforms regarding the 3 dimensional numerical models of jtops with a lot of nonlinear structural elements the computational expenses of time history analyses for such infrastructures are too high this is one of the main reasons why sample size of record suites is important for the time consuming seismic assessments of these complicated structures in this process ida has been conducted considering a suite of 40 far field ground motions selected as explained in abyani et al 2017 baker et al 2011 to model the aleatoric variability of the records the changes in intensity and frequency content of the earthquake motions due to propagation of seismic waves in soil layers commonly referred to as site effects have direct impacts on structural responses during an earthquake event one dimensional site response analysis methods are widely used to quantify the effects of soil deposits on propagated ground motions these effects may lead to some amplification in responses which should be accurately assessed the site response analysis includes such steps as selecting a set of ground motions which are recorded on rock sites applying the rock outcrop motions and computing soil layers deposit responses and applying the responses of various soil layers to the fixed nodes of p y near field elements buratti et al 2010 has reported that using a well chosen record set with small number of ground motions may lead to accurate structural responses therefore an important question is raised how much error will be introduced in the seismic fragility curves of jtops in case of using record suites with different number of ground motions the present paper aims at finding some scientific answers to this question hence it is required to evaluate the bias induced on the probabilistic seismic performance of the structure by comparing the results of different record sets selected from a target population so a standardized ground motion set recorded on rock site baker et al 2011 is considered as the target suite and several sample sets of records with different sample sizes are selected from this target suite using genetic algorithm ga in fact it is intended to minimize the root mean squared error between the statistical properties logarithmic mean and standard deviation of the response spectra of the target and selected record suites by ga with aggregation functions as it is much easier to be implemented to avoid selecting repetitive ground motions in each suite a new type of mutation technique named targeted mutation has been utilized in each generation in the rest of the paper a brief description of the sample platform as well as its numerical model is presented afterward the record selection process and each step of the implemented ga is described in details in addition the site specific probabilistic seismic hazard curve corresponding to the fundamental period of the structure is computed by probabilistic seismic hazard analysis psha bazzurro and cornell 1999 finally the results including the ida and the summarized ida curves drift cumulative distribution functions cdfs collapse fragility curves their ad p values for each record suite and some other statistical measures are discussed followed by the conclusions 2 description of the sample jacket platform and its numerical model the comprehensive description of the jacket platform configuration is presented in a previous work of the authors zarrin et al 2017 herein only a summarized description of the sample platform as well as its numerical modeling procedure is presented the sample platform is a four leg jacket supported by four piles and is located approximately at 100 km distance offshore in the persian gulf one of the jacket face rows is vertical with only single batter at 1 8 and the other one is double battered at 1 8 the jacket module of the platform has four braced story levels see fig 1 the soil stratigraphic conditions are firm to stiff clay in shallow depths followed by very stiff clay and hard clay in deeper layers all the structural elements and joints are checked in compliance with the technical considerations of api rp 2a wsd 2000 and aisc 2003 codes lumped mass method has been used to simulate the mass of the platform components in the dynamic analyses entrapped water of flooded members and added mass for all the members below the sea level are also assigned to the corresponding member joints in addition the masses of secondary and nonstructural items are lumped to the nearest jacket structural nodes in order to perform the ida a numerical model of the sample jtop has been created in opensees software mazzoni et al 2007 the nonlinear distributed plasticity beam column element model has been applied to model the jacket and pile elements additionally a beam on nonlinear winkler foundation bnwf numerical model is supposed to perform uncoupled seismic soil pile superstructure interaction spsi analysis memarpour et al 2012 the pysimple1 uniaxial material model class is utilized to mimic the lateral behavior of near field soil boulanger et al 1999 the t z materials were incorporated into zero length elements to model skin friction on the pile the q z element is also installed under the pile to account for end bearing reaction the following subsections are supposed to explain how to take the hydrodynamic damping into account in the numerical model of the jacket platform and it is noted again that all the details of the numerical modeling process has been comprehensively addressed in abyani et al 2017 zarrin et al 2017 2 1 the morison equation the total hydro dynamic force acting on a cylinder in the in line

structure combining eq 1 and eq 2 will result in the following equation where m is the hydrodynamic mass per unit span that equals ρ c m a 3 m m y b c y b 1 2 ρ c d d y b y b k y b m y g eq 3 could be used to estimate the damping ratio considering the following points which both increase the total damping mutlu and fredsoe 1997 1 the total mass is no longer m and hydrodynamic mass is added as well in this study the mentioned added mass has been explicitly calculated and also considered in the numerical model of the sample platform in opensees software 2 there is an additional resistance force equal to 1 2 ρ c d d y b y b as can be seen this term is related to velocity similar to the structural damping term c y b hence as an equivalent approach for considering the latter type of damping the damping ratio ζ c 2 m ω ω is the angular frequency has been increased from 2 to 5 to compensate this term api rp2a wsd charney 2008 2 2 rayleigh damping damping as presented in eq 4 is referred to rayleigh proportional damping charney 2008 which has been widely used in various studies asgarian and ajamy 2010 ajamy et al 2014 el din and kim 2014 abyani et al 2017 zarrin et al 2017 ajamy et al 2018 4 c a 0 m a 1 k the first term of the aforementioned equation is the stiffness proportional term and the second one is the mass proportional term which almost simulates the condition that the structure is submerged in a viscous fluid when the fluid imposes drag force to the structure this is the reason of employing rayleigh damping in the numerical model of offshore structures a 0 and a 1 are the proportional coefficients which are determined by specifying the damping ratio in any two vibration modes charney 2008 it is declared that when the system responds nonlinearly the stiffness term indicated in eq 4 changes so in order to deal with nonlinear responses the proportional coefficients a 0 and a 1 are computed based on the initial stiffness and the damping matrix is updated each time the tangent stiffness changes in this case the damping matrix will be classical at each step of the analysis as the current mode shapes will diagonalize the updated stiffness matrix charney 2008 3 record selection and site specific seismic hazard curve as mentioned in the introduction baker et al 2011 selected a set of 40 unscaled three component far field records so that their horizontal response spectra match the target mean and standard deviation in logarithmic scales at the period range of 0 5s the set was predicted for a specific scenario earthquake with a magnitude m of 7 strike slip earthquake at a distance r of 10 km the target response spectrum represents the high seismicity sites that may experience strong ground motions from mid to large magnitude earthquakes at close distances the site vs30 average shear wave velocity in the top 30 m was assumed to be 750 m s representing a rock site which is intended to be used as bedrock level ground motion for site response analysis baker et al 2011 this 40 record suite is a standardized set of ground motions selected as a part of the peer transportation systems research program tsrp with the goal of studying a wide variety of structural and geotechnical systems at a wide range of locations in active seismic regions baker et al 2011 since the ground motion set is neither structure specific nor site specific the selected records have a variety of spectral shapes over a wide range of period and it has a large and approximately constant variance around the mean spectral values of different periods from another perspective when investigating the nonlinear behavior of the structure near its final capacity as the case in this study the sensitivity of the structure to the excitation at a wide range of period increases hence a record suite with efficient variance in a broad band would be beneficial for highlighting various modes of structural behavior the seismic characteristics of the 40 record suite are tabulated in table 1 in this step it is intended to select several samples of ground motions with different sample sizes ss from the target population the aforementioned 40 record suite to investigate the effect of ss the number of selected ground motions on the probabilistic seismic performance of the sample jtop to this purpose genetic algorithm ga with aggregation functions has been employed to minimize the following error function baker et al 2011 5 r m s e 1 n w μ i 1 n μ t i μ s i 2 w σ i 1 n σ t i σ s i 2 where rmse is the total root mean squared error weighted error between the target denoted by the index t and selected suite denoted by the index s in the period range of interest that starts from 0 1 to 5 by an increment of 0 1s n 5 0 1 0 1 1 50 μ t and μ s represent the logarithm mean of the spectral acceleration of the target population ss 40 and the selected record suite σ t and σ s are the logarithm standard deviation of the spectral acceleration of the target population and the selected record suite respectively since the variation range of μ and σ are not the same their influence on numerical value of rmse can be substantially different consequently w μ and w σ are defined as the constant weights of μ and σ to balance the effects of either one on rmse it should be noted that the constant values of w μ and w σ can be found and updated by try and error and their initial values equal unity in this study the considered sample sizes are ss 7 the minimum required number of records for performing dynamic earthquake analysis introduced by asce 7 05 2006 10 15 20 25 30 35 and 40 in fact it is supposed to minimize the rmse for each value of ss by ga 3 1 description of ga despite the fact that the applicable functions of ga have been provided in matlab or some other commercial software packages this subsection explains the details of sequential steps of the utilized ga developed by the authors in matlab software as it might be useful for other researches the ga flowchart is demonstrated in fig 2 it is necessary to describe each step of the ga flowchart as follows 1 in the first step the initial population generation mitchell 1996 with a specified number of chromosomes are randomly generated each chromosome contains 40 genes and the value of each gene is either 0 or 1 the i th record is selected if the value of the i th i 1 2 3 40 gene equals 1 and otherwise if the value of i th gene is 0 that record is not selected so as an essential condition for each chromosome the sum of the values of all the genes svg must be equal to ss see fig 3 otherwise the number of selected records does not equal the ss 2 the numerical values of rmse as the fitness function ff for each chromosome is calculated 3 if rmse value is small enough or any other stopping criterion is satisfied the ga can be terminated otherwise go to the following step 4 the best chromosome elitist of the generation the chromosome with the minimum ff value is sent directly to the next generation without any change mitchell 1996 5 considering a constant value for probability of crossover pc some chromosomes with smaller values of ff are selected for single point crossover using roulette wheel selection method mitchell 1996 6 after crossover new offspring are produced 7 the new produced offspring must be standard offspring st off suppose that two chromosomes illustrated in fig 4 have been selected for crossover and ss 20 as is seen the sum of the values of the genes placed in the left hand side of section a a svgl in these two chromosomes are not the same thus these two chromosomes are known as non standard offspring nst off as they definitely lead to svg values other than ss 20 after crossover in fact in this step there are three possible conditions as follows a if the new produced offspring are st off go to step 8 b if the new produced offspring are nst off go back to step 6 for a maximum of 1000 times k 1000 c if the new produced offspring are nst off and k 1000 reduce the value of pc with an increment of 0 1 and go back to step 5 8 fig 5 clarifies that even after producing st off there is still a possibility that the svg values of some chromosomes are not equal to the ss in this example it is supposed that each chromosome has 15 genes and ss 7 as observed after crossover the 9th gene of the first chromosome is selected twice and as a consequence s v g 6 which is not equal to s s 7 9 in order to solve the problem of the previous step a new type of mutation named targeted mutation technique is proposed which randomly changes the values of some zero genes of such chromosomes to unity so that their svg values become equal to ss see fig 6 in the previous example one of the zero genes 4th gene has been randomly selected and its value is changed from zero to unity and consequently its svg becomes equal to ss 6 1 7 3 2 presentation of the selected suites of records the statistical properties mean and standard deviation of the logarithmic response spectra of the selected suites are compared with the target suite ss 40 in fig 7 a as is qualitatively observed the differences between the logarithmic mean and standard deviation of the selected record suites and the target one decreases as the ss increases in order to compare the final rmse values of the selected record suites with different sss rmse has been calculated based on the assumption that w μ 1 and w σ 1 r m s e c and illustrated in fig 7 b it should be emphasized that w μ and w σ are not equal to unity in the optimization process and their values are tabulated in table 2 in other words r m s e c criterion is calculated only to compare the error of ga for each ss this figure quantitatively confirms that the r m s e c values reduce as the ss increases and it is obvious that for the ss 40 the value of r m s e c becomes zero the selected record numbers values of p c w μ w σ and the number of generated chromosomes ngc for each ss are all tabulated in table 2 3 3 site specific seismic hazard curve the site specific probabilistic seismic hazard curve corresponding to the fundamental period of the structure t1 2 15s is assessed by psha bazzurro and cornell 1999 and depicted in fig 8 furthermore the values of the mean annual frequency of exceedance mafe as well as the spectral accelerations corresponding to 400 and 2500 year return period earthquakes s a 400 and s a 2500 are all shown on the same figure api 2000 4 results and discussion as the first result presentation the ida curves for the target record suite ss 40 as well as the summarized ida curves 16 50 and 84 percentiles are all plotted in fig 9 a in these ida curves maximum interstory drift ratio midr of the jacket and the 5 damped elastic spectral acceleration at the fundamental period of the structure s a t 1 5 are the edp and im respectively in addition depicted in fig 9 b and c are the 16 84 percentiles and the 50 percentiles of the ida curves for all the sss respectively as seen the dispersion values of the ida percentile curves for different sss raise at higher im levels as the records reach their global instability gi vamvatsikos 2002 vamvatsikos and cornell 2002 limit states at these levels also at low im levels the discrepancies between the percentile curves of all the selected record suites except ss 7 and the target one are not considerable 4 1 estimation of midr cdf for the sample platform seismic fragility evaluation is the core of probabilistic safety assessment of structures which can be expressed through a fragility curve a fragility function demonstrates the conditional probability that the structural capacity fails to resist the structural demand given the seismic intensity celik and ellingwood 2010 prior to deriving the fragility curves of drift demand for all the selected record sets the lognormal hypothesis null hypothesis for the midr demand at two underlying s a levels s a 400 and s a 2500 should be checked abyani et al 2019 cornell et al 2002 jalayer 2003 shome 1999 by anderson darling ad goodness of fit test anderson and darling 1954 the ad p values of the mentioned test for all the sss are shown in fig 10 a and b in these figures the green dashed lines represent the ad p values of the target record suite ss 40 assuming the significance level α 0 05 soong 2004 walpole et al 2002 since all the computed ad p values are greater than α the lognormal hypothesis is not rejected for any of these samples generally null hypothesis significance testing nhst might be regarded as the most frequently used approach in hypothesis evaluation nickerson 2000 in this respect p value is a powerful statistical measure which has a controversial concept as the non rigorous derivation and interpretation of p value could lead to widespread misleading results goutis et al 1996 more specifically p value is a function of sample size royall 1986 and when the sample sizes are not the same it is not much reasonable to compare their p values in order to provide evidence for or against either one for instance from fig 10 a it can be seen that the ad p value of the midr demand at s a 400 for the selected record suite with ss 7 is very close to unity greater than the other ones this observation does not provide strong evidence for the mentioned record suite or against the other ones it only shows that the null hypothesis for this sample will be rejected at higher significance levels considering lognormal distribution for the midr demand at the mentioned s a levels their cdfs are plotted in fig 11 a and b it could be observed that the differences between the cdf curves and the target one become less as the sample size of the selected suites increases it is stated that such qualitative remark might be predicted without conducting this investigation but the main purpose of this study is to quantitatively investigate the effects of sample size on probabilistic seismic performance of jtops thus to quantitatively compare these cdf curves two statistical measures can be applied 1 rmse between each cdf and the target one 2 correlation coefficient cc values between each cdf and the target one these two measures have been computed for each ss at both s a levels and demonstrated in fig 12 smaller values of rmse dissimilarity index indicate that the estimated cdf curves based on their selected record set are closer to the target one on the contrary larger values of cc similarity index show that the cdf curves estimated based on the selected and the target record suites are more linearly correlated it is evident that the rmse values reduce as the ss of the selected record suites increases fig 12 a however there are some local fluctuations in rmse values which cause both curves not to be strictly descending for example for ss 10 and 30 at s a 400 and for ss 15 at s a 2500 some increments are observed in the rmse values despite the fact that in the applied ga the r m s e c is strictly descending see fig 7 b further all these cdfs are linearly correlated with the target one as their cc values are so close to unity and cc values follow an ascending order except for the aforementioned sample sizes fig 12 b thus the results of rmse and cc curves are almost consistent 4 2 estimation of collapse fragility curves for the sample platform generally for huge infrastructures such as fixed offshore platforms gi or collapse capacity is the most critical limit state that should be quantitatively investigated in the design stage in the context of performance based design pbd atc 40 1996 utilizing ida as the structural analysis methodology the im values associated with the final points where the ida curves flatten are defined as the gi limit state vamvatsikos 2002 vamvatsikos and cornell 2002 in this regard the statistical properties logarithmic mean and standard deviation of the collapse ims for all the sss are shown in fig 13 a and b as is evident by the figure the logarithmic mean and standard deviation values of the suites with different sss fluctuate randomly around the green dashed lines without any monotonic order unexpectedly the values of the log standard deviation of the suite with ss 7 is almost as same as the target one contrary to its log mean that is considerably greater than the target one the similarity between the log standard deviation values for these sss could be justified by the concept of equifinality which declares that different parametric conditions of a mathematical or conceptual model can lead to same results beven 2006 and this concept could be generalized to ga applications additionally the difference between the logarithmic mean of the set with ss 15 and the target one is greater than the set with ss 10 nevertheless its logarithmic standard deviation is slightly closer to the target one compared to the set with ss 10 similarly these two statistical estimators get closer to the target ones except for the mentioned sample sizes prior to computing the collapse gi fragility curves of all the selected record sets the lognormal hypothesis null hypothesis of the im values associated with gi limit state should be checked abyani et al 2019 cornell et al 2002 jalayer 2003 shome 1999 by ad goodness of fit test anderson and darling 1954 the ad p values of the mentioned test for all the sss are depicted in fig 14 a defining the significance level α 0 05 soong 2004 walpole et al 2002 since all the computed ad p values are greater than α the lognormal hypothesis can be accepted for all these samples thereafter the analytical collapse fragility curves with different sss are qualitatively compared with the target one in fig 14 b it seems that the collapse fragility curves get closer to the target one as the ss of the selected record suite increases also the discrepancies between the fragility curves of the selected suites with different sss could be notable see the interval 1 5 s a 3 in this step the quantile quantile q q plot wilk and gnanadesikan 1968 compares the quantiles of collapse fragility of each selected record suite represented by the horizontal axis with the target one represented by the vertical axis as demonstrated in fig 15 the figure reveals that increase in the values of ss can reduce the differences between the fragility quantiles of the selected record suites and the target one as their predicted reference lines fit their data more precisely wilk and gnanadesikan 1968 it is worthwhile to mention that the deviations of the q q plots of fig 15 a and b from the bisector are observed in both low and high fragility values nonetheless by increasing ss high values of fragility converge to the bisector more rapidly than their low values overall the q q plots present almost the same results obtained from the qualitative comparison between the analytical collapse fragilities fig 14 b in order to make a quantitative comparison rmse and cc between the analytical collapse fragility of each record suite and the target one are calculated and illustrated in fig 16 a and b from fig 16 a it is again deduced that the rmse values decrease as the ss is raised despite the fact that some increments at ss 10 and 25 are observed fig 16 b shows that collapse fragility curves of the selected record suites are highly correlated with the target suite as their cc values are very close to unity also the results of both figures are fairly consistent with similar fluctuations at almost same sample sizes it is advantageous to note that the values of these statistical measures are strictly dependent on the weights of the aggregation functions w μ and w σ in table 2 and the fitness function of the implemented ga eq 1 in other words the rmse values between the mean and standard deviation of the logarithmic response spectra of the selected suites and the target suite are supposed to be minimized however because of the random variability in frequency content of ground motions other seismic characteristics of the selected records may not be analogous to solve this problem some other statistical kernels such as mutual information mi kraskov et al 2003 can be employed as the fitness function of ga and it is mentioned that this paper does not proceed to this issue also record selection based on cms baker 2011 could be preferable to the one based on the scenario ground motion baker et al 2011 despite the fact that deriving the cms for a specific site requires an extensive database 5 summary and conclusions in this study the effects of ground motion sample size on seismic fragility curves of offshore jacket platforms have been investigated considering a set of 40 far field ground motion records as the target population 7 record suites with different sample sizes 7 10 15 20 25 30 and 35 have been selected using ga with aggregation functions the employed ga minimizes the rmse between the mean and standard deviation of the logarithmic response spectra of the selected suites and the target one in the period range of interest the justifications are drawn as follows 1 the rmse values between the logarithmic mean and standard deviation of the response spectra of the selected record suites and the target one decreases as the sample size increases as expected the rmse values for the 7 and 10 record suites are greater compared to the other ones 2 the dispersion values of the ida percentile curves for different sss increase at higher im levels on the other hand at lower im levels the percentile curves of all the selected record suites except for ss 7 and 10 are closer to the target ones 3 the lognormal hypothesis can be accepted for the midr demand at s a 400 and s a 2500 as well as the collapse ims as their ad p values for all the sample sizes are greater than the significance level since the concept of p value is highly controversial it is not reasonable to compare the p values of these samples with each other and the higher p value only shows that its corresponding ad test might be rejected at higher significance levels 4 the rmse values between the midr cdfs or the collapse fragility curves of the selected record suites and the target one decrease as the sample size increases despite the fact that there are some limited fluctuations in the rmse values moreover the cc values between the midr cdfs or collapse fragilities of the selected record sets and the target one are very close to unity which clarifies that all these fragility curves are linearly correlated with the target collapse fragility in addition to this the variation of cc and the rmse values are almost consistent with each other 5 the results of q q plots illustrate that the fragility quantiles of the record suites with the sample sizes greater than 15 are closer to the target one compared to the other samples as their predicted reference lines fit their data more precisely 6 since performing time history analyses especially ida for the jtops with a lot of nonlinear structural elements are truly time consuming selecting appropriate record suites with smaller sample sizes significantly reduce the computational expenses the results of the considered case study reveals that sample sizes equal to 20 and 25 could lead to relatively acceptable accuracy in the final results of the probabilistic seismic performance of the investigated jtop at approximately half the computational time and cost 
22497,an integrated methodology for the parametric design and optimisation of high speed ro ro passenger vessels of both mono and twin hull configuration is presented the hullform and internal layout are elaborated automatically in the napa software environment enabling the multi objective optimisation of design alternatives with respect to installed propulsive power transport capacity and economic viability while considering all major design constraints including intact and damage stability typical application results from the optimisation of two high speed ro ro passenger vessels are presented and discussed keywords parametric design multicriteria optimisation high speed craft ro ro passenger ship monohull twinhull 1 introduction the present paper deals with the optimisation of high speed ro ro passenger ships of mono and twin hullform type the optimisation of high speed vessels for least powering lowest fuel consumption and environmental impact lowest toxic gas emissions minimal wave wash impact was subject of intensive research by the authors in the past years zaraphonitis et al 2003 project flowmart 1999 2003 papanikolaou 2011 and is still of interest today in relation to the development of zero emissions battery driven fast coastal pax vessels for which the battery weight and space requirements need to be minimised project tram 2018 2022 ship design is a synthetic discipline which is governed by a decision making process for many decades the design spiral evans 1959 provided a perspicuous representation of the traditional ship design process illustrating the sequential and repetitive elaboration of a series of design tasks each repetition carried out in increased detail and accuracy the outcome of such a procedure often characterised as point based design heavily depends on the starting point the initial estimates of the ship s main characteristics and the experience of the designer modern approaches to ship design which are implemented in practice by use of appropriate software platforms and tools introduce the parametric design into the ship design process enabling the exploration of the huge design space prior to a decision these approaches are often interrelated to a modular ship design in which the main parts of the ship hull machinery outfitting navigation bridge etc are being considered as modules with certain functionality connectivity and associated space and weight requirements similar approaches are frequently applied to naval and special purpose ship design see e g andrews and pawling 2002 bole and forrest 2005 they are also interrelated to the set based design introduced by parsons et al 1999 also in naval ship design independently and with a different emphasis a holistic multi objective and multi disciplinary approach to ship design for life cycle was introduced by papanikolaou 2010 typical early applications of this approach to the design of various types of ships and with emphasis on various design disciplines are zaraphonitis et al 2003 high speed pax hull form resistance and wash papanikolaou et al 2011 tanker overall design marine pollution economics zaraphonitis et al 2013 ropax cruise ships overall design damage stability safety koepke et al 2014 containerships overall design efficiency and economics a comprehensive historical review of developments in parametric ship design was recently presented by nowacki 2019 the above introduced parametric ship design procedure presumes the development and integration of parametric design software tools for the automatic elaboration of design alternatives once appropriate values have been assigned to a prescribed set of design parameters this is herein achieved by software tools developed in napa a well known ship design software package facilitating the fully automated elaboration of the hullform and the internal layout along with a detailed assessment of their main technical and economic characteristics the developed assessment tools enable the thorough evaluation of each design alternative characteristics including resistance and propulsion stability in intact and damaged condition strength transport capacity building and operational cost and finally its economic potential expressed via selected comprehensive economic kpis such as the ship s net present value npv and required freight rate rfr eventually the developed parametric design procedure is linked with suitable multi objective optimisation software tools in the example presented herein modefrontier and applied in a series of multi objective multi disciplinary optimisation studies alternatively a similar procedure has been implemented into the caeses software platform of friendship systems project holiship 2016 2020 harries et al 2017 the work presented in this paper focuses on an application of the parametric ship design optimisation procedure to the design of large high speed ropax ships in the following we outline the essential steps of the developed parametric design procedure and discuss typical results from the optimisation of two high speed ro ro passenger vessels 2 parametric modelling and assessment of high speed mono and twinhull ro ro passenger designs an integrated methodology for the parametric design of high speed ro ro passenger vessels of both monohull and twinhull type has been developed within the well known ship design software platform napa taking advantage of its programming and batch processing capabilities a detailed flowchart of the herein implemented parametric design methodology is presented in fig 1 while some initial results obtained from its application to the design of monohull and twinhull vessels are presented in skoupas and zaraphonitis 2008 2009 and skoupas et al 2009 the design procedure starts by reading the user s requirements and related technical data for the ship from an input file input 1 the next step is to clear the ship model database from any geometric objects points curves surfaces rooms etc that might already exist from previous runs then the elaboration of a new design is initiated following a series of steps depicted in fig 1 the core of the developed procedure is a 3d geometric model of the vessel consisting of the hullform and the internal arrangement generated automatically using design tools available in napa along with the programming capabilities offered by the napa basic programming language when the hullform is defined and before proceeding with the elaboration of the internal layout the ship s calm water resistance and required propulsion power are calculated and the main propulsion engines are selected this is necessary at this stage because the size of the main engines is used to define the size space of the engine room s alternatively in case the position of the engine room bulkheads is defined by the user it is checked whether there is enough space for the installation of the engines the geometric model is further extended to include the structural details of the hull and superstructure plates and stiffeners in the form of a so called napa structural arrangement to this end once the definition of the hullform and internal layout is completed a series of surface objects are created corresponding to the ship s decks and bulkheads as well as to the hullform major construction elements these surface objects are used to support the elaboration of the structural design each structural element is evaluated according to class rules this task is carried out both for monohull and twinhull vessels however the full structural arrangement in napa steel is currently elaborated only for the monohull vessels then the hull girder section modulus is evaluated and if necessary the ship s scantlings are modified in order to meet the class requirements subsequently the lightship weight is estimated and a series of loading conditions are created for which intact and damaged stability calculations are performed to investigate compliance with the relevant regulatory requirements if for some design alternative the stability requirements are not met this design is marked as unfeasible and no attempt is made to correct it it is simply excluded from the set of acceptable feasible solutions then the estimation of acquisition cost follows along with the operating cost and annual revenues based on operational and economic data specified by the user input 2 the final step of the assessment procedure is the evaluation of selected economic kpis such as the ship s net present value npv and required freight rate rfr for the specified operational scenario this design and assessment procedure ends after exporting the design characteristics to a series of ascii and dxf files 3 hullform definition two different methods have been used for the definition of the hullform of the studied vessels the first one is based on the parent hull of well known systematic series for high speed vessels while the second consists of freely developed fully parametric hull models in all cases considerable attention has been given to ensure that the resulting hullforms are of adequately high quality to serve as the basis of the subsequent tasks particularly the flow calculations the main advantage of using a systematic series for the development of the hullform is that in doing so it is possible to exploit available data and procedures for the assessment of the ship s hydrodynamic performance and in particular its calm water resistance in lieu of this possibility when freely developed parametric hull models are employed an alternative way of performing the resistance and powering estimation is exploited based on the results of suitable cfd software tools 3 1 high speed monohulls in case of monohull vessels the external surface of each design alternative can be based on either one of two specific hullforms the first one is a round bilge hull derived from the parent hull of the well known npl series the second alternative is derived from the parent hull of the ntua high speed deep v double chine systematic series in both cases the resulting hullform is derived from the corresponding prototype by a linear transformation based on the principal dimensions specified by the user or the optimisation algorithm a third option is to use a fully parametric model for the hull generation which is developed by the authors using the surface definition tools available in napa the npl high speed round bilge displacement hull series is widely used for the design of high speed monohulls this series was developed in the national physical laboratory and presented by marwood and bailey 1969 and bailey 1976 the series consists of 22 models derived from a parent hull by changing the length to beam and beam to draught ratios while keeping constant the values of the form coefficients c b 0 397 c p 0 693 and c m c b c p 0 573 and the position of the longitudinal centre of buoyancy lcb 6 4 of the ship s length aft of midship ten more models were built with lcb at 2 0 3 8 and 5 2 of the ship s length aft of midship this series is developed for the design of ships operating at froude numbers in the area of 0 3 1 2 volumetric froude number f n 0 6 3 0 with length to beam ratio l b 3 33 7 50 beam to draft ratio b t 1 72 10 2 length displacement ratio m l 1 3 4 47 8 3 the parent hull of the npl series was modelled in napa fig 2 and based on this alternative hullforms can be readily developed using linear transformation once the main particulars of the offspring are specified either by the user or by an optimisation algorithm the ntua high speed systematic series was developed in the laboratory for ship and marine hydrodynamics of the national technical university of athens and is presented in grigoropoulos and loukakis 1999 2002 it consists of five models with l b 4 00 4 75 5 50 6 25 and 7 00 their hullform is of the deep v type with two chines extending forward from the transom up to 70 of the hull length a warped planning surface and a wide transom εach model was tested at six displacements with a non dimensional volume of displacement coefficient c d l 0 1 l w l 3 1 00 1 61 2 23 3 00 3 62 and 4 23 this systematic series is suitable for the design of large ro ro passenger monohull ships and pleasure craft operating at preplanning speeds apart from the calm water resistance tests these models were model tested in waves both regular and random at froude number values equal to 0 34 and 0 68 the parent hull of the ntua high speed series fig 3 was modelled in napa and once again alternative hullforms can be developed by linear transformation the design parameters used to define each design alternative are listed in table 1 the first one defines the systematic series while the other three specify the required main characteristics length bp beam oa design draught and freeboard the third available option for the definition of the hullform of a high speed monohull is the use of a parametric model for the hull developed by the ship design laboratory of ntua ntua sdl this is again a deep v type hullform with a wide transom suitable for waterjet propulsion very slender bow and two chines lower and upper extending along the full length of the ship fig 4 this type of hullform is suitable for the design of large monohulls operating in the pre planning regime when this parametric model is applied apart from the main dimensions the user or an optimisation algorithm is able to control local hullform details such as the stem inclination the entrance angle of the chine at the ship s bow the position and shape of the maximum transverse section and the width and immersion of the transom the design parameters used to define each design alternative by this method are listed in table 2 in addition it is possible to apply available napa tools for the transformation of the hull enabling for example the definition of the required immersed volume or block coefficient c b and or the longitudinal position of the centre of immersed buoyancy lcb similar transformations may be obviously applied also in case the hullform is defined according to either one of the systematic series mentioned before however in this case it would no more be possible to use the systematic series data for the calculation of calm water resistance letting cfd calculations as the only alternative for resistance and propulsion calculations 3 2 twinhull vessels over the years various types of fully parametric models have been developed at ntua sdl for twinhull vessels of various types semi displacement planning catamarans and swaths and are available to the user for example the definition curves for the demihull of displacement type medium speed catamarans with and without a bulbous bow respectively both designed for propeller propulsion are presented in fig 5 and fig 6 respectively the definition curves for the demihull of two types of catamarans suitable for operation at higher speeds are presented in fig 7 and fig 8 respectively the first one is developed for the design of very slender medium size low wash passenger ferries operating in restricted waters the second is developed for the design of larger ro ro passenger vessels operating in coastal areas the semi swath hullform type is adopted in this case due to its well known enhanced seakeeping characteristics all these models are developed in a fully parametric way providing great flexibility to the designer their hullform is defined by a set of design variables enabling the user or an optimisation algorithm to specify their main particulars length beam of demihull design draught along with other important characteristics length beam height of bulbous bow stem inclination waterline entrance angle length of entrance and run maximum section shape and position width and immersion of transom etc the design parameters used to define semi swath hullform are listed in table 3 parameters va 1 to va11 are used to specify the overall characteristics of the demihull while vb 1 to vb 7 resp vc 1 to vc 5 are used to define the forebody resp aftbody shape 4 internal arrangement the internal layout of a vessel is defined automatically by the developed design tools this is a quite demanding task given the complexity of a vessel s arrangement particularly in the case of large passenger vessels the alternative ways of providing the required areas and volumes for the various types of spaces the rules requirements and the large number of design parameters the procedure presented in the following is developed for the parametric definition of the internal layout of medium to large size vessels designed to transport both passengers and vehicles the relatively simpler case of smaller pure passenger ferries can be treated on the same line with the corresponding simplifications as a matter of fact such a procedure is currently under development by ntua sdl in the framework of the eu funded research project tram transport advanced and modular 2018 2022 aiming to design battery driven catamaran ferries connecting the port of stavanger with nearby islands or servicing the thames clippers commuter route in the broader london area the internal arrangement considered in the developed parametric model is defined by a set of design parameters providing considerable flexibility to the designer and enabling the elaboration of various alternative layouts however all these alternatives both for monohull and twinhull vessels are sharing some common characteristics transverse bulkheads are used to subdivide the ship in watertight compartments they extend from the bottom of the ship up to the main vehicles deck so that the subdivision deck coincides with the main vehicles deck no longitudinal bulkheads are used to subdivide the vessel all decks are continuous with the exception of the private cars platform if existing all decks extend from the aft end of the ship to the collision bulkhead with the exception of the subdivision deck and the first passenger deck both extending beyond the collision bulkhead to the forward end of the ship loading and unloading of vehicles is carried out from the ship s stern passengers are entering and exiting the vessel from the stern via two staircases on either side of the ship the most important design parameters are those used to define the spacing of transverse frames along the ship different frame spacing may be defined in the aft middle and forward end of the ship the web frames spacing the number vertical position and type of vehicles decks i e intended for carriage of either private cars or trailers the number and vertical position of passenger decks the number of engine rooms the number of transverse bulkheads the longitudinal position of each transverse bulkhead the number of passengers and crew the vehicles carrying capacity number of private cars and trailers the existence of platform deck the type of double bottom the position and size of casing s the width of passenger stairways and the length and width of private cars and trailers the values of the above parameters may be defined by the user or by an optimisation algorithm for some of them however depending on the user s choice appropriate values may be calculated by the parametric design algorithm for example the required length and height of an engine room and pump room is usually calculated by the system based on the estimated installed propulsion power the calculation of resistance and propulsion power at the design draught takes place before the definition of the internal layout the user however is able to override the proposed default values another example is the transport capacity in terms of the maximum number of passengers and vehicles that may be carried on board the ship and the number of corresponding decks the user may define the required transport capacity in which case the system calculates the required number of decks alternatively the user may specify the number of decks in which case the system calculates the corresponding transport capacity the definition of the longitudinal position of the transverse bulkheads with the exception of the collision bulkhead can be carried out by one of the following three methods a their number and position are defined by the user b their number and position are defined automatically by the system and c the bulkheads of the pump room and engine room s are positioned by the system and the number and position of the remaining bulkheads are defined by the user the first method can be used at the final stage of a design study giving the user full control to define or fine tune the design according to his preferences or requirements the second method is more suitable during the initial design stage or during an optimisation study the third method is somewhere in the middle between the other two the collision bulkhead is always positioned according to the requirements of the high speed craft code hscc msc 73 21 annex 5 ch 4 the minimum length of the engine room s and of the pump room of monohull vessels with a length bp from 60 m to 130 m is calculated from the installed propulsion power according to fig 9 and fig 10 or eq 1 based on the analysis of data from existing ships it should be noted that some of the ships plotted in fig 9 are equipped only with diesel engines others are equipped by a combination of diesel engines and gas turbines if the position of a transverse bulkhead is defined by the system it is always aligned with a web frame in case of twinhull vessels the length of the engine room s pump room and auxiliary engine room if existing are specified by the user 1 l e r 3 761 l n p m e n e r 24 1 where l e r is the length of the engine room in m p m e is the total installed propulsion power in kw and n e r is the number of engine rooms it is acknowledged that in case of ships with two engine rooms quite often they are of unequal length in this respect the length proposed by fig 9 and eq 1 should be interpreted as their mean length according to the developed parametric modelling procedure a vessel s double bottom maybe horizontal throughout its entire length at a vertical distance from the baseplane defined by the user or can be partially inclined in order to effectively protect the upper compartments in case of raking damage in the latter case the double bottom is defined automatically following the definition of the hscc regarding the part of the hull which is vulnerable to raking damage in this case the double bottom is modelled horizontal within the aft half of the ship s length at a distance from the baseplane not less than 70 of the ship s draught and inclined within the forward mid length of the ship with its distance from the baseplane at the forward perpendicular not less than the ship s draught the subdivision deck is always modelled as a horizontal plane its position is determined by summing up the design draught plus the freeboard which is either specified by the user or used as a design variable subsequently based on the deck heights specified by the user for the vehicles decks either for the carriage of private cars or for trailers and for the accommodation decks the remaining decks below and above the subdivision deck are positioned once all decks and transverse bulkheads are defined the procedure continues with the definition of the corresponding compartments tanks and void spaces then the so called ship model arrangement in napa terminology is defined which is actually a table collecting all spaces composing the entire ship hull and superstructure along with its purpose a code name used in napa to describe a series of properties of the corresponding compartment including the damage permeabilities the arrangement drawing of a large monohull vessel developed by the above procedure is presented in fig 11 the vessel shown therein has two engine rooms ten watertight compartments one vehicles deck for the carriage of trailers and above it one retractable platform deck for private cars the superstructure consists of two accommodation decks on top of which the wheel house and the funnel may be observed the main particulars of this vessel are listed in table 4 the full set of design parameters used to define the arrangement and hull structure of a monohull vessel is listed in table 6 the corresponding set of design parameters used for the case of twin hull vessels is listed in table 7 respectively a typical general arrangement for a twinhull vessel is presented in fig 12 this vessel which is of semiswath type skoupas et al 2009 has one engine room per demihull seven watertight compartments one vehicles deck for the carriage of trailers and above it one retractable platform deck for private cars the superstructure consists of two accommodation decks the forward end of the upper passenger deck is occupied by the wheel house the main particulars of this vessel are listed in table 5 5 calculation of calm water resistance and propulsion power as discussed already the main advantage of using a systematic series for the development of the hullform of an alternative design is that it provides the opportunity to exploit the results of extensive tank testing for the evaluation of the vessel s hydrodynamic performance including but not necessarily limited to its calm water resistance prediction tank test results are collected analysed and usually presented in graphical form in a series of diagrams this permits the prediction of calm water resistance for a range of speeds following a well described manual procedure such a procedure might be perfectly suitable during the elaboration of one design alternative but cannot be applied as such in a parametric model aimed to be used within a formal optimisation study or for the systematic exploration of the design space in such cases programmable calculation methods are required enabling the fully automated assessment of a vessel s performance fortunately for both systematic series used herein the npl and the ntua series such procedures are available in the form of polynomial expressions derived from the experimental data applying regression methods for hullforms not based on systematic series other means of calculating calm water resistance are required in these cases both for the monohull and the twinhull configuration use is made of potential flow cfd tools linked with the parametric design software 5 1 calm water resistance prediction for the npl systematic series hullforms two different mathematical models for the prediction of calm water resistance of monohull vessels designed according to the npl high speed round bilge displacement hull series were presented in radojcic et al 1997 the speed independent model comprises twelve speed independent resistance and dynamic trim equations one for each volumetric froude number and one equation for the calculation of the wetted surface which does not depend on speed the speed dependent model the one used in the present study consists of two polynomial expressions for the calculation of resistance and dynamic trim and a linear equation for the wetted surface 2 r t δ 100000 i 0 8 α i φ n i i 0 8 α i 9 φ n i x 1 i 0 8 α i 117 φ n i x 27 3 τ 0 i 0 8 β i φ n i i 0 8 β i 9 φ n i x 2 i 0 8 β i 126 φ n i x 27 where r t is the total calm water resistance δ is the displacement α i and β i are coefficients given in radojcic et al 1997 τ o is the running trim x i i 1 2 27 is a series of coefficients depending on the ship s length beam draught and immersed volume and φ n is a function of the volumetric froude number 4 φ n f n 1 8 1 2 5 f n v g 1 3 5 2 calm water resistance prediction for the ntua systematic series hullforms a method for the calculation of the residual resistance coefficient c r and running trim of ships designed according to the ntua high speed double chine systematic series is presented in radojcic et al 2001 6 10 3 c r i 1 31 α i x i 7 τ i 1 28 b i y i where a i and b i are constant coefficients given in radojcic et al 2001 and x i and y i are variables depending on the froude number the non dimensional hull slenderness ratio m l w l 1 3 the length to beam l b and beam to draught b t ratio the frictional resistance coefficient may be expressed by the ittc formula and hence the total resistance coefficient and the ship s calm water resistance are readily calculated 5 3 calm water resistance calculation using cfd tools for hullforms that are not designed according to a systematic series an alternative way of obtaining a reliable estimation of their calm water resistance is by using appropriate cfd tools since during an optimisation study a reasonable calculation time is of paramount importance software tools based on potential flow are the obvious choice this is the procedure that has been followed for the optimisation studies of both monohull except for those designed according to the npl or ntua series and twinhull vessels twinhull vessels in particular are ideally suited for potential flow calculations due to their very slender demihulls to facilitate the integration of the cfd tools with the parametric design platform the details of the hullform geometry are exported from napa to appropriate ascii files using data formats supported by each cfd tool in most cases this requires the creation of ascii files with the details of a panel mesh extending fairly above the waterline or with the coordinates of a number of points describing a series of transverse sections along the hull other means of transferring the hullform details are also possible depending on the capabilities of the cfd tool such as for example exporting the hull in the form of an iges file instead of linking cfd tools with the parametric model a promising alternative is to use surrogate models for the calm water resistance or any other quantity which requires significant computing time for its calculation a relatively large number of cases is calculated in advance and the results are collected and used for the development of the surrogate models there are various ways for the development of these models including regression analysis or training suitable artificial neural networks if properly developed a surrogate model can depict quite accurately the predictions of the cfd tool extensive use of surrogate models is made in the framework of the ongoing eu funded research project holiship 2016 2020 for the prediction of calm water resistance and added resistance in waves of conventional ropax ships as well as for the prediction of their damaged stability performance the attained subdivision index with very encouraging results marzi et al 2018 the use of surrogate models not only speeds up dramatically the calculations during an optimisation study but also increases the robustness of the procedure eliminates the need for remote computing and or resolves any ipr issues in case some software tools are not available to the user complicated and time consuming calculations are made in advance by an expert at a remote location and the results are provided to the designer and can be used repeatedly during the optimisation studies 5 4 prediction of propulsion power the calculated calm water resistance properly corrected to account for appendage drag hull fouling and added resistance in waves is used for the calculation of the required propulsion power in case of waterjet propulsion the standard means of propulsion in case of large high speed vessels an estimation of the propulsion efficiency e t a is obtained from equation 8 knox 2004 8 e t a a v 3 b v 2 c v d in the above equation v is the vessel s speed in knots 10kn v 80kn and the values of the coefficients are a 2 963 e 19 b 0 0003 c 0 0295 d 0 0250 for ships fitted with propellers the wangeningen b series data may be used to identify the optimal propeller characteristics and to calculate the required propulsion power the resulting propulsion power is increased by a suitable power margin to derive the required propulsion engine s maximum continuous rating the user defined values for the mechanical losses and the engine s loading factor are used if specified otherwise the default values of 97 mechanical power transmission efficiency and 87 5 engine s loading factor are used 6 preliminary structural design the preliminary structural calculations are carried out based on existing classification rules dnv 2015 the entire ship structure both hull and superstructure is subdivided in a series of macro elements bottom inner bottom side shell decks and bulkheads which are subsequently decomposed in smaller panels down to structural elements then the plate thickness and the geometrical characteristics of primary supporting members girders webs floors keelsons are calculated and secondary stiffeners are selected from a database the definition of the structural members is based on a series of parameters specified either by the user or by an optimisation algorithm these parameters include but are not limited to the class of the ship depending on the selected operational conditions the construction material and material factors for the hull and superstructure either steel or aluminum or a combination of those along with the deck above which steel is replaced by aluminum type of ship passenger car ferry cargo patrol or yacht spacing of longitudinal stiffeners number of deck girders and the characteristics of vehicles carried on each vehicle s deck it is acknowledged that structural calculations performed by this procedure constitute a preliminary estimate which needs to be further elaborated tested and verified at a later stage by a manual procedure the main purpose of developing a preliminary structural analysis tool within the parametric design platform is to obtain an as accurate as possible estimation of the ship s structural weight at this early design stage an additional benefit is the availability of a good starting point for the elaboration of the detailed structural analysis once the optimum design has been identified based on the results of the structural analysis napa steel is used to create the 3d model of the ship s structure the basic structural elements including plates stiffeners brackets girders webs and pillars are automatically modelled and assembled in panels which in turn are joined together to create larger structures structure arrangements such as decks bulkheads or blocks at the end of this procedure the global structure arrangement of the entire ship is created combining together smaller structure arrangements currently only for monohull vessels as the elaboration of the detailed structure arrangement in case of twinhull vessels remains to be implemented the basic structural elements and the structure arrangement of the monohull vessel presented in table 4 are illustrated in fig 13 fig 14 and fig 15 at this stage it is possible to use available napa tools to calculate the exact structural weight of the ship and weight centre its distribution along the hull and a series of other important characteristics such as the height of the neutral axis at any cross section along with the corresponding section modulus it is also possible to create 2d structural drawings or to collect and process information related with required materials painting areas required production work hours and cost estimations 7 estimation of lightship weight an accurate estimation of the lightship weight is prerequisite in ship design optimisation variations of the ship s main characteristics have a direct impact on the various weight components and if this impact is not correctly captured then most probably the optimisation will be driven to a wrong direction as usually the procedure developed for the lightweight estimation is based on its decomposition in a series of top level weight categories by far the most important component of a ship s lightweight is the structural weight even more for high speed vessels for this reason it was decided to develop proper software tools for the preliminary structural analysis and for the automatic definition of the structure arrangement the remaining top level lightweight categories main propulsion ancillary machinery outfitting electrical outfitting piping accommodation other are further decomposed fig 16 and empirical formulae have been developed based on available data for the calculation of weight items at the bottom level the most important of these formulae are presented in the following all data diagrams and empirical formulae presented in this section are derived from skoupas 2011 where a more detailed description and validation of the weights calculation method can be found the weight of a diesel engine w m e d in t maybe estimated from eq 9 or eq 10 as a function of the engine s mcr power in kw each one of the two formulae corresponds to different engine makers the data from which eq 9 and eq 10 were derived are presented in fig 17 high speed vessels are often fitted with a combination of diesel engines and gas turbines if this solution is selected one or more gas turbines may be used by the parametric model each one of them assumed to deliver 25 000 kw with a weight of 20 t 9 w m e d 0 0718 p 1 d 0 673 10 w m e d 0 0624 p 1 d 0 7354 the weight of each shaft is approximated by eq 11 where w s h l s h and p s h are the shaft weight in t length in m and load in kw 11 w s h l s h 0 962 p s h 33 793 10 3 the dry weight of each waterjet is estimated according to the data in fig 18 the total weight of the diesel generators may be approximated from the installed electrical power p e l in kw according to eq 12 if the required electrical power is not available it may be approximated from eq 13 the weight of ancillary machinery may be approximated from eq 14 12 w e l 0 010 p e l 0 959 50 h z 0 008 p e l 1 135 60 h z 13 p e l 0 175 p m e 0 831 14 w a m 2 p m e p e l 10 3 the weight of the anchoring mooring and towing equipment maybe calculated from eq 15 where e n is the equipment number calculated according to the class rules w m t o t a l includes the weight of anchors anchor chains windlass fairleader cable stopper the mooring ropes winches bollards rollers chocks storage drums and remaining relevant equipment 15 w m t o t a l 6 549 e n 10 2 4 101 for vessels equipped with thrusters a first estimation of their weight may be obtained from eq 16 where p b t h is the thruster power in kw if the thruster power is not known an initial estimate can be obtained from eq 17 16 w b t h 2 2 p b t h 1 131 17 p b t h m a x 350 l b p 0 2 the weight of an air conditioning unit may be estimated from eq 18 where f is the air flow in m3 sec and c 1 and c 2 are appropriate coefficients depending on the type of areas serviced by the unit c 1 0 434 and c 2 0 946 in case of cabin areas c 1 0 399 and c 2 0 824 in case of public spaces and c 1 0 208 and c 2 0 507 in case of crew working areas the air flow can be calculated multiplying the required rate of air flow per person depending on the type of space and the specified accommodation standard with the number of persons in the area 18 w h v a c i c 1 f c 2 the accommodation outfitting weight is calculated based on the enclosed deck area using appropriate weight coefficients the most important of which are presented in table 8 an estimation of the weight of electric equipment and outfitting may be obtained from eq 19 based on the total area of accommodation spaces and vehicles spaces the weight of piping may be approximated from 20 a 3 margin for the various weights not included in the above analysis is accounted by default in the calculation of the lightweight of a ship unless a different percentage is specified by the user 19 w e l 0 02 a a c c 0 01 a v s 20 w p p 0 03 a a c c 0 02 a v s 8 loading conditions intact and damaged stability assessment the weight of fuel oil diesel oil and lubricant oil is calculated from the power and consumption of the installed engines and the required range of operation the weight of fresh water and provisions is calculated from the number of persons onboard unless otherwise specified by the user the weight of passengers and crew is calculated assuming 95 kg per passenger and 120 kg per crew member including weight of luggage the vehicles transport capacity is calculated considering the available deadweight at the design waterline as well as the available lanes length while the latter depends on the distribution of available vehicles space between trailers and private cars the former depends on the specific operational conditions since the weight of fuel carried onboard depends on the speed and required range or number of trips before refuelling once the ship s maximum transport capacity is calculated the parametric design procedure continues with the modelling of a series of typical loading conditions for which compliance with safety regulations the intact and damaged stability requirements is verified from the large number of possible loading cases a limited number between six and twelve has been considered sufficient to obtain a clear assessment of a ship s statutory compliance and performance during an optimisation study while during the final design stage this number may be considerably higher for the results presented in the following ten loading conditions listed in table 9 were modelled and accessed for each one of the loading conditions compliance with the intact and damaged stability requirements introduced by the imo high speed craft code imo 2000 is verified in addition the minimum metacentric height value required to ensure compliance with all relevant criteria is calculated for each loading condition both in intact g m m i n i i n t and damaged condition g m m i n i d a m where i 1 10 stands for each loading condition based on the obtained results the ship s attained stability margin in intact and damaged condition is calculated from eqs 21 and 22 respectively where g m i corresponds to the actual g m value of the ship at loading condition i 21 δ g m i n t m i n g m i g m m i n i i n t i 1 10 22 δ g m d a m m i n g m i g m m i n i d a m i 1 10 the g m margins calculated from eqs 21 and 22 may be considered as measures of the ship s safety margin against capsizing in intact and damaged condition both of them need to be positive for the ship to comply with all applicable stability requirements currently in force however the user may require that both of them are larger than a certain positive threshold or safety margin to ensure enhanced safety exceeding the current regulatory requirements or simply as a safeguard against possible inaccuracies of the employed procedure for the calculation of weights and weight centres or against potential future changes in vessel s lightship vertical centre of gravity 9 assessment of a vessel s economic performance the calculation of building and operating costs is based on their decomposition in major cost categories sub categories down to elementary costs and a suitable procedure has been developed based on the analysis of available data for their calculation skoupas 2011 as far as possible the calculation of the various cost items is based on unit construction or procurement costs for example cost of fabricated steel or aluminum per ton cost of outfitting of public spaces per square meter cost of procurement and installation of propulsion machinery per kw since these unit costs vary considerably from year to year or from one shipyard to the other it is up to the user to provide relevant values to ensure the accuracy of calculations otherwise pre defined default values are used unless otherwise specified by the user the crew synthesis and the corresponding monthly costs are determined according to the greek statutory regulations the operating cost and annual income are calculated for the particular service conditions specified by the user route length port calls per trip number of trips per week and estimated passenger and vehicles occupancies during the low medium and high season passenger s fare and vehicles freight state subsidies if applicable etc the user defines also the expected years of operation the estimated vessel s price at the end of the operation period as a percentage of the corresponding acquisition cost the percentage of the initial acquisition cost covered by a loan the loan interest and the payback period the discount rate and tax rate other important cost items such as port fees per trip annual maintenance and upkeeping cost insurance costs and overheads table 10 are also supplied by the user or estimated by the software based on these data the vessel s economic performance is assessed using appropriate economic indices such as the required freight rate rfr or the net present value npv net present value represents today s value of expected cash flows over a certain time period and in our case is defined by eq 23 23 n p v c 0 c s 1 r n i 1 n i i c i 1 r i where c 0 is the part of the acquisition cost of the ship not covered by a loan c s the value of the ship assumed in operation for n years i i and c i the total annual income and expenses including annual instalments until the final repayment of any initial loan and r the discount rate expected that it could be earned in alternative investments a positive net present value indicates that the anticipated earnings from the operation of the ship are exceeding the costs hence the investment of a potential ship owner is considered profitable another criterion frequently used is the required freight rate rfr corresponding to the freight which makes npv equal to zero when comparing a series of alternative designs for the same operational scenario the designs with increased npv or lower rfr values are those with increased economic potential these are complex criteria encompassing in a rational way the building and operating costs as well as the annual cash flows transport capacity and propulsion power are therefore accounted via the annual income the fuel costs and the acquisition cost of the propulsion plant it should be noted however that while for a ship carrying one type of cargo the evaluation of rfr based on the above definition would be straightforward a ro ro passenger ferry on the other hand carries passengers private cars and larger vehicles in addition quite often there are different types of passenger fares depending on the type of services making the definition of rfr quite obscure and hindering its calculation in the present method the user is requested to specify the ratios of the freight of a private car and a trailer to the passenger s fare the required freight rate is then calculated by proportionally increasing or decreasing the passenger s fare and the private car and trailer freight keeping their respective ratios as defined by the user until npv becomes equal to zero the required freight rate reported in the results corresponds to the resulting passenger s fare while the corresponding private car and trailer freight can be evaluated by the assumed ratios 10 demonstration studies the parametric model defined in napa has been linked with the multi criteria optimisation software modefrontier to form an integrated design and optimisation environment for the design of high speed ro ro passenger ferries and a large series of studies have been carried out to demonstrate its potential the developed procedure is quite flexible in the sense that a series of design variables objective functions constraints and optimisation algorithms are available to the user and those more significant for the problem at hand maybe freely selected depending on the number of objectives single or multi objective problems can be formulated and adequately treated the selected operational scenario is fully determined by a set of 49 parameters listed in table 10 where typical values used for the studies presented herein are also included the values used for the twin hull vessel optimisation are given in parenthesis when they are different than those used in the case of the monohull in the following the results from the optimisation of a monohull and a twinhull ferry operating between the port of lavrion located approximately 60 km south east of athens and the island mykonos in the central aegean archipelagos are presented the length of the route is 2 75 nm the ship is operating for six months every year divided in a high season during summer a medium season and a low season the values of the parameters defining the operational scenario used during these two studies are listed in table 10 for the calculation of the required freight rate of each alternative design a standard ratio of the private cars freight rate to the passenger s average fare equal to 1 5 has been assumed the ratio of the freight rate of trucks to that of the private cars was set equal to 2 5 3 75 times the passenger s fare 10 1 optimisation of the monohull vessel for the monohull vessel a service speed of 38kn is selected resulting in a sailing duration in the order of 2 h for a one way trip high tensile steel is selected for the construction of the hull along with aluminum alloy for the superstructure the ship is fitted with two passenger decks one trailers deck and one retractable platform deck intended for carriage of private cars when the platform deck is used the ship should still be able to load four trailers for this particular example the ntua high speed double chine systematic series has been selected for the modelling of the hull from the large number of design parameters used to describe the parametric model only four were varied during the optimisation study presented here the selected design variables along with their range of variation are listed in table 11 the values of the remaining design parameters defining the internal arrangement and structure of a monohull vessel table 6 that were selected for this particular study are presented in table 12 the number of decks the number and the longitudinal position of the transverse bulkheads were automatically calculated by the software the available lanes length and the number of passengers are also calculated automatically the alternative option would be to specify the number of vehicles and passengers and let the software define the required number of decks and their longitudinal extend in order to meet this requirement regarding the objective functions an obvious selection would be to search for the vessel maximizing the net present value or minimising the required freight rate the main advantage of these complex objective functions is that they are considered to be weighting in a rational way a ship s building and operational cost the most important of which is the fuel cost determined by the ship s resistance and propulsion power requirement with its annual earnings potential however aiming to shed more light on the complex interrelationships between a ship s main particulars resistance propulsion building cost and transport capacity as well as in order to demonstrate the potential of multiobjective optimisation four relatively simpler objective functions were selected for this study i e the maximisation of the ship s transport capacity in terms of passengers and number of private cars the minimization of building cost and the minimization of the required propulsion power the minimum acceptable transport capacity was set equal to 700 passengers 180 private cars and 4 trailers in order to ensure ample intact and damaged stability a stability margin of 0 30 m has been specified in both cases see eqs 21 and 22 apart from these constraints the only other constraints imposed were those related with the geometric characteristics of ships designed according to the ntua systematic series in order to ensure the validity of the numerical procedure for the calculation of calm water resistance presented in radojcic et al 2001 the multiple objectives genetic algorithm optimisation scheduler available in modefrontier has been selected for this particular optimisation study and 500 generations were derived with a population of 50 designs per generation the genetic operations of the genetic algorithm moga were executed with a 5 probability of selection 50 probability of directional crossover 10 probability of mutation 50 dna string mutation ratio and penalize objectives for the treatment of constraints an initial population of 50 designs were selected using the sobol quasi random sequence spanning the entire design space a percentage of 64 of the initial population 32 designs were feasible while the remaining 18 designs were violating at least one of the specified constraints such a high rate of unfeasible designs or even higher is quite common in an initial population as well as in the first generations of an optimisation study gradually reducing in later generations as the algorithm is finding its way in the design space at the end of the optimisation the entire population comprised 25000 designs 500 generations with 50 members in each one of them however with the optimisation algorithm gradually converging to the optimal solutions most of these designs were repeated several times as a result 3359 unique design alternatives were obtained 2842 of which 85 were feasible and 517 unfeasible scatter diagrams illustrating the relationship between the deadweight and the displacement of the ship at design waterline the required propulsion power acquisition cost and required freight rate are presented in figs 19 24 in these plots feasible designs are marked with open circles while full circles denote feasible designs on the pareto front i e non dominated designs in multi objective optimisation problems once a set of feasible solutions has been derived the user is faced with the problem of selecting the most preferable of them the first step in the selection procedure would be the identification of the feasible solutions belonging to the pareto front also known as the non dominated solutions in the study presented here 51 non dominated solutions have been identified plots of propulsion power required freight rate number of passengers and private cars vs acquisition cost for the designs on the pareto front are illustrated in fig 25 and fig 26 the selection of the most preferable design from the pareto front can be performed based on several methods a trivial way of selection would be to assign appropriate weighting factors to each objective transforming the multi objective optimisation problem to a single objective one another frequently used method is the identification of the design located nearest to the so called utopian optimum the utopian or ideal optimum is the design for which all objective functions obtain their optimum value fig 27 usually this solution is not included in the obtained set of feasible solutions otherwise the selection of the optimum would be straight forward but it can still be used as a benchmark point for the comparison of the pareto designs in this respect a reasonable compromise would be the selection of the design that is closer to the utopian solution according to this criterion the best five designs from the pareto front are listed in table 13 in this table l b p b m a x t d and fb stand for the length between perpendiculars maximum beam design draught and freeboard respectively n p a s s and n c a r s correspond to the maximum number of passengers and private cars transported by each design c a is the acquisition cost p w the propulsion power rfr the required freight rate and d x the distance from the utopian optimum another method that was applied for the selection of the optimum solution is the genetic algorithm multi criteria decision making ga mcdm yang and sen 1996 and sen and yang 1998 according to this method the designer can make a series of choices of the following types objective i is approximately k times more important than objective j solution i is preferable than solution j solution i has approximately the same preference with solution j based on the above choices a series of marginal utility functions are created one for each objective function and are subsequently combined to create a local optimal or mean utility function yang and sen 1996 the mean utility function is used by an optimisation algorithm e g simplex or moga to create a ranking of the pareto designs in the example presented herein the same preference was assigned to each one of the four objective functions and the application of the ga mcdm algorithm resulted in the ranking presented in table 14 the pareto front is shown in graphical form in fig 28 where the two most promising designs according to the above two methods are marked with solid circles using the same algorithm but with different preference values would obviously result in a different ranking if the transport capacity is considered more less important than the acquisition cost and the propulsion power the selection would be driven towards larger resp smaller designs the design with the lower required freight rate for the assumed operational scenario is presented in table 15 10 2 optimisation of a twinhull vessel the subject of this study is the optimisation of a considerably smaller semi swath type vessel for the same route as before in this case a service speed of 32kn is selected resulting in a time at sea of approximately 2 5 h for a one way trip aluminum alloy was selected as the construction material both for the hull and superstructure the design variables selected for this study along with their range of variation are listed in table 16 the values of the remaining design parameters used for this study are listed in table 17 the explanation of each one of these design parameters is given in tables 3 and 7 the minimum acceptable transport capacity was set equal to 450 passengers 80 private cars and 2 trailers a minimum metacentric height stability margin of 0 30 m above the requirements of the intact and damaged stability regulations has been specified only one objective function i e the maximisation of the vessel s net present value was used in this example the calculation of the ship s annual income was performed assuming a fare of 45 per passenger and a freight rate of 67 5 for the private cars and 168 75 for the trailers the multiple objectives genetic algorithm optimisation scheduler of modefrontier has been applied for the optimisation using the steady state ga algorithm moga 200 generations were derived with a population of 50 designs per generation the genetic operations were executed with a 5 probability of selection 50 probability of directional crossover 10 probability of mutation 10 dna string mutation ratio and penalize objectives for treating constraints excluding repetitions the optimisation resulted in 3498 feasible and 1052 infeasible designs some of the obtained results from this optimisation example are presented in the following plots of the attained npv versus the required propulsion power deadweight and acquisition cost are illustrated in fig 29 fig 30 and fig 31 respectively the main characteristics of the best five designs of the twinhull configuration ranked in in descending order according to their attained net present value are presented in table 18 in this table l h l b d h l t d and b t s p stand for the length and beam of the demihull design draught and transverse spacing between demihulls respectively 11 conclusions an integrated methodology for the parametric design evaluation and optimisation of high speed ro ro passenger vessels of mono and twinhull configuration has been presented the core of the developed procedure consists of a parametric model for the design of ro ro passenger vessels developed within the commercial ship design software napa the hull is defined automatically based on a set of design parameters providing to the user adequate flexibility and control on the more important hullform details at the same time special care was given to ensure a hull surface of adequate quality to serve as the basis of the subsequent tasks particularly the flow calculations in the case of monohull vessels an alternative option is available i e to develop the hullform based on either one of two systematic series the npl high speed round bilge displacement hull series or the ntua double chine systematic series subsequently the ship s internal layout and structural arrangement are elaborated automatically by the design platform the procedure continues with the elaboration of relevant calculations for the evaluation of each design alternative including stability assessment in intact and damaged condition powering weights and transport capacity estimation and finally the assessment of the economic potential of the vessel assuming an operational scenario specified by the user particular emphasis was given in the calculation of the lightship weight based on its decomposition in relevant weight groups and weight items and in the development of suitable empirical formulae for their calculations based on statistical analysis of data from existing ships and or from manufacturers of marine machinery and equipment the developed parametric design procedure facilitates the elaboration and assessment of a large number of design alternatives in very short time the design and evaluation of a relatively large vessel l w l 110 m takes approximately 80 s on a personal computer with an intel i7 970 processor at 3 2 ghz the most time consuming tasks are the development of the preliminary structural design and the damaged stability analysis requiring approximately 75 and 15 of the total computing time respectively to further increase its effectiveness the parametric ship design procedure has been linked with the multi objective optimisation software modefrontier forming an integrated platform for the design optimisation of high speed ro ro passenger vessels to demonstrate its potential the developed methodology has been applied in a series of multi disciplinary multi objective or single objective optimisation studies results from the optimisation of two high speed ro ro passenger vessels one monohull and one twinhull were presented for the monohull configuration a multi objective optimisation problem was formulated using the steady state ga algorithm moga 500 generations were derived with a population of 50 designs per generation at the end of the optimisation 3359 unique designs were identified 2842 of which 85 were feasible scatter diagrams illustrating the relationships between the main characteristics of the obtained designs are presented and the designs comprising the pareto front are identified two different procedures of selecting the most promising design solution have been applied assuming the same preference to each one of the four objective functions for the twinhull configuration a single objective optimisation problem was formulated aiming to identify the design maximizing npv for the given operational scenario using the steady state ga algorithm moga 200 generations were derived with a population of 50 designs per generation in total 5535 feasible and 1052 unfeasible designs were identified the design maximizing npv was found in the 69th generation the developed parametric ship design methodology may be a useful tool for the designer in the preliminary design stage facilitating the elaboration of a large number of design alternatives in limited time and effort the designer may explore this possibility to investigate the effect of crucial decisions on the vessel s operating performance before proceeding to the detailed design stage the design methodology may be also effectively used during a feasibility study for the determination on a rational basis of the most suitable vessel s size transport capacity speed and other operating characteristics for a selected service the integration of the parametric ship design methodology with a multi objective optimisation software facilitates the design space exploration in a rational and efficient way enabling the identification of favourable and unfavourable areas of the design variables and ultimately for the determination of the optimal designs belong to the pareto front in case of multi criteria optimisation furthermore once the optimum design has been selected it s detailed napa model including but not limited to the hullform and the watertight subdivision is readily available for further elaboration and detailed design work reducing considerably the related design effort the use of parametric design and optimisation techniques in the marine industry has constantly increased over the last decade with many applications being related with the performance and energy efficiency of the hullform the ship design laboratory of ntua has been actively involved in the development of software tools for the parametric design and optimisation of various types of ships such as containerships bulk carriers tankers and practically all types of passenger ships mono and twinhulls since the late 80s papanikolaou et al 2001 this is a never ending endeavour namely aiming at continuously improving the quality of the designs the accuracy of the employed assessment procedures and to extend the scope of the assessment in order to include as many aspects of the performance of a ship as possible plans of future work include the use of additional systematic series of standard hullforms or databases for the generation of the hullform which is ship type dependent development of surrogate models to replace computationally demanding procedures e g for the calculation of the calm water resistance or the added resistance in waves for the calculation of structural weight or for the damaged stability assessment introduction of advanced methods for the analysis of a ship s structure investigation of other aspects of the hydrodynamic performance of a ship seakeeping and manoeuvring characteristics

22497,an integrated methodology for the parametric design and optimisation of high speed ro ro passenger vessels of both mono and twin hull configuration is presented the hullform and internal layout are elaborated automatically in the napa software environment enabling the multi objective optimisation of design alternatives with respect to installed propulsive power transport capacity and economic viability while considering all major design constraints including intact and damage stability typical application results from the optimisation of two high speed ro ro passenger vessels are presented and discussed keywords parametric design multicriteria optimisation high speed craft ro ro passenger ship monohull twinhull 1 introduction the present paper deals with the optimisation of high speed ro ro passenger ships of mono and twin hullform type the optimisation of high speed vessels for least powering lowest fuel consumption and environmental impact lowest toxic gas emissions minimal wave wash impact was subject of intensive research by the authors in the past years zaraphonitis et al 2003 project flowmart 1999 2003 papanikolaou 2011 and is still of interest today in relation to the development of zero emissions battery driven fast coastal pax vessels for which the battery weight and space requirements need to be minimised project tram 2018 2022 ship design is a synthetic discipline which is governed by a decision making process for many decades the design spiral evans 1959 provided a perspicuous representation of the traditional ship design process illustrating the sequential and repetitive elaboration of a series of design tasks each repetition carried out in increased detail and accuracy the outcome of such a procedure often characterised as point based design heavily depends on the starting point the initial estimates of the ship s main characteristics and the experience of the designer modern approaches to ship design which are implemented in practice by use of appropriate software platforms and tools introduce the parametric design into the ship design process enabling the exploration of the huge design space prior to a decision these approaches are often interrelated to a modular ship design in which the main parts of the ship hull machinery outfitting navigation bridge etc are being considered as modules with certain functionality connectivity and associated space and weight requirements similar approaches are frequently applied to naval and special purpose ship design see e g andrews and pawling 2002 bole and forrest 2005 they are also interrelated to the set based design introduced by parsons et al 1999 also in naval ship design independently and with a different emphasis a holistic multi objective and multi disciplinary approach to ship design for life cycle was introduced by papanikolaou 2010 typical early applications of this approach to the design of various types of ships and with emphasis on various design disciplines are zaraphonitis et al 2003 high speed pax hull form resistance and wash papanikolaou et al 2011 tanker overall design marine pollution economics zaraphonitis et al 2013 ropax cruise ships overall design damage stability safety koepke et al 2014 containerships overall design efficiency and economics a comprehensive historical review of developments in parametric ship design was recently presented by nowacki 2019 the above introduced parametric ship design procedure presumes the development and integration of parametric design software tools for the automatic elaboration of design alternatives once appropriate values have been assigned to a prescribed set of design parameters this is herein achieved by software tools developed in napa a well known ship design software package facilitating the fully automated elaboration of the hullform and the internal layout along with a detailed assessment of their main technical and economic characteristics the developed assessment tools enable the thorough evaluation of each design alternative characteristics including resistance and propulsion stability in intact and damaged condition strength transport capacity building and operational cost and finally its economic potential expressed via selected comprehensive economic kpis such as the ship s net present value npv and required freight rate rfr eventually the developed parametric design procedure is linked with suitable multi objective optimisation software tools in the example presented herein modefrontier and applied in a series of multi objective multi disciplinary optimisation studies alternatively a similar procedure has been implemented into the caeses software platform of friendship systems project holiship 2016 2020 harries et al 2017 the work presented in this paper focuses on an application of the parametric ship design optimisation procedure to the design of large high speed ropax ships in the following we outline the essential steps of the developed parametric design procedure and discuss typical results from the optimisation of two high speed ro ro passenger vessels 2 parametric modelling and assessment of high speed mono and twinhull ro ro passenger designs an integrated methodology for the parametric design of high speed ro ro passenger vessels of both monohull and twinhull type has been developed within the well known ship design software platform napa taking advantage of its programming and batch processing capabilities a detailed flowchart of the herein implemented parametric design methodology is presented in fig 1 while some initial results obtained from its application to the design of monohull and twinhull vessels are presented in skoupas and zaraphonitis 2008 2009 and skoupas et al 2009 the design procedure starts by reading the user s requirements and related technical data for the ship from an input file input 1 the next step is to clear the ship model database from any geometric objects points curves surfaces rooms etc that might already exist from previous runs then the elaboration of a new design is initiated following a series of steps depicted in fig 1 the core of the developed procedure is a 3d geometric model of the vessel consisting of the hullform and the internal arrangement generated automatically using design tools available in napa along with the programming capabilities offered by the napa basic programming language when the hullform is defined and before proceeding with the elaboration of the internal layout the ship s calm water resistance and required propulsion power are calculated and the main propulsion engines are selected this is necessary at this stage because the size of the main engines is used to define the size space of the engine room s alternatively in case the position of the engine room bulkheads is defined by the user it is checked whether there is enough space for the installation of the engines the geometric model is further extended to include the structural details of the hull and superstructure plates and stiffeners in the form of a so called napa structural arrangement to this end once the definition of the hullform and internal layout is completed a series of surface objects are created corresponding to the ship s decks and bulkheads as well as to the hullform major construction elements these surface objects are used to support the elaboration of the structural design each structural element is evaluated according to class rules this task is carried out both for monohull and twinhull vessels however the full structural arrangement in napa steel is currently elaborated only for the monohull vessels then the hull girder section modulus is evaluated and if necessary the ship s scantlings are modified in order to meet the class requirements subsequently the lightship weight is estimated and a series of loading conditions are created for which intact and damaged stability calculations are performed to investigate compliance with the relevant regulatory requirements if for some design alternative the stability requirements are not met this design is marked as unfeasible and no attempt is made to correct it it is simply excluded from the set of acceptable feasible solutions then the estimation of acquisition cost follows along with the operating cost and annual revenues based on operational and economic data specified by the user input 2 the final step of the assessment procedure is the evaluation of selected economic kpis such as the ship s net present value npv and required freight rate rfr for the specified operational scenario this design and assessment procedure ends after exporting the design characteristics to a series of ascii and dxf files 3 hullform definition two different methods have been used for the definition of the hullform of the studied vessels the first one is based on the parent hull of well known systematic series for high speed vessels while the second consists of freely developed fully parametric hull models in all cases considerable attention has been given to ensure that the resulting hullforms are of adequately high quality to serve as the basis of the subsequent tasks particularly the flow calculations the main advantage of using a systematic series for the development of the hullform is that in doing so it is possible to exploit available data and procedures for the assessment of the ship s hydrodynamic performance and in particular its calm water resistance in lieu of this possibility when freely developed parametric hull models are employed an alternative way of performing the resistance and powering estimation is exploited based on the results of suitable cfd software tools 3 1 high speed monohulls in case of monohull vessels the external surface of each design alternative can be based on either one of two specific hullforms the first one is a round bilge hull derived from the parent hull of the well known npl series the second alternative is derived from the parent hull of the ntua high speed deep v double chine systematic series in both cases the resulting hullform is derived from the corresponding prototype by a linear transformation based on the principal dimensions specified by the user or the optimisation algorithm a third option is to use a fully parametric model for the hull generation which is developed by the authors using the surface definition tools available in napa the npl high speed round bilge displacement hull series is widely used for the design of high speed monohulls this series was developed in the national physical laboratory and presented by marwood and bailey 1969 and bailey 1976 the series consists of 22 models derived from a parent hull by changing the length to beam and beam to draught ratios while keeping constant the values of the form coefficients c b 0 397 c p 0 693 and c m c b c p 0 573 and the position of the longitudinal centre of buoyancy lcb 6 4 of the ship s length aft of midship ten more models were built with lcb at 2 0 3 8 and 5 2 of the ship s length aft of midship this series is developed for the design of ships operating at froude numbers in the area of 0 3 1 2 volumetric froude number f n 0 6 3 0 with length to beam ratio l b 3 33 7 50 beam to draft ratio b t 1 72 10 2 length displacement ratio m l 1 3 4 47 8 3 the parent hull of the npl series was modelled in napa fig 2 and based on this alternative hullforms can be readily developed using linear transformation once the main particulars of the offspring are specified either by the user or by an optimisation algorithm the ntua high speed systematic series was developed in the laboratory for ship and marine hydrodynamics of the national technical university of athens and is presented in grigoropoulos and loukakis 1999 2002 it consists of five models with l b 4 00 4 75 5 50 6 25 and 7 00 their hullform is of the deep v type with two chines extending forward from the transom up to 70 of the hull length a warped planning surface and a wide transom εach model was tested at six displacements with a non dimensional volume of displacement coefficient c d l 0 1 l w l 3 1 00 1 61 2 23 3 00 3 62 and 4 23 this systematic series is suitable for the design of large ro ro passenger monohull ships and pleasure craft operating at preplanning speeds apart from the calm water resistance tests these models were model tested in waves both regular and random at froude number values equal to 0 34 and 0 68 the parent hull of the ntua high speed series fig 3 was modelled in napa and once again alternative hullforms can be developed by linear transformation the design parameters used to define each design alternative are listed in table 1 the first one defines the systematic series while the other three specify the required main characteristics length bp beam oa design draught and freeboard the third available option for the definition of the hullform of a high speed monohull is the use of a parametric model for the hull developed by the ship design laboratory of ntua ntua sdl this is again a deep v type hullform with a wide transom suitable for waterjet propulsion very slender bow and two chines lower and upper extending along the full length of the ship fig 4 this type of hullform is suitable for the design of large monohulls operating in the pre planning regime when this parametric model is applied apart from the main dimensions the user or an optimisation algorithm is able to control local hullform details such as the stem inclination the entrance angle of the chine at the ship s bow the position and shape of the maximum transverse section and the width and immersion of the transom the design parameters used to define each design alternative by this method are listed in table 2 in addition it is possible to apply available napa tools for the transformation of the hull enabling for example the definition of the required immersed volume or block coefficient c b and or the longitudinal position of the centre of immersed buoyancy lcb similar transformations may be obviously applied also in case the hullform is defined according to either one of the systematic series mentioned before however in this case it would no more be possible to use the systematic series data for the calculation of calm water resistance letting cfd calculations as the only alternative for resistance and propulsion calculations 3 2 twinhull vessels over the years various types of fully parametric models have been developed at ntua sdl for twinhull vessels of various types semi displacement planning catamarans and swaths and are available to the user for example the definition curves for the demihull of displacement type medium speed catamarans with and without a bulbous bow respectively both designed for propeller propulsion are presented in fig 5 and fig 6 respectively the definition curves for the demihull of two types of catamarans suitable for operation at higher speeds are presented in fig 7 and fig 8 respectively the first one is developed for the design of very slender medium size low wash passenger ferries operating in restricted waters the second is developed for the design of larger ro ro passenger vessels operating in coastal areas the semi swath hullform type is adopted in this case due to its well known enhanced seakeeping characteristics all these models are developed in a fully parametric way providing great flexibility to the designer their hullform is defined by a set of design variables enabling the user or an optimisation algorithm to specify their main particulars length beam of demihull design draught along with other important characteristics length beam height of bulbous bow stem inclination waterline entrance angle length of entrance and run maximum section shape and position width and immersion of transom etc the design parameters used to define semi swath hullform are listed in table 3 parameters va 1 to va11 are used to specify the overall characteristics of the demihull while vb 1 to vb 7 resp vc 1 to vc 5 are used to define the forebody resp aftbody shape 4 internal arrangement the internal layout of a vessel is defined automatically by the developed design tools this is a quite demanding task given the complexity of a vessel s arrangement particularly in the case of large passenger vessels the alternative ways of providing the required areas and volumes for the various types of spaces the rules requirements and the large number of design parameters the procedure presented in the following is developed for the parametric definition of the internal layout of medium to large size vessels designed to transport both passengers and vehicles the relatively simpler case of smaller pure passenger ferries can be treated on the same line with the corresponding simplifications as a matter of fact such a procedure is currently under development by ntua sdl in the framework of the eu funded research project tram transport advanced and modular 2018 2022 aiming to design battery driven catamaran ferries connecting the port of stavanger with nearby islands or servicing the thames clippers commuter route in the broader london area the internal arrangement considered in the developed parametric model is defined by a set of design parameters providing considerable flexibility to the designer and enabling the elaboration of various alternative layouts however all these alternatives both for monohull and twinhull vessels are sharing some common characteristics transverse bulkheads are used to subdivide the ship in watertight compartments they extend from the bottom of the ship up to the main vehicles deck so that the subdivision deck coincides with the main vehicles deck no longitudinal bulkheads are used to subdivide the vessel all decks are continuous with the exception of the private cars platform if existing all decks extend from the aft end of the ship to the collision bulkhead with the exception of the subdivision deck and the first passenger deck both extending beyond the collision bulkhead to the forward end of the ship loading and unloading of vehicles is carried out from the ship s stern passengers are entering and exiting the vessel from the stern via two staircases on either side of the ship the most important design parameters are those used to define the spacing of transverse frames along the ship different frame spacing may be defined in the aft middle and forward end of the ship the web frames spacing the number vertical position and type of vehicles decks i e intended for carriage of either private cars or trailers the number and vertical position of passenger decks the number of engine rooms the number of transverse bulkheads the longitudinal position of each transverse bulkhead the number of passengers and crew the vehicles carrying capacity number of private cars and trailers the existence of platform deck the type of double bottom the position and size of casing s the width of passenger stairways and the length and width of private cars and trailers the values of the above parameters may be defined by the user or by an optimisation algorithm for some of them however depending on the user s choice appropriate values may be calculated by the parametric design algorithm for example the required length and height of an engine room and pump room is usually calculated by the system based on the estimated installed propulsion power the calculation of resistance and propulsion power at the design draught takes place before the definition of the internal layout the user however is able to override the proposed default values another example is the transport capacity in terms of the maximum number of passengers and vehicles that may be carried on board the ship and the number of corresponding decks the user may define the required transport capacity in which case the system calculates the required number of decks alternatively the user may specify the number of decks in which case the system calculates the corresponding transport capacity the definition of the longitudinal position of the transverse bulkheads with the exception of the collision bulkhead can be carried out by one of the following three methods a their number and position are defined by the user b their number and position are defined automatically by the system and c the bulkheads of the pump room and engine room s are positioned by the system and the number and position of the remaining bulkheads are defined by the user the first method can be used at the final stage of a design study giving the user full control to define or fine tune the design according to his preferences or requirements the second method is more suitable during the initial design stage or during an optimisation study the third method is somewhere in the middle between the other two the collision bulkhead is always positioned according to the requirements of the high speed craft code hscc msc 73 21 annex 5 ch 4 the minimum length of the engine room s and of the pump room of monohull vessels with a length bp from 60 m to 130 m is calculated from the installed propulsion power according to fig 9 and fig 10 or eq 1 based on the analysis of data from existing ships it should be noted that some of the ships plotted in fig 9 are equipped only with diesel engines others are equipped by a combination of diesel engines and gas turbines if the position of a transverse bulkhead is defined by the system it is always aligned with a web frame in case of twinhull vessels the length of the engine room s pump room and auxiliary engine room if existing are specified by the user 1 l e r 3 761 l n p m e n e r 24 1 where l e r is the length of the engine room in m p m e is the total installed propulsion power in kw and n e r is the number of engine rooms it is acknowledged that in case of ships with two engine rooms quite often they are of unequal length in this respect the length proposed by fig 9 and eq 1 should be interpreted as their mean length according to the developed parametric modelling procedure a vessel s double bottom maybe horizontal throughout its entire length at a vertical distance from the baseplane defined by the user or can be partially inclined in order to effectively protect the upper compartments in case of raking damage in the latter case the double bottom is defined automatically following the definition of the hscc regarding the part of the hull which is vulnerable to raking damage in this case the double bottom is modelled horizontal within the aft half of the ship s length at a distance from the baseplane not less than 70 of the ship s draught and inclined within the forward mid length of the ship with its distance from the baseplane at the forward perpendicular not less than the ship s draught the subdivision deck is always modelled as a horizontal plane its position is determined by summing up the design draught plus the freeboard which is either specified by the user or used as a design variable subsequently based on the deck heights specified by the user for the vehicles decks either for the carriage of private cars or for trailers and for the accommodation decks the remaining decks below and above the subdivision deck are positioned once all decks and transverse bulkheads are defined the procedure continues with the definition of the corresponding compartments tanks and void spaces then the so called ship model arrangement in napa terminology is defined which is actually a table collecting all spaces composing the entire ship hull and superstructure along with its purpose a code name used in napa to describe a series of properties of the corresponding compartment including the damage permeabilities the arrangement drawing of a large monohull vessel developed by the above procedure is presented in fig 11 the vessel shown therein has two engine rooms ten watertight compartments one vehicles deck for the carriage of trailers and above it one retractable platform deck for private cars the superstructure consists of two accommodation decks on top of which the wheel house and the funnel may be observed the main particulars of this vessel are listed in table 4 the full set of design parameters used to define the arrangement and hull structure of a monohull vessel is listed in table 6 the corresponding set of design parameters used for the case of twin hull vessels is listed in table 7 respectively a typical general arrangement for a twinhull vessel is presented in fig 12 this vessel which is of semiswath type skoupas et al 2009 has one engine room per demihull seven watertight compartments one vehicles deck for the carriage of trailers and above it one retractable platform deck for private cars the superstructure consists of two accommodation decks the forward end of the upper passenger deck is occupied by the wheel house the main particulars of this vessel are listed in table 5 5 calculation of calm water resistance and propulsion power as discussed already the main advantage of using a systematic series for the development of the hullform of an alternative design is that it provides the opportunity to exploit the results of extensive tank testing for the evaluation of the vessel s hydrodynamic performance including but not necessarily limited to its calm water resistance prediction tank test results are collected analysed and usually presented in graphical form in a series of diagrams this permits the prediction of calm water resistance for a range of speeds following a well described manual procedure such a procedure might be perfectly suitable during the elaboration of one design alternative but cannot be applied as such in a parametric model aimed to be used within a formal optimisation study or for the systematic exploration of the design space in such cases programmable calculation methods are required enabling the fully automated assessment of a vessel s performance fortunately for both systematic series used herein the npl and the ntua series such procedures are available in the form of polynomial expressions derived from the experimental data applying regression methods for hullforms not based on systematic series other means of calculating calm water resistance are required in these cases both for the monohull and the twinhull configuration use is made of potential flow cfd tools linked with the parametric design software 5 1 calm water resistance prediction for the npl systematic series hullforms two different mathematical models for the prediction of calm water resistance of monohull vessels designed according to the npl high speed round bilge displacement hull series were presented in radojcic et al 1997 the speed independent model comprises twelve speed independent resistance and dynamic trim equations one for each volumetric froude number and one equation for the calculation of the wetted surface which does not depend on speed the speed dependent model the one used in the present study consists of two polynomial expressions for the calculation of resistance and dynamic trim and a linear equation for the wetted surface 2 r t δ 100000 i 0 8 α i φ n i i 0 8 α i 9 φ n i x

coefficients given in radojcic et al 2001 and x i and y i are variables depending on the froude number the non dimensional hull slenderness ratio m l w l 1 3 the length to beam l b and beam to draught b t ratio the frictional resistance coefficient may be expressed by the ittc formula and hence the total resistance coefficient and the ship s calm water resistance are readily calculated 5 3 calm water resistance calculation using cfd tools for hullforms that are not designed according to a systematic series an alternative way of obtaining a reliable estimation of their calm water resistance is by using appropriate cfd tools since during an optimisation study a reasonable calculation time is of paramount importance software tools based on potential flow are the obvious choice this is the procedure that has been followed for the optimisation studies of both monohull except for those designed according to the npl or ntua series and twinhull vessels twinhull vessels in particular are ideally suited for potential flow calculations due to their very slender demihulls to facilitate the integration of the cfd tools with the parametric design platform the details of the hullform geometry are exported from napa to appropriate ascii files using data formats supported by each cfd tool in most cases this requires the creation of ascii files with the details of a panel mesh extending fairly above the waterline or with the coordinates of a number of points describing a series of transverse sections along the hull other means of transferring the hullform details are also possible depending on the capabilities of the cfd tool such as for example exporting the hull in the form of an iges file instead of linking cfd tools with the parametric model a promising alternative is to use surrogate models for the calm water resistance or any other quantity which requires significant computing time for its calculation a relatively large number of cases is calculated in advance and the results are collected and used for the development of the surrogate models there are various ways for the development of these models including regression analysis or training suitable artificial neural networks if properly developed a surrogate model can depict quite accurately the predictions of the cfd tool extensive use of surrogate models is made in the framework of the ongoing eu funded research project holiship 2016 2020 for the prediction of calm water resistance and added resistance in waves of conventional ropax ships as well as for the prediction of their damaged stability performance the attained subdivision index with very encouraging results marzi et al 2018 the use of surrogate models not only speeds up dramatically the calculations during an optimisation study but also increases the robustness of the procedure eliminates the need for remote computing and or resolves any ipr issues in case some software tools are not available to the user complicated and time consuming calculations are made in advance by an expert at a remote location and the results are provided to the designer and can be used repeatedly during the optimisation studies 5 4 prediction of propulsion power the calculated calm water resistance properly corrected to account for appendage drag hull fouling and added resistance in waves is used for the calculation of the required propulsion power in case of waterjet propulsion the standard means of propulsion in case of large high speed vessels an estimation of the propulsion efficiency e t a is obtained from equation 8 knox 2004 8 e t a a v 3 b v 2 c v d in the above equation v is the vessel s speed in knots 10kn v 80kn and the values of the coefficients are a 2 963 e 19 b 0 0003 c 0 0295 d 0 0250 for ships fitted with propellers the wangeningen b series data may be used to identify the optimal propeller characteristics and to calculate the required propulsion power the resulting propulsion power is increased by a suitable power margin to derive the required propulsion engine s maximum continuous rating the user defined values for the mechanical losses and the engine s loading factor are used if specified otherwise the default values of 97 mechanical power transmission efficiency and 87 5 engine s loading factor are used 6 preliminary structural design the preliminary structural calculations are carried out based on existing classification rules dnv 2015 the entire ship structure both hull and superstructure is subdivided in a series of macro elements bottom inner bottom side shell decks and bulkheads which are subsequently decomposed in smaller panels down to structural elements then the plate thickness and the geometrical characteristics of primary supporting members girders webs floors keelsons are calculated and secondary stiffeners are selected from a database the definition of the structural members is based on a series of parameters specified either by the user or by an optimisation algorithm these parameters include but are not limited to the class of the ship depending on the selected operational conditions the construction material and material factors for the hull and superstructure either steel or aluminum or a combination of those along with the deck above which steel is replaced by aluminum type of ship passenger car ferry cargo patrol or yacht spacing of longitudinal stiffeners number of deck girders and the characteristics of vehicles carried on each vehicle s deck it is acknowledged that structural calculations performed by this procedure constitute a preliminary estimate which needs to be further elaborated tested and verified at a later stage by a manual procedure the main purpose of developing a preliminary structural analysis tool within the parametric design platform is to obtain an as accurate as possible estimation of the ship s structural weight at this early design stage an additional benefit is the availability of a good starting point for the elaboration of the detailed structural analysis once the optimum design has been identified based on the results of the structural analysis napa steel is used to create the 3d model of the ship s structure the basic structural elements including plates stiffeners brackets girders webs and pillars are automatically modelled and assembled in panels which in turn are joined together to create larger structures structure arrangements such as decks bulkheads or blocks at the end of this procedure the global structure arrangement of the entire ship is created combining together smaller structure arrangements currently only for monohull vessels as the elaboration of the detailed structure arrangement in case of twinhull vessels remains to be implemented the basic structural elements and the structure arrangement of the monohull vessel presented in table 4 are illustrated in fig 13 fig 14 and fig 15 at this stage it is possible to use available napa tools to calculate the exact structural weight of the ship and weight centre its distribution along the hull and a series of other important characteristics such as the height of the neutral axis at any cross section along with the corresponding section modulus it is also possible to create 2d structural drawings or to collect and process information related with required materials painting areas required production work hours and cost estimations 7 estimation of lightship weight an accurate estimation of the lightship weight is prerequisite in ship design optimisation variations of the ship s main characteristics have a direct impact on the various weight components and if this impact is not correctly captured then most probably the optimisation will be driven to a wrong direction as usually the procedure developed for the lightweight estimation is based on its decomposition in a series of top level weight categories by far the most important component of a ship s lightweight is the structural weight even more for high speed vessels for this reason it was decided to develop proper software tools for the preliminary structural analysis and for the automatic definition of the structure arrangement the remaining top level lightweight categories main propulsion ancillary machinery outfitting electrical outfitting piping accommodation other are further decomposed fig 16 and empirical formulae have been developed based on available data for the calculation of weight items at the bottom level the most important of these formulae are presented in the following all data diagrams and empirical formulae presented in this section are derived from skoupas 2011 where a more detailed description and validation of the weights calculation method can be found the weight of a diesel engine w m e d in t maybe estimated from eq 9 or eq 10 as a function of the engine s mcr power in kw each one of the two formulae corresponds to different engine makers the data from which eq 9 and eq 10 were derived are presented in fig 17 high speed vessels are often fitted with a combination of diesel engines and gas turbines if this solution is selected one or more gas turbines may be used by the parametric model each one of them assumed to deliver 25 000 kw with a weight of 20 t 9 w m e d 0 0718 p 1 d 0 673 10 w m e d 0 0624 p 1 d 0 7354 the weight of each shaft is approximated by eq 11 where w s h l s h and p s h are the shaft weight in t length in m and load in kw 11 w s h l s h 0 962 p s h 33 793 10 3 the dry weight of each waterjet is estimated according to the data in fig 18 the total weight of the diesel generators may be approximated from the installed electrical power p e l in kw according to eq 12 if the required electrical power is not available it may be approximated from eq 13 the weight of ancillary machinery may be approximated from eq 14 12 w e l 0 010 p e l 0 959 50 h z 0 008 p e l 1 135 60 h z 13 p e l 0 175 p m e 0 831 14 w a m 2 p m e p e l 10

vessels equipped with thrusters a first estimation of their weight may be obtained from eq 16 where p b t h is the thruster power in kw if the thruster power is not known an initial estimate can be obtained from eq 17 16 w b t h 2 2 p b t h 1 131 17 p b t h m a x 350 l b p 0 2 the weight of an air conditioning unit may be estimated from eq 18 where f is the air flow in m3 sec and c 1 and c 2 are appropriate coefficients depending on the type of areas serviced by the unit c 1 0 434 and c 2 0 946 in case of cabin areas c 1 0 399 and c 2 0 824 in case of public spaces and c 1 0 208 and c 2 0 507 in case of crew working areas the air flow can be calculated multiplying the required rate of air flow per person depending on the type of space and the specified accommodation standard with the number of persons in the area 18 w h v a c i c 1 f c 2 the accommodation outfitting weight is calculated based on the enclosed deck area using appropriate weight coefficients the most important of which are presented in table 8 an estimation of the weight of electric equipment and outfitting may be obtained from eq 19 based on the total area of accommodation spaces and vehicles spaces the weight of piping may be approximated from 20 a 3 margin for the various weights not included in the above analysis is accounted by default in the calculation of the lightweight of a ship unless a different percentage is specified by the user 19 w e l 0 02 a a c c 0 01 a v s 20 w p p 0 03 a a c c 0 02 a v s 8 loading conditions intact and damaged stability assessment the weight of fuel oil diesel oil and lubricant oil is calculated from the power and consumption of the installed engines and the required range of operation the weight of fresh water and provisions is calculated from the number of persons onboard unless otherwise specified by the user the weight of passengers and crew is calculated assuming 95 kg per passenger and 120 kg per crew member including weight of luggage the vehicles transport capacity is calculated considering the available deadweight at the design waterline as well as the available lanes length while the latter depends on the distribution of available vehicles space between trailers and private cars the former depends on the specific operational conditions since the weight of fuel carried onboard depends on the speed and required range or number of trips before refuelling once the ship s maximum transport capacity is calculated the parametric design procedure continues with the modelling of a series of typical loading conditions for which compliance with safety regulations the intact and damaged stability requirements is verified from the large number of possible loading cases a limited number between six and twelve has been considered sufficient to obtain a clear assessment of a ship s statutory compliance and performance during an optimisation study while during the final design stage this number may be considerably higher for the results presented in the following ten loading conditions listed in table 9 were modelled and accessed for each one of the loading conditions compliance with the intact and damaged stability requirements introduced by the imo high speed craft code imo 2000 is verified in addition the minimum metacentric height value required to ensure compliance with all relevant criteria is calculated for each loading condition both in intact g m m i n i i n t and damaged condition g m m i n i d a m where i 1 10 stands for each loading condition based on the obtained results the ship s attained stability margin in intact and damaged condition is calculated from eqs 21 and 22 respectively where g m i corresponds to the actual g m value of the ship at loading condition i 21 δ g m i n t m i n g m i g m m i n i i n t i 1 10 22 δ g m d a m m i n g m i g m m i n i d a m i 1 10 the g m margins calculated from eqs 21 and 22 may be considered as measures of the ship s safety margin against capsizing in intact and damaged condition both of them need to be positive for the ship to comply with all applicable stability requirements currently in force however the user may require that both of them are larger than a certain positive threshold or safety margin to ensure enhanced safety exceeding the current regulatory requirements or simply as a safeguard against possible inaccuracies of the employed procedure for the calculation of weights and weight centres or against potential future changes in vessel s lightship vertical centre of gravity 9 assessment of a vessel s economic performance the calculation of building and operating costs is based on their decomposition in major cost categories sub categories down to elementary costs and a suitable procedure has been developed based on the analysis of available data for their calculation skoupas 2011 as far as possible the calculation of the various cost items is based on unit construction or procurement costs for example cost of fabricated steel or aluminum per ton cost of outfitting of public spaces per square meter cost of procurement and installation of propulsion machinery per kw since these unit costs vary considerably from year to year or from one shipyard to the other it is up to the user to provide relevant values to ensure the accuracy of calculations otherwise pre defined default values are used unless otherwise specified by the user the crew synthesis and the corresponding monthly costs are determined according to the greek statutory regulations the operating cost and annual income are calculated for the particular service conditions specified by the user route length port calls per trip number of trips per week and estimated passenger and vehicles occupancies during the low medium and high season passenger s fare and vehicles freight state subsidies if applicable etc the user defines also the expected years of operation the estimated vessel s price at the end of the operation period as a percentage of the corresponding acquisition cost the percentage of the initial acquisition cost covered by a loan the loan interest and the payback period the discount rate and tax rate other important cost items such as port fees per trip annual maintenance and upkeeping cost insurance costs and overheads table 10 are also supplied by the user or estimated by the software based on these data the vessel s economic performance is assessed using appropriate economic indices such as the required freight rate rfr or the net present value npv net present value represents today s value of expected cash flows over a certain time period and in our case is defined by eq 23 23 n p v c 0 c s 1 r n i 1 n i i c i 1 r i where c 0 is the part of the acquisition cost of the ship not covered by a loan c s the value of the ship assumed in operation for n years i i and c i the total annual income and expenses including annual instalments until the final repayment of any initial loan and r the discount rate expected that it could be earned in alternative investments a positive net present value indicates that the anticipated earnings from the operation of the ship are exceeding the costs hence the investment of a potential ship owner is considered profitable another criterion frequently used is the required freight rate rfr corresponding to the freight which makes npv equal to zero when comparing a series of alternative designs for the same operational scenario the designs with increased npv or lower rfr values are those with increased economic potential these are complex criteria encompassing in a rational way the building and operating costs as well as the annual cash flows transport capacity and propulsion power are therefore accounted via the annual income the fuel costs and the acquisition cost of the propulsion plant it should be noted however that while for a ship carrying one type of cargo the evaluation of rfr based on the above definition would be straightforward a ro ro passenger ferry on the other hand carries passengers private cars and larger vehicles in addition quite often there are different types of passenger fares depending on the type of services making the definition of rfr quite obscure and hindering its calculation in the present method the user is requested to specify the ratios of the freight of a private car and a trailer to the passenger s fare the required freight rate is then calculated by proportionally increasing or decreasing the passenger s fare and the private car and trailer freight keeping their respective ratios as defined by the user until npv becomes equal to zero the required freight rate reported in the results corresponds to the resulting passenger s fare while the corresponding private car and trailer freight can be evaluated by the assumed ratios 10 demonstration studies the parametric model defined in napa has been linked with the multi criteria optimisation software modefrontier to form an integrated design and optimisation environment for the design of high speed ro ro passenger ferries and a large series of studies have been carried out to demonstrate its potential the developed procedure is quite flexible in the sense that a series of design variables objective functions constraints and optimisation algorithms are available to the user and those more significant for the problem at hand maybe freely selected depending on the number of objectives single or multi objective problems can be formulated and adequately treated the selected operational scenario is fully determined by a set of 49 parameters listed in table 10 where typical values used for the studies presented herein are also included the values used for the twin hull vessel optimisation are given in parenthesis when they are different than those used in the case of the monohull in the following the results from the optimisation of a monohull and a twinhull ferry operating between the port of lavrion located approximately 60 km south east of athens and the island mykonos in the central aegean archipelagos are presented the length of the route is 2 75 nm the ship is operating for six months every year divided in a high season during summer a medium season and a low season the values of the parameters defining the operational scenario used during these two studies are listed in table 10 for the calculation of the required freight rate of each alternative design a standard ratio of the private cars freight rate to the passenger s average fare equal to 1 5 has been assumed the ratio of the freight rate of trucks to that of the private cars was set equal to 2 5 3 75 times the passenger s fare 10 1 optimisation of the monohull vessel for the monohull vessel a service speed of 38kn is selected resulting in a sailing duration in the order of 2 h for a one way trip high tensile steel is selected for the construction of the hull along with aluminum alloy for the superstructure the ship is fitted with two passenger decks one trailers deck and one retractable platform deck intended for carriage of private cars when the platform deck is used the ship should still be able to load four trailers for this particular example the ntua high speed double chine systematic series has been selected for the modelling of the hull from the large number of design parameters used to describe the parametric model only four were varied during the optimisation study presented here the selected design variables along with their range of variation are listed in table 11 the values of the remaining design parameters defining the internal arrangement and structure of a monohull vessel table 6 that were selected for this particular study are presented in table 12 the number of decks the number and the longitudinal position of the transverse bulkheads were automatically calculated by the software the available lanes length and the number of passengers are also calculated automatically the alternative option would be to specify the number of vehicles and passengers and let the software define the required number of decks and their longitudinal extend in order to meet this requirement regarding the objective functions an obvious selection would be to search for the vessel maximizing the net present value or minimising the required freight rate the main advantage of these complex objective functions is that they are considered to be weighting in a rational way a ship s building and operational cost the most important of which is the fuel cost determined by the ship s resistance and propulsion power requirement with its annual earnings potential however aiming to shed more light on the complex interrelationships between a ship s main particulars resistance propulsion building cost and transport capacity as well as in order to demonstrate the potential of multiobjective optimisation four relatively simpler objective functions were selected for this study i e the maximisation of the ship s transport capacity in terms of passengers and number of private cars the minimization of building cost and the minimization of the required propulsion power the minimum acceptable transport capacity was set equal to 700 passengers 180 private cars and 4 trailers in order to ensure ample intact and damaged stability a stability margin of 0 30 m has been specified in both cases see eqs 21 and 22 apart from these constraints the only other constraints imposed were those related with the geometric characteristics of ships designed according to the ntua systematic series in order to ensure the validity of the numerical procedure for the calculation of calm water resistance presented in radojcic et al 2001 the multiple objectives genetic algorithm optimisation scheduler available in modefrontier has been selected for this particular optimisation study and 500 generations were derived with a population of 50 designs per generation the genetic operations of the genetic algorithm moga were executed with a 5 probability of selection 50 probability of directional crossover 10 probability of mutation 50 dna string mutation ratio and penalize objectives for the treatment of constraints an initial population of 50 designs were selected using the sobol quasi random sequence spanning the entire design space a percentage of 64 of the initial population 32 designs were feasible while the remaining 18 designs were violating at least one of the specified constraints such a high rate of unfeasible designs or even higher is quite common in an initial population as well as in the first generations of an optimisation study gradually reducing in later generations as the algorithm is finding its way in the design space at the end of the optimisation the entire population comprised 25000 designs 500 generations with 50 members in each one of them however with the optimisation algorithm gradually converging to the optimal solutions most of these designs were repeated several times as a result 3359 unique design alternatives were obtained 2842 of which 85 were feasible and 517 unfeasible scatter diagrams illustrating the relationship between the deadweight and the displacement of the ship at design waterline the required propulsion power acquisition cost and required freight rate are presented in figs 19 24 in these plots feasible designs are marked with open circles while full circles denote feasible designs on the pareto front i e non dominated designs in multi objective optimisation problems once a set of feasible solutions has been derived the user is faced with the problem of selecting the most preferable of them the first step in the selection procedure would be the identification of the feasible solutions belonging to the pareto front also known as the non dominated solutions in the study presented here 51 non dominated solutions have been identified plots of propulsion power required freight rate number of passengers and private cars vs acquisition cost for the designs on the pareto front are illustrated in fig 25 and fig 26 the selection of the most preferable design from the pareto front can be performed based on several methods a trivial way of selection would be to assign appropriate weighting factors to each objective transforming the multi objective optimisation problem to a single objective one another frequently used method is the identification of the design located nearest to the so called utopian optimum the utopian or ideal optimum is the design for which all objective functions obtain their optimum value fig 27 usually this solution is not included in the obtained set of feasible solutions otherwise the selection of the optimum would be straight forward but it can still be used as a benchmark point for the comparison of the pareto designs in this respect a reasonable compromise would be the selection of the design that is closer to the utopian solution according to this criterion the best five designs from the pareto front are listed in table 13 in this table l b p b m a x t d and fb stand for the length between perpendiculars maximum beam design draught and freeboard respectively n p a s s and n c a r s correspond to the maximum number of passengers and private cars transported by each design c a is the acquisition cost p w the propulsion power rfr the required freight rate and d x the distance from the utopian optimum another method that was applied for the selection of the optimum solution is the genetic algorithm multi criteria decision making ga mcdm yang and sen 1996 and sen and yang 1998 according to this method the designer can make a series of choices of the following types objective i is approximately k times more important than objective j solution i is preferable than solution j solution i has approximately the same preference with solution j based on the above choices a series of marginal utility functions are created one for each objective function and are subsequently combined to create a local optimal or mean utility function yang and sen 1996 the mean utility function is used by an optimisation algorithm e g simplex or moga to create a ranking of the pareto designs in the example presented herein the same preference was assigned to each one of the four objective functions and the application of the ga mcdm algorithm resulted in the ranking presented in table 14 the pareto front is shown in graphical form in fig 28 where the two most promising designs according to the above two methods are marked with solid circles using the same algorithm but with different preference values would obviously result in a different ranking if the transport capacity is considered more less important than the acquisition cost and the propulsion power the selection would be driven towards larger resp smaller designs the design with the lower required freight rate for the assumed operational scenario is presented in table 15 10 2 optimisation of a twinhull vessel the subject of this study is the optimisation of a considerably smaller semi swath type vessel for the same route as before in this case a service speed of 32kn is selected resulting in a time at sea of approximately 2 5 h for a one way trip aluminum alloy was selected as the construction material both for the hull and superstructure the design variables selected for this study along with their range of variation are listed in table 16 the values of the remaining design parameters used for this study are listed in table 17 the explanation of each one of these design parameters is given in tables 3 and 7 the minimum acceptable transport capacity was set equal to 450 passengers 80 private cars and 2 trailers a minimum metacentric height stability margin of 0 30 m above the requirements of the intact and damaged stability regulations has been specified only one objective function i e the maximisation of the vessel s net present value was used in this example the calculation of the ship s annual income was performed assuming a fare of 45 per passenger and a freight rate of 67 5 for the private cars and 168 75 for the trailers the multiple objectives genetic algorithm optimisation scheduler of modefrontier has been applied for the optimisation using the steady state ga algorithm moga 200 generations were derived with a population of 50 designs per generation the genetic operations were executed with a 5 probability of selection 50 probability of directional crossover 10 probability of mutation 10 dna string mutation ratio and penalize objectives for treating constraints excluding repetitions the optimisation resulted in 3498 feasible and 1052 infeasible designs some of the obtained results from this optimisation example are presented in the following plots of the attained npv versus the required propulsion power deadweight and acquisition cost are illustrated in fig 29 fig 30 and fig 31 respectively the main characteristics of the best five designs of the twinhull configuration ranked in in descending order according to their attained net present value are presented in table 18 in this table l h l b d h l t d and b t s p stand for the length and beam of the demihull design draught and transverse spacing between demihulls respectively 11 conclusions an integrated methodology for the parametric design evaluation and optimisation of high speed ro ro passenger vessels of mono and twinhull configuration has been presented the core of the developed procedure consists of a parametric model for the design of ro ro passenger vessels developed within the commercial ship design software napa the hull is defined automatically based on a set of design parameters providing to the user adequate flexibility and control on the more important hullform details at the same time special care was given to ensure a hull surface of adequate quality to serve as the basis of the subsequent tasks particularly the flow calculations in the case of monohull vessels an alternative option is available i e to develop the hullform based on either one of two systematic series the npl high speed round bilge displacement hull series or the ntua double chine systematic series subsequently the ship s internal layout and structural arrangement are elaborated automatically by the design platform the procedure continues with the elaboration of relevant calculations for the evaluation of each design alternative including stability assessment in intact and damaged condition powering weights and transport capacity estimation and finally the assessment of the economic potential of the vessel assuming an operational scenario specified by the user particular emphasis was given in the calculation of the lightship weight based on its decomposition in relevant weight groups and weight items and in the development of suitable empirical formulae for their calculations based on statistical analysis of data from existing ships and or from manufacturers of marine machinery and equipment the developed parametric design procedure facilitates the elaboration and assessment of a large number of design alternatives in very short time the design and evaluation of a relatively large vessel l w l 110 m takes approximately 80 s on a personal computer with an intel i7 970 processor at 3 2 ghz the most time consuming tasks are the development of the preliminary structural design and the damaged stability analysis requiring approximately 75 and 15 of the total computing time respectively to further increase its effectiveness the parametric ship design procedure has been linked with the multi objective optimisation software modefrontier forming an integrated platform for the design optimisation of high speed ro ro passenger vessels to demonstrate its potential the developed methodology has been applied in a series of multi disciplinary multi objective or single objective optimisation studies results from the optimisation of two high speed ro ro passenger vessels one monohull and one twinhull were presented for the monohull configuration a multi objective optimisation problem was formulated using the steady state ga algorithm moga 500 generations were derived with a population of 50 designs per generation at the end of the optimisation 3359 unique designs were identified 2842 of which 85 were feasible scatter diagrams illustrating the relationships between the main characteristics of the obtained designs are presented and the designs comprising the pareto front are identified two different procedures of selecting the most promising design solution have been applied assuming the same preference to each one of the four objective functions for the twinhull configuration a single objective optimisation problem was formulated aiming to identify the design maximizing npv for the given operational scenario using the steady state ga algorithm moga 200 generations were derived with a population of 50 designs per generation in total 5535 feasible and 1052 unfeasible designs were identified the design maximizing npv was found in the 69th generation the developed parametric ship design methodology may be a useful tool for the designer in the preliminary design stage facilitating the elaboration of a large number of design alternatives in limited time and effort the designer may explore this possibility to investigate the effect of crucial decisions on the vessel s operating performance before proceeding to the detailed design stage the design methodology may be also effectively used during a feasibility study for the determination on a rational basis of the most suitable vessel s size transport capacity speed and other operating characteristics for a selected service the integration of the parametric ship design methodology with a multi objective optimisation software facilitates the design space exploration in a rational and efficient way enabling the identification of favourable and unfavourable areas of the design variables and ultimately for the determination of the optimal designs belong to the pareto front in case of multi criteria optimisation furthermore once the optimum design has been selected it s detailed napa model including but not limited to the hullform and the watertight subdivision is readily available for further elaboration and detailed design work reducing considerably the related design effort the use of parametric design and optimisation techniques in the marine industry has constantly increased over the last decade with many applications being related with the performance and energy efficiency of the hullform the ship design laboratory of ntua has been actively involved in the development of software tools for the parametric design and optimisation of various types of ships such as containerships bulk carriers tankers and practically all types of passenger ships mono and twinhulls since the late 80s papanikolaou et al 2001 this is a never ending endeavour namely aiming at continuously improving the quality of the designs the accuracy of the employed assessment procedures and to extend the scope of the assessment in order to include as many aspects of the performance of a ship as possible plans of future work include the use of additional systematic series of standard hullforms or databases for the generation of the hullform which is ship type dependent development of surrogate models to replace computationally demanding procedures e g for the calculation of the calm water resistance or the added resistance in waves for the calculation of structural weight or for the damaged stability assessment introduction of advanced methods for the analysis of a ship s structure investigation of other aspects of the hydrodynamic performance of a ship seakeeping and manoeuvring characteristics dynamic instabilities design optimisation and simulation of the ship s power plant optimisation of energy consumption development of tools for the improved calculation and reduction of production costs design for production and for the life cycle analysis of a design including scrapping and recycling and last but not least the development of procedures and tools taking into consideration the

the geometry no matter how coarse discretize the studied boundary which then produces no geometrical errors a zoning method is carried out to study arrangement of the multiple porous baffles in the tanks neighboring zones is joined together by the boundary conditions of the porous baffles and virtual interface which correlate the flux and velocity potential by discretizing boundaries of each zone using the isogeometric function the governing integral equation on the boundary by using bem can be formulated into the dynamic equation in frequency domain three configurations of baffles are taken into account such as the top mounted baffles bottom mounted baffles and annular baffles the results obtained by the proposed method are verified by comparing with the reported solutions and very good agreement is obtained the effects of tank s geometry liquid filling level and the baffle s parameters with various lengths submergence depths number of baffles and porosities on the natural

power plants aerospace systems road transportation system municipal facilities systems naval oil industry water conservancy and civil facilities as we all know that oscillations of liquid sloshing in partially filled container under excitations may cause undesirable hydrodynamic moments and forces with enormous magnitude which will bring out structural instability and damage in this sense many fields of liquid sloshing have been developed such as natural frequencies as well as corresponding mode shapes in a vehicle sloshing analysis under low or zero gravity linear or non linear feature of sloshing analysis of coupling liquid sloshing and structural vibration control and optimization of sloshing features ibrahim 2005 has given a comprehensive review with more than 2600 instances until its publication date since there are challenges for the analysis of liquid sloshing by using the theoretical methods with complex geometry many researchers turn to experimental works or numerical methods for example the finite volume method saripilli and sen 2018 finite difference method zhang et al 2016 boundary element method zhang et al 2016 finite element method battaglia et al 2018 meshless method violeau and rogers 2016 scaled boundary finite element method lin et al 2015 and pseudo spectral turner et al 2015 method have become wide use in this field among all boundary element method bem becomes a well popular manner since only the boundaries instead of the entire domain should be discretized so the costs of time and memory can be cut down significantly compared to other conventional method such as finite element method fem finite difference method fdm and finite volume method fvm nakayama and washizu 1981 conducted the boundary element method to analyze the two dimensional 2d nonlinear liquid sloshing problems hwang et al 1992 considered the three dimensional 3d sloshing of liquid in the spherical tank subjected to the dynamically excitation by using bem abe

the 3d tank kolaei et al 2015a b presented the coupled multimodal and bem to estimate the 3d liquid sloshing in the cylindrical container under the lateral and longitudinal acceleration excitations zhang 2016 simulated the 3d nonlinear sloshing of liquid in the wedged containers based on the bem coupling the improved semi lagrangian technique chen et al 2017 employed the new bem with adding back and subtracting manner to study the 2d and 3d nonlinear liquid sloshing problems zhao et al 2018 predicted the 3d sloshing responses considerding the viscous effects of liquid in the lng container under different excitation meanwhile the baffles installed within the tanks have been widely used and can effectively suppress the sloshing behavior many valuable researchers have been performed on the baffled effects of liquid sloshing by using bem gedikli and ergüven 1999 reported the dynamic sloshing responses in the cylindrical tank with ring baffle under the seismic excitation by using the bem gedikli and ergüven 2003 investigated the effect of baffle on the natural frequencies in the cylindrical tank by using a variational bem firouz abadi et al 2008 developed the bem along with a

kolaei et al 2015a b analyzed the liquid sloshing in the horizontal cylindrical container with different longitudinal baffles under the lateral acceleration excitation by use of the bem ebrahimian et al 2015 carried out the analysis of free liquid sloshing in the arbitrary axisymmetric tanks subject to the low gravity condition by using the bem kolaei et al 2017 proposed the efficient numerical

three degrees of freedom motion in the 2d rectangular container considerding the coupling effects of the internal liquid sloshing and tank motion by the bem in time domain behshad and shekari 2018 investigated liquid sloshing response in the rectangular container with baffles using the bem isogeometric analysis iga is a new numerical method which is originated by hughes et al 2005 and firstly proposed to concern the use of the fem and has attracted a lot of attention in the recent years compared with conventional bem the igabem for the analysis of liquid sloshing can exactly represent the geometry no matter how coarse discretize the studied boundary which then produces no geometrical errors many researchers have applied the igabem with its distinct advantages to study various problems such as potential problems gong et al 2017a b acoustic problems coox et al 2017 laplace equation analysis aimi et al 2016 helmholtz equation analysis peake et al 2013 calculation of effective thermal

shape optimization lian et al 2016 stokes flows heltai et al 2014 fast multipole igabem liu et al 2017 and adaptive mesh refinement feischl et al 2016 as the same time compared to solid baffles the porous baffles can significantly cut down the sloshing forces on the tanks however the applications for the analysis of liquid sloshing in the tanks with porous baffles have been limited to only a few jin et al 2014 conducted the experimental studies for the liquid sloshing in the tank with the horizontal perforated plate under different excitation cho et al 2016 2017 presented the analytical solutions for the liquid sloshing in the rectangular container with the horizontal or dual vertical porous baffles by using the matched eigenfunction expansion method based on the linear potential theory ye et al 2018 presented the scaled boundary finite element method sbfem to analyze the liquid sloshing in the cylindrical tanks with coaxial porous baffles review mentioned above suggests that the analysis of the liquid sloshing problems in the rectangular circular or elliptical horizontal annular tanks with multiple porous baffles does not exist to fill this gap in the present study the igabem coupling with the zoning method is applied to the simulation of liquid sloshing problems in section 2 the formulation with igabem of the liquid sloshing in the annular tanks with porous baffles is summarized section 3 gives the verification of the proposed method through the numerical example in section 4 the effects of the tank s geometry liquid filling level and the baffle length on the natural sloshing frequency in horizontal annular tanks are studied in detail meanwhile the effects of baffle parameters with various lengths submergence depths and porosities on wave surface elevation sloshing force and velocity field are also investigated in section 4 finally conclusions are obtained in section 5 2 theoretical description and the formulation with igabem for this problem the schematic diagram of the horizontal eccentric annular tanks having uniform longitudinal section z axis direction with porous baffle subject to the horizontal lateral excitation in frequency domain is shown in fig 1 where r and r 1 are the radii of the exterior and interior tank walls respectively and the profile in the two dimensional cartesian coordinates x y is circular and the section such as rectangular type will be also considered thereinafter the x axis points the plane of liquid free surface vertically pointing downwards through the midpoint of liquid surface is y axis and z axis expresses the longitudinal direction assuming the small time harmonic incompressible irrotational and inviscid liquid the governing equation for the sloshing of liquid can be obtained with respect to the flow potential φ x y t with the uniform longitudinal section nezami et al 2014a b which can be dealt with the laplace equation and the boundary conditions therefore the flow potential φ x y t can be expressed as 1 φ x y t ϕ x y e i ω t and ϕ x y meets 2 2 ϕ 2 ϕ x 2 2 ϕ y 2 0 in ω the linearized boundary condition of free surface is 3 ϕ y ω 2 g ϕ with the boundary condition at rigid wall of the tank and the matching condition on the porous baffle 4 ϕ n i ω a cos θ 5 ϕ n ϕ n i ω λ ϕ ϕ i ω a cos θ where θ is the angle between the outer normal of the boundary and the x axis ω is the external excitation frequency a is the amplitude of lateral excitation ϕ n and ϕ n are the normal velocities at each baffle sides and ϕ as well as ϕ present the fluid potentials at each baffle sides respectively n means the unit normal vector and λ is the porous effect parameter of porous baffle thus the matching condition on the porous baffle meets the darcy s law then the flow velocity between each side of the porous baffle is linearly proportional to the pressure difference and normal mass fluxes are continuous meanwhile the item i ω a cos θ in the right hand of eq 5 expresses that the porous baffle and tank move together meanwhile the dynamic pressure the elevation of liquid free surface and the velocity can be expressed as follow 6 p ρ φ t 7 η i ω g ϕ 8 v φ as to the boundary element method bem fig 2 shows the two dimensional region and the boundary p is on behalf of the source point and q expresses the field point introducing the weight function ϕ the weighted residual form of eq 1 can be described as 9 ω ϕ 2 ϕ d ω 0 integral equation can be obtained by using gauss divergence theorem and integration by parts method to eqs 3 5 10 γ ϕ ϕ n d γ γ ϕ ϕ n d γ ω ϕ 2 ϕ d ω 0 the weight function is treated as the laplace s fundamental solution which satisfies the following equation 11 2 ϕ δ 0 where δ is dirac function according to the properties of the dirac delta function the domain integral term in eq 11 can be written as 12 ω ϕ 2 ϕ d ω ϕ substituting eq 12 into eq 10 leads to 13 c p ϕ p γ ϕ q q q p d γ γ ϕ q p q q d γ in which 14 q ϕ n in eq 13 ϕ and q are the values of the potential and the flux mass ϕ presents the fundamental solution to the laplace s equation and q is the normal derivative of ϕ for the two dimensional potential problems as follow brebbia c a dominguez 1992 banerjee p k 1992 divo and kassab 2003 15 ϕ 1 2 π ln 1 r 16 q ϕ n 1 2 π r r n in which r is the distance between the points p and q c p in eq 13 can be expressed as 17 c p 1 α 2 π where α is the angle between tangent lines at the boundary point thus p is corresponding to the boundary of the domain α 2 π means that p is outside the domain and α 0 is for p inside the domain in order to numerically solve the integral equation 13 numerous small elements should be separated for the boundary and the discretization equation of the boundary element can be expressed as 18 c i ϕ i j 1 n e l n d ϕ l j γ j q q i d γ j j n e l n d q l j γ j ϕ q i d γ j where n e is the number of elements n d is number of nodes per element and ϕ l j as well as q l j are the values of the potential and flux mass of the l th node in j th element 19 ϕ ξ n φ 20 q ξ n q in which φ and q are the column vectors consisting of potentials and flux masses at all the nodes of one element n indicates a row vector called the shape function related to the element type and quadratic elements are used in this paper for the simulation for the two dimensional potential problem the boundary is the one dimensional and n for the three node quadratic element can be expressed as 21 n n 1 ξ n 2 ξ n 3 ξ where ξ is the local coordinate variable and 22 n 1 ξ 1 2 ξ ξ 1 23 n 2 ξ 1 ξ 2 24 n 3 ξ 1 2 ξ ξ 1 substituting eqs 19 20 into eq 18 the discretization of boundary integral equation can be obtained as 25 c i ϕ i j 1 n e k i j φ j j 1 n e g i j q j in which 26 k i j 1 1 q n j ξ j j ξ d ξ 27 g i j 1 1 ϕ n j ξ j j ξ d ξ where j are the jacobian matrix associated with the element and j d γ d ξ for the two dimensional potential problem j can be described as 28 j ξ d x 1 d ξ 2 d x 2 d ξ 2 it should be noted that eqs 26 and 27 can be generally evaluated with gaussian integration approach however when the source point i in eqs 26 and 27 is located at the j th element eqs 26 and 27 become strongly and weakly singular integrals due to the items of 1 r in q and ln 1 r in ϕ gao 2005 as described in eqs 16 and 15 the singularity subtraction technique guiggiani et al 1992 and telles transformation scheme telles 1987 are employed in this paper to evaluate these two kinds of integrals respectively as the same time the non uniform rational b splines nurbs shown in fig 3 is used as the basis function to formulate the general equation of the isogeometric boundary element method igabem for this problem and b spline basis function can be obtained by the recursion formula as follows when the knot vector u u 0 u 1 u n u i u i 1 is given 29 n i 0 u 1 u i u u i 1 0 o t h e r w i s e n i κ u u u i u i κ u i n i κ 1 u u i κ 1 u u i κ 1 u i n i 1 κ 1 u κ 1 where κ represents the degree of the function and u i is called knot nurbs basis function can be derived from the b spine by introduce the weight item and the one dimensional nurbs function can be described as hughes et al 2005 30 r i κ u w i n i κ u j 0 n w j n j κ u the boundary element method is used to solve the two dimensional potential problem only by discretization the boundary hence the two dimensional problem can be reduced to one dimensional problem being different from the traditional boundary element method the nodes corresponding to the control points in the igabem are not necessarily on the boundary which will cause trouble for the application of boundary conditions therefore collocation points in parameter space are introduced as 31 u ˆ i u i 1 u i 2 u i κ κ i 1 2 n 1 in which n is the number of the control points of the boundary according to the basic theory of nurbs and interpolation theory node coordinates on the boundary can be described as 32 x i u j 1 n r j κ u c j i i 1 2 where x i is the i th coordinate component of the collocation points c j i are the i th coordinate components of the j th control point on the boundary using the similar manner some physical quantities can also be achieved as follows 33 ϕ u i 1 n r i κ u ϕ i 34 q u i 1 n r i κ u q i where ϕ and q are values of the potential and flux mass associated with the control points at the boundary in order to do the boundary integral with the gaussian integral the value of u should be expressed as a local coordinate form 35 u u ξ u 2 e u 1 e 2 ξ u 2 e u 1 e 2 ξ 1 1 in which u 1 e and u 2 e represent the values of the parameter space at the both ends of the e th element meanwhile the interval u 1 e u 2 e is called a knot span and the first order derivative of u versus ξ can be written as 36 d u ξ d ξ u 2 e u 1 e 2 the basis function in the local coordinate system can be mapped by the basis function defined in the global coordinate system as 37 n l e ξ r i κ u ξ l 1 2 κ 1 in which n l e is local nurbs basis function in element e and i denotes the index of global nurbs basis functions whose values are not zero when the certain local coordinate ξ is given thinking about the properties of the local support of the nurbs basis function eqs 32 34 can be rewritten as 38 x i ξ l 1 κ 1 n l e ξ c l i e i 1 2 39 ϕ ξ l 1 κ 1 n l e ξ ϕ l e 40 q ξ l 1 κ 1 n l e ξ q l e according to eq 28 eq 35 and eq 36 one can obtain 41 j e ξ d γ d ξ d γ d u d u d ξ d x 1 d u 2 d x 2 d u 2 u 2 e u 1 e 2 discretization form of the igabem equation is given by the following term 42 c i l 1 κ 1 n l e ˆ ξ ˆ ϕ l e ˆ j 1 n e l 1 κ 1 1 1 q q ξ i n l j ξ j j ξ d ξ ϕ l j j n e l 1 κ 1 1 1 ϕ q ξ i n l j ξ j j ξ d ξ q l j in which e ˆ is denoted as the number of element containing the collocation point p and ξ ˆ presents the local coordinate of point p eq 42 can be further expressed in the matrix equation 43 k φ g q in which k and g are the coefficient matrices which can be assembled by the row vectors of k i j and g i j with respect to the element as follow 44 k i j 1 1 q q ξ i n j ξ j j ξ d ξ e ˆ j c i n e ˆ ξ 1 1 q q ξ i n j ξ j j ξ d ξ e ˆ j 45 g i j 1 1 ϕ q ξ i n j ξ j j ξ d ξ where n j ξ n 1 j ξ n 2 j ξ n κ 1 j ξ sub domains should be divided for the fluid domain when the porous baffles are equipped within the tank as shown in fig 4 in order to solve the problem of discontinuity of the physical quantities and easily assemble matrices k and g common corner nodes in the different domains and the junction between the virtual interface and the porous baffle are divided into three or two nodes for a typical element shown in fig 4 it is assumed that the ratio of the collocation nodes a and c for convenience collocation point is abbreviated as node hereinafter inwards a distance by using the shape function ζ of the parameter space and the knot values of the nodes a and c can be calculated as follows 46 u a 1 2 ζ ζ 1 u 1 1 ζ 2 u 2 1 2 ζ ζ 1 u 3 47 u c 1 2 ζ ζ 1 u 1 ζ 2 ζ u 2 1 2 1 ζ 2 ζ u 3 meanwhile u b is corresponding to the u 2 of the parameter space because b is inside the element as shown in fig 4 in igabem the nodes collocation points are not necessarily coincide with the control points but the values of φ and q in eq 43 are the physical quantities of the control points therefore the given boundary conditions cannot be directly added to the solving formula one technique to solve this problem is that the physical quantities of the control points should be inversely calculated from the given values of the boundary condition which means that the degree of freedom of calculation is determined by the control point and then eq 43 can be solved as the conventional bem 48 φ γ ϕ r γ ϕ u γ ϕ φ γ ϕ where γ ϕ presents the boundary in which the values of φ are given φ γ ϕ indicate the known potential values of nodes collocation points on γ ϕ r γ ϕ are the global nurbs basis function matrices according to γ ϕ φ γ ϕ present the potential values to be evaluated at the control points associated with γ ϕ and u γ ϕ are the knot values of the nodes on boundary γ ϕ in the parametric space which can be obtained by eq 31 49 φ γ ϕ r γ ϕ 1 u γ ϕ φ γ ϕ similar derivation can also be achieved as eq 50 50 q γ q r γ q 1 u γ q q γ q where γ q expresses the boundary in which the values of q are given q γ q point the known the flux mass values of the nodes on γ q r γ q are the global nurbs basis function matrices responding to γ q q γ q present the flux mass values of the control points with respect to γ q u γ q are the values of the collocation points on γ q in parameter space in eq 31 as shown in fig 4 the solved field taken as example can be divided into two sub domains by the virtual interface and the porous baffle assuming that the subscripts of f r v p indicate the liquid free surface the rigid boundary virtual interface and porous baffle respectively eq 43 can be written as 51 k f k r k v k p φ f φ r φ v φ p g f g r g v g p q f q r q v q p the global equation for the two sub domains can be assembled as follow 52 k f 1 k r 1 k v 1 k p 1 k f 2 k r 2 k v 2 k p 2 φ f 1 φ r 1 φ v 1 φ p 1 φ f 2 φ r 2 φ v 2 φ p 2 g f 1 g r 1 g v 1 g p 1 g f 2 g r 2 g v 2 g p 2 q f 1 q r 1 q v 1 q p 1 q f 2 q r 2 q v 2 q p 2 where superscripts 1 and 2 represent the two sub domains considering the matching condition at the porous baffle corresponding to eq 5 and the normal velocity and pressure to be continuous on the virtual boundary between the two sub domains one can achieve 53 q p 1 q p 2 i ω λ ϕ p 1 ϕ p 2 i ω a cos θ 54 q v 1 q v 2 55 ϕ v 1 ϕ v 2 substitute eq 1 and eqs 53 55 into eq 51 and arrangementing yield k f 1 ω 2 g g f 1 k r 1 k v 1 k p 1 i ω λ g p 1 i ω λ g p 1 g v 1 k v 2 i ω λ g p 2 k f 2 ω 2 g g f 2 k r 2 k p 2 i ω λ g p 2 g v 2 φ f 1 φ r 1 φ v 1 φ p 1 φ f 2 φ r 2 φ p 2 q v 2 56 g r 1 g p 1 g p 2 g r 2 q r 1 i ω a cos θ q r 2 the derivation process is similar to that of the above mentioned two sub domains when there are more sub domains the dynamic pressure the elevation of liquid free surface and the velocity in eqs 6 8 can be obtained after the vectors φ and q being solved by eq 56 and then the horizontal sloshing force acting on the whole system can be addressed as 57 f x h 0 p r p p d y with p r and p p denoting the dynamic sloshing pressures on the rigid boundary as well as the porous baffles of the liquid tank for simplicity the non dimensional slosh force f x ρ a ω 2 s is applied to investigate the sloshing response in two dimensional tanks where s indicates the area of the flow domain finally fig 5 shows the flowchart of iga bem for liquid sloshing problem in tanks with multiple sub domains in which the zoning method is involved and it should be noted that the shaded blocks are notably different from those of the standard bem as described above 3 verification of igabem model in order to demonstrate the correctness efficiency and convergence of the proposed manner three examples of verification are proposed in this section firstly the horizontal eccentric circular annular tank with half full liquid is illustrated in fig 6 in which the exterior and interior circular radii of the present tank are r 1 and r 2 in order to compare with the limiting case the radio r 2 r 1 0 01 is set to match the results solved by faltinsen and timokha 2010 with the analytical method for the first ten sloshing frequencies ω 2 r 1 g in a partially filled circular tank the results were also calculated by the appropriate conformal mapping transformation nezami et al 2014a b and the boundary element method bem with the authors own program figs 7 and 8 depict the discretized schematic diagrams of igabem and bem in the horizontal eccentric annular tank with half full liquid respectively in igabem for this example the numbers of the control points and nodes are identical in fact the values of the nodes are involved in computing instead of that of the control points mentioned above thus the degrees of freedom can be calculated by using the nodes when compared to the other numerical method which is also applies to the latter part of this paper the comparing calculation results list in table 1 show that good agreement with the analytical method with few nodes and the proposed method has higher convergence and accurate than the conventional bem especially for the higher frequencies secondly a half filled horizontal eccentric circular annular tank with top mounted baffle is considered to verify the correctness of the present igabem model in calculating the sloshing force fig 9 shows the geometries of the mentioned tank as well as the top mounted baffle as can be seen in this figure the top mounted baffle is fixed vertically at the middle of the tank and l means the length of the baffle the exterior and interior circular radii of the tank are fixed at r 1 2 and r 2 1 the igabem solutions are compared with the fem ones solved by commercial ansys software figs 10 and 11 schematically describe the discretized diagrams of fem and igabem respectively and fem with 960 two dimension 8 nodes elements together with igabem with 70 quadratic elements are used to simulate this example the validation of the non dimensional sloshing force with the factor ρ a ω 2 π r 1 2 r 2 2 2 to the nondimensional excitation frequency ω g r 1 r 2 1 2 1 2 is illustrated in fig 12 at the fixed baffle length l r 1 r 2 0 5 meanwhile the porous effect parameter is set as λ 0 solid baffle in order to facilitate the simulation by using ansys good agreement between the igabem and fem solutions can be observed from fig 12 which also verifies the igabem model well finally on the basis of figs 9 and 11 the variation of the first three non dimensional natural frequencies ω 2 r 1 g within a horizontal eccentric circular annular tank with top mounted baffle versus the baffle length ratio l r 1 is projected in fig 13 and the present results are compared with those in the existing reference hasheminejad and aghabeigi 2012 which were solved by the successive conformal transformation technique in order to match the results of hasheminejad and aghabeigi 2012 the radius ratio is assumed as r 2 r 1 0 001 and the porous effect parameter is set to λ 0 which implies that the porous baffle is almost a solid baffle the comparison yields complete agreement as shown in fig 13 and fig 13 further indicates that with increasing the ratio l r 1 the first natural frequency decreases gradually while the second and third frequencies firstly decrease rapidly and then become almost irrespective of the ratio l r 1 4 numerical results and discussion in this section a study is provided to estimate the effects of the tank s geometry liquid filling level and the key baffle parameters with various lengths number of baffles and porosities on the natural frequency wave surface elevation sloshing force and velocity field 4 1 effects of liquid filling level and the tank s geometric parameters on natural frequency it is of significant practical value for ocean engineering to study the influence factors of natural sloshing frequency in liquid storage tanks due to which a horizontal elliptical annular tank is chosen as an example in this section to investigate the effects of the liquid filling level and the tank s geometric parameters on the natural frequency figs 14 and 15 describe the geometry of the tank and the discretized schematic diagram of the flow domain respectively as shown in fig 14 a 1 and a 2 denote the major semi axes of the outer and inner tank wall b 1 and b 2 are the minor semi axes accordingly meanwhile h indicates the depth of the liquid for simplicity the major semi axes of the outer tank wall is fixed at a 1 2 in this section in addition it should be noted that 161 control points nodes are utilized in this example the variation curves of the first five antisymmetric non dimensional natural frequencies ω 2 a 1 b 1 g against the ratio of minor to major semi axes b 1 a 1 are shown in fig 16 with the geometric parameters and liquid filling level satisfy a 2 a 1 b 2 b 1 0 001 and h b 1 1 it can be seen that all the five natural frequencies increase from zero as the ratio b 1 a 1 increases meanwhile the increase rate of natural frequency increases with the increase in mode number fig 17 depicts the variation of the first five antisymmetric non dimensional natural frequencies ω 2 b 1 g against the radius ratio a 2 a 1 by fixing the geometric parameters at a 1 b 1 a 2 b 2 1 actually a circular annular tank and the filling level at h b 1 1 it is clear that with increasing the radius ratio a 2 a 1 the first natural frequency decreases monotonically while the natural frequencies of higher order modes increase nonlinearly which is totally different from the trend of first natural frequency additionally based on the assumptions of a 1 b 1 a 2 b 2 1 and a 2 a 1 0 5 fig 18 illustrates the variation of the first five antisymmetric non dimensional natural frequencies ω 2 b 1 g versus the liquid filling level h b 1 one can see that the first natural frequency firstly increases to its peak value as the filling level increases to about h b 1 0 5 and then decreases gradually with the further increase in filling level while the higher natural frequencies show opposite trends moreover an interesting feature can be observed from fig 18 that turning points occur in the curves according to natural frequencies of higher order modes at h b 1 0 5 this is because when the liquid filling level is higher than half of the tank h b 1 0 5 the free surface is divided by the inner tank wall into two parts which may significantly affect the sloshing response compared with the case of lower h b 1 0 5 liquid filling level 4 2 effect of the different sections of the eccentric annular tank with single bottom mounted porous baffle firstly a single bottom mounted porous baffle has been designed to investigate how its length h influences the liquid sloshing in the eccentric rectangular annular tank in which the widths of the exterior and interior walls are 2 b 1 and 2 b 2 and the corresponding heights are h 1 and h 2 h 2 is also the height of the liquid free surface respectively as shown in fig 19 for simplicity the above parameters are fixed at h 1 b 1 2 and h 2 b 2 1 for this example fig 20 depicts the discretized schematic diagram of igabem for this model with two sub domains in which there are 124 nodes corresponding to 120 control points fig 21 shows how the total nondimensional sloshing force with the factor 2 ρ a ω 2 b 1 h 1 b 2 h 2 varies against the nondimensional excitation frequency ω g h 1 h 2 1 2 1 2 at the ratio h h 1 h 2 0 9 several porous effect parameters λ 0 1 0 3 0 5 0 7 0 9 are selected for this example it can be seen that the location where the maximum sloshing force occurs is shifted to smaller value of nondimensional excitation frequency with a decrease in λ and the maximum value of the sloshing force decreases slightly with the increase in porous effect parameter when λ 0 3 and then drastically increases as λ further increases which demonstrates that an porous baffle with the appropriate porous effect parameter can significantly suppress the liquid sloshing the variation of the total nondimensional sloshing force with the factor 2 ρ a ω 2 b 1 h 1 b 2 h 2 to the nondimensional excitation frequency ω g h 1 h 2 1 2 1 2 with various lengths of the porous baffle h h 1 h 2 0 1 0 3 0 5 0 7 0 9 is summarized in fig 22 and the porous effect parameter of the porous baffle is set to λ 0 5 from fig 22 the total sloshing force on the walls and baffle of tank rapidly decreases with increasing the baffle length which means that the length of baffle has great influence on the sloshing force and relatively large length of the porous baffle can effectively suppress the liquid sloshing fig 23 shows the total sloshing force with various porous baffle for the storage container considering different lateral excitations ω g h 1 h 2 1 2 1 2 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 and h h 1 h 2 1 0 as can be seen in fig 23 the sloshing forces rapidly increase with increase of the porous effect parameter λ in relatively small range and then tend to the asymptotic values which illustrates that the effect of the porous parameter λ is most pronounced when the value of λ is relatively smaller furthermore the surface elevation along the positive half of the x axis versus the porous effect parameter of baffle is exhibited in fig 24 the lateral excitation and baffle length ratio are fixed at ω g h 1 h 2 1 2 1 2 0 8 and h h 1 h 2 1 0 from fig 24 the surface elevation increases gradually with the porous effect parameter while the variation ratio becomes much smaller when the value of λ is relatively larger this also confirms the conclusions in fig 23 meanwhile the horizontal eccentric rectangular annular tank having circular arc angle with penetrating baffle h h 1 h 2 1 0 is also compared to that the rectangular section mentioned above as illustrated in fig 25 in which r 1 r 2 ensures that the area of this tank can restrain the same area as the above tank and the other geometric parameters b 1 b 2 h 1 and h 2 of this tank are identical to that of the eccentric rectangular annular tank 168 nodes together with 164 control points are adopted in fig 26 the total sloshing forces at different lateral excitations ω g h 1 h 2 1 2 1 2 are presented in fig 27 with the porous effect parameter fixed at λ 0 5 five different ratios r b 2 of 0 1 0 3 0 5 0 7 and 0 9 are considered it can be found from fig 27 that circular arc angle instead of right angle may slightly increase the sloshing force fig 28 further shows the nondimensional sloshing force varies against the lateral excitations with five selected porous effect parameters λ 0 1 0 3 0 5 0 7 0 9 and the ratio is fixed at r b 2 0 5 for the example given here it is clear that the peak value of sloshing force response becomes much weaker as λ becomes relatively smaller and when the porous effect parameter is λ 0 1 the resonance phenomenon even vanishes moreover based on the comparison between figs 28 and 21 one can note that the penetrating baffle can make more significant suppression effects on the sloshing force acting on the horizontal eccentric rectangular annular tank secondly the horizontal eccentric circular annular tank with bottom mounted baffle is taken about as shown in fig 29 in which r 1 2 and r 2 1 are the exterior and interior radii and l is the length of the bottom mounted baffle and the corresponding to discretized schematic diagram of igabem are illustrated in fig 30 where 168 nodes together with 164 control points in two sub domains are used for the mentioned tank fig 31 plots the variation of the total nondimensional sloshing force with the factor ρ a ω 2 π r 1 2 r 2 2 2 vs the porous effect parameter of the porous baffle at the ratio l r 1 r 2 0 9 as one can see from fig 31 the amplitude value of the sloshing force firstly descries to its minimum and then monotonically increases with further increase in the porous effect parameter λ 0 3 seems to be the best choice for the bottom mounted baffle to suppress the sloshing force acting on the horizontal eccentric circular annular tank fig 31 also shows that with decreasing the porous effect parameter λ the resonance sloshing frequency monotonically decreases due to the decrease in sloshing energy dissipation meanwhile the values of the nondimensional sloshing force with the factor ρ a ω 2 π r 1 2 r 2 2 2 against ω g h 1 h 2 1 2 1 2 is shown in fig 32 in which five different porous baffle lengths of l r 1 r 2 having 0 1 0 3 0 5 0 7 and 0 9 are considered a similar trend as fig 22 can be noted from fig 32 that the maximum value of total sloshing force sharply decreases with an increase in the baffle length while the variation of its amplitude with porous baffle lengths is smaller than those of the eccentric rectangular annular tank which demonstrates that variation of the porous baffle lengths in the eccentric rectangular annular tank is more sensitive to the sloshing force than the eccentric circular annular tank fig 33 shows variation of the nondimensional sloshing force with porous effect parameter λ with ω g h 1 h 2 1 2 1 2 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 and l r 1 r 2 1 0 it can be observed from fig 33 that the value of sloshing force appear a rapidly increase within relatively small range about λ 1 0 of porous effect parameter thereafter the sloshing force remains almost unchanged with the further increase in porous effect parameter which means that choosing a suitable porous effect parameter can effectively reduce the sloshing force finally the horizontal eccentric elliptical annular tank with bottom mounted baffle is considered as shown in fig 34 in which a 1 and a 2 are the exterior and interior lengths of the major semi axes while b 1 and b 2 are the corresponding lengths of the minor semi axes and l indicates the length of the bottom mounted baffle for comparison purpose this tank has the same section area as the circular annular tank mentioned above fig 35 shows the discretized schematic diagram of igabem where 168 nodes together with 164 control points in two sub domains are used the variation of the total nondimensional sloshing force with the factor ρ a ω 2 π a 1 b 1 a 2 b 2 2 vs the porous effect parameters of the porous baffle at the ratio l b 1 b 2 0 9 is depicted in fig 31 it is evident that when λ 0 3 the nondimensional sloshing force decreases uniformly with decreasing the porous effect parameter while the sloshing force is found to increase again with the further decrease in λ furthermore the comparison between figs 31 and 36 shows that the sloshing force acting on the circular annular tank seems more sensitive than the elliptical annular tank to the porous effect parameter of the porous baffle the value of the nondimensional sloshing force with the factor ρ a ω 2 π a 1 b 1 a 2 b 2 2 against ω g b 1 b 2 1 2 1 2 is shown in fig 37 in which the value of porous effect parameter of the porous baffle is set as λ 0 5 meanwhile different lengths of porous baffle l b 1 b 2 ranging from 0 1 to 0 9 are taken into account as shown in fig 37 compared with fig 32 when the ratio l b 1 b 2 changes from 0 1 to 0 5 the reduction in the peak value of sloshing force acting on the elliptical annular tank is about 50 which is march bigger than that of the circular annular tank nearly 30 however when the ratio l b 1 b 2 changes from 0 5 to 0 9 the variation of baffle length has more remarkable influence on the sloshing force acting on circular annular tank than that acting on elliptical annular tank fig 38 also gives the nondimensional surface elevation with porous effect parameters of bottom mounted baffle subject to the specified lateral excitation ω g b 1 b 2 1 2 1 2 0 6 by fixed the ratio l b 1 b 2 0 5 as shown in fig 38 the surface elevation increases gradually as the porous effect parameter increases it can further be seen from fig 38 that when the porous effect parameter changes from 0 3 to 0 5 the surface elevation shows a larger increase which means that baffles with smaller value of porous effect parameters can effectively suppress the surface elevation moreover fig 39 shows the visualizations of the typical liquid velocity fields caused by the excitation ω g b 1 b 2 1 2 1 2 0 6 for the elliptical annular tank with bottom mounted baffle in which the porous effect parameter is fixed as λ 0 5 and the baffle lengths l b 1 b 2 0 3 0 7 are chosen fig 39 reveals that larger baffle length yields more evident effects on the velocity fields than the relatively smaller one this also confirms the viewpoint in fig 37 4 3 effects of position and length of the coaxial arc porous baffle the horizontal eccentric circular annular tank with coaxial arc porous baffle and the corresponding to its discretized schematic diagram of igabem are shown in figs 40 and 41 respectively in fig 40 r 1 r 2 and r present the exterior interior radii of walls and arc porous baffle respectively and θ is the opening angle of the porous baffle which also can represent the length of the baffle 137 nodes and 131 control points in two sub domains are adopted in the model of igabem in fig 42 the variation of the total nondimensional sloshing forces with the factor ρ a ω 2 π r 1 2 r 2 2 2 is plotted against ω g r 1 r 2 1 2 1 2 for several different opening angles of the porous baffle at r r 2 r 1 r 2 0 5 and the porous effect parameter λ 0 5 we note from fig 42 that the lengths of the arc porous baffle make negligible influence on the sloshing force the variation of the total nondimensional sloshing forces versus the dimensionless horizontal position of the porous baffle with λ 0 5 and θ π 2 is presented in fig 43 it is evident from fig 43 that the effect of the porous baffle s position could be neglected a computation with various porous effect parameters is made and results are illustrated in fig 44 for the total nondimensional sloshing force in surge with r r 2 r 1 r 2 0 5 and θ π 2 as shown in fig 44 unless the porous effect parameter is relatively small λ 0 1 the porous effect parameter has a little effect on the slosh force 4 4 effect of the number of the porous baffle the geometries of the horizontal eccentric circular annular tank and the arrangement of three top and bottom mounted porous baffles are shown in figs 45 and 46 respectively in which r 1 and r 2 are the exterior interior radii of walls θ orientates the location of the porous baffle and l is the length of the porous baffle the discretization models for the two structures are illustrated in figs 47 and 48 where there are 210 nodes including 195 control points the total nondimensional sloshing forces with the factor ρ a ω 2 π r 1 2 r 2 2 2 on the two systems vs the different lengths of porous baffles are presented in fig 49 a and b with θ π 4 and λ 0 5 it can be seen from the two figures that in general the sloshing forces for the case with three top mounted baffles are smaller than those with three bottom mounted baffles meanwhile fig 49 a also suggests that extending the length of the top mounted porous baffles close to the outer wall of the tank affects lower the sloshing force with the change of the baffle length fig 50 illustrates how the total nondimensional sloshing forces vary with the porous effect parameters of top and bottom mounted baffles at θ π 4 and l r 1 r 2 0 9 as it can be seen from fig 50 the porous effect parameter has the value about λ 0 3 can bring out the minimum values of the sloshing forces for the two cases which also means that an appropriate porous effect parameter can effectively suppress the sloshing force in addition fig 50 further shows that with decreasing the porous effect parameters of the top and bottom mounted baffles the first resonance sloshing frequencies decreases monotonously the visualizations of the typical liquid velocity fields for the two cases with selected porous baffle configurations with the porous effect parameter λ 0 3 0 7 as shown in fig 51 under the lateral excitations ω g r 1 r 2 1 2 1 2 0 8 can further demonstrate the viewpoint mentioned above fig 52 a and b also give the variation of the nondimensional surface elevation with different porous effect parameters of baffles for the two cases subject to the lateral excitation ω g r 1 r 2 1 2 1 2 0 8 from fig 52 a and b when the porous effect parameters decrease from 0 9 to 0 1 the liquid surface elevations decrease by nearly 50 in both cases meanwhile the case with the three bottom mounted baffles can evoke greater surface elevation than that with three top mounted baffles fig 53 further present the curves of the total nondimensional sloshing forces with the factor ρ a ω 2 π r 1 2 r 2 2 2 for the cases with one and three mounted porous baffles or without baffle in which the porous effect parameters together with the lengths of all the mentioned porous baffles are fixed at λ 0 5 and l r 1 r 2 0 5 it can be seen from the figure that the sloshing forces are reduced compared to those by a direct wave impact without the porous baffle and equipping with three top mounted porous baffles yields greater suppression of the lateral forces than that with three bottom mounted porous baffles meanwhile suppression effect of three bottom mounted porous baffles on the sloshing force is more significant than that of one bottom mounted porous baffle 5 conclusion in this paper based on the linearized potential theory the isogeometric boundary element igabem is firstly conducted to investigate liquid sloshing in the horizontal eccentric annular tanks with multiple porous baffles the proposed method can reduce one dimension within the framework of bem and the igabem for the analysis of liquid sloshing can exactly represent the geometry no matter how coarse discretize the studied boundary which then produces no geometrical errors the derivation process for this problem by using the proposed method is obtained in detail three configurations of baffles are taken into account such as the top mounted baffles bottom mounted baffles and arc baffles the results obtained by the proposed method are verified by comparing with the reported solutions or fem solutions estimated by ansys and higher numerical accuracy and stability are obtained the effects of tank s geometry liquid filling level and the baffle parameters with various lengths submergence depths number of baffles and porosities on the natural sloshing frequency wave surface elevation sloshing force and velocity field are investigated as to the natural frequency increasing the ratio of minor to major semi axes of horizontal elliptical annular tank results in decreases in liquid natural frequencies and with increasing the radius ratio of the horizontal circular annular tank the first natural frequency decreases monotonically while the natural frequencies of higher order modes increase nonlinearly meanwhile the first natural frequency firstly increases and then decreases gradually with the increase in liquid filling level of the horizontal circular annular tank while the higher natural frequencies show opposite trends moreover decreasing the porous effect parameter may decrease the resonance frequencies of liquid sloshing in various horizontal annular tanks as to the horizontal eccentric rectangular circular elliptical annular tank with top or bottom mounted baffles the effect of the baffles on sloshing response is most pronounced when the value of λ equals about 0 3 choosing a suitable porous effect parameter can effectively reduce the sloshing forces and baffles with relatively large length conduct significant suppression effects on sloshing force circular arc angle instead of right angle may slightly increase the sloshing force acting on the rectangular annular tank and for the case of horizontal eccentric circular annular tank with coaxial arc baffle the length and porous effect parameter of the arc porous baffle have little effects on the slosh force as to the horizontal eccentric circular annular tank with the arrangement of one or three bottom mounted and three top mounted porous baffles that the sloshing forces are reduced compared to those by a direct wave impact without the porous baffle and equipping with three top mounted porous baffles yields greater suppression of the lateral forces than that with one or three bottom mounted porous baffles although this study is carried out under some assumptions such as the incompressible irrotational inviscid flow and linearized free surface boundary condition it can be applied as an efficient approach to evaluate the characteristics of small waved sloshing within two dimensional tanks and aids to provide scientific guidance in

22498,boundary element method bem coupled with the isogeometric boundary based on non uniform rational b splines nurbs which is termed igabem is a new numerical method and has attracted wide attention in recent years in this paper igabem is first applied to the liquid sloshing problem in the horizontal rectangular circular or elliptical annular tanks with multiple porous baffles assuming

power plants aerospace systems road transportation system municipal facilities systems naval oil industry water conservancy and civil facilities as we all know that oscillations of liquid sloshing in partially filled container under excitations may cause undesirable hydrodynamic moments and forces with enormous magnitude which will bring out structural instability and damage in this sense many fields of liquid sloshing have been developed such as natural frequencies as well as corresponding mode shapes in a vehicle sloshing analysis under low or zero gravity linear or non linear feature of sloshing analysis of coupling liquid sloshing and structural vibration control and optimization of sloshing features ibrahim 2005 has given a comprehensive review with more than 2600 instances until its publication date since there are challenges for the analysis of liquid sloshing by using the theoretical methods with complex geometry many researchers turn to experimental works or numerical methods for example the finite volume method saripilli and sen 2018 finite difference method zhang et al 2016 boundary element method zhang et al 2016 finite element method battaglia et al 2018 meshless method violeau and rogers 2016 scaled boundary finite element method lin et al 2015 and pseudo spectral turner et al 2015 method have become wide use in this field among all boundary element method bem becomes a well popular manner since only the boundaries instead of the entire domain should be discretized so the costs of time and memory can be cut down significantly compared to other conventional method such as finite element method fem finite difference method fdm and finite volume method fvm nakayama and washizu 1981 conducted the boundary element method to analyze the two

under different excitation meanwhile the baffles installed within the tanks have been widely used and can effectively suppress the sloshing behavior many valuable researchers have been performed on the baffled effects of liquid sloshing by using bem gedikli and ergüven 1999 reported the dynamic sloshing responses in the cylindrical tank with ring baffle under the seismic excitation by using the bem gedikli and ergüven 2003 investigated the effect of baffle on the natural frequencies in the cylindrical tank by using a variational bem firouz abadi et al 2008 developed the bem along with a zoning method to estimate the natural frequencies and the corresponding mode shapes of liquid sloshing in 3d tanks with baffles sygulski 2011 concerned the bem to investigate the natural frequencies

three degrees of freedom motion in the 2d rectangular container considerding the coupling effects of the internal liquid sloshing and tank motion by the bem in time domain behshad and shekari 2018 investigated liquid sloshing response in the rectangular container with baffles using the bem isogeometric analysis iga is a new numerical method which is originated by hughes et al 2005 and firstly proposed to concern the use of the fem and has attracted a lot of attention in the recent years compared with conventional bem the igabem for the analysis of liquid sloshing can exactly represent the geometry no matter how coarse discretize the studied boundary which then produces no geometrical errors many researchers have applied the igabem with its distinct advantages to study various problems such as potential problems gong et al 2017a b acoustic problems coox et al 2017 laplace equation analysis aimi et al 2016 helmholtz equation analysis peake et al 2013 calculation of effective thermal

shape optimization lian et al 2016 stokes flows heltai et al 2014 fast multipole igabem liu et al 2017 and adaptive mesh refinement feischl et al 2016 as the same time compared to solid baffles the porous baffles can significantly cut down the sloshing forces on the tanks however the applications for the analysis of liquid sloshing in the tanks with porous baffles have been limited to only a few jin et al 2014 conducted the experimental studies for the liquid sloshing in the tank with the horizontal perforated plate under different excitation cho et al 2016 2017 presented the analytical solutions for the liquid sloshing in the rectangular container with the horizontal or dual vertical porous baffles by using the matched eigenfunction expansion method based on the linear potential theory ye et al 2018 presented the scaled boundary finite element method sbfem to analyze the liquid sloshing in the cylindrical tanks with coaxial porous baffles review mentioned above suggests that the analysis of the liquid sloshing problems in the rectangular circular or elliptical horizontal annular tanks with multiple porous baffles does not exist to fill this gap in the present study the igabem coupling with the zoning method is applied to the simulation of liquid sloshing problems in section 2 the formulation with igabem of the liquid sloshing in the annular tanks with porous baffles is summarized section 3 gives the verification of the proposed method through the numerical example in section 4 the effects of the tank s geometry liquid filling level and the baffle length on the natural sloshing frequency in horizontal annular tanks are studied in detail meanwhile the effects of baffle parameters with various lengths submergence depths and porosities on wave surface elevation sloshing force and velocity field are also investigated in section 4 finally conclusions are obtained in section 5 2 theoretical description and the formulation with igabem for this problem the schematic diagram of the horizontal eccentric annular tanks having uniform longitudinal section z axis direction with porous baffle subject to the horizontal lateral excitation in frequency domain is shown in fig 1 where r and r 1 are the radii of the exterior and interior tank walls respectively and the profile in the two dimensional cartesian coordinates x y is circular and the section such as rectangular type will be also considered thereinafter the x axis points the plane of liquid free surface vertically pointing downwards through the midpoint of liquid surface is y axis and z axis expresses the longitudinal direction assuming the small time harmonic incompressible irrotational and inviscid liquid the governing equation for the sloshing of liquid can be obtained with respect to the flow potential φ x y t with the uniform longitudinal section nezami et al 2014a b which can be dealt with the laplace equation and the boundary conditions therefore the flow potential φ x y t can be expressed as 1 φ x y t ϕ x y e i ω t and ϕ x y meets 2 2 ϕ 2 ϕ x 2 2 ϕ y 2 0 in ω the linearized boundary condition of free surface is 3 ϕ y ω 2 g ϕ with the boundary condition at rigid wall of the tank and the matching condition on the porous baffle 4 ϕ n i ω a cos θ 5 ϕ n ϕ n i ω λ ϕ ϕ i ω a cos θ where θ is the angle between the outer normal of the boundary and the x axis ω is the external excitation frequency a is the amplitude of lateral excitation ϕ n and ϕ n are the normal velocities at each baffle sides and ϕ as well as ϕ present the fluid potentials at each baffle sides respectively n means the unit normal vector and λ is the porous effect parameter of porous baffle thus the matching condition on the porous baffle meets the darcy s law then the flow velocity between each side of the porous baffle is linearly proportional to the pressure difference and normal mass fluxes are continuous meanwhile the item i ω a cos θ in the right hand of eq 5 expresses that the porous baffle and tank move together meanwhile the dynamic pressure the elevation of liquid free surface and the velocity can be expressed as follow 6 p ρ φ t 7 η i ω g ϕ 8 v φ as to the boundary element method bem fig 2 shows the two dimensional region and the boundary p is on behalf of the source point and q expresses the field point introducing the weight function ϕ the weighted residual

the weight function is treated as the laplace s fundamental solution which satisfies the following equation 11 2 ϕ δ 0 where δ is dirac function according to the properties of the dirac delta function the domain integral term in eq 11 can be written as 12 ω ϕ 2 ϕ d ω ϕ substituting eq 12 into eq 10 leads to 13 c p ϕ p γ ϕ q q q p d γ γ ϕ q p q q d γ in which 14 q ϕ n in eq 13 ϕ and q are the values of the potential and the flux mass ϕ presents the fundamental solution to the laplace s equation and q is the normal derivative of ϕ for the two dimensional potential problems as follow brebbia c a dominguez 1992 banerjee p k 1992 divo and kassab 2003 15 ϕ 1 2 π ln 1 r 16 q ϕ n 1 2 π r r n in which r is the distance between the points p and q c p in eq 13 can be expressed as 17 c p 1 α 2 π where α is the angle between tangent lines at the boundary point thus p is corresponding to the boundary of the domain α 2 π means that p is outside the domain and α 0 is for p inside the domain in order to numerically solve the integral equation 13 numerous small elements should be separated for the boundary and the discretization equation of the boundary element can be expressed as 18 c i ϕ i j 1 n e l n d ϕ l j γ j q q i d γ j j n e l n d q l j γ j ϕ q i d γ j where n e is the number of elements n d is number of nodes per element and ϕ l j as well as q l j are the values of the potential and flux mass of the l th node in j th element 19 ϕ ξ n φ 20 q ξ n q in which φ and q are the column vectors consisting of potentials and flux masses at all the nodes of one element n indicates a row vector called the shape function related to the element type and quadratic elements are used in this paper for the simulation for the two dimensional potential problem the boundary is the one dimensional and n for the three node quadratic element can be expressed as 21 n n 1 ξ n 2 ξ n 3 ξ where ξ is the local coordinate variable and 22 n 1 ξ 1 2 ξ ξ 1 23 n 2 ξ 1 ξ 2 24 n 3 ξ 1 2 ξ ξ 1 substituting eqs 19 20 into eq 18 the discretization of boundary integral equation can be obtained as 25 c i ϕ i j 1 n e k i j φ j j 1 n e g i j q j in which 26 k i j 1 1 q n j ξ j j ξ d ξ 27 g i j 1 1 ϕ n j ξ j j ξ d ξ where j are the jacobian matrix associated with the element and j d γ d ξ for the two dimensional potential problem j can be described as 28 j ξ d x 1 d ξ 2 d x 2 d ξ 2 it should be noted that eqs 26 and 27 can be generally evaluated with gaussian integration approach however when the source point i in eqs 26 and 27 is located at the j th element eqs 26 and 27 become strongly and weakly singular integrals due to the items of 1 r in q and ln 1 r in ϕ gao 2005 as described in eqs 16 and 15 the singularity subtraction technique guiggiani et al 1992 and telles transformation scheme telles 1987 are employed in this paper to evaluate these two kinds of integrals respectively as the same time the non uniform rational b splines nurbs shown in fig 3 is used as the basis function to formulate the general equation of the isogeometric boundary element method igabem for this problem and b spline basis function can be obtained by the recursion formula as follows when the knot vector u u 0 u 1 u n u i u i 1 is given 29 n i 0 u 1 u i u u i 1 0 o t h e r w i s e n i κ u u u i u i κ u i n i κ 1 u u i κ 1 u u i κ 1 u i n i 1 κ 1 u κ 1 where κ represents the degree of the function and u i is called knot nurbs basis function can be derived from the b spine by introduce the weight item and the one dimensional nurbs function can be described as hughes et al 2005 30 r i κ u w i n i κ u j 0 n w j n j κ u the boundary element method is used to solve the two dimensional potential problem only by discretization the boundary hence the two dimensional problem can be reduced to one dimensional problem being different from the traditional boundary element method the nodes corresponding to the control points in the igabem are not necessarily on the boundary which will cause trouble for the application of boundary conditions therefore collocation points in parameter space are introduced as 31 u ˆ i u i 1 u i 2 u i κ κ i 1 2 n 1 in which n is the number of the control points of the boundary according to the basic theory of nurbs and interpolation theory node coordinates on the boundary can be described as 32 x i u j 1 n r j κ u c j i i 1 2 where x i is the i th coordinate component of the collocation points c j i are the i th coordinate components of the j th control point on the boundary using the similar manner some physical quantities can also be achieved as follows 33 ϕ u i 1 n r i κ u ϕ i 34 q u i 1 n r i κ u q i where ϕ and q are values of the potential and flux mass associated with the control points at the boundary in order to do the boundary integral with the gaussian integral the value of u should be expressed as a local coordinate form 35 u u ξ u 2 e u 1 e 2 ξ u 2 e u 1 e 2 ξ 1 1 in which u 1 e and u 2 e represent the values of the parameter space at the both ends of the e th element meanwhile the interval u 1 e u 2 e is called a knot span and the first order derivative of u versus ξ can be written as 36 d u ξ d ξ u 2 e u 1 e 2 the basis function in the local coordinate system can be mapped by the basis function defined in the global coordinate system as 37 n l e ξ r i κ u ξ l 1 2 κ 1 in which n l e is local nurbs basis function in element e and i denotes the index of global nurbs basis functions whose values are not zero when the certain local coordinate ξ is given thinking about the properties of the local support of the nurbs basis function eqs 32 34 can be rewritten as 38 x i ξ l 1 κ 1 n l e ξ c l i e i 1 2 39 ϕ ξ l 1 κ 1 n l e ξ ϕ l e 40 q ξ l 1 κ 1 n l e ξ q l e according to eq 28 eq 35 and eq 36 one can obtain 41 j e ξ d γ d ξ d γ d u d u d ξ d x 1 d u 2 d x 2 d u 2 u 2 e u 1 e 2 discretization form of the igabem equation is given by the following term 42 c i l 1 κ 1 n l e ˆ ξ ˆ ϕ l e ˆ j 1 n e l 1 κ 1 1 1 q q ξ i n l j ξ

eq 42 can be further expressed in the matrix equation 43 k φ g q in which k and g are the coefficient matrices which can be assembled by the row vectors of k i j and g i j with respect to the element as follow 44 k i j 1 1 q q ξ i n j ξ j j ξ d ξ e ˆ j c i n e ˆ ξ 1 1 q q ξ i n j ξ j j ξ d ξ e ˆ j 45 g i j 1 1 ϕ q ξ i n j ξ j j ξ d ξ where n j ξ n 1 j ξ n 2 j ξ n κ 1 j ξ sub domains should be divided for the fluid domain when the porous baffles are equipped within the tank as shown in fig 4 in order to solve the problem of discontinuity of the physical quantities and easily assemble matrices k and g common corner nodes in the different domains and the junction between the virtual interface and the porous baffle are divided into three or two nodes for a typical element shown in fig 4 it is assumed that the ratio of the collocation nodes a and c for convenience collocation point is abbreviated as node hereinafter inwards a distance by using the shape function ζ of the parameter space and the knot values of the nodes a and c can be calculated as follows 46 u a 1 2 ζ ζ 1 u 1 1 ζ 2 u 2 1 2 ζ ζ 1 u 3 47 u c 1 2 ζ ζ 1 u 1 ζ 2 ζ u 2 1 2 1 ζ 2 ζ u 3 meanwhile u b is corresponding to the u 2 of the parameter space because b is inside the element as shown in fig 4 in igabem the nodes collocation points are not necessarily coincide with the control points but the values of φ and q in eq 43 are the physical quantities of the control points therefore the given boundary conditions cannot be directly added to the solving formula one technique to solve this problem is that the physical quantities of the control points should be inversely calculated from the given values of the boundary condition which means that the degree of freedom of calculation is determined by the control point and then eq 43 can be solved as the conventional bem 48 φ γ ϕ r γ ϕ u γ ϕ φ γ ϕ where γ ϕ presents the boundary in which the values of φ are given φ γ ϕ indicate the known potential values of nodes collocation points on γ ϕ r γ ϕ are the global nurbs basis function matrices according to γ ϕ φ γ ϕ present the potential values to be evaluated at the control points associated with γ ϕ and u γ ϕ are the knot values of the nodes on boundary γ ϕ in the parametric space which can be obtained by eq 31 49 φ γ ϕ r γ ϕ 1 u γ ϕ φ γ ϕ similar derivation can also be achieved as eq 50 50 q γ q r γ q 1 u γ q q γ q where γ q expresses the boundary in which the values of q are given q γ q point the known the flux mass values of the nodes on γ q r γ q are the global nurbs basis function matrices responding to γ q q γ q present the flux mass values of the control points with respect to γ q u γ q are the values of the collocation points on γ q in parameter space in eq 31 as shown in fig 4 the solved field taken as example can be divided into two sub domains by the virtual interface and the porous baffle assuming that the subscripts of f r v p indicate the liquid free surface the rigid boundary virtual interface and porous baffle respectively eq 43 can be written as 51 k f k r k v k p φ f φ r φ v φ p g f g r g v g p q f q r q v q p the global equation for the two sub domains can be assembled as follow 52 k f 1 k r 1 k v 1 k p 1 k f 2 k r 2 k v 2 k p 2 φ f 1 φ r 1 φ v 1 φ p 1 φ f 2 φ r 2 φ v 2 φ p 2 g f 1 g r 1 g v 1 g p 1 g f 2 g r 2 g v 2 g p 2 q f 1 q r 1 q v 1 q p 1 q f 2 q r 2 q v 2 q p 2 where superscripts 1 and 2 represent the two sub domains considering the matching condition at the porous baffle corresponding to eq 5 and the normal velocity and pressure to be continuous on the virtual boundary between the two sub domains one can achieve 53 q p 1 q p 2 i ω λ ϕ p 1 ϕ p 2 i ω a cos θ 54 q v 1 q v 2 55 ϕ v 1 ϕ v 2 substitute eq 1 and eqs 53 55 into eq 51 and arrangementing yield k f 1 ω 2 g g f 1 k r 1 k v 1 k p 1 i ω λ g p 1 i ω λ g p 1 g v 1 k v 2 i ω λ g p 2 k f 2 ω 2 g g f 2 k r 2 k p 2 i ω λ g p 2 g v 2 φ f 1 φ r 1 φ v 1 φ p 1 φ f 2 φ r 2 φ p 2 q v 2 56 g r 1 g p 1 g p 2 g r 2 q r 1 i ω a cos θ q r 2 the derivation process is similar to that of the above mentioned two sub domains when there are more sub domains the dynamic pressure the elevation of liquid free surface and the velocity in eqs 6 8 can be obtained after the vectors φ and q being solved by eq 56 and then the horizontal sloshing force acting on the whole system can be addressed as 57 f x h 0 p r p p d y with p r and p p denoting the dynamic sloshing pressures on the rigid boundary as well as the porous baffles of the liquid tank for simplicity the non dimensional slosh force f x ρ a ω 2 s is applied to investigate the sloshing response in two dimensional tanks where s indicates the area of the flow domain finally fig 5 shows the flowchart of iga bem for liquid sloshing problem in tanks with multiple sub domains in which the zoning method is involved and it should be noted that the shaded blocks are notably different from those of the standard bem as described above 3 verification of igabem model in order to demonstrate the correctness efficiency and convergence of the proposed manner three examples of verification are proposed in this section firstly the horizontal eccentric circular annular tank with half full liquid is illustrated in fig 6 in which the exterior and interior circular radii of the present tank are r 1 and r 2 in order to compare with the limiting case the radio r 2 r 1 0 01 is set to match the results solved by faltinsen and timokha 2010 with the analytical method for the first ten sloshing frequencies ω 2 r 1 g in a partially filled circular tank the results were also calculated by the appropriate conformal mapping transformation nezami et al 2014a b and the boundary element method bem with the authors own program figs 7 and 8 depict the discretized schematic diagrams of igabem and bem in the horizontal eccentric annular tank with half full liquid respectively in igabem for this example the numbers of the control points and nodes are identical in fact the values of the nodes are involved in computing instead of that of the control points mentioned above thus the degrees of freedom can be calculated by using the nodes when compared to the other numerical method which is also applies to the latter part of this paper the comparing calculation results list in table 1 show that good agreement with the analytical method with few nodes and the proposed method has higher convergence and accurate than the conventional bem especially for the higher frequencies secondly a half filled horizontal eccentric circular annular tank with top mounted baffle is considered to verify the correctness of the present igabem model in calculating the sloshing force fig 9 shows the geometries of the mentioned tank as well as the top mounted baffle as can be seen in this figure the top mounted baffle is fixed vertically at the middle of the tank and l means the length of the baffle the exterior and interior circular radii of the tank are fixed at r 1 2 and r 2 1 the igabem solutions are compared with the fem ones solved by commercial ansys software figs 10 and 11 schematically describe the discretized diagrams of fem and igabem respectively and fem with 960 two dimension 8 nodes elements together with igabem with 70 quadratic elements are used to simulate this example the validation of the non dimensional sloshing force with the factor ρ a ω 2 π r 1 2 r 2 2 2 to the nondimensional excitation frequency ω g r 1 r 2 1 2 1 2 is illustrated in fig 12 at the fixed baffle length l r 1 r 2 0 5 meanwhile the porous effect parameter is set as λ 0 solid baffle in order to facilitate the simulation by using ansys good agreement between the igabem and fem solutions can be observed from fig 12 which also verifies the igabem model well finally on the basis of figs 9 and 11 the variation of the first three non dimensional natural frequencies ω 2 r 1 g within a horizontal eccentric circular annular tank with top mounted baffle versus the baffle length ratio l r 1 is projected in fig 13 and the present results are compared with those in the existing reference hasheminejad and aghabeigi 2012 which were solved by the successive conformal transformation technique in order to match the results of hasheminejad and aghabeigi 2012 the radius ratio is assumed as r 2 r 1 0 001 and the porous effect parameter is set to λ 0 which implies that the porous baffle is almost a solid baffle the comparison yields complete agreement as shown in fig 13 and fig 13 further indicates that with increasing the ratio l r 1 the first natural frequency decreases gradually while the second and third frequencies firstly decrease rapidly and then become almost irrespective of the ratio l r 1 4 numerical results and discussion in this section a study is provided to estimate the effects of the tank s geometry liquid filling level and the key baffle parameters with various lengths number of baffles and porosities on the natural frequency wave surface elevation sloshing force and velocity field 4 1 effects of liquid filling level and the tank s geometric parameters on natural frequency it is of significant practical value for ocean engineering to study the influence factors of natural sloshing frequency in liquid storage tanks due to which a horizontal elliptical annular tank is chosen as an example in this section to investigate the effects of the liquid filling level and the tank s geometric parameters on the natural frequency figs 14 and 15 describe the geometry of the tank and the discretized schematic diagram of the flow domain respectively as shown in fig 14 a 1 and a 2 denote the major semi axes of the outer and inner tank wall b 1 and b 2 are the minor semi axes accordingly meanwhile h indicates the depth of the liquid for simplicity the major semi axes of the outer tank wall is fixed at a 1 2 in this section in addition it should be noted that 161 control points nodes are utilized in this example the variation curves of the first five antisymmetric non dimensional natural frequencies ω 2 a 1 b 1 g against the ratio of minor to major semi axes b 1 a 1 are shown in fig 16 with the geometric parameters and liquid filling level satisfy a 2 a 1 b 2 b 1 0 001 and h b 1 1 it can be seen that all the five natural frequencies increase from zero as the ratio b 1 a 1 increases meanwhile the increase rate of natural frequency increases with the increase in mode number fig 17 depicts the variation of the first five antisymmetric non dimensional natural frequencies ω 2 b 1 g against the radius ratio a 2 a 1 by fixing the geometric parameters at a 1 b 1 a 2 b 2 1 actually a circular annular tank and the filling level at h b 1 1 it is clear that with increasing the radius ratio a 2 a 1 the first natural frequency decreases monotonically while the natural frequencies of higher order modes increase nonlinearly which is totally different from the trend of first natural frequency additionally based on the assumptions of a 1 b 1 a 2 b 2 1 and a 2 a 1 0 5 fig 18 illustrates the variation of the first five antisymmetric non dimensional natural frequencies ω 2 b 1 g versus the liquid filling level h b 1 one can see that the first natural frequency firstly increases to its peak value as the filling level increases to about h b 1 0 5 and then decreases gradually with the further increase in filling level while the higher natural frequencies show opposite trends moreover an interesting feature can be observed from fig 18 that turning points occur in the curves according to natural frequencies of higher order modes at h b 1 0 5 this is because when the liquid filling level is higher than half of the tank h b 1 0 5 the free surface is divided by the inner tank wall into two parts which may significantly affect the sloshing response compared with the case of lower h b 1 0 5 liquid filling level 4 2 effect of the different sections of the eccentric annular tank with single bottom mounted porous baffle firstly a single bottom mounted porous baffle has been designed to investigate how its length h influences the liquid sloshing in the eccentric rectangular annular tank in which the widths of the exterior and interior walls are 2 b 1 and 2 b 2 and the corresponding heights are h 1 and h 2 h 2 is also the height of the liquid free surface respectively as shown in fig 19 for simplicity the above parameters are fixed at h 1 b 1 2 and h 2 b 2 1 for this example fig 20 depicts the discretized schematic diagram of igabem for this model with two sub domains in which there are 124 nodes corresponding to 120 control points fig 21 shows how the total nondimensional sloshing force with the factor 2 ρ a ω 2 b 1 h 1 b 2 h 2 varies against the nondimensional excitation frequency ω g h 1 h 2 1 2 1 2 at the ratio h h 1 h 2 0 9 several porous effect parameters λ 0 1 0 3 0 5 0 7 0 9 are selected for this example it can be seen that the location where the maximum sloshing force occurs is shifted to smaller value of nondimensional excitation frequency with a decrease in λ and the maximum value of the sloshing force decreases slightly with the increase in porous effect parameter when λ 0 3 and then drastically increases as λ further increases which demonstrates that an porous baffle with the appropriate porous effect parameter can significantly suppress the liquid sloshing the variation of the total nondimensional sloshing force with the factor 2 ρ a ω 2 b 1 h 1 b 2 h 2 to the nondimensional excitation frequency ω g h 1 h 2 1 2 1 2 with various lengths of the porous baffle h h 1 h 2 0 1 0 3 0 5 0 7 0 9 is summarized in fig 22 and the porous effect parameter of the porous baffle is set to λ 0 5 from fig 22 the total sloshing force on the walls and baffle of tank rapidly decreases with increasing the baffle length which means that the length of baffle has great influence on the sloshing force and relatively large length of the porous baffle can effectively suppress the liquid sloshing fig 23 shows the total sloshing force with various porous baffle for the storage container considering different lateral excitations ω g h 1 h 2 1 2 1 2 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 and h h 1 h 2 1 0 as can be seen in fig 23 the sloshing forces rapidly increase with increase of the porous effect parameter λ in relatively small range and then tend to the asymptotic values which illustrates that the effect of the porous parameter λ is most pronounced when the value of λ is relatively smaller furthermore the surface elevation along the positive half of the x axis versus the porous effect parameter of baffle is exhibited in fig 24 the lateral excitation and baffle length ratio are fixed at ω g h 1 h 2 1 2 1 2 0 8 and h h 1 h 2 1 0 from fig 24 the surface elevation increases gradually with the porous effect parameter while the variation ratio becomes much smaller when the value of λ is relatively larger this also confirms the conclusions in fig 23 meanwhile the horizontal eccentric rectangular annular tank having circular arc angle with penetrating baffle h h 1 h 2 1 0 is also compared to that the rectangular section mentioned above as illustrated in fig 25 in which r 1 r 2 ensures that the area of this tank can restrain the same area as the above tank and the other geometric parameters b 1 b 2 h 1 and h 2 of this tank are identical to that of the eccentric rectangular annular tank 168 nodes together with 164 control points are adopted in fig 26 the total sloshing forces at different lateral excitations ω g h 1 h 2 1 2 1 2 are presented in fig 27 with the porous effect parameter fixed at λ 0 5 five different ratios r b 2 of 0 1 0 3 0 5 0 7 and 0 9 are considered it can be found from fig 27 that circular arc angle instead of right angle may slightly increase the sloshing force fig 28 further shows the nondimensional sloshing force varies against the lateral excitations with five selected porous effect parameters λ 0 1 0 3 0 5 0 7 0 9 and the ratio is fixed at r b 2 0 5 for the example given here it is clear that the peak value of sloshing force response becomes much weaker as λ becomes relatively smaller and when the porous effect parameter is λ 0 1 the resonance phenomenon even vanishes moreover based on the comparison between figs 28 and 21 one can note that the penetrating baffle can make more significant suppression effects on the sloshing force acting on the horizontal eccentric rectangular annular tank secondly the horizontal eccentric circular annular tank with bottom mounted baffle is taken about as shown in fig 29 in which r 1 2 and r 2 1 are the exterior and interior radii and l is the length of the bottom mounted baffle and the corresponding to discretized schematic diagram of igabem are illustrated in fig 30 where 168 nodes together with 164 control points in two sub domains are used for the mentioned tank fig 31 plots the variation of the total nondimensional sloshing force with the factor ρ a ω 2 π r 1 2 r 2 2 2 vs the porous effect parameter of the porous baffle at the ratio l r 1 r 2 0 9 as one can see from fig 31 the amplitude value of the sloshing force firstly descries to its minimum and then monotonically increases with further increase in the porous effect parameter λ 0 3 seems to be the best choice for the bottom mounted baffle to suppress the sloshing force acting on the horizontal eccentric circular annular tank fig 31 also shows that with decreasing the porous effect parameter λ the resonance sloshing frequency monotonically decreases due to the decrease in sloshing energy dissipation meanwhile the values of the nondimensional sloshing force with the factor ρ a ω 2 π r 1 2 r 2 2 2 against ω g h 1 h 2 1 2 1 2 is shown in fig 32 in which five different porous baffle lengths of l r 1 r 2 having 0 1 0 3 0 5 0 7 and 0 9 are considered a similar trend as fig 22 can be noted from fig 32 that the maximum value of total sloshing force sharply decreases with an increase in the baffle length while the variation of its amplitude with porous baffle lengths is smaller than those of the eccentric rectangular annular tank which demonstrates that variation of the porous baffle lengths in the eccentric rectangular annular tank is more sensitive to the sloshing force than the eccentric circular annular tank fig 33 shows variation of the nondimensional sloshing force with porous effect parameter λ with ω g h 1 h 2 1 2 1 2 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 and l r 1 r 2 1 0 it can be observed from fig 33 that the value of sloshing force appear a rapidly increase within relatively small range about λ 1 0 of porous effect parameter thereafter the sloshing force remains almost unchanged with the further increase in porous effect parameter which means that choosing a suitable porous effect parameter can effectively reduce the sloshing force finally the horizontal eccentric elliptical annular tank with bottom mounted baffle is considered as shown in fig 34 in which a 1 and a 2 are the exterior and interior lengths of the major semi axes while b 1 and b 2 are the corresponding lengths of the minor semi axes and l indicates the length of the bottom mounted baffle for comparison purpose this tank has the same section area as the circular annular tank mentioned above fig 35 shows the discretized schematic diagram of igabem where 168 nodes together with 164 control points in two sub domains are used the variation of the total nondimensional sloshing force with the factor ρ a ω 2 π a 1 b 1 a 2 b 2 2 vs the porous effect parameters of the porous baffle at the ratio l b 1 b 2 0 9 is depicted in fig 31 it is evident that when λ 0 3 the nondimensional sloshing force decreases uniformly with decreasing the porous effect parameter while the sloshing force is found to increase again with the further decrease in λ furthermore the comparison between figs 31 and 36 shows that the sloshing force acting on the circular annular tank seems more sensitive than the elliptical annular tank to the porous effect parameter of the porous baffle the value of the nondimensional sloshing force with the factor ρ a ω 2 π a 1 b 1 a 2 b 2 2 against ω g b 1 b 2 1 2 1 2 is shown in fig 37 in which the value of porous effect parameter of the porous baffle is set as λ 0 5 meanwhile different lengths of porous baffle l b 1 b 2 ranging from 0 1 to 0 9 are taken into account as shown in fig 37 compared with fig 32 when the ratio l b 1 b 2 changes from 0 1 to 0 5 the reduction in the peak value of sloshing force acting on the elliptical annular tank is about 50 which is march bigger than that of the circular annular tank nearly 30 however when the ratio l b 1 b 2 changes from 0 5 to 0 9 the variation of baffle length has more remarkable influence on the sloshing force acting on circular annular tank than that acting on elliptical annular tank fig 38 also gives the nondimensional surface elevation with porous effect parameters of bottom mounted baffle subject to the specified lateral excitation ω g b 1 b 2 1 2 1 2 0 6 by fixed the ratio l b 1 b 2 0 5 as shown in fig 38 the surface elevation increases gradually as the porous effect parameter increases it can further be seen from fig 38 that when the porous effect parameter changes from 0 3 to 0 5 the surface elevation shows a larger increase which means that baffles with smaller value of porous effect parameters can effectively suppress the surface elevation moreover fig 39 shows the visualizations of the typical liquid velocity fields caused by the excitation ω g b 1 b 2 1 2 1 2 0 6 for the elliptical annular tank with bottom mounted baffle in which the porous effect parameter is fixed as λ 0 5 and the baffle lengths l b 1 b 2 0 3 0 7 are chosen fig 39 reveals that larger baffle length yields more evident effects on the velocity fields than the relatively smaller one this also confirms the viewpoint in fig 37 4 3 effects of position and length of the coaxial arc porous baffle the horizontal eccentric circular annular tank with coaxial arc porous baffle and the corresponding to its discretized schematic diagram of igabem are shown in figs 40 and 41 respectively in fig 40 r 1 r 2 and r present the exterior interior radii of walls and arc porous baffle respectively and θ is the opening angle of the porous baffle which also can represent the length of the baffle 137 nodes and 131 control points in two sub domains are adopted in the model of igabem in fig 42 the variation of the total nondimensional sloshing forces with the factor ρ a ω 2 π r 1 2 r 2 2 2 is plotted against ω g r 1 r 2 1 2 1 2 for several different opening angles of the porous baffle at r r 2 r 1 r 2 0 5 and the porous effect parameter λ 0 5 we note from fig 42 that the lengths of the arc porous baffle make negligible influence on the sloshing force the variation of the total nondimensional sloshing forces versus the dimensionless horizontal position of the porous baffle with λ 0 5 and θ π 2 is presented in fig 43 it is evident from fig 43 that the effect of the porous baffle s position could be neglected a computation with various porous effect parameters is made and results are illustrated in fig 44 for the total nondimensional sloshing force in surge with r r 2 r 1 r 2 0 5 and θ π 2 as shown in fig 44 unless the porous effect parameter is relatively small λ 0 1 the porous effect parameter has a little effect on the slosh force 4 4 effect of the number of the porous baffle the geometries of the horizontal eccentric circular annular tank and the arrangement of three top and bottom mounted porous baffles are shown in figs 45 and 46 respectively in which r 1 and r 2 are the exterior interior radii of walls θ orientates the location of the porous baffle and l is the length of the porous baffle the discretization models for the two structures are illustrated in figs 47 and 48 where there are 210 nodes including 195 control points the total nondimensional sloshing forces with the factor ρ a ω 2 π r 1 2 r 2 2 2 on the two systems vs the different lengths of porous baffles are presented in fig 49 a and b with θ π 4 and λ 0 5 it can be seen from the two figures that in general the sloshing forces for the case with three top mounted baffles are smaller than those with three bottom mounted baffles meanwhile fig 49 a also suggests that extending the length of the top mounted porous baffles close to the outer wall of the tank affects lower the sloshing force with the change of the baffle length fig 50 illustrates how the total nondimensional sloshing forces vary with the porous effect parameters of top and bottom mounted baffles at θ π 4 and l r 1 r 2 0 9 as it can be seen from fig 50 the porous effect parameter has the value about λ 0 3 can bring out the minimum values of the sloshing forces for the two cases which also means that an appropriate porous effect parameter can effectively suppress the sloshing force in addition fig 50 further shows that with decreasing the porous effect parameters of the top and bottom mounted baffles the first resonance sloshing frequencies decreases monotonously the visualizations of the typical liquid velocity fields for the two cases with selected porous baffle configurations with the porous effect parameter λ 0 3 0 7 as shown in fig 51 under the lateral excitations ω g r 1 r 2 1 2 1 2 0 8 can further demonstrate the viewpoint mentioned above fig 52 a and b also give the variation of the nondimensional surface elevation with different porous effect parameters of baffles for the two cases subject to the lateral excitation ω g r 1 r 2 1 2 1 2 0 8 from fig 52 a and b when the porous effect parameters decrease from 0 9 to 0 1 the liquid surface elevations decrease by nearly 50 in both cases meanwhile the case with the three bottom mounted baffles can evoke greater surface elevation than that with three top mounted baffles fig 53 further present the curves of the total nondimensional sloshing forces with the factor ρ a ω 2 π r 1 2 r 2 2 2 for the cases with one and three mounted porous baffles or without baffle in which the porous effect parameters together with the lengths of all the mentioned porous baffles are fixed at λ 0 5 and l r 1 r 2 0 5 it can be seen from the figure that the sloshing forces are reduced compared to those by a direct wave impact without the porous baffle and equipping with three top mounted porous baffles yields greater suppression of the lateral forces than that with three bottom mounted porous baffles meanwhile suppression effect of three bottom mounted porous baffles on the sloshing force is more significant than that of one bottom mounted porous baffle 5 conclusion in this paper based on the linearized potential theory the isogeometric boundary element igabem is firstly conducted to investigate liquid sloshing in the horizontal eccentric annular tanks with multiple porous baffles the proposed method can reduce one dimension within the framework of bem and the igabem for the analysis of liquid sloshing can exactly represent the geometry no matter how coarse discretize the studied boundary which then produces no geometrical errors the derivation process for this problem by using the proposed method is obtained in detail three configurations of baffles are taken into account such as the top mounted baffles bottom mounted baffles and arc baffles the results obtained by the proposed method are verified by comparing with the reported solutions or fem solutions estimated by ansys and higher numerical accuracy and stability are obtained the effects of tank s geometry liquid filling level and the baffle parameters with various lengths submergence depths number of baffles and porosities on the natural sloshing frequency wave surface elevation sloshing force and velocity field are investigated as to the natural frequency increasing the ratio of minor to major semi axes of horizontal elliptical annular tank results in decreases in liquid natural frequencies and with increasing the radius ratio of the horizontal circular annular tank the first natural frequency decreases monotonically while the natural frequencies of higher order modes increase nonlinearly meanwhile the first natural frequency firstly increases and then decreases gradually with the increase in liquid filling level of the horizontal circular annular tank while the higher natural frequencies show opposite trends moreover decreasing the porous effect parameter may decrease the resonance frequencies of liquid sloshing in various horizontal annular tanks as to the horizontal eccentric rectangular circular elliptical annular tank with top or bottom mounted baffles the effect of the baffles on sloshing response is most pronounced when the value of λ equals about 0 3 choosing a suitable porous effect parameter can effectively reduce the sloshing forces and baffles with relatively large length conduct significant suppression effects on sloshing force circular arc angle instead of right angle may slightly increase the sloshing force acting on the rectangular annular tank and for the case of horizontal eccentric circular annular tank with coaxial arc baffle the length and porous effect parameter of the arc porous baffle have little effects on the slosh force as to the horizontal eccentric circular annular tank with the arrangement of one or three bottom mounted and three top mounted porous baffles that the sloshing forces are reduced compared to those by a direct wave impact without the porous baffle and equipping with three top mounted porous baffles yields greater suppression of the lateral forces than that with one or three bottom mounted porous baffles although this study is carried out under some assumptions such as the incompressible irrotational inviscid flow and linearized free surface boundary condition it can be applied as an efficient approach to evaluate the characteristics of small waved sloshing within two dimensional tanks and aids to provide scientific guidance in

investigated the fiv of a flexible riser conveying unstable slug flow they reported that the vibration response mainly occurs in the curvature plane of the flexible riser and the maximum response amplitude occurs when the longest liquid slug passes through the riser the flexible riser takes the responsibility of safely conveying oil and gas from the wellhead on seabed to platform it is crucial to identify the potential dynamic response induced by the internal gas liquid flow although the siv of a catenary flexible riser has been experimentally investigated in our previous studies zhu et al 2018a 2018b the range of gas liquid ratio is limited and the space time variations of response amplitude and frequency are not fully analyzed this work aims to investigate the siv of a curved flexible

and the variation in liquid slug length the response displacement and flow regime are captured using the nonintrusive measurement with two high speed cameras based on the experimental results obtained by image post processing the vibration response pressure fluctuation and slug flow characteristics are analyzed in detail the organization of this paper is as follows section 2 describes the details of experimental set up and methods the experimental results are then discussed in section 3 finally several important conclusions are drawn 2 experimental details 2 1 experimental arrangement the experiments were carried out in a re circulating water flume at southwest petroleum university swpu described in zhu et al 2018a the test apparatus is mainly composed of a test loop fluid supplies and measurement and control devices the sketch of the experimental setup is depicted in fig 1 the flexible riser model is made of silica gel tube with an outer diameter of 6 0 mm and a wall thickness of 1 0 mm the length of the riser is 95 cm resulting in an aspect ratio of 158 3 the poisson ratio and the linear mass of the flexible riser are 0 48 and 0 0164 kg m respectively the riser model is deployed as the catenary configuration in a vertical curvature plane xoz plane where x is the horizontal direction and z is the vertical direction the origin of the coordinate is located at the riser base thus the configuration of the catenary riser is expressed as 1 z x 0 4521 cosh 2 212 x 1 as the riser is freely hanging in still air the mass ratio is 790 702 where the mass ratio is the ratio of the mass of the riser fully filled with water to the mass of displaced air due to its weight the initial axis tension of the riser is 0 03 n the main parameters are summarized in table 1 the water in the upstream tank was dyed black in order to distinguish the boundary of liquid slug clearly the detailed description of the gas liquid circulating system was provided in zhu et al 2018a as listed in table 2 five different gas liquid ratios ranging from 0 804 to 3 031 were achieved in the experiments by adjusting the opening of the control valves mounted on the air and water supply pipes the corresponding air flow rate ranges from 0 35 l min to 0 8 l min and the water flow rate is from 0 264 l min to 0 436 l min the mixture velocity v m is expressed as 2 v m q l q g a where q g and q l are the air and water flow rates respectively and a is the cross section area of the riser as shown in fig 1 d 33 black rings with width of 4 mm and center to center spacing of 28 mm were marked along the riser to provide specific monitored points two high speed cameras were employed to capture the vibration displacement of the riser as well as the internal slug flow properties one camera was placed underneath the water flume to track the out of plane displacements y direction which is perpendicular to the xoz plane of markings another one was arranged beside the water flume looking through the side view window to record the in plane response as well as the internal flow structure the two cameras were triggered simultaneously with a view window size of 2048 1088 pixels and a frame rate of 100 hz this non intrusive technique of high speed imaging method was successfully applied in our previous studies zhu et al 2016 2018a 2018b 2019 three pressure probes were mounted on the horizontal pipe the riser base and the top of riser respectively in order to monitor the pressure variation notated by p 1 p 2 and p 3 the measuring apparatuses were calibrated prior to the test and the data acquisition lasted 2min in each case after the two phase flow reaching a steady state each camera stored 12000 pictures arrayed in time series one can refer to the image post processing method described in detail in our previous work zhu et al 2018a as depicted in fig 2 the pixel calibration was performed by corresponding the height of each marking in the recorded images to its actual size of 4 mm after that the markings were recognized by matching the characteristics with the moment invariants then the coordinate system was defined in the recorded images the displacements were obtained by converting the translational pixels of each marking to the actual distances finally the time series of displacements were got through the image post processing the precision examination test of this nonintrusive measurement and image post processing method was carried out first as shown in fig 3 a known displacement was imposed on the flexible riser and then the riser was kept stationary the high speed cameras recorded the two images before and after the displacement after that the two images were applied in the image post processing table 3 compares the measured displacements with the given displacements the error for the majority of markings is below 5 the relatively large error occurs at the markings that have a much small displacement which is mainly determined by the image resolution generally this method has a good measurement accuracy 2 2 decay test decay tests were carried out to obtain the natural frequency of the flexible riser hanging in still air and the system damping ratio the riser fully filled with water was adopted in the decay test in the pluck tests an initial displacement was imposed on the in plane and out of plane of the riser respectively to minimize the impact between each other as depicted in fig 4 the in plane and out of plane responses of the riser were recorded by the two high speed cameras then the relative parameters were achieved by the fast fourier transform fft the damping ratio is 0 01774 and the first out of plane natural frequency is 1 609 hz while the first and second in plane natural frequencies are 3 163 hz and 6 379 hz respectively the out of plane natural frequency is also observed in the in plane spectrum in indicates that the out of plane response interferes the in plane response due to the nonlinear configuration of the riser it should be noted that the first in plane natural frequency in our previous decay test zhu et al 2018a was identified as 1 6097 hz rather than 3 163 hz instead of exerting initial displacement purely in the curvature plane or out of plane the initial displacement was given randomly in the previous work so that the out of plane natural frequency was amplified in the in plane spectrum and it was mistook as the first natural frequency in the curvature plane 2 3 modal analysis modal analysis was carried out using the finite element software ansys prior to the analysis of the experimental results fig 5 shows the first three out of plane and in plane vibration modes it is observed that the out of plane modes of the curved riser are similar to the modes of a straight riser while the in plane modes are totally different the first mode of the in plane response has a node due to the catenary configuration it is easy to mistake the first mode as the second one 3 results and discussion compared to the in plane response the out of plane response is much less and could be neglected zhu et al 2018a thus only the in plane response is discussed in this paper 3 1 equilibrium position and axial deformation due to the gravity and centrifugal force exerted on the riser by the internal slug flow the flexible riser experiences a certain axial deformation and reaches a new equilibrium position in each case fig 6 plots the equilibrium position of the flexible riser at different gas liquid ratios where the black line represents the initial position the maximum axial deformation of 0 03373d occurs at q g q l 0 804 because of the maximum liquid holdup in the riser as the gas liquid ratio increases the axial deformation decreases gradually although an axial deformation is created by the slug flow the deformation is very small with axial drawing ratio less than 0 03 and hence the very little effect on the oscillating system therefore the variation of axial tension is very small 3 2 standard case analysis 3 2 1 vibration response the evolution of in plane response along the riser during 11s is depicted in fig 7 a there are no pure nodes along the span and the position of nodes vary over time indicating the unstable response and multi mode competition it is mainly attributed to the unstable slug flow in the flexible riser the vibration sometimes presents the first mode response while sometimes it shifts to the second one as the mode switching depicted in fig 7 b it is noted that the mode switching is in sync for the two directions in the curvature plane implying the response in the horizontal and vertical directions are interdependent to each other fig 8 a plots the root mean square amplitude along the length where the root mean square amplitude a rms is calculated as 3 a rms 1 n i 1 n a i 2 where a i is the instantaneous amplitude at the moment i and n is the total number of samples for statistical analysis n 12000 as 12000 images were recorded by a high speed camera in this work it is clearly seen that the in plane response is dominated by the first mode although it unsteadily switches between the first mode and the second one it can be seen from the amplitude distribution that the horizontal response a x d is larger in the upper part of the riser while the vertical response a z d is larger in the lower part because of the catenary configuration the positive horizontal displacement in the upper part leads to the upward movement of the lower part and vice versa as multiple frequencies take part in the response fig 8 b displays the modal weight of vibration amplitude decomposed by frequency bands for the two representative markings and the corresponding pressure fluctuation of monitoring points the first row in fig 8 b shows the time histories of amplitudes decomposed by five frequency bands for the crest marking 11 and trough marking 23 of horizontal response the second row depicts the decomposed amplitudes associated with the vertical response pressure fluctuation and its spectra are plotted in the third row it is clearly observed that both the maximum response in the x and z directions are mainly contributed by the oscillation in the frequency range of 3 3 76 hz in which the first natural frequency falls consequently the in plane response is dominated by the first mode in contrast the trough response is mainly composed of the amplitude in the range of 3 3 76 hz and that in the range of 5 28 6 hz where the second natural frequency belongs to it indicates that the mode transition occurs at the trough apart from the two high frequency bands the amplitudes in another three small frequency bands also contribute to the in plane response nevertheless the contribution is much less than that from higher frequencies it is interesting to find the fluctuation frequencies of monitored pressure 0 65 hz 1 29 hz and 1 95 hz are just the median values of the three small frequency bands observed in the vibration response it implies the pressure fluctuation of the two phase flow affects the siv fig 9 depicts the variation of response frequency at representative markings along the flexible riser at q g q l 2 136 illustrating the multi modal characteristics the response energy concentrates at 3 163 hz for the majority part of riser expect the marking 23 in the horizontal direction and the marking 19 in the vertical direction which are corresponding to the trough in the two directions it further confirms the response is dominated by the first mode the distribution of frequency is more dispersed at the trough with a broad band indicating the mode transition additionally the three smaller frequencies of the monitored pressure are also observed in the response although the response energy is relatively low the frequencies more or less fluctuate over time implying the intermittent participation in the vibration process this oscillation characteristic is associated with the instability of the internal slug flow fig 10 depicts the flow induced vibration characteristics along the riser at q g q l 2 136 the first column shows the distribution of response frequency along the riser the second column illustrates the space time varying amplitude contours over 3s the third column presents the time histories of the amplitudes along the two directions and the phase difference between them at eight representative markings the last column depicts the response trajectories of the selected markings as shown in fig 10 a and fig 10 c the spanwise evolution of the response frequency reflects the energy distribution along the riser which is closely related to the dominant mode the response energy mainly concentrates at the first natural frequency for the majority part of the riser except for the vibration node and the two ends although the nonzero nodes in fig 8 a indicate the occurrence of travelling wave the in plane response is dominated by the standing wave as seen in fig 10 b and fig 10 d unlike the trajectories of viv the in plane vibration trajectories mainly present a line shape figure or an ellipse shape figure as the dominant frequencies in the two directions are the same the 180 π phase difference leads to the line shape orbits of 7 11 15 26 and 31 markings while 225 5π 4 phase difference results in the ellipse shape trajectories of 3 19 and 23 markings in addition the instability of slug flow contributes to the oscillating amplitudes and hence the unstable orbits 3 2 2 flow characteristics fig 11 shows the vibration amplitude the movement of liquid slug and the instantaneous force exerted by the slugs at q g q l 2 136 the fluid force includes the gravity and centrifugal force generated by the liquid slugs when they pass through the curved riser the vibration amplitudes present an evident periodicity which is associated with the periodic appearance of the longest liquid slug l liquid max 18 67d fig 11 b c and d display the three processes of the longest liquid slug passing through the riser taking the time period from t 1 to t 5 for example the longest liquid slug flows into the test section at t 1 10 53s then it moves upward gradually as time goes on and reaches the top at t 5 11 13s it is noted that the larger amplitude occurs when the longest liquid slug appears in the flexible riser which is related to the fluid force exerted on the riser by the liquid slug as shown in fig 11 b the resultant force of gravity and centrifugal force of liquid slugs are decomposed to f x and f z along the x and z directions respectively note that the force exerted by the liquid slug depends not only on the location but also on its length the longer liquid slug usually creates the greater force as the longest liquid slug arrives at the riser base at t 1 the fluid force exerted by the existing slugs in the riser is relatively small resulting in the relatively weak response at this moment when the longest liquid slug completely enters the riser the fluid force is significantly increased leading to the increase of amplitude additionally because of the smaller curvature radius at the lower part of the curved riser the centrifugal force is relatively large at t 1 and t 3 contributing to the more vigorous response this process of slug migration and slug flow induced vibration is repeated in fig 11 c and fig 11 d 3 3 effect of different gas liquid ratio 3 3 1 vibration response fig 12 plots the spanwise evolution of the rms amplitude at different gas liquid ratios it is seen that the response becomes greater as the gas liquid ratio increases from 0 804 to 3 031 the maximum amplitudes grow 4 6 times and 3 9 times in the x and z directions respectively nevertheless the in plane response is still dominated by the first mode at the highest gas liquid ratio it is mainly attributed to the limited riser length and the gas liquid ratio the frequency spectra of the response of representative markings and the pressure fluctuation at three monitoring points p 1 p 2 and p 3 are depicted in fig 13 which presents the distinct multi modal properties the first three small frequencies are introduced by the pressure fluctuation of slug flow another two frequencies are mainly determined by the structural properties one of them is close to the first natural frequency while the other one is around the second natural frequency as the majority part of the riser oscillates with the peak frequency around f x f 1x 1 075 the response is dominated by the first mode nevertheless the dominant frequency of marking 23 corresponding to the response trough shifts from f x f 1x 1 074 at q g q l 1 618 to f x f 2x 0 992 at q g q l 2 136 illustrating the mode switching the mode switching appears first in the trough where the response energy is relatively low indicating the mode competition leads to the dispersion of energy the fluctuation frequencies of the monitored pressure are also shown in the bottom of fig 13 it is interesting to find the oscillation frequencies take part in the pressure fluctuation illustrating that the response of riser in turn affects the characteristics of slug flow the similar frequency spectra is observed in the vertical direction and no more description here fig 14 compares the space time varying amplitude the corresponding frequency distribution and time histories of the amplitude at marking 11 where presents the peak amplitude along the riser it is clearly seen that the oscillation is enhanced as the gas liquid ratio increase accordingly the intermittent participation of frequency becomes more obvious and the frequency distribution is more dispersed it implies the mode switching and mode competition also appear in the response peak although the vibration energy is relatively concentrated additionally the frequencies introduced by the pressure fluctuation are weakened gradually as the gas liquid ratio increases due mainly to the transfer of response energy although the response is dominated by the standing wave as the gas liquid ratio increases the contribution of travelling wave increases gradually because of the multi mode response 3 3 2 flow characteristics fig 15 compares the mixture velocity of slug flow and the maximum liquid slug length at five different gas liquid ratios it is clearly seen that the longest liquid slug is shortened gradually as the gas liquid ratio increases from 0 804 to 3 031 coinciding with the previous experimental results zhu et al 2018a at q g q l 0 804 the volume fraction of gas entering the riser is relatively small providing favorable condition for the accumulation of liquid and hence the occurrence of longer liquid slugs more gas enters the riser with increasing of gas liquid ratio contributing to the increase of mixture velocity however the increase of mixture velocity is not conductive to the accumulation of liquid slug furthermore the increasing vibration response affects the internal slug flow the formation of liquid slug is disturbed by vigorous response and sometimes the liquid slugs are split into shorter ones consequently the long liquid slugs are harder to build up at higher gas liquid ratio the pressure fluctuation reflects the characteristics of the two phase flow in the riser to some extent as shown in fig 16 the time averaged pressures at three monitored points are reduced with increasing of gas liquid ratio nevertheless the rms pressure is increased and the growth rate at the riser top presents the maximum one while the rising rate in the upstream of the riser possesses the minimum one as depicted in fig 16 c it indicates that the vibration response of the riser brings about the disturbance to the slug flow and hence the enhancement of pressure oscillation therefore the variation of pressure fluctuation further confirms the fluid structure interaction between the flexible riser and the internal slug flow as plotted in fig 16 d the pressure difference in the horizontal section δ p 1 p 1 p 2 increases with the increase of gas liquid ratio while the pressure difference in the riser section δ p 2 p 2 p 3 decreases gradually the increase of gas liquid ratio leads to the growth of mixture velocity as in fig 15 consequently the friction loss is increased contributing to the growth of pressure difference in the upstream horizontal section in contrast the length of liquid slug in the riser is reduced as the gas liquid increases the reduction of the liquid holdup in the riser gives rise to the decrease of the liquid column pressure which overcomes the pressure difference caused by friction loss thus the variation of pressure difference in the riser section shows the converse trend 4 conclusions a series of experiments has been carried out in an air water test loop to investigate the slug flow induced vibration of a freely hanging flexible riser the vibration response and the flow structure in the riser are simultaneously recorded by high speed cameras the experimental results including the time histories of displacement transient mode time frequency distribution frequency spectra and flow characteristics are presented and discussed major findings are summarized as follows 1 the internal slug flow induced vibration mainly occurs in the curvature plane of the flexible riser although the in plane response is dominated by the first mode in the considered gas liquid ratio range multiple frequencies take part in the vibration three small frequencies of them coincide with the pressure fluctuation of slug flow indicating the effect of the internal two phase flow the other two frequencies correspond to the first and second natural frequencies at q g q l 2 136 the response switches unsteadily between the two modes by contrast the mode switching occurs first at the trough of the in plane response as the gas liquid ratio increases where the frequency distribution is more widely spread 2 the fluid force exerted on the riser by the liquid slugs includes the gravity and the centrifugal force therefore large response amplitude occurs when the longest liquid slug passes through the flexible riser furthermore due to the smaller curvature radius at the lower part of the riser more vigorous response occurs as the liquid slug appears there 3 the vibration response is enhanced as the gas liquid ratio increases however the intermittent participation of frequency becomes more obvious and the frequency distribution is more dispersed the oscillation frequencies are also observed in the pressure fluctuation demonstrating the response in turn affects the flow characteristics nevertheless the frequencies introduced by the pressure fluctuation are weakened with increasing of gas liquid ratio additionally more gas enters the riser contributing to the increase of mixture velocity the formation of liquid slug is disturbed by vigorous response so that the longest liquid slug is shortened as the gas liquid ratio increases further extensive work is still needed to uncover the underlying physics of slug flow characteristics and slug flow induced vibration for a longer flexible riser under a broader range of gas liquid ratio acknowledgements the research work was supported by national natural science foundation of china no 51979238 sichuan youth science and technology

through the side view window to record the in plane response as well as the internal flow structure the two cameras were triggered simultaneously with a view window size of 2048 1088 pixels and a frame rate of 100 hz this non intrusive technique of high speed imaging method was successfully applied in our previous studies zhu et al 2016 2018a 2018b 2019 three pressure probes were mounted on the horizontal pipe the riser base and the top of riser respectively in order to monitor the pressure variation notated by p 1 p 2 and p 3 the measuring apparatuses were calibrated prior to the test and the data acquisition lasted 2min in each case after the two phase flow reaching a steady state each camera stored 12000 pictures arrayed in time series one can refer to the image post processing method described in detail in our previous work zhu et al 2018a as depicted in fig 2 the pixel calibration was performed by corresponding the height of each marking in the recorded images to its actual size of 4 mm after that the markings were recognized by matching the characteristics with the moment invariants then the coordinate system was defined in the recorded images the displacements were obtained by converting the translational pixels of each marking to the actual distances finally the time series of displacements were got through the image post processing the precision examination test of this nonintrusive measurement and image post processing method was carried out first as shown in fig 3 a known displacement was imposed on the flexible riser and then the riser was kept stationary the high speed cameras recorded the two images before and after the displacement after that the two images were applied in the image post processing table 3 compares the measured displacements with the given displacements the error for the majority of markings is below 5 the relatively large error occurs at the markings that have a much small displacement which is mainly determined by the image resolution generally this method has a good measurement accuracy 2 2 decay test decay tests were carried out to obtain the natural frequency of the flexible riser hanging in still air and the system damping ratio the riser fully filled with water was adopted in the decay test in the pluck tests an initial displacement was imposed on the in plane and out of plane of the riser respectively to minimize the impact between each other as depicted in fig 4 the in plane and out of plane responses of the riser were recorded by the two high speed cameras then the relative parameters were achieved by the fast fourier transform fft the damping ratio is 0 01774 and the first out of plane natural frequency is 1 609 hz while the first and second in plane natural frequencies are 3 163 hz and 6 379 hz respectively the out of plane natural frequency is also observed in the in plane spectrum in indicates that the out of plane response interferes the in plane response due to the nonlinear configuration of the riser it should be noted that the first in plane natural frequency in our previous decay test zhu et al 2018a was identified as 1 6097 hz rather than 3 163 hz instead of exerting initial displacement purely in the curvature plane or out of plane the initial displacement was given randomly in the previous work so that the out of plane natural frequency was amplified in the in plane spectrum and it was mistook as the first natural frequency in the curvature plane 2 3 modal analysis modal analysis was carried out using the finite element software ansys prior to the analysis of the experimental results fig 5 shows the first three out of plane and in plane vibration modes it is observed that the out of plane modes of the curved riser are similar to the modes of a straight riser while the in plane modes are totally different the first mode of the in plane response has a node due to the catenary configuration it is easy to mistake the first mode as the second one 3 results and discussion compared to the in plane response the out of plane response is much less and could be neglected zhu et al 2018a thus only the in plane response is discussed in this paper 3 1 equilibrium position and axial deformation due to the gravity and centrifugal force exerted on the riser by the internal slug flow the flexible riser experiences a certain axial deformation and reaches a new equilibrium position in each case fig 6 plots the equilibrium position of the flexible riser at different gas liquid ratios where the black line represents the initial position the maximum axial deformation of 0 03373d occurs at q g q l 0 804 because of the maximum liquid holdup in the riser as the gas liquid ratio increases the axial deformation decreases gradually although an axial deformation is created by the slug flow the deformation is very small with axial drawing ratio less than 0 03 and hence the very little effect on the oscillating system therefore the variation of axial tension is very small 3 2 standard case analysis 3 2 1 vibration response the evolution of in plane response along the riser during 11s is depicted in fig 7 a there are no pure nodes along the span and the position of nodes vary over time indicating the unstable response and multi mode competition it is mainly attributed to the unstable slug flow in the flexible riser the vibration sometimes presents the first mode response while sometimes it shifts to the second one as the mode switching depicted in fig 7 b it is noted that the mode switching is in sync for the two directions in the curvature plane implying the response in the horizontal and vertical directions are interdependent to each other fig 8 a plots the root mean square amplitude along the length where the root mean square amplitude a rms is calculated as 3 a rms 1 n i 1 n a i 2 where a i is the instantaneous amplitude at the moment i and n is the total number of samples for statistical analysis n 12000 as 12000 images were recorded by a high speed camera in this work it is clearly seen that the in plane response is dominated by the first mode although it unsteadily switches between the first mode and the second one it can be seen from the amplitude distribution that the horizontal response a x d is larger in the upper part of the riser while the vertical response a z d is larger in the lower part because of the catenary configuration the positive horizontal displacement in the upper part leads to the upward movement of the lower part and vice versa as multiple frequencies take part in the response fig 8 b displays the modal weight of vibration amplitude decomposed by frequency bands for the two representative markings and the corresponding pressure fluctuation of monitoring points the first row in fig 8 b shows the time histories of amplitudes decomposed by five frequency bands for the crest marking 11 and trough marking 23 of horizontal response the second row depicts the decomposed amplitudes associated with the vertical response pressure fluctuation and its spectra are plotted in the third row it is clearly observed that both the maximum response in the x and z directions are mainly contributed by the oscillation in the frequency range of 3 3 76 hz in which the first natural frequency falls consequently the in plane response is dominated by the first mode in contrast the trough response is mainly composed of the amplitude in the range of 3 3 76 hz and that in the range of 5 28 6 hz where the second natural frequency belongs to it indicates that the mode transition occurs at the trough apart from the two high frequency bands the amplitudes in another three small frequency bands also contribute to the in plane response nevertheless the contribution is much less than that from higher frequencies it is interesting to find the fluctuation frequencies of monitored pressure 0 65 hz 1 29 hz and 1 95 hz are just the median values of the three small frequency bands observed in the vibration response it implies the pressure fluctuation of the two phase flow affects the siv fig 9 depicts the variation of response frequency at representative markings along the flexible riser at q g q l 2 136 illustrating the multi modal characteristics the response energy concentrates at 3 163 hz for the majority part of riser expect the marking 23 in the horizontal direction and the marking 19 in the vertical direction which are corresponding to the trough in the two directions it further confirms the response is dominated by the first mode the distribution of frequency is more dispersed at the trough with a broad band indicating the mode transition additionally the three smaller frequencies of the monitored pressure are also observed in the response although the response energy is relatively low the frequencies more or less fluctuate over time implying the intermittent participation in the vibration process this oscillation characteristic is associated with the instability of the internal slug flow fig 10 depicts the flow induced vibration characteristics along the riser at q g q l 2 136 the first column shows the distribution of response frequency along the riser the second column illustrates the space time varying amplitude contours over 3s the third column presents the time histories of the amplitudes along the two directions and the phase difference between them at eight representative markings the last column depicts the response trajectories of the selected markings as shown in fig 10 a and fig 10 c the spanwise evolution of the response frequency reflects the energy distribution along the riser which is closely related to the dominant mode the response energy mainly concentrates at the first natural frequency for the majority part of the riser except for the vibration node and the two ends although the nonzero nodes in fig 8 a indicate the occurrence of travelling wave the in plane response is dominated by the standing wave as seen in fig 10 b and fig 10 d unlike the trajectories of viv the in plane vibration trajectories mainly present a line shape figure or an ellipse shape figure as the dominant frequencies in the two directions are the same the 180 π phase difference leads to the line shape orbits of 7 11 15 26 and 31 markings while 225 5π 4 phase difference results in the ellipse shape trajectories of 3 19 and 23 markings in addition the instability of slug flow contributes to the oscillating amplitudes and hence the unstable orbits 3 2 2 flow characteristics fig 11 shows the vibration amplitude the movement of liquid slug and the instantaneous force exerted by the slugs at q g q l 2 136 the fluid force includes the gravity and centrifugal force generated by the liquid slugs when they pass through the curved riser the vibration amplitudes present an evident periodicity which is associated with the periodic appearance of the longest liquid slug l liquid max 18 67d fig 11 b c and d display the three processes of the longest liquid slug passing through the riser taking the time period from t 1 to t 5 for example the longest liquid slug flows into the test section at t 1 10 53s then it moves upward gradually as time goes on and reaches the top at t 5 11 13s it is noted that the larger amplitude occurs when the longest liquid slug appears in the flexible riser which is related to the fluid force exerted on the riser by the liquid slug as shown in fig 11 b the resultant force of gravity and centrifugal force of liquid slugs are decomposed to f x and f z along the x and z directions respectively note that the force exerted by the liquid slug depends not only on the location but also on its length the longer liquid slug usually creates the greater force as the longest liquid slug arrives at the riser base at t 1 the fluid force exerted by the existing slugs in the riser is relatively small resulting in the relatively weak response at this moment when the longest liquid slug completely enters the riser the fluid force is significantly increased leading to the increase of amplitude additionally because of the smaller curvature radius at the lower part of the curved riser the centrifugal force is relatively large at t 1 and t 3 contributing to the more vigorous response this process of slug migration and slug flow induced vibration is repeated in fig 11 c and fig 11 d 3 3 effect of different gas liquid ratio 3 3 1 vibration response fig 12 plots the spanwise evolution of the rms amplitude at different gas liquid ratios it is seen that the response becomes greater as the gas liquid ratio increases from 0 804 to 3 031 the maximum amplitudes grow 4 6 times and 3 9 times in the x and z directions respectively nevertheless the in plane response is still dominated by the first mode at the highest gas liquid ratio it is mainly attributed to the limited riser length and the gas liquid ratio the frequency spectra of the response of representative markings and the pressure fluctuation at three monitoring points p 1 p 2 and p 3 are depicted in fig 13 which presents the distinct multi modal properties the first three small frequencies are introduced by the pressure fluctuation of slug flow another two frequencies are mainly determined by the structural properties one of them is close to the first natural frequency while the other one is around the second natural frequency as the majority part of the riser oscillates with the peak frequency around f x f 1x 1 075 the response is dominated by the first mode nevertheless the dominant frequency of marking 23 corresponding to the response trough shifts from f x f 1x 1 074 at q g q l 1 618 to f x f 2x 0 992 at q g q l 2 136 illustrating the mode switching the mode switching appears first in the trough where the response energy is relatively low indicating the mode competition leads to the dispersion of energy the fluctuation frequencies of the monitored pressure are also shown in the bottom of fig 13 it is interesting to find the oscillation frequencies take part in the pressure fluctuation illustrating that the response of riser in turn affects the characteristics of slug flow the similar frequency spectra is observed in the vertical direction and no more description here fig 14 compares the space time varying amplitude the corresponding frequency distribution and time histories of the amplitude at marking 11 where presents the peak amplitude along the riser it is clearly seen that the oscillation is enhanced as the gas liquid ratio increase accordingly the intermittent participation of frequency becomes more obvious and the frequency distribution is more dispersed it implies the mode switching and mode competition also appear in the response peak although the vibration energy is relatively concentrated additionally the frequencies introduced by the pressure fluctuation are weakened gradually as the gas liquid ratio increases due mainly to the transfer of response energy although the response is dominated by the standing wave as the gas liquid ratio increases the contribution of travelling wave increases gradually because of the multi mode response 3 3 2 flow characteristics fig 15 compares the mixture velocity of slug flow and the maximum liquid slug length at five different gas liquid ratios it is clearly seen that the longest liquid slug is shortened gradually as the gas liquid ratio increases from 0 804 to 3 031 coinciding with the previous experimental results zhu et al 2018a at q g q l 0 804 the volume fraction of gas entering the riser is relatively small providing favorable condition for the accumulation of liquid and hence the occurrence of longer liquid slugs more gas enters the riser with increasing of gas liquid ratio contributing to the increase of mixture velocity however the increase of mixture velocity is not conductive to the accumulation of liquid slug furthermore the increasing vibration response affects the internal slug flow the formation of liquid slug is disturbed by vigorous response and sometimes the liquid slugs are split into shorter ones consequently the long liquid slugs are harder to build up at higher gas liquid ratio the pressure fluctuation reflects the characteristics of the two phase flow in the riser to some extent as shown in fig 16 the time averaged pressures at three monitored points are reduced with increasing of gas liquid ratio nevertheless the rms pressure is increased and the growth rate at the riser top presents the maximum one while the rising rate in the upstream of the riser possesses the minimum one as depicted in fig 16 c it indicates that the vibration response of the riser brings about the disturbance to the slug flow and hence the enhancement of pressure oscillation therefore the variation of pressure fluctuation further confirms the fluid structure interaction between the flexible riser and the internal slug flow as plotted in fig 16 d the pressure difference in the horizontal section δ p 1 p 1 p 2 increases with the increase of gas liquid ratio while the pressure difference in the riser section δ p 2 p 2 p 3 decreases gradually the increase of gas liquid ratio leads to the growth of mixture velocity as in fig 15 consequently the friction loss is increased contributing to the growth of pressure difference in the upstream horizontal section in contrast the length of liquid slug in the riser is reduced as the gas liquid increases the reduction of the liquid holdup in the riser gives rise to the decrease of the liquid column pressure which overcomes the pressure difference caused by friction loss thus the variation of pressure difference in the riser section shows the converse trend 4 conclusions a series of experiments has been carried out in an air water test loop to investigate the slug flow induced vibration of a freely hanging flexible riser the vibration response and the flow structure in the riser are simultaneously recorded by high speed cameras the experimental results including the time histories of displacement transient mode time frequency distribution frequency spectra and flow characteristics are presented and discussed major findings are summarized as follows 1 the internal slug flow induced vibration mainly occurs in the curvature plane of the flexible riser although the in plane response is dominated by the first mode in the considered gas liquid ratio range multiple frequencies take part in the vibration three small frequencies of them coincide with the pressure fluctuation of slug flow indicating the effect of the internal two phase flow the other two frequencies correspond to the first and second natural frequencies at q g q l 2 136 the response switches unsteadily between the two modes by contrast the mode switching occurs first at the trough of the in plane response as the gas liquid ratio increases where the frequency distribution is more widely spread 2 the fluid force exerted on the riser by the liquid slugs includes the gravity and the centrifugal force therefore large response amplitude occurs when the longest liquid slug passes through the flexible riser furthermore due to the smaller curvature radius at the lower part of the riser more vigorous response occurs as the liquid slug appears there 3 the vibration response is enhanced as the gas liquid ratio increases however the intermittent participation of frequency becomes more obvious and the frequency distribution is more dispersed the oscillation frequencies are also observed in the pressure fluctuation demonstrating the response in turn affects the flow characteristics nevertheless the frequencies introduced by the pressure fluctuation are weakened with increasing of gas liquid ratio additionally more gas enters the riser contributing to the increase of mixture velocity the formation of liquid slug is disturbed by vigorous response so that the longest liquid slug is shortened as the gas liquid ratio increases further extensive work is still needed to uncover the underlying physics of slug flow characteristics and slug flow induced vibration for a longer flexible riser under a broader range of gas liquid ratio acknowledgements the research work was supported by national natural science foundation of china no 51979238 sichuan youth science and technology
