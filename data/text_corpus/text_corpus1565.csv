7825,study region southeastern brazil with emphasis on the jaguari river basin the main tributary of the cantareira system study focus we examined the basin hydroclimate variability especially along the historical meteorological droughts between 2013 and 2021 and the hydrologic response to negative disturbances in rainfall field and satellite measurements of rainfall flow soil moisture and water storage were used to assess the hydroclimate variability and to validate the hydrological model our hypothesis is that a good model performance on these validated variables improve our confidence in the representation of aquifer storage and recharge we also estimated the long term elasticity of flow to precipitation using the entire analysis period 27 years and compared to the elasticity in along the serial droughts from 2017 to 2021 new hydrological insights for the region results show that the serial meteorological droughts were very likely unprecedented in the last 70 years leading to hydrologic impacts over regional scale we estimated a decrease of 6 4 mm y 1 in the soil moisture and a reduction of 26 in the aquifer recharge in the last 5 years of serial droughts in the same period the elasticity of flow to precipitation was 3 1 which greatly exceeded the long term value of 2 0 this greater hydrologic sensitivity in the elasticity may represent that the resilience of the surface hydrologic system was transiently lost graphical abstract ga1 keywords drought resilience water supply hydrologic modeling data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction water availability is a key and limiting factor to attend the increasing demand for food and energy in the future d odorico et al 2018 although brazil has 18 of all global freshwater resources this water is highly concentrated in the amazon basin and other regions in the country often more densely populated are very vulnerable to drought these conditions are likely to become more critical in the near future as the population grows he et al 2021 and because of the potential effects of climate change magrin et al 2014 regional scale hydrologic droughts generally stem from a large scale meteorological drought vicente serrano and lópez moreno 2005 barker et al 2016 huang et al 2017 but their regional characteristics depend on the conditions and properties of the hydrologic system which depend on aquifers soil surface cover and local climate van loon and laaha 2015 as a response to meteorological drought the recovery of surface water availability indicates the resilience of the hydrologic system which can be determined by observing the preservation of parameters such as the mean flow minimum flow and statistical characteristics of the rainfall runoff response pandey and ramasastri 2001 geris et al 2015 reported that the system resilience and its rapid recovery from drought in a microbasin in scotland stemmed from very wet conditions prior to the drought and the soil propensity histosol to remain wet alternatively creed et al 2014 explored the concept of hydrologic resilience using the budyko model and considered a basin as resilient when interannual variabilities in the dryness index di result in predicted changes in the evaporative index ei according to the theoretical budyko curve thus resilience is lost when the di ei pair diverges from the theoretical curve a series of meteorological droughts has occurred in brazil in the last 20 years in various regions including the amazon in 2005 2010 and 2016 the pantanal in 2020 marengo et al 2021 and other regions where water supply substantially decreased for domestic and industrial consumption as in brasília during 2016 2017 cunha et al 2018 the southeastern region in 2013 2014 otto et al 2016 and the northeastern region in 2012 2016 azevedo et al 2018 in southeast brazil precipitation decreased by 44 during the historical drought in 2013 2014 coelho et al 2016 that marked a historical record in the last 70 years to date this situation affected 80 million people in a socioeconomically important region tundisi and tundisi 2015 and was aggravated by record high summer temperatures that increased water consumption milano et al 2018 nobre et al 2016 the water reservoirs of the cantareira system in the southeast region supply above nine million people only in são paulo city exemplifying the region s high vulnerability to drought deusdará leal et al 2020 water shortages occurred in the megacity of são paulo leading to restrictive measures such as reduced pressure in the supply network reduced consumption in exchange for discounts in the water bill use of the lake s technical reservation and emergency construction of water diversion systems from neighboring basins deusdará leal et al 2020 millington 2018 in these reservoirs coutinho et al 2015 found that the volume of stored water balances out under different regimes one of which is very dry and presents hysteretic behavior making it difficult to manage strategies for promoting a return to normal conditions this regime of dry equilibrium may be triggered by events of meteorological droughts or even critical patterns of climate change in the future as assessed for jaguari river basin domingues et al 2022 sone et al 2022 gesualdo et al 2019 the main tributary of cantareira system although some authors nobre et al 2016 otto et al 2016 have already investigated the meteorological component of the drought in the cantareira reservoir system in 2013 2014 its hydrologic development during and after the drought integrating recent field and remote sensing measurements and hydrologic modeling has not yet been examined furthermore to the best of our knowledge no previous study was carried out assessing the resilience of cantareira system or its tributaries to maintain their surface water availability under drought events in this study we aimed to comprehensively determine the hydrologic response of jaguari river basin to the 2013 2014 major meteorological drought and subsequent moderate serial droughts and to discuss an apparent resilience loss of the basin in generating baseflow during this extended dry period this study also integrates a suite of field and observational based data to validate flow evapotranspiration and soil moisture calculated with the hydrological model the hypothesis is that a good model performance in these variables improve our confidence in other hydrologic simulated fluxes difficult to validate such as the aquifer recharge 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the cantareira system is a set of reservoirs tunnels and canals that store and transport water from parts of the piracicaba river basin to the alto tietê basin kelman 2015 supplying approximately nine million inhabitants whately and cunha 2007 in the são paulo metropolitan region in southeastern brazil the headwaters lie on the border between the states of são paulo and minas gerais fig 1a near the mantiqueira mountains the system is composed of reservoirs in the jaguari jacareí cachoeira and atibainha rivers in the piracicaba river basin and in the juqueri river in the upper tietê basin the jaguari river basin covers 1027 km2 which is the largest area among the other basins of cantareira system ana and daee 2013 it corresponds to 45 3 of the total drainage area whately and cunha 2007 and is relatively well monitored hydroclimatologically the jaguari and jacareí reservoirs are interconnected and provide the system s greatest inflow with an average contribution of 25 2 m3s 1 ana and daee 2013 we used the station f 25b sabesp as the outlet to the jaguari river basin fig 1a which corresponds to 94 of the jaguari reservoir area and shows an average flow of 18 6 m3s 1 this station is downstream of the confluence of the camanducaia and jaguari rivers at an altitude of approximately 1000 m below the headwaters 2 2 hydroclimate variability the changes in the average minimum flow from 2016 to 2020 with respect to that during 1990 2012 of the station f 25b were assessed in order to evaluate the hydrologic variability on a regional scale we used daily flow data measured by the department of water and energy departamento de águas e energia elétrica daee in sub basins of the piracicaba river selecting stations at which measurements were performed from the 1990 s and in the last five years 2017 2021 for a minimum of 20 years it was selected the stations 3d 009 and 4d 001 at jaguari river 4d 009 3d 003 and 3d 006 at atibaia river 3d 001 and 3d 002 at camanducaia river 4d 007 at piracicaba river and 4d 021 at corumbataí river we used the standardized precipitation index spi vicente serrano et al 2010 and historical time series of monthly mean rainfall in the hydrologic area to examine the interannual variability of precipitation in the jaguari river basin rainfall dataset was fitted to a gamma distribution and standardized in order to have a distribution of mean of zero and standard deviation of unit mckee et al 1993 based on the classification of mckee et al 1993 spi ranges from 1 to 1 5 for moderately wet conditions is 1 5 for very wet conditions and 2 for extremely wet conditions analogously spi ranges from 1 to 1 5 for moderately dry conditions is 1 5 for very dry conditions and 2 for extremely dry conditions likewise the standardized streamflow index ssi de jesus et al 2020 was used for streamflow in the same area following the same steps than spi in this work both spi and ssi time series were computed with a time scale of 12 months 2 3 remote sensing assessment of evapotranspiration and water storage the mascon solution watkins et al 2015 was used to estimate the terrestrial water storage tws using data from the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace mission satellites and their follow up grace follow on grace fo by jet propulsion laboratory rl06m v 2 0 wiese et al 2019 these data are available at a spatial resolution of 0 5 0 5 the data present a high coastline resolution wiese et al 2016 and have been corrected by applying multiplicative gain factors derived from the community land model version 4 0 the average series was estimated based on grid cells within the box between latitudes 23 and 22 5 s and between longitudes 46 5 and 45 5 w green box in fig 1a the monthly data of tws anomalies was used to estimate changes in water storage ds dt in mm month 1 as the difference between two consecutive measurements divided by the time between measurements 1 ds dt s t s t s t 1 t where s is the terrestrial water storage anomaly in mm and t and t 1 are temporal indices in the interval t for a reference estimate of et we used the terrestrial water balance method with direct observational field and satellite measurements 2 et p r s t where p is the observed average precipitation in the basin r is the observed flow in the basin outflow and s t is the variation in water storage derived from grace all values are expressed in mm month 1 for consecutive measurements of s t in different months we performed linear interpolation of the anomalies to ensure temporal consistency finally the series was smoothed with a moving average using a 3 month window although grace satellite measurements are best suited for application in basins larger than 200 000 km2 rodell and famiglietti 1999 some researchers have applied these measurements in smaller areas such as in the studies by neves et al 2020 and rahimzadegan and entezari 2019 who used the satellite measurements in areas covering 9600 and 5000 km2 respectively additionally the water storage anomalies presented by the grace satellites did not skew the estimates as they are null when summed together for the evaluation period 2 4 hydrological modeling we used the soil and water assessment tool swat a semi distributed continuous time model that represents hydrologic processes on the scale of small to large basins at daily time steps gassman et al 2007 swat has been extensively used worldwide with nearly 4000 publications tan et al 2020 only in brazil between 1999 and 2015 bressiani et al 2015 found 102 studies carried out using different swat versions with an overall good performance in flow calibration more recently a review of tan et al 2020 describes that swat performance on extreme cases was in most cases reported to be satisfactory the model assumes the contribution area divided into sub basins according to the topography that in turn are divided into hydrologic response units hru or areas with common slope soil and vegetation cover characteristics the water balance within each hru is calculated with processes in the vadose zone and for groundwater namely infiltration surface runoff lateral flow baseflow transpiration soil evaporation canopy interception shallow aquifer recharge and losses in the deep aquifer runoff from the hrus are aggregated and propagated into the drainage network as detailed by neitsch et al 2011 strauch and volk 2013 reported that the leaf area index lai is not properly calculated by swat in the southern hemisphere compared to the version used in this study we modified the tool to accurately estimate lai under the geographic conditions and seasonal range observed in the study area assuming the stationarity of the long term mean lai 3 lai i j blai j b lai j alai min j 0 5 sin 5 5 π π i 182 1 1 1 where blai and alai min correspond to the maximum and minimum lai values respectively determined from typical observations in the study area in m2m 2 and the i and j indices refer to the day of the year and vegetation cover respectively first reported by mota da silva 2013 blai was determined to be 5 2 and 2 5 m2m 2 and alai min was determined to be 4 5 and 1 m2m 2 for forests and grasslands respectively we used the arcswat 2012 10 2 18 extension via arcgis 10 2 2 to set up and configure the boundary conditions and used swat version 2012 rev 591 to run the simulations the types of vegetation cover and soil were prescribed according to the field studies of instituto brasileiro de geografia e estatística ibge 2015 and ufv cetec ufla feam 2010 respectively fig 1b c the physical properties of soil were prescribed using regional soil characteristics based on pontes et al 2016 the climate data required for model forcing maximum and minimum air temperature relative humidity incident solar radiation and wind speed were obtained from era interim reanalysis dee et al 2011 at the nearest grid points fig 1d between 1990 and 2020 as these data were discontinued at the end of august 2019 the last months of the time series were filled with data from era5 hersbach et al 2020 and by interpolation to the era interim grid points for consistency finally we used observed precipitation data from available stations various sources national waters agency agência nacional de águas ana basic sanitation company of the state of são paulo companhia de saneamento básico do estado de são paulo sabesp national center for monitoring and early warning of natural disasters centro nacional de monitoramento e alertas de desastres naturais national institute of meteorology instituto nacional de meteorologia and agronomic institute of campinas instituto agronômico de campinas after a careful review these stations were daily interpolated by inverse distance weighting pebesma 2004 generating a regular grid with a resolution of 10 km fig 1d for precipitation in 2021 not used to force swat model we used the average monthly data available from sabesp 2021 2 4 1 runoff the total runoff in swat is a contribution of overland lateral and groundwater flows overland flow was computed using the modified soil conservation service curve number method regarding the groundwater flow it is reported to be one of the main weaknesses of swat as it presents a simplified groundwater concept nguyen and dietrich 2018 which would directly impact the simulated low flows for the same area domingues et al 2022 proposed a previous calibration in the soil parameters to improve the representation of low flows by maximizing the model s seepage we reproduced the same configuration as in domingues et al 2022 setting the saturated hydraulic conductivity bulk density and available water capacity at 65 mm h 1 0 9 mg m 3 and 0 13 respectively for the eight 25 cm layers and both soil types except for the first layer where the available water capacity was 0 1 observed flow data was provided by gauge station f 25b this station is the closest to the site of the jaguari dam in the jaguari jacareí reservoir of the cantareira system with mostly complete data during 1995 2020 a visual inspection procedure removed gross errors in the series which along with previous missing data account to only 0 6 of the entire period 2 4 2 evapotranspiration the evapotranspiration was calculated as the sum of transpiration and evaporation from soil and canopy terms these processes are independently estimated in the model so that the sum in each time step could not surpass the potential evapotranspiration calculated according with penman monteith equation for simplicity we neglected the canopy evaporation from et estimation by keeping the canopy maximum storage null as default in the model we made some adjustments in specific control parameters soil moisture retention at top layer maximum stomatal conductance and rooting depth to improve the model partition between transpiration and soil evaporation along with the changes in the lai seasonality as described in eq 3 for further details the reader is referred to domingues et al 2022 we used the et estimated by the terrestrial water balance twb to validate our calculations with swat both with the common period of 2003 2016 2 4 3 soil moisture soil moisture was calculated in swat by the discrete determination of moisture in eight vertical layers of the vadose zone and heterogeneously represented as hundreds of hydrologic sub units along the area the physical parameters for each layer were prescribed homogeneously but differed for each specified soil type for a comparison with the model we utilized the product level 4 surface and root zone soil moisture analysis update data l4 sm from the soil moisture active passive smap satellite reichle et al 2020 the l4 sm data was produced using a customized version of nasa s goddard earth observing system geos 5 model which assimilates the surface brightness temperature in the l band of smap it also integrates the soil moisture profile from the surface to the depth of impermeable rock and has a spatial resolution of 9 km and a temporal resolution of 3 h we used 24 grid cells comprising the jaguari basin area green box in fig 1a for further comparisons with the model we used soil moisture measurements from the field with 11 vertical profile probes pr2 delta t cambridge uk and at six depth levels 10 20 30 40 60 and 100 cm throughout the ribeirão das posses basin shown in fig 1b which provides water to the jaguari river chitolina et al 2022 measurements were performed in grassland areas brachiaria decumbens which are dominant in the study area and the sensors were calibrated according to silva et al 2021 the measurements were reduced in the form of two average series by layers of depth one integrated the depth data at 10 20 and 30 cm referred to as shallow soil and the other integrated the depth data at 40 60 and 100 cm referred to as intermediate soil comparing soil moisture using different methods requires some caution because of the different hypothetical specificities and scale of space in the expression of moisture content to prioritize temporal variability we used the soil wetness index swi t for each estimate at time t as follows 4 swi t θ θ wp θ fc θ wp θ θ min θ max θ min where θ is the volumetric moisture content of the soil and θ wp θ fc θ max and θ min refer to the moisture contents at the permanent wilting point at field capacity and at absolute maximum and minimum respectively the denominator in eq 4 represents the water holding capacity 2 4 4 calibration and validation the model was calibrated with respect to the flow at the outlet for 2003 2017 when there was greater interannual variability in the flow rate compared to that during the interval used for validation 1995 2002 we applied a 5 year warm up range for both calibration 1998 2002 and validation 1990 1994 periods initially we prescribed parameters based on the literature mota da silva 2013 pontes et al 2016 rafee et al 2019 and used the particle swarm optimization algorithm abbaspour 2015 to evaluate the most sensitive parameters next we performed a second more refined step using the swatplusr package schürz 2019 in r r core team 2013 we adopted latin hypercube sampling and produced 10 000 sets with 15 fixed parameters see table 1 in supplementary materials and defined ranges of variation for calibration selected in the previous step the flows determined by swat were stored for each set and were evaluated using a goodness of fit index in hydrology a wide spread goodness of fit index is the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse index 5 nse 1 i 1 n q obs i q sim i 2 i 1 n q obs i q obs 2 where q obs q sim and q obs correspond to the observed simulated and average observed flow rates respectively throughout the interval between i and n however some previous works have already pointed out that nse index should be avoided e g domingues et al 2022 althoff and rodrigues 2021 krause et al 2005 as it is reported to be oversensitive to peak flows due essentially to the squared difference between observed and predicted flows we thus applied the log nse index intending to weigh the different flow ranges of the hydrograph more uniformly than the conventional nse 6 log nse 1 i 1 n ln q obs i ln q sim i 2 i 1 n ln q obs i ln q obs 2 we stress that using the log nse index rather than nse implies different sets of optimized parameters the differences in simulated flow for each set are shown in fig s1 2 4 5 uncertainty assessment the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation glue method beven and binley 1992 was used to assess the parameter uncertainty of flow simulation the analysis was performed on the calibration period similarly to tegegne et al 2019 the simulated flows derived from the 10 000 parameter sets were assessed according to a likelihood function l θ and a defined threshold value then the parameter sets with the likelihood function values below the threshold were removed and the n remaining cases are defined as behavioral parameter sets in this work we used the nse index as the likelihood function and a threshold value of 0 7 second a likelihood weight w i was estimated for each behavioral set as 7 w i l θ i k 1 n l θ k we then set the 2 5 and 97 5 levels of the flow cumulative distribution computed as weighted quantiles with hmisc package harrel 2022 as the lower and upper bounds of the prediction uncertainty often referred to 95 prediction uncertainty 95ppu at last it is estimated the percentage of observations covered by 95ppu p factor and the relative width of 95ppu r factor as 8 p 1 t t 1 t z t z t 1 if q obs t q 2 5 t q 97 5 t 0 otherwise 9 r 1 t t 1 t q 97 5 t q 2 5 t σ obs where t is the simulation time step t is the total number of time steps q obs t is the observed flow at time step t q 97 5 t and q 2 5 t are the upper and lower bounds of the prediction uncertainty at time step t respectively and σ obs is the standard deviation of the observed flow according to wu et al 2021 a good uncertainty analysis should bracket most of the observed data with the smallest possible uncertainty band which means maximizing the ratio p r 2 5 non parametric tests we applied the non parametric test of pettitt 1979 to detect change points in the time series of the station f 25b with trend package pohlert 2020 the null hypothesis of no change is tested and if rejected it is assumed the alternative hypothesis which also identifies the location of the probable change point mann kendall test mann 1945 kendall 1975 is used to analyze consistently monotonic trends in a given variable collected over time the kendall rank correlation coefficient or simply kendall s τ is initially calculated this coefficient measures the similarity between two variables independently ranked by their quantities the coefficient signal shows whether the trend is positive or negative with respect to time we used the kendall package mcleod 2022 in r to calculate τ and verify whether the value is significantly two sided p value different from the null hypothesis of τ 0 if p value 0 05 we accept the alternative hypothesis that a trend is present in the data 3 results 3 1 interannual climate variability and abrupt flow response from the very wet conditions of rainfall during 2009 2010 fig 2a when the volume of the jaguari reservoir reached overflow thresholds spi oscillated around neutral for the next 3 years and abruptly reached extremely dry conditions in 2013 2014 these conditions marked the major meteorological drought which is considered as a historical event in the last 75 years otto et al 2016 coelho et al 2016 this drought was followed by 2 years of wet and very wet conditions in 2015 2016 thereafter spi was dominantly negative from 2017 to 2021 with some peaks at 1 5 changing from initially moderately dry conditions to moderately or very dry conditions by the end of the period some expressive events with spi peaks close to 1 5 occurred in this historical series e g the event in 2000 2001 when there was a hydroelectricity crisis in southeastern brazil hunt et al 2018 and briefly in 2004 for the standardized streamflow index ssi we observed flow variability in succeeding notable events which began in 2013 with a long interval of serial droughts and negative ssi peaking in 2014 with extremely dry conditions 3 and continuous droughts under moderately dry to very dry conditions from 2017 onwards fig 2b analyzing with details the daily flow at station f25 b id3 in fig 3a we detected an abrupt change in the observed series on june 15 2011 vertical dashed line in fig 3b according to pettitt s test p value 2 10 16 since the 2014 drought a different pattern emerged after 2016 with reductions in both annual maximum and minimum peak flows fig 3b measurements of the minimum flow in the last 7 years were often close to that of the historical 2014 drought with small differences of 0 6 m3s 1 in later years the minimum flow reached the lowest values of the series since 1990 the absolute minimum was 2 6 m3s 1 in september 2021 and 3 0 m3s 1 in 2020 which were both below the minimum of 3 2 m3s 1 in 2014 fig 3b this downward variability of minimum flow at station id3 was also noted at other stations fig 3c shows trends as decreasing minimum flow as of 2016 at id stations 3 7 8 and 10 which exhibited patterns very similar to each other these stations are on the right bank of the jaguari and piracicaba rivers and did not present any damming effects of the cantareira lakes at these stations the estimated trend between 2016 and 2020 ranged from 0 25 to 0 5 m3s 1 per year a downward trend in flow was also observed at most other stations although the absence of damming effects was not true for these all stations showed a drop in minimum flow between 2016 and 2020 red boxes in fig 3a as a percentage drop this reduction was more pronounced at the jaguari and camanducaia river stations id 1 2 3 7 and 8 from 40 to 64 and at the middle and lower courses of the atibaia river id 4 5 and 6 between 10 and 21 fig 3a in the corumbataí river id 10 which is west of the basin the reduction was relatively modest at 6 finally the piracicaba river id 9 downstream of all other stations showed a pronounced decrease of 37 a likely integrated effect of upstream response the results suggest that the hydrologic effects on the jaguari river were controlled by precipitation at a larger regional scale variability rather than processes at such limited area of contribution however the hydrologic effects at the basin are about to be partly regulated by other factors such as local climate geology and surface vegetation that can contribute to the hydrological response to further examine the temporal dynamics of the hydrologic system and analyze its resilience against droughts we evaluated the patterns of covariant terms that affect the streamflow particularly the evapotranspiration soil moisture water storage and aquifer recharge 3 2 model performance we determined a detailed configuration of parameters and attempted to compare comprehensively the calculated terms of the water balance to observational data including streamflow evapotranspiration et and soil moisture by assessing these terms we envisaged to get an adequate representation of the hydrologic response to rainfall variability and in turn to have increasing chances to calculate reasonably other hydrologic fluxes that are difficult to compare to field data such as soil infiltration and aquifer recharge the model performance in simulating the flow in calibration validation and entire periods are shown in table 1 we found a good performance according to moriasi et al 2015 for all indexes and periods except for the percent bias at validation considered satisfactory in general the calculated flow represented the seasonality well and also particularly the interannual variations including the extreme in 2014 fig 4b the calculations slightly underestimated the peak flows especially over 50 m3s 1 which partially contributed to the negative bias however the calculations effectively represented well the minimum and average flow and the intermediate ranges above the average flow which is critical to investigate the events of droughts where the low flows are dominant with respect to the uncertainty in model parameters we found 351 behavioral parameter sets out of the 10 000 runs which originated the 95ppu in fig 4b we also calculated the p factor and r factor that were equal to 0 85 and 0 83 respectively abbaspour 2015 suggests threshold values of p factor and r factor of 0 7 and 1 respectively our p r ratio of 1 02 was comparable to wu et al 2021 best cases whose work tested different methods to assess uncertainty in parameter sets the calculated et and reference estimate from the terrestrial water balance were generally very similar fig 5a on averaging annual values the calculated et standard deviation was 2 62 0 17 mm d 1 and reference et was 2 65 0 39 mm d 1 in wet and dry seasons the calculated et was 3 2 0 8 and 1 4 0 4 mm d 1 respectively compared to the reference et of 3 3 1 0 and 1 5 0 6 mm d 1 respectively fig 5a on a monthly scale the calculated et showed a seasonal distribution that was very similar to the expected phase and extremes slightly overestimating the reference during the early rainy season october december and underestimating it during the rainy season and early dry season january june fig 5b these monthly differences were generally below 10 which was satisfactory given that the reference measurements are independent of the model calculations except for the precipitation term which showed an instrumental measurement uncertainty of approximately 10 moreira et al 2019 with a slightly higher variance than the calculated terms based on the long term monthly averages of the model and smap we observed patterns of seasonal variability showing good concordance fig 6a and correlation with the monthly historical time series r2 0 85 as indicated by the swi at the end of the rainy season in march both average estimates reached approximately 75 of the water holding capacity of each estimate the estimates also reached the annual minimum in september during the transition from the dry to rainy seasons there was one discrepancy between the estimates the model and smap gave water holding capacities of 33 and 15 respectively comparisons of the calculated soil moisture and field reference demonstrated excellent agreement in seasonal variability and in extreme values for shallow soil up to 30 cm in depth fig 6b mostly because of the common precipitation in both cases and the settings of physical parameters for soil with approximately the characteristics of basin soils at shallow depths in the field comparisons of the model for intermediate soil moisture 40 100 cm fig 6c revealed satisfactory results for the annual maximum and minimum values however there was some discrepancy in the maximum value estimates the water holding capacities according to the model and field measurements were approximately 70 and 55 respectively 3 3 estimating the water budget for 1996 2021 we analyzed the annual average water budget terms and their temporal variability in the jaguari river basin in a normal water year fig 7 october september of the indicated year over the entire interval the average precipitation p was 1500 mm y 1 the calculated et was 953 mm y 1 and the observed specific flow q was 581 mm y 1 therefore et and q accounted for 64 and 39 of the rainfall respectively fig 7 the interannual oscillations of q and et generally agree with the oscillations of p the annual time series for et fig 7b indicated a small variance which was relatively much smaller than those for p or q with a coefficient of variation of 5 confirming this apparent competition of oscillations between terms we observed a significant direct proportional relationship between q or et and annual p fig 8 based on this relationship we performed a simple calculation for the elasticity of q or et with respect to precipitation defined as the proportional variation of q or et divided by the proportional variation of p the p elasticity of et was 0 36 indicating that a 1 variation in annual rainfall results in a 0 36 variation in et thus et presents a low sensitivity relative to rainfall the p elasticity of q was estimated to be 2 0 demonstrating that a 1 variation in rainfall results in a 2 variation in flow and indicates high responsiveness the evaluation of several rivers worldwide with average flow rates above 500 mm y 1 and precipitation above 1500 mm y 1 showed that the p elasticity of q is generally 2 chiew et al 2006 brêda et al 2020 estimated the p elasticity of q of the major rivers in south america and found values of 1 5 2 5 for the paraná river basin and values 2 5 for drier regions thus the jaguari river basin may be a very sensitive hydrologic system for generating runoff in response to precipitation variability for the interannual variability of rainfall fig 7a we observed four notable events the first event occurred between 2008 and 2012 when rainfall was 2 15 above average peaking in 2009 the second event was the historical drought of 2014 when rainfall decreased dramatically to the minimum in the series with an anomaly of 430 mm y 1 or 29 below average on this occasion both q and et reached minimum values in the series q presented a deviation of 340 mm y 1 or 59 below average fig 7c and et presented a deviation of 98 mm y 1 or 10 below average fig 7b after this drought a third event occurred in 2016 with a substantial recovery of rainfall at 283 mm above average whereas flow only moderately recovered at 41 mm above average finally 2017 marked the beginning of a five year range under a persistent negative rainfall regime with slight to moderate negative variations between 0 2 and 16 y 1 or between 2 and 247 mm y 1 below average for this succession of events we compared the water budget from the cumulative components from 2012 to 2021 fig 9 during this interval q accumulated a deficit of 1504 mm equivalent to 2 6 fold its long term annual average and 1 5 fold the deficit of p in the same period the recovery of above average rainfall in 2015 and 2016 was evident in the cumulative precipitation anomaly whereas q accumulated deficits over approximately the last ten years fig 9 in the last five years dashed line in fig 9 precipitation presented a significant negative trend according to mann kendall test τ 0 83 p value 2 2 10 16 accumulating a deficit of 694 mm which corresponds to an average anomaly of 9 y 1 these changes generated a modest variation in et as a response decreasing by 19 mm or 2 y 1 on average however the decrease was significant for flow q τ 0 99 p value 2 2 10 16 with a cumulative deficit of 825 mm or 28 y 1 considering the cumulative deficit of rainfall and flow between 2017 and 2021 we made a simple calculation using the discrete differences in the range and the long term averages giving an approximate value of 3 1 for the p elasticity of q thus flow decreased by 3 1 in response to a 1 reduction in rainfall which shows an apparent elasticity that greatly exceeded the estimated long term value of 2 0 our simple estimate was based on information accounted for a relatively short range of data that was possibly long enough to detect a transient response of the system this apparent high elasticity is well above the interval of 2 0 considered as a typical threshold of variability according to chiew et al 2006 3 4 runoff coefficient and soil moisture changes we evaluated the annual average runoff coefficient rc q p fig 10 which showed a mean value of 39 throughout the interval and significant interannual variations similar to those of annual flow this estimate is comparable to the long term values estimated in regional inventories by ana and daee 2013 for the jaguari jacareí reservoirs 41 and for sub basins of the piracicaba river with values of 29 42 henriques 2019 as expected for rainy summers in a subtropical climate the runoff coefficient increases with precipitation highlighting extremes such as the high value of 50 in the very rainy year of 2010 and low value of 23 during the historical drought of 2014 in drier years the precipitation supply is not only lower but the efficiency of generating surface runoff is also lower as noted in the cumulative deficit of flow q a continuous period of negative deviations was defined in the interannual variability of rc in the last ten years of the series fig 10 this period began in 2012 just before the great drought of 2014 and did not show sufficient recovery in the wet year of 2016 the annual average evaporative index ei et p fig 10 was 64 and unlike et showed an inverse relationship with precipitation in interannual variability as expected for this climate wherein energy restrictions dominantly control et variability in the 2014 drought ei reached the maximum of 80 in the series and remained relatively stable around 69 during the five years after 2017 presenting values slightly above the long term average we analyzed the components of transpiration et and soil evaporation es in et to determine how et partitioning processes manifested at the interannual climate scale like et the annual average et and es varied proportionally with rainfall fig s2 a the et et and es et ratios remained nearly constant in the period fig s2 b the transpiration component et was more sensitive to rainfall variations than es the decrease in et and particularly in et in dry years reduced soil moisture extraction in the root layer which was compensated by the lower precipitation at this point it is uncertain whether the response of the soil moisture would increase decrease or present no significant anomalies to further examine this response we evaluated soil moisture patterns in dry events we evaluated soil moisture variability on regional and local scales with observed measurements and modeled estimates regional scale moisture between 2016 and 2020 showed significant downward trends for swi fig 11 which were apparent for both the annual maximum and minimum values and for both the swat τ 0 24 p value 0 0073 and smap τ 0 24 p value 0 0065 estimates from our calculated estimate the downward trend in soil moisture at a depth of 2 m was equivalent to 6 4 mm y 1 similarly soil moisture measured in the field at plot scale fig 12 between 2015 and 2020 showed significant declining trends the decline in moisture during dry years manifested in both the shallow τ 0 22 p value 0 016 and intermediate τ 0 39 p value 2 3 10 5 layers the grassland in the posses basin is managed well and has a root system that typically reaches a depth of 1 m silva et al 2021 explaining the trend detected in both layers the effects of soil moisture trends within the jaguari river basin fig 11 were the same at the hydrologic microscale fig 12 as evaluated using independent methods at the microscale the estimates can serve as a reference because they were directly measured helping to corroborate trends in regional estimates based on modeling at a larger scale in the context of the temporal variabilities in the water budget the downward trend in soil moisture in successive dry years suggests that the impact of reduced rainfall was greater than that of reduced soil water extraction by the roots this process is also partially explained by the positive anomalies of the annual mean ei and particularly its persistence during dry years ei is expected to increase with decreasing rainfall but a lower et in turn would decrease ei the effect of rainfall variations dominated the final result 3 5 total water storage changes and aquifer recharge to understand the impact of dry years on soil moisture and more comprehensively on the total water storage of the system we analyzed the variability in tws fig 13 the reference tws circles with black line in fig 13 generally increased in the first half of the time series from 2002 to 2012 it is marked by increasing annual peaks followed by an opposing and dominantly decreasing pattern in the following years until 2021 the interannual oscillations of tws showed a consistent pattern with rainfall there is a sharp drop during the 2014 2015 drought with an anomaly of approximately 300 mm and with recovery in 2016 2017 leading to an anomaly above 200 mm in the last five years tws progressively declined in line with the negative rainfall anomalies reaching the same anomaly of approximately 300 mm observed during the historical drought by the end of 2021 the water storage calculated by the model red line in fig 13 adequately represented the interannual variability of grace measurements and indicated seasonal variabilities with a high temporal resolution some years did not show good agreement in the minimum seasonal values but the simulated values were comparable to measurements in the most striking events of the series namely the 2014 drought and the last five years of the period the absolute values of the calculated and measured anomalies had an offset because of the limitations of the model which used a simplified groundwater flow scheme besides this there is an intrinsic difficulty of establishing volumes for storage compartments such as shallow aquifers and soils at different depths based on these 20 years of grace measurements the annual range has generally varied at 150 200 mm of water getirana 2016 assessed the tws anomaly in 16 large energy reservoirs in southeastern brazil which are regionally close to the jaguari river basin his analysis covered the period between april 2002 and january 2015 and found an average amplitude in tws of 200 mm which is comparable to our results in a study of the urucaia river aquifer in northeastern brazil the mean amplitude of tws was higher at 300 mm gonçalves et al 2020 this temporal pattern of tws supports the variability of the water budget terms particularly the decline in soil moisture over the last five years fig 11 at the end of the historical time series in september 2021 tws achieved the lowest level which was even lower than that during the great drought in 2014 according to the measured flow rate fig 3b throughout the analysis range the maximum variation of tws was 604 mm of water estimated using the difference between the peak in 2011 and minimum value in 2021 which is equivalent to 40 of the annual average precipitation we calculated shallow aquifer recharge using the hydrologic model estimated as the flow of water percolating from the bottom of the vadose zone into the shallow aquifer this is the compartment whose moisture status contributes to the calculated baseflow in the river the annual mean recharge was estimated as 108 36 mm y 1 comparable to regional scale estimates for southeastern brazil oliveira et al 2021 the interannual variation of recharge was similar to that of specific flow with the extremes of the series ranging from 35 to 170 mm y 1 and the maximum in 2010 and minimum in 2014 fig 14 the recharge decreased in 2014 with the maximum reduction of the series at 80 however the average reduction of 26 in the last dry years although minor contributed to the negative accumulation of tws during dry years 4 discussion observed records of precipitation and flow section 3 1 suggested that there was an immediate and strong effect on inflow to the jaguari reservoir resulting from the 2014 meteorological drought despite the inflow and the reservoir levels not shown recovery between 2015 and 2016 to increased rainfall it was soon affected by serial droughts with intensities ranging from moderately dry to very dry in fact as elucidated later in fig 9 the drought spanned 9 years from 2013 to 2021 and was unprecedented in the last 30 years but more presumably in the last 70 years if based on the rainfall records these results contrast with the findings of de freitas 2020 who did not find significant trends in streamflow of jaguari jacareí catchment in the period of 1976 2009 it was also remarkable that different sources of data tws and f 25b station figs 13 and 3b respectively had their historical minima in 2021 in the case of f 25b station even the minimum flow in 2020 was 6 9 lower than in the major 2014 drought whereas 2021 minimum flow was 17 9 lower than in 2014 sabesp 2022 estimated that without the water increments from other basins to alto tietê basin the cantareira system would have totally collapsed in november 2020 to better understand the processes and dynamics behind these droughts we strived to adjust the hydrologic model in multiple components section 3 2 the simulations using the calibrated model showed a good ability to represent the flow table 1 and fig 4 et fig 5 and soil moisture fig 6 in the study area additionally the 95ppu fig 4 on the uncertainty analysis covered most of the observed flow p factor 0 85 under relatively small width r factor 0 83 which indicates that choosing a different set of parameters of behavioral solutions would not produce substantial differences in the simulated flow ultimately these flows and variables highly covariate in the swat model the soil moisture status controls the calculation of the lateral runoff component of flow and also depends on the et depletion rate and soil properties that influence the infiltration and soil water retention these processes in turn influence deep drainage to the saturated zone where the water status controls the baseflow finally groundwater dependent flows largely determine streamflow during seasonal hydrologic recession requiring the model to be robust in simulations of droughts with different intensities in numerical studies of hydrologic sensitivity to climate krysanova et al 2018 flow simulation alone should not be used as an isolated criterion when evaluating the performance of simulations which prevents a good result of the flow calculation from arising due to large offsetting performance errors in other covariate variables we thus expect to have found a hydrological modeling configuration with a set of very good precedents to adequately represent the charge and discharge processes of the soil aquifer system another notable characteristic in our results was the response of the natural hydrologic system to the interannual variability of precipitation we observed a high apparent elasticity of the flow in relation to rainfall in the last 5 years 3 1 that was well above the long term estimate 2 0 indeed santarosa et al 2022 showed that as cantareira overlies on crystalline aquifers the impacts on streamflow generation under reductions in rainfall can be drastic due to the short time water remains in the aquifer systems we assessed the apparent elasticity during a time with a progressive deficit in the cumulative flow and water anomalies of the system this elasticity can be conservatively interpreted as a transient sensitivity in response to drought a response to a continuous but time limited drying of the system or more broadly a low resilience against hydrologic recovery the resilience for flow recovery may have been transiently lost along the serial droughts providing conditions for greater hydrologic sensitivity than those in the past among the conditions associated with these changes the water storage status of the system decreased more specifically the soil moisture fig 11 and groundwater fig 13 significantly declined stemmed from high evapotranspiration fig 10 and less aquifer recharge fig 14 as a first hypothesis these apparent changes in resilience may have been triggered by the great drought in 2014 and then accentuated by the successive less intense droughts thus between 2013 and subsequent droughts the system may have recovered to a high hydrologic status in 2016 when the aquifer apparently recharged but this was insufficient to inhibit the changed response in subsequent years moreover as a second hypothesis an apparent loss of resilience may have occurred only in the last five years with limited effects in this time range under this second hypothesis the most critical hydrologic response occurred at the end and if compared to the 2014 drought the water storage of the system depleted to lower levels and showed slightly less low flow even though the mean annual flow was higher in both interpretations the role of the water storage in the system appeared to be closely related to the dynamics of the hydrologic response our estimates of the water balance attempted to adequately reproduce the flows and storages of the water budget which performed reasonably well against various references even though we did not use complex groundwater flow models 5 conclusions we described a regional hydroclimate variability characterized by serial meteorological droughts at the jaguari river basin in southeastern brazil with unprecedented patterns in the observational records over the last 70 years our analysis also revealed anomalous changes in the hydrologic response using a thorough validated hydrological model the major meteorological and hydrological droughts in 2014 were extremely dry events according to spi and ssi indexes marked by reductions of 29 and 59 in rainfall and streamflow respectively likewise serial meteorological and hydrological droughts with moderately to very dry conditions occurred between 2017 and 2021 when precipitation and flow showed deficits at mean rates of 9 and 28 y 1 respectively at last it was examined whether a breakdown occurred in the resilience of surface and groundwater hydrologic systems and how it could have affected the ability to maintain key hydrological processes that control baseflow we estimated a decrease of 6 4 mm y 1 in the soil moisture and a reduction of 26 in the aquifer recharge within the range of serial droughts which helped to clarify the outstanding depletion of about 250 mm observed at the entire terrestrial water storage we ended up noting that the resilience may have been transiently lost as the flow along the serial droughts decreased by 3 1 in contrast to 2 for long term conditions in response to 1 reduction in rainfall it emphasizes the great hydrologic sensitivity of the system along the criticality of the event besides the overall good performance of the hydrologic model in representing flows and storages of the water budget not using a more complex groundwater flow model is a limitation of our estimates future works would explore groundwater models to determine the spatial variability in the characteristics of aquifer retention and conductivity as well as the gains and losses of the system calculated by transport explicitly described in the saturated zone furthermore as we examined a current phenomenon future studies are obviously needed to evaluate both the manifestation of meteorological and hydrologic variability in near future years as well as in other basins around the region for instance we believe that guandu river basin which supplies water to the dense population of rio de janeiro city would be another feasible study case to test our hypotheses finally because we examined a socioeconomically strategic region with an increasing growth trend and particularly population densification in medium and large cities our results can add to a broader hydrologic risk management context credit authorship contribution statement l m domingues conceptualization

7825,study region southeastern brazil with emphasis on the jaguari river basin the main tributary of the cantareira system study focus we examined the basin hydroclimate variability especially along the historical meteorological droughts between 2013 and 2021 and the hydrologic response to negative disturbances in rainfall field and satellite measurements of rainfall flow soil moisture and water storage were used to assess the hydroclimate variability and to validate the hydrological model our hypothesis is that a good model performance on these validated variables improve our confidence in the representation of aquifer storage and recharge we also estimated the long term elasticity of flow to precipitation using the entire analysis period 27 years and compared to the elasticity in along the serial droughts from 2017 to 2021 new hydrological insights for the region results show that the serial meteorological droughts were very likely unprecedented in the last 70 years leading to hydrologic impacts over regional scale we estimated a decrease of 6 4 mm y 1 in the soil moisture and a reduction of 26 in the aquifer recharge in the last 5 years of serial droughts in the same period the elasticity of flow to precipitation was 3 1 which greatly exceeded the long term value of 2 0 this greater hydrologic sensitivity in the elasticity may represent that the resilience of the surface hydrologic system was transiently lost graphical abstract ga1 keywords drought resilience water supply hydrologic modeling data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction water availability is a key and limiting factor to attend the increasing demand for food and energy in the future d odorico et al 2018 although brazil has 18 of all global freshwater resources this water is highly concentrated in the amazon basin and other regions in the country often more densely populated are very vulnerable to drought these conditions are likely to become more critical in the near future as the population grows he et al 2021 and because of the potential effects of climate change magrin et al 2014 regional scale hydrologic droughts generally stem from a large scale meteorological drought vicente serrano and lópez moreno 2005 barker et al 2016 huang et al 2017 but their regional characteristics depend on the conditions and properties of the hydrologic system which depend on aquifers soil surface cover and local climate van loon and laaha 2015 as a response to meteorological drought the recovery of surface water availability indicates the resilience of the hydrologic system which can be determined by observing the preservation of parameters such as the mean flow minimum flow and statistical characteristics of the rainfall runoff response pandey and ramasastri 2001 geris et al 2015 reported that the system resilience and its rapid recovery from drought in a microbasin in scotland stemmed from very wet conditions prior to the drought and the soil propensity histosol to remain wet alternatively creed et al 2014 explored the concept of hydrologic resilience using the budyko model and considered a basin as resilient when interannual variabilities in the dryness index di result in predicted changes in the evaporative index ei according to the theoretical budyko curve thus resilience is lost when the di ei pair diverges from the theoretical curve a series of meteorological droughts has occurred in brazil in the last 20 years in various regions including the amazon in 2005 2010 and 2016 the pantanal in 2020 marengo et al 2021 and other regions where water supply substantially decreased for domestic and industrial consumption as in brasília during 2016 2017 cunha et al 2018 the southeastern region in 2013 2014 otto et al 2016 and the northeastern region in 2012 2016 azevedo et al 2018 in southeast brazil precipitation decreased by 44 during the historical drought in 2013 2014 coelho et al 2016 that marked a historical record in the last 70 years to date this situation affected 80 million people in a socioeconomically important region tundisi and tundisi 2015 and was aggravated by record high summer temperatures that increased water consumption milano et al 2018 nobre et al 2016 the water reservoirs of the cantareira system in the southeast region supply above nine million people only in são paulo city exemplifying the region s high vulnerability to drought deusdará leal et al 2020 water shortages occurred in the megacity of são paulo leading to restrictive measures such as reduced pressure in the supply network reduced consumption in exchange for discounts in the water bill use of the lake s technical reservation and emergency construction of water diversion systems from neighboring basins deusdará leal et al 2020 millington 2018 in these reservoirs coutinho et al 2015 found that the volume of stored water balances out under different regimes one of which is very dry and presents hysteretic behavior making it difficult to manage strategies for promoting a return to normal conditions this regime of dry equilibrium may be triggered by events of meteorological droughts or even critical patterns of climate change in the future as assessed for jaguari river basin domingues et al 2022 sone et al 2022 gesualdo et al 2019 the main tributary of cantareira system although some authors nobre et al 2016 otto et al 2016 have already investigated the meteorological component of the drought in the cantareira reservoir system in 2013 2014 its hydrologic development during and after the drought integrating recent field and remote sensing measurements and hydrologic modeling has not yet been examined furthermore to the best of our knowledge no previous study was carried out assessing the resilience of cantareira system or its tributaries to maintain their surface water availability under drought events in this study we aimed to comprehensively determine the hydrologic response of jaguari river basin to the 2013 2014 major meteorological drought and subsequent moderate serial droughts and to discuss an apparent resilience loss of the basin in generating baseflow during this extended dry period this study also integrates a suite of field and observational based data to validate flow evapotranspiration and soil moisture calculated with the hydrological model the hypothesis is that a good model performance in these variables improve our confidence in other hydrologic simulated fluxes difficult to validate such as the aquifer recharge 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the cantareira system is a set of reservoirs tunnels and canals that store and transport water from parts of the piracicaba river basin to the alto tietê basin kelman 2015 supplying approximately nine million inhabitants whately and cunha 2007 in the são paulo metropolitan region in southeastern brazil the headwaters lie on the border between the states of são paulo and minas gerais fig 1a near the mantiqueira mountains the system is composed of reservoirs in the jaguari jacareí cachoeira and atibainha rivers in the piracicaba river basin and in the juqueri river in the upper tietê basin the jaguari river basin covers 1027 km2 which is the largest area among the other basins of cantareira system ana and daee 2013 it corresponds to 45 3 of the total drainage area whately and cunha 2007 and is relatively well monitored hydroclimatologically the jaguari and jacareí reservoirs are interconnected and provide the system s greatest inflow with an average contribution of 25 2 m3s 1 ana and daee 2013 we used the station f 25b sabesp as the outlet to the jaguari river basin fig 1a which corresponds to 94 of the jaguari reservoir area and shows an average flow of 18 6 m3s 1 this station is downstream of the confluence of the camanducaia and jaguari rivers at an altitude of approximately 1000 m below the headwaters 2 2 hydroclimate variability the changes in the average minimum flow from 2016 to 2020 with respect to that during 1990 2012 of the station f 25b were assessed in order to evaluate the hydrologic variability on a regional scale we used daily flow data measured by the department of water and energy departamento de águas e energia elétrica daee in sub basins of the piracicaba river selecting stations at which measurements were performed from the 1990 s and in the last five years 2017 2021 for a minimum of 20 years it was selected the stations 3d 009 and 4d 001 at jaguari river 4d 009 3d 003 and 3d 006 at atibaia river 3d 001 and 3d 002 at camanducaia river 4d 007 at piracicaba river and 4d 021 at corumbataí river we used the standardized precipitation index spi vicente serrano et al 2010 and historical time series of monthly mean rainfall in the hydrologic area to examine the interannual variability of precipitation in the jaguari river basin rainfall dataset was fitted to a gamma distribution and standardized in order to have a distribution of mean of zero and standard deviation of unit mckee et al 1993 based on the classification of mckee et al 1993 spi ranges from 1 to 1 5 for moderately wet conditions is 1 5 for very wet conditions and 2 for extremely wet conditions analogously spi ranges from 1 to 1 5 for moderately dry conditions is 1 5 for very dry conditions and 2 for extremely dry conditions likewise the standardized streamflow index ssi de jesus et al 2020 was used for streamflow in the same area following the same steps than spi in this work both spi and ssi time series were computed with a time scale of 12 months 2 3 remote sensing assessment of evapotranspiration and water storage the mascon solution watkins et al 2015 was used to estimate the terrestrial water storage tws using data from the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace mission satellites and their follow up grace follow on grace fo by jet propulsion laboratory rl06m v 2 0 wiese et al 2019 these data are available at a spatial resolution of 0 5 0 5 the data present a high coastline resolution wiese et al 2016 and have been corrected by applying multiplicative gain factors derived from the community land model version 4 0 the average series was estimated based on grid cells within the box between latitudes 23 and 22 5 s and between longitudes 46 5 and 45 5 w green box in fig 1a the monthly data of tws anomalies was used to estimate changes in water storage ds dt in mm month 1 as the difference between two consecutive measurements divided by the time between measurements 1 ds dt s t s t s t 1 t where s is the terrestrial water storage anomaly in mm and t and t 1 are temporal indices in the interval t for a reference estimate of et we used the terrestrial water balance method with direct observational field and satellite measurements 2 et p r s t where p is the observed average precipitation in the basin r is the observed flow in the basin outflow and s t is the variation in water storage derived from grace all values are expressed in mm month 1 for consecutive measurements of s t in different months we performed linear interpolation of the anomalies to ensure temporal consistency finally the series was smoothed with a moving average using a 3 month window although grace satellite measurements are best suited for application in basins larger than 200 000 km2 rodell and famiglietti 1999 some researchers have applied these measurements in smaller areas such as in the studies by neves et al 2020 and rahimzadegan and entezari 2019 who used the satellite measurements in areas covering 9600 and 5000 km2 respectively additionally the water storage anomalies presented by the grace satellites did not skew the estimates as they are null when summed together for the evaluation period 2 4 hydrological modeling we used the soil and water assessment tool swat a semi distributed continuous time model that represents hydrologic processes on the scale of small to large basins at daily time steps gassman et al 2007 swat has been extensively used worldwide with nearly 4000 publications tan et al 2020 only in brazil between 1999 and 2015 bressiani et al 2015 found 102 studies carried out using different swat versions with an overall good performance in flow calibration more recently a review of tan et al 2020 describes that swat performance on extreme cases was in most cases reported to be satisfactory the model assumes the contribution area divided into sub basins according to the topography that in turn are divided into hydrologic response units hru or areas with common slope soil and vegetation cover characteristics the water balance within each hru is calculated with processes in the vadose zone and for groundwater namely infiltration surface runoff lateral flow baseflow transpiration soil evaporation canopy interception shallow aquifer recharge and losses in the deep aquifer runoff from the hrus are aggregated and propagated into the drainage network as detailed by neitsch et al 2011 strauch and volk 2013 reported that the leaf area index lai is not properly calculated by swat in the southern hemisphere compared to the version used in this study we modified the tool to accurately estimate lai under the geographic conditions and seasonal range observed in the study area assuming the stationarity of the long term mean lai 3 lai i j blai j b lai j alai min j 0 5 sin 5 5 π π i 182 1 1 1 where blai and alai min correspond to the maximum and minimum lai values respectively determined from typical observations in the study area in m2m 2 and the i and j indices refer to the day of the year and vegetation cover respectively first reported by mota da silva 2013 blai was determined to be 5 2 and 2 5 m2m 2 and alai min was determined to be 4 5 and 1 m2m 2 for forests and grasslands respectively we used the arcswat 2012 10 2 18 extension via arcgis 10 2 2 to set up and configure the boundary conditions and used swat version 2012 rev 591 to run the simulations the types of vegetation cover and soil were prescribed according to the field studies of instituto brasileiro de geografia e estatística ibge 2015 and ufv cetec ufla feam 2010 respectively fig 1b c the physical properties of soil were prescribed using regional soil characteristics based on pontes et al 2016 the climate data required for model forcing maximum and minimum air temperature relative humidity incident solar radiation and wind speed were obtained from era interim reanalysis dee et al 2011 at the nearest grid points fig 1d between 1990 and 2020 as these data were discontinued at the end of august 2019 the last months of the time series were filled with data from era5 hersbach et al 2020 and by interpolation to the era interim grid points for consistency finally we used observed precipitation data from available stations various sources national waters agency agência nacional de águas ana basic sanitation company of the state of são paulo companhia de saneamento básico do estado de são paulo sabesp national center for monitoring and early warning of natural disasters centro nacional de monitoramento e alertas de desastres naturais national institute of meteorology instituto nacional de meteorologia and agronomic institute of campinas instituto agronômico de campinas after a careful review these stations were daily interpolated by inverse distance weighting pebesma 2004 generating a regular grid with a resolution of 10 km fig 1d for precipitation in 2021 not used to force swat model we used the average monthly data available from sabesp 2021 2 4 1 runoff the total runoff in swat is a contribution of overland lateral and groundwater flows overland flow was computed using the modified soil conservation service curve number method regarding the groundwater flow it is reported to be one of the main weaknesses of swat as it presents a simplified groundwater concept nguyen and dietrich 2018 which would directly impact the simulated low flows for the same area domingues et al 2022 proposed a previous calibration in the soil parameters to improve the representation of low flows by maximizing the model s seepage we reproduced the same configuration as in domingues et al 2022 setting the saturated hydraulic conductivity bulk density and available water capacity at 65 mm h 1 0 9 mg m 3 and 0 13 respectively for the eight 25 cm layers and both soil types except for the first layer where the available water capacity was 0 1 observed flow data was provided by gauge station f 25b this station is the closest to the site of the jaguari dam in the jaguari jacareí reservoir of the cantareira system with mostly complete data during 1995 2020 a visual inspection procedure removed gross errors in the series which along with previous missing data account to only 0 6 of the entire period 2 4 2 evapotranspiration the evapotranspiration was calculated as the sum of transpiration and evaporation from soil and canopy terms these processes are independently estimated in the model so that the sum in each time step could not surpass the potential evapotranspiration calculated according with penman monteith equation for simplicity we neglected the canopy evaporation from et estimation by keeping the canopy maximum storage null as default in the model we made some adjustments in specific control parameters soil moisture retention at top layer maximum stomatal conductance and rooting depth to improve the model partition between transpiration and soil evaporation along with the changes in the lai seasonality as described in eq 3 for further details the reader is referred to domingues et al 2022 we used the et estimated by the terrestrial water balance twb to validate our calculations with swat both with the common period of 2003 2016 2 4 3 soil moisture soil moisture was calculated in swat by the discrete determination of moisture in eight vertical layers of the vadose zone and heterogeneously represented as hundreds of hydrologic sub units along the area the physical parameters for each layer were prescribed homogeneously but differed for each specified soil type for a comparison with the model we utilized the product level 4 surface and root zone soil moisture analysis update data l4 sm from the soil moisture active passive smap satellite reichle et al 2020 the l4 sm data was produced using a customized version of nasa s goddard earth observing system geos 5 model which assimilates the surface brightness temperature in the l band of smap it also integrates the soil moisture profile from the surface to the depth of impermeable rock and has a spatial resolution of 9 km and a temporal resolution of 3 h we used 24 grid cells comprising the jaguari basin area green box in fig 1a for further comparisons with the model we used soil moisture measurements from the field with 11 vertical profile probes pr2 delta t cambridge uk and at six depth levels 10 20 30 40 60 and 100 cm throughout the ribeirão das posses basin shown in fig 1b which provides water to the jaguari river chitolina et al 2022 measurements were performed in grassland areas brachiaria decumbens which are dominant in the study area and the sensors were calibrated according to silva et al 2021 the measurements were reduced in the form of two average series by layers of depth one integrated the depth data at 10 20 and 30 cm referred to as shallow soil and the other integrated the depth data at 40 60 and 100 cm referred to as intermediate soil comparing soil moisture using different methods requires some caution because of the different hypothetical specificities and scale of space in the expression of moisture content to prioritize temporal variability we used the soil wetness index swi t for each estimate at time t as follows 4 swi t θ θ wp θ fc θ wp θ θ min θ max θ min where θ is the volumetric moisture content of the soil and θ wp θ fc θ max and θ min refer to the moisture contents at the permanent wilting point at field capacity and at absolute maximum and minimum respectively the denominator in eq 4 represents the water holding capacity 2 4 4 calibration and validation the model was calibrated with respect to the flow at the outlet for 2003 2017 when there was greater interannual variability in the flow rate compared to that during the interval used for validation 1995 2002 we applied a 5 year warm up range for both calibration 1998 2002 and validation 1990 1994 periods initially we prescribed parameters based on the literature mota da silva 2013 pontes et al 2016 rafee et al 2019 and used the particle swarm optimization algorithm abbaspour 2015 to evaluate the most sensitive parameters next we performed a second more refined step using the swatplusr package schürz 2019 in r r core team 2013 we adopted latin hypercube sampling and produced 10 000 sets with 15 fixed parameters see table 1 in supplementary materials and defined ranges of variation for calibration selected in the previous step the flows determined by swat were stored for each set and were evaluated using a goodness of fit index in hydrology a wide spread goodness of fit index is the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse index 5 nse 1 i 1 n q obs i q sim i 2 i 1 n q obs i q obs 2 where q obs q sim and q obs correspond to the observed simulated and average observed flow rates respectively throughout the interval between i and n however some previous works have already pointed out that nse index should be avoided e g domingues et al 2022 althoff and rodrigues 2021 krause et al 2005 as it is reported to be oversensitive to peak flows due essentially to the squared difference between observed and predicted flows we thus applied the log nse index intending to weigh the different flow ranges of the hydrograph more uniformly than the conventional nse 6 log nse 1 i 1 n ln q obs i ln q sim i 2 i 1 n ln q obs i ln q obs 2 we stress that using the log nse index rather than nse implies different sets of optimized parameters the differences in simulated flow for each set are shown in fig s1 2 4 5 uncertainty assessment the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation glue method beven and binley 1992 was used to assess the parameter uncertainty of flow simulation the analysis was performed on the calibration period similarly to tegegne et al 2019 the simulated flows derived from the 10 000 parameter sets were assessed according to a likelihood function l θ and a defined threshold value then the parameter sets with the likelihood function values below the threshold were removed and the n remaining cases are defined as behavioral parameter sets in this work we used the nse index as the likelihood function and a threshold value of 0 7 second a likelihood weight w i was estimated for each behavioral set as 7 w i l θ i k 1 n l θ k we then set the 2 5 and 97 5 levels of the flow cumulative distribution computed as weighted quantiles with hmisc package harrel 2022 as the lower and upper bounds of the prediction uncertainty often referred to 95 prediction uncertainty 95ppu at last it is estimated the percentage of observations covered by 95ppu p factor and the relative width of 95ppu r factor as 8 p 1 t t 1 t z t z t 1 if q obs t q 2 5 t q 97 5 t 0 otherwise 9 r 1 t t 1 t q 97 5 t q 2 5 t σ obs where t is the simulation time step t is the total number of time steps q obs t is the observed flow at time step t q 97 5 t and q 2 5 t are the upper and lower bounds of the prediction uncertainty at time step t respectively and σ obs is the standard deviation of the observed flow according to wu et al 2021 a good uncertainty analysis should bracket most of the observed data with the smallest possible uncertainty band which means maximizing the ratio p r 2 5 non parametric tests we applied the non parametric test of pettitt 1979 to detect change points in the time series of the station f 25b with trend package pohlert 2020 the null hypothesis of no change is tested and if rejected it is assumed the alternative hypothesis which also identifies the location of the probable change point mann kendall test mann 1945 kendall 1975 is used to analyze consistently monotonic trends in a given variable collected over time the kendall rank correlation coefficient or simply kendall s τ is initially calculated this coefficient measures the similarity between two variables independently ranked by their quantities the coefficient signal shows whether the trend is positive or negative with respect to time we used the kendall package mcleod 2022 in r to calculate τ and verify whether the value is significantly two sided p value different from the null hypothesis of τ 0 if p value 0 05 we accept the alternative hypothesis that a trend is present in the data 3 results 3 1 interannual climate variability and abrupt flow response from the very wet conditions of rainfall during 2009 2010 fig 2a when the volume of the jaguari reservoir reached overflow thresholds spi oscillated around neutral for the next 3 years and abruptly reached extremely dry conditions in 2013 2014 these conditions marked the major meteorological drought which is considered as a historical event in the last 75 years otto et al 2016 coelho et al 2016 this drought was followed by 2 years of wet and very wet conditions in 2015 2016 thereafter spi was dominantly negative from 2017 to 2021 with some peaks at 1 5 changing from initially moderately dry conditions to moderately or very dry conditions by the end of the period some expressive events with spi peaks close to 1 5 occurred in this historical series e g the event in 2000 2001 when there was a hydroelectricity crisis in southeastern brazil hunt et al 2018 and briefly in 2004 for the standardized streamflow index ssi we observed flow variability in succeeding notable events which began in 2013 with a long interval of serial droughts and negative ssi peaking in 2014 with extremely dry conditions 3 and continuous droughts under moderately dry to very dry conditions from 2017 onwards fig 2b analyzing with details the daily flow at station f25 b id3 in fig 3a we detected an abrupt change in the observed series on june 15 2011 vertical dashed line in fig 3b according to pettitt s test p value 2 10 16 since the 2014 drought a different pattern emerged after 2016 with reductions in both annual maximum and minimum peak flows fig 3b measurements of the minimum flow in the last 7 years were often close to that of the historical 2014 drought with small differences of 0 6 m3s 1 in later years the minimum flow reached the lowest values of the series since 1990 the absolute minimum was 2 6 m3s 1 in september 2021 and 3 0 m3s 1 in 2020 which were both below the minimum of 3 2 m3s 1 in 2014 fig 3b this downward variability of minimum flow at station id3 was also noted at other stations fig 3c shows trends as decreasing minimum flow as of 2016 at id stations 3 7 8 and 10 which exhibited patterns very similar to each other these stations are on the right bank of the jaguari and piracicaba rivers and did not present any damming effects of the cantareira lakes at these stations the estimated trend between 2016 and 2020 ranged from 0 25 to 0 5 m3s 1 per year a downward trend in flow was also observed at most other stations although the absence of damming effects was not true for these all stations showed a drop in minimum flow between 2016 and 2020 red boxes in fig 3a as a percentage drop this reduction was more pronounced at the jaguari and camanducaia river stations id 1 2 3 7 and 8 from 40 to 64 and at the middle and lower courses of the atibaia river id 4 5 and 6 between 10 and 21 fig 3a in the corumbataí river id 10 which is west of the basin the reduction was relatively modest at 6 finally the piracicaba river id 9 downstream of all other stations showed a pronounced decrease of 37 a likely integrated effect of upstream response the results suggest that the hydrologic effects on the jaguari river were controlled by precipitation at a larger regional scale variability rather than processes at such limited area of contribution however the hydrologic effects at the basin are about to be partly regulated by other factors such as local climate geology and surface vegetation that can contribute to the hydrological response to further examine the temporal dynamics of the hydrologic system and analyze its resilience against droughts we evaluated the patterns of covariant terms that affect the streamflow particularly the evapotranspiration soil moisture water storage and aquifer recharge 3 2 model performance we determined a detailed configuration of parameters and attempted to compare comprehensively the calculated terms of the water balance to observational data including streamflow evapotranspiration et and soil moisture by assessing these terms we envisaged to get an adequate representation of the hydrologic response to rainfall variability and in turn to have increasing chances to calculate reasonably other hydrologic fluxes that are difficult to compare to field data such as soil infiltration and aquifer recharge the model performance in simulating the flow in calibration validation and entire periods are shown in table 1 we found a good performance according to moriasi et al 2015 for all indexes and periods except for the percent bias at validation considered satisfactory in general the calculated flow represented the seasonality well and also particularly the interannual variations including the extreme in 2014 fig 4b the calculations slightly underestimated the peak flows especially over 50 m3s 1 which partially contributed to the negative bias however the calculations effectively represented well the minimum and average flow and the intermediate ranges above the average flow which is critical to investigate the events of droughts where the low flows are dominant with respect to the uncertainty in model parameters we found 351 behavioral parameter sets out of the 10 000 runs which originated the 95ppu in fig 4b we also calculated the p factor and r factor that were equal to 0 85 and 0 83 respectively abbaspour 2015 suggests threshold values of p factor and r factor of 0 7 and 1 respectively our p r ratio of 1 02 was comparable to wu et al 2021 best cases whose work tested different methods to assess uncertainty in parameter sets the calculated et and reference estimate from the terrestrial water balance were generally very similar fig 5a on averaging annual values the calculated et standard deviation was 2 62 0 17 mm d 1 and reference et was 2 65 0 39 mm d 1 in wet and dry seasons the calculated et was 3 2 0 8 and 1 4 0 4 mm d 1 respectively compared to the reference et of 3 3 1 0 and 1 5 0 6 mm d 1 respectively fig 5a on a monthly scale the calculated et showed a seasonal distribution that was very similar to the expected phase and extremes slightly overestimating the reference during the early rainy season october december and underestimating it during the rainy season and early dry season january june fig 5b these monthly differences were generally below 10 which was satisfactory given that the reference measurements are independent of the model calculations except for the precipitation term which showed an instrumental measurement uncertainty of approximately 10 moreira et al 2019 with a slightly higher variance than the calculated terms based on the long term monthly averages of the model and smap we observed patterns of seasonal variability showing good concordance fig 6a and correlation with the monthly historical time series r2 0 85 as indicated by the swi at the end of the rainy season in march both average estimates reached approximately 75 of the water holding capacity of each estimate the estimates also reached the annual minimum in september during the transition from the dry to rainy seasons there was one discrepancy between the estimates the model and smap gave water holding capacities of 33 and 15 respectively comparisons of the calculated soil moisture and field reference demonstrated excellent agreement in seasonal variability and in extreme values for shallow soil up to 30 cm in depth fig 6b mostly because of the common precipitation in both cases and the settings of physical parameters for soil with approximately the characteristics of basin soils at shallow depths in the field comparisons of the model for intermediate soil moisture 40 100 cm fig 6c revealed satisfactory results for the annual maximum and minimum values however there was some discrepancy in the maximum value estimates the water holding capacities according to the model and field measurements were approximately 70 and 55 respectively 3 3 estimating the water budget for 1996 2021 we analyzed the annual average water budget terms and their temporal variability in the jaguari river basin in a normal water year fig 7 october september of the indicated year over the entire interval the average precipitation p was 1500 mm y 1 the calculated et was 953 mm y 1 and the observed specific flow q was 581 mm y 1 therefore et and q accounted for 64 and 39 of the rainfall respectively fig 7 the interannual oscillations of q and et generally agree with the oscillations of p the annual time series for et fig 7b indicated a small variance which was relatively much smaller than those for p or q with a coefficient of variation of 5 confirming this apparent competition of oscillations between terms we observed a significant direct proportional relationship between q or et and annual p fig 8 based on this relationship we performed a simple calculation for the elasticity of q or et with respect to precipitation defined as the proportional variation of q or et divided by the proportional variation of p the p elasticity of et was 0 36 indicating that a 1 variation in annual rainfall results in a 0 36 variation in et thus et presents a low sensitivity relative to rainfall the p elasticity of q was estimated to be 2 0 demonstrating that a 1 variation in rainfall results in a 2 variation in flow and indicates high responsiveness the evaluation of several rivers worldwide with average flow rates above 500 mm y 1 and precipitation above 1500 mm y 1 showed that the p elasticity of q is generally 2 chiew et al 2006 brêda et al 2020 estimated the p elasticity of q of the major rivers in south america and found values of 1 5 2 5 for the paraná river basin and values 2 5 for drier regions thus the jaguari river basin may be a very sensitive hydrologic system for generating runoff in response to precipitation variability for the interannual variability of rainfall fig 7a we observed four notable events the first event occurred between 2008 and 2012 when rainfall was 2 15 above average peaking in 2009 the second event was the historical drought of 2014 when rainfall decreased dramatically to the minimum in the series with an anomaly of 430 mm y 1 or 29 below average on this occasion both q and et reached minimum values in the series q presented a deviation of 340 mm y 1 or 59 below average fig 7c and et presented a deviation of 98 mm y 1 or 10 below average fig 7b after this drought a third event occurred in 2016 with a substantial recovery of rainfall at 283 mm above average whereas flow only moderately recovered at 41 mm above average finally 2017 marked the beginning of a five year range under a persistent negative rainfall regime with slight to moderate negative variations between 0 2 and 16 y 1 or between 2 and 247 mm y 1 below average for this succession of events we compared the water budget from the cumulative components from 2012 to 2021 fig 9 during this interval q accumulated a deficit of 1504 mm equivalent to 2 6 fold its long term annual average and 1 5 fold the deficit of p in the same period the recovery of above average rainfall in 2015 and 2016 was evident in the cumulative precipitation anomaly whereas q accumulated deficits over approximately the last ten years fig 9 in the last five years dashed line in fig 9 precipitation presented a significant negative trend according to mann kendall test τ 0 83 p value 2 2 10 16 accumulating a deficit of 694 mm which corresponds to an average anomaly of 9 y 1 these changes generated a modest variation in et as a response decreasing by 19 mm or 2 y 1 on average however the decrease was significant for flow q τ 0 99 p value 2 2 10 16 with a cumulative deficit of 825 mm or 28 y 1 considering the cumulative deficit of rainfall and flow between 2017 and 2021 we made a simple calculation using the discrete differences in the range and the long term averages giving an approximate value of 3 1 for the p elasticity of q thus flow decreased by 3 1 in response to a 1 reduction in rainfall which shows an apparent elasticity that greatly exceeded the estimated long term value of 2 0 our simple estimate was based on information accounted for a relatively short range of data that was possibly long enough to detect a transient response of the system this apparent high elasticity is well above the interval of 2 0 considered as a typical threshold of variability according to chiew et al 2006 3 4 runoff coefficient and soil moisture changes we evaluated the annual average runoff coefficient rc q p fig 10 which showed a mean value of 39 throughout the interval and significant interannual variations similar to those of annual flow this estimate is comparable to the long term values estimated in regional inventories by ana and daee 2013 for the jaguari jacareí reservoirs 41 and for sub basins of the piracicaba river with values of 29 42 henriques 2019 as expected for rainy summers in a subtropical climate the runoff coefficient increases with precipitation highlighting extremes such as the high value of 50 in the very rainy year of 2010 and low value of 23 during the historical drought of 2014 in drier years the precipitation supply is not only lower but the efficiency of generating surface runoff is also lower as noted in the cumulative deficit of flow q a continuous period of negative deviations was defined in the interannual variability of rc in the last ten years of the series fig 10 this period began in 2012 just before the great drought of 2014 and did not show sufficient recovery in the wet year of 2016 the annual average evaporative index ei et p fig 10 was 64 and unlike et showed an inverse relationship with precipitation in interannual variability as expected for this climate wherein energy restrictions dominantly control et variability in the 2014 drought ei reached the maximum of 80 in the series and remained relatively stable around 69 during the five years after 2017 presenting values slightly above the long term average we analyzed the components of transpiration et and soil evaporation es in et to determine how et partitioning processes manifested at the interannual climate scale like et the annual average et and es varied proportionally with rainfall fig s2 a the et et and es et ratios remained nearly constant in the period fig s2 b the transpiration component et was more sensitive to rainfall variations than es the decrease in et and particularly in et in dry years reduced soil moisture extraction in the root layer which was compensated by the lower precipitation at this point it is uncertain whether the response of the soil moisture would increase decrease or present no significant anomalies to further examine this response we evaluated soil moisture patterns in dry events we evaluated soil moisture variability on regional and local scales with observed measurements and modeled estimates regional scale moisture between 2016 and 2020 showed significant downward trends for swi fig 11 which were apparent for both the annual maximum and minimum values and for both the swat τ 0 24 p value 0 0073 and smap τ 0 24 p value 0 0065 estimates from our calculated estimate the downward trend in soil moisture at a depth of 2 m was equivalent to 6 4 mm y 1 similarly soil moisture measured in the field at plot scale fig 12 between 2015 and 2020 showed significant declining trends the decline in moisture during dry years manifested in both the shallow τ 0 22 p value 0 016 and intermediate τ 0 39 p value 2 3 10 5 layers the grassland in the posses basin is managed well and has a root system that typically reaches a depth of 1 m silva et al 2021 explaining the trend detected in both layers the effects of soil moisture trends within the jaguari river basin fig 11 were the same at the hydrologic microscale fig 12 as evaluated using independent methods at the microscale the estimates can serve as a reference because they were directly measured helping to corroborate trends in regional estimates based on modeling at a larger scale in the context of the temporal variabilities in the water budget the downward trend in soil moisture in successive dry years suggests that the impact of reduced rainfall was greater than that of reduced soil water extraction by the roots this process is also partially explained by the positive anomalies of the annual mean ei and particularly its persistence during dry years ei is expected to increase with decreasing rainfall but a lower et in turn would decrease ei the effect of rainfall variations dominated the final result 3 5 total water storage changes and aquifer recharge to understand the impact of dry years on soil moisture and more comprehensively on the total water storage of the system we analyzed the variability in tws fig 13 the reference tws circles with black line in fig 13 generally increased in the first half of the time series from 2002 to 2012 it is marked by increasing annual peaks followed by an opposing and dominantly decreasing pattern in the following years until 2021 the interannual oscillations of tws showed a consistent pattern with rainfall there is a sharp drop during the 2014 2015 drought with an anomaly of approximately 300 mm and with recovery in 2016 2017 leading to an anomaly above 200 mm in the last five years tws progressively declined in line with the negative rainfall anomalies reaching the same anomaly of approximately 300 mm observed during the historical drought by the end of 2021 the water storage calculated by the model red line in fig 13 adequately represented the interannual variability of grace measurements and indicated seasonal variabilities with a high temporal resolution some years did not show good agreement in the minimum seasonal values but the simulated values were comparable to measurements in the most striking events of the series namely the 2014 drought and the last five years of the period the absolute values of the calculated and measured anomalies had an offset because of the limitations of the model which used a simplified groundwater flow scheme besides this there is an intrinsic difficulty of establishing volumes for storage compartments such as shallow aquifers and soils at different depths based on these 20 years of grace measurements the annual range has generally varied at 150 200 mm of water getirana 2016 assessed the tws anomaly in 16 large energy reservoirs in southeastern brazil which are regionally close to the jaguari river basin his analysis covered the period between april 2002 and january 2015 and found an average amplitude in tws of 200 mm which is comparable to our results in a study of the urucaia river aquifer in northeastern brazil the mean amplitude of tws was higher at 300 mm gonçalves et al 2020 this temporal pattern of tws supports the variability of the water budget terms particularly the decline in soil moisture over the last five years fig 11 at the end of the historical time series in september 2021 tws achieved the lowest level which was even lower than that during the great drought in 2014 according to the measured flow rate fig 3b throughout the analysis range the maximum variation of tws was 604 mm of water estimated using the difference between the peak in 2011 and minimum value in 2021 which is equivalent to 40 of the annual average precipitation we calculated shallow aquifer recharge using the hydrologic model estimated as the flow of water percolating from the bottom of the vadose zone into the shallow aquifer this is the compartment whose moisture status contributes to the calculated baseflow in the river the annual mean recharge was estimated as 108 36 mm y 1 comparable to regional scale estimates for southeastern brazil oliveira et al 2021 the interannual variation of recharge was similar to that of specific flow with the extremes of the series ranging from 35 to 170 mm y 1 and the maximum in 2010 and minimum in 2014 fig 14 the recharge decreased in 2014 with the maximum reduction of the series at 80 however the average reduction of 26 in the last dry years although minor contributed to the negative accumulation of tws during dry years 4 discussion observed records of precipitation and flow section 3 1 suggested that there was an immediate and strong effect on inflow to the jaguari reservoir resulting from the 2014 meteorological drought despite the inflow and the reservoir levels not shown recovery between 2015 and 2016 to increased rainfall it was soon affected by serial droughts with intensities ranging from moderately dry to very dry in fact as elucidated later in fig 9 the drought spanned 9 years from 2013 to 2021 and was unprecedented in the last 30 years but more presumably in the last 70 years if based on the rainfall records these results contrast with the findings of de freitas 2020 who did not find significant trends in streamflow of jaguari jacareí catchment in the period of 1976 2009 it was also remarkable that different sources of data tws and f 25b station figs 13 and 3b respectively had their historical minima in 2021 in the case of f 25b station even the minimum flow in 2020 was 6 9 lower than in the major 2014 drought whereas 2021 minimum flow was 17 9 lower than in 2014 sabesp 2022 estimated that without the water increments from other basins to alto tietê basin the cantareira system would have totally collapsed in november 2020 to better understand the processes and dynamics behind these droughts we strived to adjust the hydrologic model in multiple components section 3 2 the simulations using the calibrated model showed a good ability to represent the flow table 1 and fig 4 et fig 5 and soil moisture fig 6 in the study area additionally the 95ppu fig 4 on the uncertainty analysis covered most of the observed flow p factor 0 85 under relatively small width r factor 0 83 which indicates that choosing a different set of parameters of behavioral solutions would not produce substantial differences in the simulated flow ultimately these flows and variables highly covariate in the swat model the soil moisture status controls the calculation of the lateral runoff component of flow and also depends on the et depletion rate and soil properties that influence the infiltration and soil water retention these processes in turn influence deep drainage to the saturated zone where the water status controls the baseflow finally groundwater dependent flows largely determine streamflow during seasonal hydrologic recession requiring the model to be robust in simulations of droughts with different intensities in numerical studies of hydrologic sensitivity to climate krysanova et al 2018 flow simulation alone should not be used as an isolated criterion when evaluating the performance of simulations which prevents a good result of the flow calculation from arising due to large offsetting performance errors in other covariate variables we thus expect to have found a hydrological modeling configuration with a set of very good precedents to adequately represent the charge and discharge processes of the soil aquifer system another notable characteristic in our results was the response of the natural hydrologic system to the interannual variability of precipitation we observed a high apparent elasticity of the flow in relation to rainfall in the last 5 years 3 1 that was well above the long term estimate 2 0 indeed santarosa et al 2022 showed that as cantareira overlies on crystalline aquifers the impacts on streamflow generation under reductions in rainfall can be drastic due to the short time water remains in the aquifer systems we assessed the apparent elasticity during a time with a progressive deficit in the cumulative flow and water anomalies of the system this elasticity can be conservatively interpreted as a transient sensitivity in response to drought a response to a continuous but time limited drying of the system or more broadly a low resilience against hydrologic recovery the resilience for flow recovery may have been transiently lost along the serial droughts providing conditions for greater hydrologic sensitivity than those in the past among the conditions associated with these changes the water storage status of the system decreased more specifically the soil moisture fig 11 and groundwater fig 13 significantly declined stemmed from high evapotranspiration fig 10 and less aquifer recharge fig 14 as a first hypothesis these apparent changes in resilience may have been triggered by the great drought in 2014 and then accentuated by the successive less intense droughts thus between 2013 and subsequent droughts the system may have recovered to a high hydrologic status in 2016 when the aquifer apparently recharged but this was insufficient to inhibit the changed response in subsequent years moreover as a second hypothesis an apparent loss of resilience may have occurred only in the last five years with limited effects in this time range under this second hypothesis the most critical hydrologic response occurred at the end and if compared to the 2014 drought the water storage of the system depleted to lower levels and showed slightly less low flow even though the mean annual flow was higher in both interpretations the role of the water storage in the system appeared to be closely related to the dynamics of the hydrologic response our estimates of the water balance attempted to adequately reproduce the flows and storages of the water budget which performed reasonably well against various references even though we did not use complex groundwater flow models 5 conclusions we described a regional hydroclimate variability characterized by serial meteorological droughts at the jaguari river basin in southeastern brazil with unprecedented patterns in the observational records over the last 70 years our analysis also revealed anomalous changes in the hydrologic response using a thorough validated hydrological model the major meteorological and hydrological droughts in 2014 were extremely dry events according to spi and ssi indexes marked by reductions of 29 and 59 in rainfall and streamflow respectively likewise serial meteorological and hydrological droughts with moderately to very dry conditions occurred between 2017 and 2021 when precipitation and flow showed deficits at mean rates of 9 and 28 y 1 respectively at last it was examined whether a breakdown occurred in the resilience of surface and groundwater hydrologic systems and how it could have affected the ability to maintain key hydrological processes that control baseflow we estimated a decrease of 6 4 mm y 1 in the soil moisture and a reduction of 26 in the aquifer recharge within the range of serial droughts which helped to clarify the outstanding depletion of about 250 mm observed at the entire terrestrial water storage we ended up noting that the resilience may have been transiently lost as the flow along the serial droughts decreased by 3 1 in contrast to 2 for long term conditions in response to 1 reduction in rainfall it emphasizes the great hydrologic sensitivity of the system along the criticality of the event besides the overall good performance of the hydrologic model in representing flows and storages of the water budget not using a more complex groundwater flow model is a limitation of our estimates future works would explore groundwater models to determine the spatial variability in the characteristics of aquifer retention and conductivity as well as the gains and losses of the system calculated by transport explicitly described in the saturated zone furthermore as we examined a current phenomenon future studies are obviously needed to evaluate both the manifestation of meteorological and hydrologic variability in near future years as well as in other basins around the region for instance we believe that guandu river basin which supplies water to the dense population of rio de janeiro city would be another feasible study case to test our hypotheses finally because we examined a socioeconomically strategic region with an increasing growth trend and particularly population densification in medium and large cities our results can add to a broader hydrologic risk management context credit authorship contribution statement l m domingues conceptualization

7826,study region the lake winnipeg basin in the northern great plains of north america study focus assessment of trends in total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp and total suspended solids tss for 18 river stations in the lake winnipeg basin for the period of 1996 2016 using a weighted regressions on time discharge and season wrtds modeling approach new hydrological insights for the region we observed rapidly increasing concentrations loads and yields of tn tp and tss at most of the evaluated river monitoring stations in the eastern half of the basin in contrast nutrient and suspended solid loads tended to exhibit decreasing or stationary trends at most of the more western stations trends in nutrients and suspended solids typically corresponded to discharge particularly in the red assiniboine subdrainage where rapidly increasing nutrient loads were almost exclusively associated with runoff patterns our findings will serve as a baseline against which future trend assessments can be compared moreover our findings suggest that land management practices aimed at reducing nutrient loads to lake winnipeg should be prioritized towards the rivers of the eastern subdrainages of the lake winnipeg basin graphical abstract ga1 keywords wrtds total phosphorus total nitrogen total suspended solids discharge concentration discharge water quality modeling data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction eutrophication is a global issue that affects many of the largest and most economically important waterbodies on earth smith 2003 smith et al 2006 le moal et al 2019 an excellent example of eutrophication rapidly impacting a whole ecosystem is lake winnipeg the tenth largest lake in the world where since the early 1990 s there has been lake wide cyanobacteria blooms and associated changes in ecosystem conditions kling et al 2011 mccullough et al 2012 these dramatic changes in productivity have impacted lake scale ecosystem functions impairing commercial municipal recreational and cultural uses of lake winnipeg lake winnipeg stewardship board 2006 voora and venema 2008 yet like many of the large waterbodies experiencing eutrophication management of lake winnipeg is hindered by its vast drainage area nearly 1 million km2 which makes identification and prioritizing of nutrient sources difficult consequently there has been growing interest in basin wide assessments of nutrient loadings to lake winnipeg e g armstrong and mccullough 2011 benoy et al 2016 lake winnipeg receives point and non point source inputs of nutrients and sediments from numerous tributaries that flow east across the canadian prairies north from the headwaters of the red river and west from the canadian shield these tributaries are exposed to a variety of sources of nutrients and sediments including agriculture urban areas and wastewater treatment facilities as well as natural sources e g stream bed and bank erosion as they flow to lake winnipeg schindler et al 2012 moreover the region s climate has been shifting leading to changes in hydrologic patterns associated with nutrient loading to lake winnipeg mccullough et al 2012 schindler et al 2012 interannual patterns in climate are particularly important to runoff dynamics in the fill and spill pothole topography of the prairie portions of the basin where hydrologic connectivity related to moisture availability has been linked to phytoplankton blooms in lake winnipeg ali and english 2019 although basin wide changes in land use climate and hydrology have all been linked to patterns of eutrophication in lake winnipeg to date trend studies have typically focused on a single river or small portion of the basin e g jones and armstrong 2001 hebben 2007 ryberg 2017 shafiei and mcloughlin 2017 vecchia 2005 consequently there remains a gap in terms of a comprehensive long term analysis of trends in concentrations loadings and yields of nutrients and suspended solids for the major tributaries throughout the lake winnipeg basin but see ppwb 2016 environment canada 2011 the weighted regressions on time discharge and season wrtds hirsch et al 2010 hirsch and de cicco 2015 choquette et al 2019 model is designed for large long term datasets and is formulated to allow for maximum flexibility in representations of the long term trend seasonal and discharge related components of the behavior of the water quality variable of interest hirsch et al 2010 sprague et al 2011 to date it has been successfully applied to model nutrient loadings to the chesapeake bay river the mississippi river western lake erie and other areas experiencing eutrophication hirsch et al 2010 sprague et al 2011 choquette et al 2019 beck et al 2015 moreover it has performed favorably in comparisons to other common modelling approaches e g estimator loadest 5 loadest 7 for assessing trends in loadings e g beck et al 2015 hirsch 2014 as such the wrtds model is likely an effective means of determining trends in concentrations loads and yields of nutrients and suspended solids in rivers and streams of the lake winnipeg basin the goal of our study is to provide an assessment of long term trends in river nutrient and suspended solid concentrations loads and yields across the lake winnipeg basin we achieved this goal by using a wrtds model to first determine trends in concentrations and loads of total nitrogen total phosphorus and total suspended solids for the period of record of 1996 2016 for each of 18 river monitoring stations second we use wrtds generated trends for the 20 year period of record to assess spatial patterns in trends of nutrients and suspended solids across the lake winnipeg basin results of this study will serve as a baseline for comparison against future conditions resulting from management activities and climate change moreover it will identify regions in the lake winnipeg basin where nutrient and suspended solid loads may need increased management and study 2 methods 2 1 station selection and data sources the lake winnipeg basin drains an area of approximately 1 million km2 extending from the canadian rockies in the west the dakotas and minnesota in the south and the canadian shield in the east the basin consists of six major subdrainages the north south and lower saskatchewan river subdrainages the transboundary red assiniboine subdrainage the westward flowing winnipeg subdrainage and the eastern lake winnipeg subdrainage fig 1 the subdrainages span four u s states i e minnesota montana north dakota and south dakota and four canadian provinces alberta manitoba ontario and saskatchewan landscapes vary from the mountains and foothills in the headwaters in alberta to the parklands and prairies of saskatchewan manitoba and the dakotas to the mixed and boreal forests of minnesota ontario and eastern manitoba land use is primarily agricultural throughout the majority of the lake winnipeg basin with a small number of urban centers table s1 including calgary edmonton regina saskatoon winnipeg grand forks and fargo scattered across the basin natural forest cover dominates in the winnipeg subdrainage and in the headwaters of the north and south saskatchewan subdrainages our study of nutrient and suspended solid trends in the tributaries of lake winnipeg used publicly available data from 18 river monitoring stations in five of the major subdrainages table 1 to be included in the study monitoring stations were required to have data on discharge nutrients and suspended solids covering at minimum the period of 1996 2016 monitoring stations meeting these criteria spanned the five major subdrainages of the lake winnipeg basin and the major tributaries within it as rivers in the eastern lake winnipeg subdrainage did not have sufficient data to meet these criteria they were not included in the study selected stations were located in three canadian provinces alberta 8 stations saskatchewan 5 stations and manitoba 5 stations however two of the stations red and souris rivers were located near the canada usa border and captured drainage from the usa portion of the red assiniboine subdrainage moreover stations captured longitudinal variation across the saskatchewan river basin as stations were distributed along the north and south and lower sections of this system as well as on its key tributaries thus three rivers north saskatchewan bow and red deer ab had two stations each and these were differentiated as upstream and downstream stations consequently there was substantive variation in the drainage areas of the selected stations 1902 km2 to 373 000 km2 also the study included two distinct red deer rivers one with upstream and downstream stations that originates in alberta and flows into the south saskatchewan river and one that originates in saskatchewan and flows into red deer lake in manitoba although dams were present in some drainages all were constructed prior to the period of record used in our study hydrologic data at all 18 stations was obtained from water survey of canada https wateroffice ec gc ca mainmenu historical data index e html with the exception of 4 stations bow upstream south saskatchewan battle saskatchewan discharge and water quality were measured at the same location throughout the period of record discharge for the bow upstream station was predominantly measured at canmore however gaps in the canmore dataset were estimated from the gauging station at banff using a regression based on a 10 year flow period when discharge at both canmore and banff were measured the discharge for the south saskatchewan river station was calculated as the discharge of the south saskatchewan river at medicine hat plus the discharge of seven persons creek and ross creek discharge for the saskatchewan river above the carrot river was calculated as the discharge at the saskatchewan river at the pas minus the discharge of the carrot river the discharge station for the battle river was moved downstream in 1978 the pre 1978 discharge for the battle river was adjusted using a regression equation based on the 1978 1979 period when both stations were monitored wrtds requires daily discharge data and if data were missing it was either filled in via interpolation between the missing data points for short periods or estimated via a regression relationship with another station on the same river water quality data describing concentrations of total nitrogen total phosphorus and total suspended solids as a surrogate for sediments was obtained from environment and climate change canada eccc https www canada ca en environment climate change services freshwater quality monitoring online data html who monitored 15 of the stations and from the province of alberta https environment extranet gov ab ca apps waterquality dataportal who monitored 3 stations all water quality data were reviewed to identify and remove routine quality control replicates most stations were sampled once per month although occasionally some high frequency sampling occurred over the period of record data were thinned to 2 4 samples per month using a stratified random sampling approach when sampling frequency was high 2 2 analysis of trends for each of the 18 stations we analyzed flow normalized concentrations loads and yields of total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp and total suspended solids tss data from 1996 to 2016 daily loads measured in tonnes were calculated by multiplying daily flows with wrtds estimated daily concentrations annual loads are the sum of daily loads for each year yields were generated by dividing loads by the drainage area associated with each station s catchment and were expressed as kg km2 year trends in water quality parameters were analyzed with the weighted regressions on time discharge and season wrtds model hirsch et al 2010 hirsch and de cicco 2015 choquette et al 2019 the wrtds model uses a weighted regression approach to generate daily estimates of concentration and load the weights that are used are based on the similarity in time year discharge and season of the estimated day to the known observations for example if the model is estimating the concentration on june 1 2009 and the measured discharge on that day was 100 m3 s 1 data points in the year 2009 would be given higher weight than data points in the year 2000 data points in may june and july of any year would be given higher weights than data points in november december and january of any year and data points with discharge near 100 m3 s 1 would be given higher weight than data points with much lower or higher discharges the model produces daily time series of estimated concentrations and loads for the period of record an excellent overview of the model is provided by oelsner et al 2017 to reduce the impact of random year to year variations in flow that arise from large scale climatic events e g drought and flood years the wrtds models also generate daily flow normalized estimates of concentration and load as described by oelsner et al 2017 the flow normalization process for concentration creates a weighted regression for concentration on a given day for every historical discharge value that occurred on that day the mean of those concentration estimates is the flow normalized concentration for that day for example the model would estimate the flow normalized concentration on june 1 2009 by taking the mean of the model estimates run using discharge values that occurred on every june 1st during the period of record the flow normalized load for that day would be computed by taking the mean of the load estimates generated by multiplying each concentration estimate by its corresponding discharge value the magnitude of the total change over a specific time period is provided both as the change in value and as a percent change the change is further divided into two components a concentration component c vs q that describes what the change would be if there was no change in the probability distribution of discharge over time and a discharge component q that describes the amount of the trend that can be attributed to a change in the probability distribution of discharge choquette et al 2019 the latter components provide insight into the influence of non stationarity in flow e g increasing or decreasing flow over time on concentration and load trends the wrtds model was run with r software using the egret 3 0 and egretci 2 0 packages hirsch and de cicco 2015 model runs in egret 3 0 used default parameterization except for the windowside parameter which was set based on the presence or absence of non stationarity in flow and the windowq parameter which was set based on drainage basin area refer to hirsch and de cicco 2015 for parameter definitions the windowside parameter was set to 7 for stations that exhibited a trend in one or more discharge components and to 30 for stations that did not the windowq parameter was set to the default of 2 for basins 250 000 km2 and to 1 for basins 250 000 km2 the models were developed using the longest period of record available for the water quality parameters which ranged from 23 to 56 years to assess stationarity of flow trends in discharge measures i e minimum daily maximum daily median daily and mean daily flows were analyzed with the same period of record over which the models were developed using egret 3 0 and tested for significance using the mann kendall test α 0 1 water quality trends were assessed using the runpairs option for the 20 year period between 1996 and 2016 this 20 year period was selected because all stations had data for each parameter for that time period additional 20 year discharge trend analyses over the period 1996 2016 were conducted to understand the role of discharge in the water quality trend results goodness of fit for the wrtds models was assessed with the flux bias statistic hirsch 2014 if the flux bias statistic was greater than 0 2 potentially indicating a model bias of between 5 and 25 hirsch 2014 the model was excluded from further analysis a bootstrap test using the runpairsboot option in the egretci r package was used to estimate the uncertainty of water quality trends hirsch et al 2015 in the context of classical hypothesis testing the null hypothesis is that there is no change in flow normalized concentration flow normalized load between the selected years in the trend period namely 1996 2016 models were categorized as highly likely very likely likely or no trend depending upon the generated p value models where 1 p 0 95 to 1 0 were considered highly likely 2 p 0 90 to 0 95 were considered very likely 3 p 0 66 to 0 90 were considered likely and 4 p 0 33 to 0 66 were considered to have no trend 3 results 3 1 trends in nutrients and suspended solids fifty four trend models representing three water quality constituents for 18 river stations were completed table s2 of the 54 models 39 had little to no bias flux bias statistic 0 1 seven had some bias flux bias statistic 0 1 but 0 2 and eight had significant bias flux bias statistic 0 2 the wrtds method performed best for tn as all tn models had a flux bias statistic of less than 0 2 twelve of the tp models had little to no bias three had some bias and three had significant bias the tss models showed the most bias nine models had little to no bias four had some bias and five had significant bias biased models were restricted to locations in the north south and lower saskatchewan subdrainages the north saskatchewan downstream and the oldman river stations accounted for half of the significantly biased models biased models were not analyzed further all results presented hereafter reflect flow normalized concentrations and loads of tn tp and tss however for the sake of brevity we do not indicate flow normalized in each instance 3 2 total nitrogen mean annual average tn concentration from 1996 to 2016 ranged from 0 14 0 01 mg l north saskatchewan river upstream to 3 09 0 10 mg l souris river table s3 annual average tn concentration generally increased over the 20 year study period at all stations in the red assiniboine and lower saskatchewan subdrainages except the souris and saskatchewan rivers respectively fig s1 in contrast annual average tn concentrations were generally lower in 2016 compared to 1996 in the lower saskatchewan and winnipeg river subdrainages and were variable in the south saskatchewan subdrainage mean annual tn load over the period of record ranged from 231 20 tonnes north saskatchewan river upstream to 16 852 746 tonnes winnipeg river table s3 moreover the mean annual tn loads at the red saskatchewan and winnipeg river stations were all nearly twice that of the rest of the assessed stations temporal patterns of annual tn loads generally increased from 1996 to 2016 in stations in the red assiniboine lower saskatchewan and winnipeg subdrainages decreased across the north saskatchewan subdrainage stations and were variable among the stations of the south saskatchewan subdrainage fig s2 of the 18 stations eight stations had mean annual yields in excess of 100 kg km2 yr four stations had yields ranging from 8 to 50 kg km2 yr whereas the remaining stations fell somewhere in between 50 and 100 kg km2 yr table s3 annual yields of tn exhibited similar temporal patterns to annual loads fig s3 from 1996 2016 nine of the 18 stations had increasing trends in tn concentration seven stations had decreasing trends and two stations exhibited no trend fig 2 top the total percentage increase in tn concentration over the 20 year period ranged from about 5 bow river downstream to 49 red deer ab downstream or 0 3 2 5 per year decreasing concentration trends occurred at 7 stations where the total percentage change over the 20 year period ranged from about 5 oldman river to 38 north saskatchewan river downstream or 0 3 to 1 9 per year substantial contributions to the total increase in tn concentration from changes in discharge i e q component were evident at the south saskatchewan river bow river downstream and pembina river stations and to a lesser degree the red deer mb river and carrot river stations the red river station was the only station where the discharge trend component was negative in terms of tn load and yield 13 stations had increasing trends and five stations had decreasing trends fig 2 bottom the percentage increase over the 20 year period in tn load ranged from 0 2 winnipeg to 247 red deer mb or 0 01 12 4 per year five of the 13 stations assiniboine carrot qu appelle red deer mb and souris all had increases in load that were over 100 when taken over the 20 year period the percentage decrease in tn load was similar at the five stations ranging from 12 north saskatchewan upstream to 27 oldman or 0 6 to 1 35 per year over the 20 year period the q component accounted for the large percentage increases in load 100 at the assiniboine carrot qu appelle red deer mb and souris stations 3 3 total phosphorus the mean annual tp concentration over the period of record ranged from 0 009 0 003 mg l bow river upstream to 0 44 0 07 mg l souris river table s4 fig s4 throughout the years the range of mean annual tp concentrations was smallest at the north saskatchewan upstream station 0 005 mg l and greatest at the souris river where the range of 0 27 mg l was more than double that of the second largest range observed in the red river 0 11 mg l annual average tp concentrations were largely increasing over time at three stations in the red assiniboine subdrainages i e pembina qu appelle and red fig s5 general increases from 1996 to 2016 were also observed at all stations in the lower saskatchewan and winnipeg subdrainages except in the saskatchewan river declining annual average tp concentrations were variable over time in the north and south saskatchewan subdrainages the mean annual tp load over the period of record ranged from 25 tonnes bow river upstream to 2546 tonnes red river table s4 fig s5 temporal patterns in annual tp loads were predominantly increasing from 1996 2016 in all subdrainages except the north and south saskatchewan subdrainages where patterns were more variable when loads were converted to yields the saskatchewan river station became one of the lowest yielding stations along with the qu appelle river station whereas the pembina river became one of the highest yielding stations along with the south saskatchewan and red river stations table s4 fig s6 similar to annual tp loads tp yields generally increased between 1996 and 2016 at stations in the red assiniboine winnipeg and lower saskatchewan subdrainages but were more variable in the stations of the north and south saskatchewan subdrainages tp concentrations of the 15 stations with unbiased models trended upward for 8 of the stations fig 3 top three of the remaining stations exhibited no trend and the other 4 exhibited decreasing trends of the increasing trends six stations had total percent increases of 20 or greater and except the red deer ab river downstream were located in the lower saskatchewan and red assiniboine subdrainages rivers exhibiting highly likely decreasing trends were all about 45 total change the q or discharge component comprised a negligible portion of the percent total change in tp concentration trends at all but 4 locations and only at 2 stations located in the lower saskatchewan subdrainage was the q component the dominant source of change trends in tp load and yield were primarily increasing 12 stations fig 3 bottom red deer upstream and battle river exhibited decreasing trends and the bow river upstream exhibited stationarity increasing trends captured total changes ranging from 21 in the winnipeg river to 335 in the red deer mb river ten stations exhibited increasing trends leading to total percent change of greater than 50 over the 20 year period of record unlike trends in tp concentration increasing trends in tp load were primarily associated with the q component in particular the q component was responsible for at least half and in one case all of the total percent change in tp load for stations within the red assiniboine rivers and lower saskatchewan subdrainages 3 4 total suspended solids mean annual tss concentration from 1996 2016 ranged from 3 2 0 29 mg l winnipeg river to 242 38 mg l red deer river downstream table s5 fig s7 annual average tss concentrations generally increased over the study period across the red assiniboine subdrainage stations and were mostly increasing in the south saskatchewan subdrainage in contrast tss concentration were typically smaller in 2016 than in 1996 in the winnipeg river subdrainage temporal patterns were variable in the lower and north saskatchewan subdrainages the mean annual tss load over the period of record ranged from 5547 1370 tonnes souris river to 2191 429 346 361 tonnes south saskatchewan river table s5 fig s8 over the years the smallest loads all less than 100 000 tonnes were found in the souris assiniboine bow upstream qu appelle and carrot stations the stations with the highest tss load were the red deer ab downstream red and south saskatchewan with loads that generally were two orders of magnitude larger than those of the five lowest stations the north saskatchewan river upstream station had the largest yields table s5 fig s9 in addition the pembina river bow river upstream and the south saskatchewan river stations also had yields in excess of 20 000 kg km2 in most years and most commonly in the last ten years of record similar to tss loads temporal patterns in tss yields were largely increasing in the red assiniboine subdrainage and most south saskatchewan subdrainages in contrast tss yields were declining in the winnipeg river subdrainage and variable in the lower and north saskatchewan subdrainages of the 13 stations where tss concentrations were successfully modeled eight exhibited increasing trends three showed decreasing trends and two had no trend fig 4 top the greatest change in tss concentration was observed for the assiniboine river 130 in addition the red and red deer ab downstream stations exhibited increases of nearly or greater than 100 however at the red river and red deer ab downstream stations the change in tss concentration was entirely associated with the c vs q component whereas in the assiniboine river nearly a third of the change was associated with the q component except for the bow river upstream all stations exhibiting increasing trends in mean annual tss concentration had the majority of change associated with the c vs q component stations with decreasing trends indicated that change in mean annual tss concentrations were primarily attributed to the q component moreover stations with decreasing trends all showed less than a 30 decrease in contrast to mean annual tss concentrations mean annual tss loads and yields were primarily increasing 10 of 13 and with the exception of two stations bow river upstream and red deer river ab downstream change was dominated by the q component fig 4 bottom change exceeded 100 at five stations including a near 300 increase at the bow river downstream station and a greater than 450 increase at the assiniboine river station stations with decreasing trends were the north saskatchewan river upstream and the winnipeg river however decreases represented a less than 20 change at these two stations 3 5 discharge trends discharge varied substantially among the evaluated monitoring stations with mean annual average discharges from 6 49 4 45 m3 s 1 in the battle river to 1050 294 m3 s 1 in the winnipeg river fig s10 among station variation in mean annual average discharge was generally associated with drainage area r 0 68 although the stations within the red assiniboine subdrainage had lower discharge by area and the headwater stations of the north and south saskatchewan subdrainages exhibited greater discharge than their drainage areas would predict the range in mean annual discharge over the 20 year study period was largest in the winnipeg river with a range of 1085 m3 s 1 and smallest in the battle river range 16 2 m3 s 1 mann kendall tests indicated that there were no significant trends in any of the tested annual measures of discharge at ten of the 18 stations p 0 1 table 2 of the remaining 8 stations only the assiniboine carrot and red deer mb rivers exhibited a trend for more than one discharge metric moreover increases for these metrics all exceeded 5 year indeed the assiniboine and carrot rivers both showed trend slope estimates greater than 10 year in minimum and maximum annual discharge as well as for mean annual discharge in the case of the assiniboine 3 6 spatial assessment spatial assessment of trends in metrics describing tn tp and tss in rivers across the lake winnipeg basin revealed clear patterns in subdrainages experiencing increasing concentrations load and yield fig 5 in particular all five modelled rivers in the red assiniboine subdrainage showed increasing trends in load and yields of all three water quality parameters moreover the only decreasing trends in the red assiniboine rivers subdrainage were observed at the souris river station where concentrations of tn and tp were declining in contrast to the red assiniboine subdrainage was the north saskatchewan subdrainage where the only increasing trend was observed for tp concentration at the battle river station trends in the south and lower saskatchewan subdrainages were more variable among stations with some stations showing increasing trends in all metrics of all parameters e g carrot river and some stations exhibiting a mix of increasing and decreasing trends e g bow river upstream lower saskatchewan river depending upon the parameter examined 4 discussion in this study a water quality modelling tool wrtds was applied to twenty year records of monitoring data describing discharge tp tn and tss across the lake winnipeg basin trend analysis revealed basin wide increases in concentrations loads and yields of nitrogen and phosphorus and to a lesser extent suspended solids increases in nutrient and suspended solid loads were driven by co occurring changes discharge but this was not the case for concentrations increasing trends in nutrients suspended solids were particularly pronounced for rivers within the red assiniboine subdrainage application of the wrtds modelling tool provided insight into the nature of trends and the probable drivers and will thereby provide managers with critical information to focus management actions aimed at protecting lake winnipeg 4 1 comparison to past trend studies in the lake winnipeg basin we observed increasing trends in concentrations of tn and tp at approximately half of the sixteen stations this proportion is significantly greater than has been reported in past studies of the same stations ppwb 2016 jones and armstrong 2001 environment canada 2011 for example the prairie provinces water board ppwb 2016 assessed trends from 1973 to 2008 at nine stations that we also studied however only one station the lower saskatchewan showed the same trends in both our study and the ppwb study moreover the ppwb study showed increasing trends of tn and tp concentrations at only two and three stations respectively whereas we observed increasing tn and tp trends at six of the common sites likewise a similarly small number of sites with increasing tn and tp concentration trends three stations for each were reported in a trend assessment by environment canada 2011 spanning the years 1996 2006 a study spanning 1973 1999 by jones and armstrong 2001 that used the same 9 sites in manitoba that we studied had better agreement with our study in terms of trends in tp concentrations indeed the four sites they observed to have increasing trends were also increasing in our study period however we also observed increasing trends at two sites the jones and armstrong 2001 study did not including the qu appelle river station which showed a strong decreasing trend in this past study increasing trends in nutrient concentrations predominantly occurred in rivers within the red assiniboine south saskatchewan and lower saskatchewan subdrainages ppwb 2016 and environment canada 2011 also observed increasing tn and tp concentration trends at stations in the lower saskatchewan but did not identify trends at any of the stations in the red assiniboine or south saskatchewan drainages in contrast a more recent trend analysis of the red and pembina river stations by nustad and vecchia 2020 spanning the years 2000 2015 also observed increasing trends in tp concentration similar to our observations however unlike our study the nustad and vecchia 2020 study found no trend in tn concentrations increasing trends in tss concentrations were observed in 9 stations within the red assiniboine and south saskatchewan subdrainages the ppwb 2016 study also found increasing trends in two of these stations the carrot and assiniboine but did not identify trends in the other seven rivers we studied there was also no agreement between the two sites shared between our study and the nustad and vecchia 2020 study as the usgs study found no trend at the red river station and a decreasing trend at the pembina river station unlike trends in nutrient concentrations there has been no previous assessments of trends in nutrient loads across the entire lake winnipeg basin however a study by bourne et al 2002 did assess trends in tp loads from the mid 1970 s to 1999 for the nine stations in manitoba that we observed to all be increasing in tp loads from 1996 to 2016 as the period of record included in the bourne et al 2002 study almost fully precedes the period of record we assessed direct comparisons are not practical however the findings of bourne et al 2002 study can provide insight into potential changes in trend direction of stations our studies shared indeed based on bourne et al 2002 it appears that the rapidly increasing tp loads in the red river we observed have been occurring for at least the past four decades likewise the increasing tp loads at the pembina carrot and winnipeg stations also appear to be continuations of trends from previous decades in contrast the increasing tp loads we observed for the remaining five manitoba stations suggest that these increases have only become apparent in the 2000 s in particular the qu appelle river station was found by bourne et al 2001 to have a decreasing trend in tp load whereas we found an increasing trend the observed discrepancies in the trends in concentration and loads between our study and past assessments likely arise from either differences in the temporal scopes of the studies or in the approaches to establishing trends as our study emphasizes more recent conditions the more frequent occurrence of increasing trends suggests that conditions in the lake winnipeg basin have been changing since the start of the 21st century and are leading to greater concentrations and loads of nutrients and sediments in this region s rivers trend detection methods may also have had an effect although it is difficult to directly establish method effects because of co occurring differences in temporal scope however comparison to the study by the nustad and vecchia 2020 which used r qwtrends vecchia and nustad 2020 to assess a similar period of record to our study 2000 2015 vs 1996 2016 respectively for the red and pembina stations may provide some insight into the importance of the method interestingly there was little consistency between our study and the usgs study as only trends in concentration and load of tp were in agreement suggesting that method may have a significant impact on whether a trend is identified however because the record lengths are not identical it is difficult to fully disentangle if differences in method is the source of disagreement we recommend formal comparisons of trend detection methods be undertaken to better enable study comparison and inform managers of changes in nutrients and sediments in the lake winnipeg basin 4 2 role of discharge as a driver of nutrient and suspended solids trends increases in runoff and discharge appear to be primarily responsible for the co occurring increasing trends in loads and yields of tn tp and tss indeed increasing trends in tn and tp had q components i e the part of the change due to discharge that were 80 or larger at all stations in the lower saskatchewan as well as four of the five stations in the red assiniboine likewise all stations with increasing trends in tss had q components that exceeded 50 thus our observations suggest that rivers throughout much of the lake winnipeg basin are experiencing runoff driven increases in nutrient and sediment loadings from non point sources such as agricultural lands however as the amount of agricultural lands in the basin has not significantly changed over the period of record used in our study anon 2016 it is likely changes in agricultural practices and intensity that are responsible for the increased loadings increasing non point source loadings to lake winnipeg basin tributaries because of greater agricultural intensity is consistent with reports of greater intensity of n and p fertilizer use as well as greater numbers of livestock in agricultural areas across the basin dorff and beaulieu 2014 it is also possible that our findings reflect increases in the contributing areas in many of the lake winnipeg basin subdrainages as a result of wetland drainage leading to greater discharge and subsequent nutrient and sediment loadings from uplands baulch et al 2021 dumanski et al 2015 as fully elucidating the sources of nutrients and sediments was beyond the scope of our study future assessments are needed to more accurately identify the key sources to these tributaries disparities between station q components and trends of annual discharge indicates temporal shifts in the character of individual runoff events rather than annual discharge are responsible for increasing nutrient and sediment loads across much of the lake winnipeg basin moreover as annual discharge in lake winnipeg basin tributaries is typically strongly associated with the quantity of snowmelt gray and landine 1988 our observations of stable annual discharge in most tributaries also suggests that trends in nutrient and sediment loads are the result of runoff events outside of snowmelt an increasing role of individual events in the hydrology in the lake winnipeg basin is consistent with predictions and observations of increasing precipitation particularly in the summer season in the easternmost areas of the lake winnipeg basin dumanski et al 2015 debeer et al 2016 dibike et al 2021 thus in addition to providing insight into the timing and type of events that are likely driving nutrient and sediment loading trends in the lake winnipeg basin our study also demonstrates the advantages of using an approach such as wrtds that incorporates shorter temporal scales in trend assessments as opposed to annual scaled data 4 3 modelling limitations and caveats our study incorporated datasets generated from water quality and discharge measurements that were long in record and high in frequency as such known limitations of the wrtds model such as those described by oelsner et al 2017 are not anticipated to have greatly impacted our findings however the nature of the wrtds model does entail that trends are assessed over the entire period of record and may thus not detect changes in a parameter s trajectory near the beginning or more importantly the end of the record indeed directional transitions appear to occur in the latter half of the records at several of our studied stations e g south saskatchewan saskatchewan and winnipeg rivers although such directional changes may only represent short term variation these inflection points may also be indicative of a broad change in a station s catchment condition we recommend that these stations be revisited in the near future to establish if these short term patterns reflect a lasting shift in nutrient and sediment trends 4 4 linkages to eutrophication of lake winnipeg our findings support and corroborate hypotheses and data related to the rapid eutrophication of lake winnipeg through the 1990 s and early 2000 s in particular our observations demonstrate clear trends of increasing nutrient loads to lake winnipeg that correspond to the rapid increase in mean mid summer phytoplankton biomass observed in the lake by mccullough et al 2012 moreover our finding that increases in tributary discharge particularly those in the red assiniboine subdrainage supports hypotheses by schindler et al 2012 that increasing stream flow is a key driver of the eutrophication of lake winnipeg finally our finding of disproportionate increases in nutrient loads in the red assiniboine subdrainage supports calls emphasizing management of this transboundary subdrainage to meet nutrient reduction targets aimed at rehabilitating lake winnipeg e g lwsb 2006 anon 2015 anon 2020 however some caution is required in linking our findings to conditions in lake winnipeg as many of these stations flow through lakes or reservoirs prior to entering the lake e g saskatchewan river flows through cedar lake prior to draining to lake winnipeg these lentic environments may act as sinks of nutrients and sediments and thus management actions in the subdrainages may provide less benefit to lake winnipeg than would be anticipated from the loads and yields we report 5 conclusion the findings of our study have two critical implications for the management of the lake winnipeg basin first our analyses have revealed several long term trends in river borne nutrients that may lead to further impairment of lake winnipeg indeed it appears that land management practices aimed at reducing nutrient loads to lake winnipeg should be prioritized towards the rivers of the red assiniboine and lower saskatchewan subdrainages as these areas showed both the largest and most rapidly increasing nutrient loads observed throughout the basin we recommend that trend analyses be undertaken in these hotspot subdrainages to better understand the role of land use and land management changes as potential drivers of nutrient loads in these systems second by using the wrtds modelling approach we have established a baseline for future spatial and temporal assessments of nutrients and suspended solids in the lake winnipeg basin this baseline will enable periodic trend analyses to track changes over time and determine the effectiveness of management actions in the basin in particular we suggest that future analyses consider loads and concentrations of dissolved fractions of nutrients as well as seasonally specific trends to further explain the potential roles of land use and climate as drivers of river borne nutrients and sediments in the lake

7826,study region the lake winnipeg basin in the northern great plains of north america study focus assessment of trends in total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp and total suspended solids tss for 18 river stations in the lake winnipeg basin for the period of 1996 2016 using a weighted regressions on time discharge and season wrtds modeling approach new hydrological insights for the region we observed rapidly increasing concentrations loads and yields of tn tp and tss at most of the evaluated river monitoring stations in the eastern half of the basin in contrast nutrient and suspended solid loads tended to exhibit decreasing or stationary trends at most of the more western stations trends in nutrients and suspended solids typically corresponded to discharge particularly in the red assiniboine subdrainage where rapidly increasing nutrient loads were almost exclusively associated with runoff patterns our findings will serve as a baseline against which future trend assessments can be compared moreover our findings suggest that land management practices aimed at reducing nutrient loads to lake winnipeg should be prioritized towards the rivers of the eastern subdrainages of the lake winnipeg basin graphical abstract ga1 keywords wrtds total phosphorus total nitrogen total suspended solids discharge concentration discharge water quality modeling data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction eutrophication is a global issue that affects many of the largest and most economically important waterbodies on earth smith 2003 smith et al 2006 le moal et al 2019 an excellent example of eutrophication rapidly impacting a whole ecosystem is lake winnipeg the tenth largest lake in the world where since the early 1990 s there has been lake wide cyanobacteria blooms and associated changes in ecosystem conditions kling et al 2011 mccullough et al 2012 these dramatic changes in productivity have impacted lake scale ecosystem functions impairing commercial municipal recreational and cultural uses of lake winnipeg lake winnipeg stewardship board 2006 voora and venema 2008 yet like many of the large waterbodies experiencing eutrophication management of lake winnipeg is hindered by its vast drainage area nearly 1 million km2 which makes identification and prioritizing of nutrient sources difficult consequently there has been growing interest in basin wide assessments of nutrient loadings to lake winnipeg e g armstrong and mccullough 2011 benoy et al 2016 lake winnipeg receives point and non point source inputs of nutrients and sediments from numerous tributaries that flow east across the canadian prairies north from the headwaters of the red river and west from the canadian shield these tributaries are exposed to a variety of sources of nutrients and sediments including agriculture urban areas and wastewater treatment facilities as well as natural sources e g stream bed and bank erosion as they flow to lake winnipeg schindler et al 2012 moreover the region s climate has been shifting leading to changes in hydrologic patterns associated with nutrient loading to lake winnipeg mccullough et al 2012 schindler et al 2012 interannual patterns in climate are particularly important to runoff dynamics in the fill and spill pothole topography of the prairie portions of the basin where hydrologic connectivity related to moisture availability has been linked to phytoplankton blooms in lake winnipeg ali and english 2019 although basin wide changes in land use climate and hydrology have all been linked to patterns of eutrophication in lake winnipeg to date trend studies have typically focused on a single river or small portion of the basin e g jones and armstrong 2001 hebben 2007 ryberg 2017 shafiei and mcloughlin 2017 vecchia 2005 consequently there remains a gap in terms of a comprehensive long term analysis of trends in concentrations loadings and yields of nutrients and suspended solids for the major tributaries throughout the lake winnipeg basin but see ppwb 2016 environment canada 2011 the weighted regressions on time discharge and season wrtds hirsch et al 2010 hirsch and de cicco 2015 choquette et al 2019 model is designed for large long term datasets and is formulated to allow for maximum flexibility in representations of the long term trend seasonal and discharge related components of the behavior of the water quality variable of interest hirsch et al 2010 sprague et al 2011 to date it has been successfully applied to model nutrient loadings to the chesapeake bay river the mississippi river western lake erie and other areas experiencing eutrophication hirsch et al 2010 sprague et al 2011 choquette et al 2019 beck et al 2015 moreover it has performed favorably in comparisons to other common modelling approaches e g estimator loadest 5 loadest 7 for assessing trends in loadings e g beck et al 2015 hirsch 2014 as such the wrtds model is likely an effective means of determining trends in concentrations loads and yields of nutrients and suspended solids in rivers and streams of the lake winnipeg basin the goal of our study is to provide an assessment of long term trends in river nutrient and suspended solid concentrations loads and yields across the lake winnipeg basin we achieved this goal by using a wrtds model to first determine trends in concentrations and loads of total nitrogen total phosphorus and total suspended solids for the period of record of 1996 2016 for each of 18 river monitoring stations second we use wrtds generated trends for the 20 year period of record to assess spatial patterns in trends of nutrients and suspended solids across the lake winnipeg basin results of this study will serve as a baseline for comparison against future conditions resulting from management activities and climate change moreover it will identify regions in the lake winnipeg basin where nutrient and suspended solid loads may need increased management and study 2 methods 2 1 station selection and data sources the lake winnipeg basin drains an area of approximately 1 million km2 extending from the canadian rockies in the west the dakotas and minnesota in the south and the canadian shield in the east the basin consists of six major subdrainages the north south and lower saskatchewan river subdrainages the transboundary red assiniboine subdrainage the westward flowing winnipeg subdrainage and the eastern lake winnipeg subdrainage fig 1 the subdrainages span four u s states i e minnesota montana north dakota and south dakota and four canadian provinces alberta manitoba ontario and saskatchewan landscapes vary from the mountains and foothills in the headwaters in alberta to the parklands and prairies of saskatchewan manitoba and the dakotas to the mixed and boreal forests of minnesota ontario and eastern manitoba land use is primarily agricultural throughout the majority of the lake winnipeg basin with a small number of urban centers table s1 including calgary edmonton regina saskatoon winnipeg grand forks and fargo scattered across the basin natural forest cover dominates in the winnipeg subdrainage and in the headwaters of the north and south saskatchewan subdrainages our study of nutrient and suspended solid trends in the tributaries of lake winnipeg used publicly available data from 18 river monitoring stations in five of the major subdrainages table 1 to be included in the study monitoring stations were required to have data on discharge nutrients and suspended solids covering at minimum the period of 1996 2016 monitoring stations meeting these criteria spanned the five major subdrainages of the lake winnipeg basin and the major tributaries within it as rivers in the eastern lake winnipeg subdrainage did not have sufficient data to meet these criteria they were not included in the study selected stations were located in three canadian provinces alberta 8 stations saskatchewan 5 stations and manitoba 5 stations however two of the stations red and souris rivers were located near the canada usa border and captured drainage from the usa portion of the red assiniboine subdrainage moreover stations captured longitudinal variation across the saskatchewan river basin as stations were distributed along the north and south and lower sections of this system as well as on its key tributaries thus three rivers north saskatchewan bow and red deer ab had two stations each and these were differentiated as upstream and downstream stations consequently there was substantive variation in the drainage areas of the selected stations 1902 km2 to 373 000 km2 also the study included two distinct red deer rivers one with upstream and downstream stations that originates in alberta and flows into the south saskatchewan river and one that originates in saskatchewan and flows into red deer lake in manitoba although dams were present in some drainages all were constructed prior to the period of record used in our study hydrologic data at all 18 stations was obtained from water survey of canada https wateroffice ec gc ca mainmenu historical data index e html with the exception of 4 stations bow upstream south saskatchewan battle saskatchewan discharge and water quality were measured at the same location throughout the period of record discharge for the bow upstream station was predominantly measured at canmore however gaps in the canmore dataset were estimated from the gauging station at banff using a regression based on a 10 year flow period when discharge at both canmore and banff were measured the discharge for the south saskatchewan river station was calculated as the discharge of the south saskatchewan river at medicine hat plus the discharge of seven persons creek and ross creek discharge for the saskatchewan river above the carrot river was calculated as the discharge at the saskatchewan river at the pas minus the discharge of the carrot river the discharge station for the battle river was moved downstream in 1978 the pre 1978 discharge for the battle river was adjusted using a regression equation based on the 1978 1979 period when both stations were monitored wrtds requires daily discharge data and if data were missing it was either filled in via interpolation between the missing data points for short periods or estimated via a regression relationship with another station on the same river water quality data describing concentrations of total nitrogen total phosphorus and total suspended solids as a surrogate for sediments was obtained from environment and climate change canada eccc https www canada ca en environment climate change services freshwater quality monitoring online data html who monitored 15 of the stations and from the province of alberta https environment extranet gov ab ca apps waterquality dataportal who monitored 3 stations all water quality data were reviewed to identify and remove routine quality control replicates most stations were sampled once per month although occasionally some high frequency sampling occurred over the period of record data were thinned to 2 4 samples per month using a stratified random sampling approach when sampling frequency was high 2 2 analysis of trends for each of the 18 stations we analyzed flow normalized concentrations loads and yields of total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp and total suspended solids tss data from 1996 to 2016 daily loads measured in tonnes were calculated by multiplying daily flows with wrtds estimated daily concentrations annual loads are the sum of daily loads for each year yields were generated by dividing loads by the drainage area associated with each station s catchment and were expressed as kg km2 year trends in water quality parameters were analyzed with the weighted regressions on time discharge and season wrtds model hirsch et al 2010 hirsch and de cicco 2015 choquette et al 2019 the wrtds model uses a weighted regression approach to generate daily estimates of concentration and load the weights that are used are based on the similarity in time year discharge and season of the estimated day to the known observations for example if the model is estimating the concentration on june 1 2009 and the measured discharge on that day was 100 m3 s 1 data points in the year 2009 would be given higher weight than data points in the year 2000 data points in may june and july of any year would be given higher weights than data points in november december and january of any year and data points with discharge near 100 m3 s 1 would be given higher weight than data points with much lower or higher discharges the model produces daily time series of estimated concentrations and loads for the period of record an excellent overview of the model is provided by oelsner et al 2017 to reduce the impact of random year to year variations in flow that arise from large scale climatic events e g drought and flood years the wrtds models also generate daily flow normalized estimates of concentration and load as described by oelsner et al 2017 the flow normalization process for concentration creates a weighted regression for concentration on a given day for every historical discharge value that occurred on that day the mean of those concentration estimates is the flow normalized concentration for that day for example the model would estimate the flow normalized concentration on june 1 2009 by taking the mean of the model estimates run using discharge values that occurred on every june 1st during the period of record the flow normalized load for that day would be computed by taking the mean of the load estimates generated by multiplying each concentration estimate by its corresponding discharge value the magnitude of the total change over a specific time period is provided both as the change in value and as a percent change the change is further divided into two components a concentration component c vs q that describes what the change would be if there was no change in the probability distribution of discharge over time and a discharge component q that describes the amount of the trend that can be attributed to a change in the probability distribution of discharge choquette et al 2019 the latter components provide insight into the influence of non stationarity in flow e g increasing or decreasing flow over time on concentration and load trends the wrtds model was run with r software using the egret 3 0 and egretci 2 0 packages hirsch and de cicco 2015 model runs in egret 3 0 used default parameterization except for the windowside parameter which was set based on the presence or absence of non stationarity in flow and the windowq parameter which was set based on drainage basin area refer to hirsch and de cicco 2015 for parameter definitions the windowside parameter was set to 7 for stations that exhibited a trend in one or more discharge components and to 30 for stations that did not the windowq parameter was set to the default of 2 for basins 250 000 km2 and to 1 for basins 250 000 km2 the models were developed using the longest period of record available for the water quality parameters which ranged from 23 to 56 years to assess stationarity of flow trends in discharge measures i e minimum daily maximum daily median daily and mean daily flows were analyzed with the same period of record over which the models were developed using egret 3 0 and tested for significance using the mann kendall test α 0 1 water quality trends were assessed using the runpairs option for the 20 year period between 1996 and 2016 this 20 year period was selected because all stations had data for each parameter for that time period additional 20 year discharge trend analyses over the period 1996 2016 were conducted to understand the role of discharge in the water quality trend results goodness of fit for the wrtds models was assessed with the flux bias statistic hirsch 2014 if the flux bias statistic was greater than 0 2 potentially indicating a model bias of between 5 and 25 hirsch 2014 the model was excluded from further analysis a bootstrap test using the runpairsboot option in the egretci r package was used to estimate the uncertainty of water quality trends hirsch et al 2015 in the context of classical hypothesis testing the null hypothesis is that there is no change in flow normalized concentration flow normalized load between the selected years in the trend period namely 1996 2016 models were categorized as highly likely very likely likely or no trend depending upon the generated p value models where 1 p 0 95 to 1 0 were considered highly likely 2 p 0 90 to 0 95 were considered very likely 3 p 0 66 to 0 90 were considered likely and 4 p 0 33 to 0 66 were considered to have no trend 3 results 3 1 trends in nutrients and suspended solids fifty four trend models representing three water quality constituents for 18 river stations were completed table s2 of the 54 models 39 had little to no bias flux bias statistic 0 1 seven had some bias flux bias statistic 0 1 but 0 2 and eight had significant bias flux bias statistic 0 2 the wrtds method performed best for tn as all tn models had a flux bias statistic of less than 0 2 twelve of the tp models had little to no bias three had some bias and three had significant bias the tss models showed the most bias nine models had little to no bias four had some bias and five had significant bias biased models were restricted to locations in the north south and lower saskatchewan subdrainages the north saskatchewan downstream and the oldman river stations accounted for half of the significantly biased models biased models were not analyzed further all results presented hereafter reflect flow normalized concentrations and loads of tn tp and tss however for the sake of brevity we do not indicate flow normalized in each instance 3 2 total nitrogen mean annual average tn concentration from 1996 to 2016 ranged from 0 14 0 01 mg l north saskatchewan river upstream to 3 09 0 10 mg l souris river table s3 annual average tn concentration generally increased over the 20 year study period at all stations in the red assiniboine and lower saskatchewan subdrainages except the souris and saskatchewan rivers respectively fig s1 in contrast annual average tn concentrations were generally lower in 2016 compared to 1996 in the lower saskatchewan and winnipeg river subdrainages and were variable in the south saskatchewan subdrainage mean annual tn load over the period of record ranged from 231 20 tonnes north saskatchewan river upstream to 16 852 746 tonnes winnipeg river table s3 moreover the mean annual tn loads at the red saskatchewan and winnipeg river stations were all nearly twice that of the rest of the assessed stations temporal patterns of annual tn loads generally increased from 1996 to 2016 in stations in the red assiniboine lower saskatchewan and winnipeg subdrainages decreased across the north saskatchewan subdrainage stations and were variable among the stations of the south saskatchewan subdrainage fig s2 of the 18 stations eight stations had mean annual yields in excess of 100 kg km2 yr four stations had yields ranging from 8 to 50 kg km2 yr whereas the remaining stations fell somewhere in between 50 and 100 kg km2 yr table s3 annual yields of tn exhibited similar temporal patterns to annual loads fig s3 from 1996 2016 nine of the 18 stations had increasing trends in tn concentration seven stations had decreasing trends and two stations exhibited no trend fig 2 top the total percentage increase in tn concentration over the 20 year period ranged from about 5 bow river downstream to 49 red deer ab downstream or 0 3 2 5 per year decreasing concentration trends occurred at 7 stations where the total percentage change over the 20 year period ranged from about 5 oldman river to 38 north saskatchewan river downstream or 0 3 to 1 9 per year substantial contributions to the total increase in tn concentration from changes in discharge i e q component were evident at the south saskatchewan river bow river downstream and pembina river stations and to a lesser degree the red deer mb river and carrot river stations the red river station was the only station where the discharge trend component was negative in terms of tn load and yield 13 stations had increasing trends and five stations had decreasing trends fig 2 bottom the percentage increase over the 20 year period in tn load ranged from 0 2 winnipeg to 247 red deer mb or 0 01 12 4 per year five of the 13 stations assiniboine carrot qu appelle red deer mb and souris all had increases in load that were over 100 when taken over the 20 year period the percentage decrease in tn load was similar at the five stations ranging from 12 north saskatchewan upstream to 27 oldman or 0 6 to 1 35 per year over the 20 year period the q component accounted for the large percentage increases in load 100 at the assiniboine carrot qu appelle red deer mb and souris stations 3 3 total phosphorus the mean annual tp concentration over the period of record ranged from 0 009 0 003 mg l bow river upstream to 0 44 0 07 mg l souris river table s4 fig s4 throughout the years the range of mean annual tp concentrations was smallest at the north saskatchewan upstream station 0 005 mg l and greatest at the souris river where the range of 0 27 mg l was more than double that of the second largest range observed in the red river 0 11 mg l annual average tp concentrations were largely increasing over time at three stations in the red assiniboine subdrainages i e pembina qu appelle and red fig s5 general increases from 1996 to 2016 were also observed at all stations in the lower saskatchewan and winnipeg subdrainages except in the saskatchewan river declining annual average tp concentrations were variable over time in the north and south saskatchewan subdrainages the mean annual tp load over the period of record ranged from 25 tonnes bow river upstream to 2546 tonnes red river table s4 fig s5 temporal patterns in annual tp loads were predominantly increasing from 1996 2016 in all subdrainages except the north and south saskatchewan subdrainages where patterns were more variable when loads were converted to yields the saskatchewan river station became one of the lowest yielding stations along with the qu appelle river station whereas the pembina river became one of the highest yielding stations along with the south saskatchewan and red river stations table s4 fig s6 similar to annual tp loads tp yields generally increased between 1996 and 2016 at stations in the red assiniboine winnipeg and lower saskatchewan subdrainages but were more variable in the stations of the north and south saskatchewan subdrainages tp concentrations of the 15 stations with unbiased models trended upward for 8 of the stations fig 3 top three of the remaining stations exhibited no trend and the other 4 exhibited decreasing trends of the increasing trends six stations had total percent increases of 20 or greater and except the red deer ab river downstream were located in the lower saskatchewan and red assiniboine subdrainages rivers exhibiting highly likely decreasing trends were all about 45 total change the q or discharge component comprised a negligible portion of the percent total change in tp concentration trends at all but 4 locations and only at 2 stations located in the lower saskatchewan subdrainage was the q component the dominant source of change trends in tp load and yield were primarily increasing 12 stations fig 3 bottom red deer upstream and battle river exhibited decreasing trends and the bow river upstream exhibited stationarity increasing trends captured total changes ranging from 21 in the winnipeg river to 335 in the red deer mb river ten stations exhibited increasing trends leading to total percent change of greater than 50 over the 20 year period of record unlike trends in tp concentration increasing trends in tp load were primarily associated with the q component in particular the q component was responsible for at least half and in one case all of the total percent change in tp load for stations within the red assiniboine rivers and lower saskatchewan subdrainages 3 4 total suspended solids mean annual tss concentration from 1996 2016 ranged from 3 2 0 29 mg l winnipeg river to 242 38 mg l red deer river downstream table s5 fig s7 annual average tss concentrations generally increased over the study period across the red assiniboine subdrainage stations and were mostly increasing in the south saskatchewan subdrainage in contrast tss concentration were typically smaller in 2016 than in 1996 in the winnipeg river subdrainage temporal patterns were variable in the lower and north saskatchewan subdrainages the mean annual tss load over the period of record ranged from 5547 1370 tonnes souris river to 2191 429 346 361 tonnes south saskatchewan river table s5 fig s8 over the years the smallest loads all less than 100 000 tonnes were found in the souris assiniboine bow upstream qu appelle and carrot stations the stations with the highest tss load were the red deer ab downstream red and south saskatchewan with loads that generally were two orders of magnitude larger than those of the five lowest stations the north saskatchewan river upstream station had the largest yields table s5 fig s9 in addition the pembina river bow river upstream and the south saskatchewan river stations also had yields in excess of 20 000 kg km2 in most years and most commonly in the last ten years of record similar to tss loads temporal patterns in tss yields were largely increasing in the red assiniboine subdrainage and most south saskatchewan subdrainages in contrast tss yields were declining in the winnipeg river subdrainage and variable in the lower and north saskatchewan subdrainages of the 13 stations where tss concentrations were successfully modeled eight exhibited increasing trends three showed decreasing trends and two had no trend fig 4 top the greatest change in tss concentration was observed for the assiniboine river 130 in addition the red and red deer ab downstream stations exhibited increases of nearly or greater than 100 however at the red river and red deer ab downstream stations the change in tss concentration was entirely associated with the c vs q component whereas in the assiniboine river nearly a third of the change was associated with the q component except for the bow river upstream all stations exhibiting increasing trends in mean annual tss concentration had the majority of change associated with the c vs q component stations with decreasing trends indicated that change in mean annual tss concentrations were primarily attributed to the q component moreover stations with decreasing trends all showed less than a 30 decrease in contrast to mean annual tss concentrations mean annual tss loads and yields were primarily increasing 10 of 13 and with the exception of two stations bow river upstream and red deer river ab downstream change was dominated by the q component fig 4 bottom change exceeded 100 at five stations including a near 300 increase at the bow river downstream station and a greater than 450 increase at the assiniboine river station stations with decreasing trends were the north saskatchewan river upstream and the winnipeg river however decreases represented a less than 20 change at these two stations 3 5 discharge trends discharge varied substantially among the evaluated monitoring stations with mean annual average discharges from 6 49 4 45 m3 s 1 in the battle river to 1050 294 m3 s 1 in the winnipeg river fig s10 among station variation in mean annual average discharge was generally associated with drainage area r 0 68 although the stations within the red assiniboine subdrainage had lower discharge by area and the headwater stations of the north and south saskatchewan subdrainages exhibited greater discharge than their drainage areas would predict the range in mean annual discharge over the 20 year study period was largest in the winnipeg river with a range of 1085 m3 s 1 and smallest in the battle river range 16 2 m3 s 1 mann kendall tests indicated that there were no significant trends in any of the tested annual measures of discharge at ten of the 18 stations p 0 1 table 2 of the remaining 8 stations only the assiniboine carrot and red deer mb rivers exhibited a trend for more than one discharge metric moreover increases for these metrics all exceeded 5 year indeed the assiniboine and carrot rivers both showed trend slope estimates greater than 10 year in minimum and maximum annual discharge as well as for mean annual discharge in the case of the assiniboine 3 6 spatial assessment spatial assessment of trends in metrics describing tn tp and tss in rivers across the lake winnipeg basin revealed clear patterns in subdrainages experiencing increasing concentrations load and yield fig 5 in particular all five modelled rivers in the red assiniboine subdrainage showed increasing trends in load and yields of all three water quality parameters moreover the only decreasing trends in the red assiniboine rivers subdrainage were observed at the souris river station where concentrations of tn and tp were declining in contrast to the red assiniboine subdrainage was the north saskatchewan subdrainage where the only increasing trend was observed for tp concentration at the battle river station trends in the south and lower saskatchewan subdrainages were more variable among stations with some stations showing increasing trends in all metrics of all parameters e g carrot river and some stations exhibiting a mix of increasing and decreasing trends e g bow river upstream lower saskatchewan river depending upon the parameter examined 4 discussion in this study a water quality modelling tool wrtds was applied to twenty year records of monitoring data describing discharge tp tn and tss across the lake winnipeg basin trend analysis revealed basin wide increases in concentrations loads and yields of nitrogen and phosphorus and to a lesser extent suspended solids increases in nutrient and suspended solid loads were driven by co occurring changes discharge but this was not the case for concentrations increasing trends in nutrients suspended solids were particularly pronounced for rivers within the red assiniboine subdrainage application of the wrtds modelling tool provided insight into the nature of trends and the probable drivers and will thereby provide managers with critical information to focus management actions aimed at protecting lake winnipeg 4 1 comparison to past trend studies in the lake winnipeg basin we observed increasing trends in concentrations of tn and tp at approximately half of the sixteen stations this proportion is significantly greater than has been reported in past studies of the same stations ppwb 2016 jones and armstrong 2001 environment canada 2011 for example the prairie provinces water board ppwb 2016 assessed trends from 1973 to 2008 at nine stations that we also studied however only one station the lower saskatchewan showed the same trends in both our study and the ppwb study moreover the ppwb study showed increasing trends of tn and tp concentrations at only two and three stations respectively whereas we observed increasing tn and tp trends at six of the common sites likewise a similarly small number of sites with increasing tn and tp concentration trends three stations for each were reported in a trend assessment by environment canada 2011 spanning the years 1996 2006 a study spanning 1973 1999 by jones and armstrong 2001 that used the same 9 sites in manitoba that we studied had better agreement with our study in terms of trends in tp concentrations indeed the four sites they observed to have increasing trends were also increasing in our study period however we also observed increasing trends at two sites the jones and armstrong 2001 study did not including the qu appelle river station which showed a strong decreasing trend in this past study increasing trends in nutrient concentrations predominantly occurred in rivers within the red assiniboine south saskatchewan and lower saskatchewan subdrainages ppwb 2016 and environment canada 2011 also observed increasing tn and tp concentration trends at stations in the lower saskatchewan but did not identify trends at any of the stations in the red assiniboine or south saskatchewan drainages in contrast a more recent trend analysis of the red and pembina river stations by nustad and vecchia 2020 spanning the years 2000 2015 also observed increasing trends in tp concentration similar to our observations however unlike our study the nustad and vecchia 2020 study found no trend in tn concentrations increasing trends in tss concentrations were observed in 9 stations within the red assiniboine and south saskatchewan subdrainages the ppwb 2016 study also found increasing trends in two of these stations the carrot and assiniboine but did not identify trends in the other seven rivers we studied there was also no agreement between the two sites shared between our study and the nustad and vecchia 2020 study as the usgs study found no trend at the red river station and a decreasing trend at the pembina river station unlike trends in nutrient concentrations there has been no previous assessments of trends in nutrient loads across the entire lake winnipeg basin however a study by bourne et al 2002 did assess trends in tp loads from the mid 1970 s to 1999 for the nine stations in manitoba that we observed to all be increasing in tp loads from 1996 to 2016 as the period of record included in the bourne et al 2002 study almost fully precedes the period of record we assessed direct comparisons are not practical however the findings of bourne et al 2002 study can provide insight into potential changes in trend direction of stations our studies shared indeed based on bourne et al 2002 it appears that the rapidly increasing tp loads in the red river we observed have been occurring for at least the past four decades likewise the increasing tp loads at the pembina carrot and winnipeg stations also appear to be continuations of trends from previous decades in contrast the increasing tp loads we observed for the remaining five manitoba stations suggest that these increases have only become apparent in the 2000 s in particular the qu appelle river station was found by bourne et al 2001 to have a decreasing trend in tp load whereas we found an increasing trend the observed discrepancies in the trends in concentration and loads between our study and past assessments likely arise from either differences in the temporal scopes of the studies or in the approaches to establishing trends as our study emphasizes more recent conditions the more frequent occurrence of increasing trends suggests that conditions in the lake winnipeg basin have been changing since the start of the 21st century and are leading to greater concentrations and loads of nutrients and sediments in this region s rivers trend detection methods may also have had an effect although it is difficult to directly establish method effects because of co occurring differences in temporal scope however comparison to the study by the nustad and vecchia 2020 which used r qwtrends vecchia and nustad 2020 to assess a similar period of record to our study 2000 2015 vs 1996 2016 respectively for the red and pembina stations may provide some insight into the importance of the method interestingly there was little consistency between our study and the usgs study as only trends in concentration and load of tp were in agreement suggesting that method may have a significant impact on whether a trend is identified however because the record lengths are not identical it is difficult to fully disentangle if differences in method is the source of disagreement we recommend formal comparisons of trend detection methods be undertaken to better enable study comparison and inform managers of changes in nutrients and sediments in the lake winnipeg basin 4 2 role of discharge as a driver of nutrient and suspended solids trends increases in runoff and discharge appear to be primarily responsible for the co occurring increasing trends in loads and yields of tn tp and tss indeed increasing trends in tn and tp had q components i e the part of the change due to discharge that were 80 or larger at all stations in the lower saskatchewan as well as four of the five stations in the red assiniboine likewise all stations with increasing trends in tss had q components that exceeded 50 thus our observations suggest that rivers throughout much of the lake winnipeg basin are experiencing runoff driven increases in nutrient and sediment loadings from non point sources such as agricultural lands however as the amount of agricultural lands in the basin has not significantly changed over the period of record used in our study anon 2016 it is likely changes in agricultural practices and intensity that are responsible for the increased loadings increasing non point source loadings to lake winnipeg basin tributaries because of greater agricultural intensity is consistent with reports of greater intensity of n and p fertilizer use as well as greater numbers of livestock in agricultural areas across the basin dorff and beaulieu 2014 it is also possible that our findings reflect increases in the contributing areas in many of the lake winnipeg basin subdrainages as a result of wetland drainage leading to greater discharge and subsequent nutrient and sediment loadings from uplands baulch et al 2021 dumanski et al 2015 as fully elucidating the sources of nutrients and sediments was beyond the scope of our study future assessments are needed to more accurately identify the key sources to these tributaries disparities between station q components and trends of annual discharge indicates temporal shifts in the character of individual runoff events rather than annual discharge are responsible for increasing nutrient and sediment loads across much of the lake winnipeg basin moreover as annual discharge in lake winnipeg basin tributaries is typically strongly associated with the quantity of snowmelt gray and landine 1988 our observations of stable annual discharge in most tributaries also suggests that trends in nutrient and sediment loads are the result of runoff events outside of snowmelt an increasing role of individual events in the hydrology in the lake winnipeg basin is consistent with predictions and observations of increasing precipitation particularly in the summer season in the easternmost areas of the lake winnipeg basin dumanski et al 2015 debeer et al 2016 dibike et al 2021 thus in addition to providing insight into the timing and type of events that are likely driving nutrient and sediment loading trends in the lake winnipeg basin our study also demonstrates the advantages of using an approach such as wrtds that incorporates shorter temporal scales in trend assessments as opposed to annual scaled data 4 3 modelling limitations and caveats our study incorporated datasets generated from water quality and discharge measurements that were long in record and high in frequency as such known limitations of the wrtds model such as those described by oelsner et al 2017 are not anticipated to have greatly impacted our findings however the nature of the wrtds model does entail that trends are assessed over the entire period of record and may thus not detect changes in a parameter s trajectory near the beginning or more importantly the end of the record indeed directional transitions appear to occur in the latter half of the records at several of our studied stations e g south saskatchewan saskatchewan and winnipeg rivers although such directional changes may only represent short term variation these inflection points may also be indicative of a broad change in a station s catchment condition we recommend that these stations be revisited in the near future to establish if these short term patterns reflect a lasting shift in nutrient and sediment trends 4 4 linkages to eutrophication of lake winnipeg our findings support and corroborate hypotheses and data related to the rapid eutrophication of lake winnipeg through the 1990 s and early 2000 s in particular our observations demonstrate clear trends of increasing nutrient loads to lake winnipeg that correspond to the rapid increase in mean mid summer phytoplankton biomass observed in the lake by mccullough et al 2012 moreover our finding that increases in tributary discharge particularly those in the red assiniboine subdrainage supports hypotheses by schindler et al 2012 that increasing stream flow is a key driver of the eutrophication of lake winnipeg finally our finding of disproportionate increases in nutrient loads in the red assiniboine subdrainage supports calls emphasizing management of this transboundary subdrainage to meet nutrient reduction targets aimed at rehabilitating lake winnipeg e g lwsb 2006 anon 2015 anon 2020 however some caution is required in linking our findings to conditions in lake winnipeg as many of these stations flow through lakes or reservoirs prior to entering the lake e g saskatchewan river flows through cedar lake prior to draining to lake winnipeg these lentic environments may act as sinks of nutrients and sediments and thus management actions in the subdrainages may provide less benefit to lake winnipeg than would be anticipated from the loads and yields we report 5 conclusion the findings of our study have two critical implications for the management of the lake winnipeg basin first our analyses have revealed several long term trends in river borne nutrients that may lead to further impairment of lake winnipeg indeed it appears that land management practices aimed at reducing nutrient loads to lake winnipeg should be prioritized towards the rivers of the red assiniboine and lower saskatchewan subdrainages as these areas showed both the largest and most rapidly increasing nutrient loads observed throughout the basin we recommend that trend analyses be undertaken in these hotspot subdrainages to better understand the role of land use and land management changes as potential drivers of nutrient loads in these systems second by using the wrtds modelling approach we have established a baseline for future spatial and temporal assessments of nutrients and suspended solids in the lake winnipeg basin this baseline will enable periodic trend analyses to track changes over time and determine the effectiveness of management actions in the basin in particular we suggest that future analyses consider loads and concentrations of dissolved fractions of nutrients as well as seasonally specific trends to further explain the potential roles of land use and climate as drivers of river borne nutrients and sediments in the lake

7827,study region licungo basin mozambique study focus the licungo basin 23 263 km2 suffers frequent severe flooding due to tropical storms in a country that is among the world s most vulnerable in terms of exposure to weather related hazards and climate change we propose a methodology for the estimation of the population exposed to flooding at the catchment scale in data scarce regions combining satellite imagery with integrated high resolution hydrological hydraulic modelling all the input data needed are retrieved from freely available global satellite products the numerical model is also freeware the methodology is therefore replicable worldwide an estimate of the flood extent and exposed population during tropical storm ana january 2022 is presented as a case study new hydrological insights for the region current freely available satellite products in combination with high resolution hydrological hydraulic models can be used to estimate the population exposed to flooding in the whole catchment this estimate is more realistic than the one obtained using satellite imagery alone since satellite images are very rarely taken at the time of maximum flooding using the proposed methodology we estimate that over 273 000 people out of 1 5 million were exposed to flooding in the licungo basin during tropical storm ana this represents 18 of the basin population and is 8 times larger than the estimate obtained using only the available satellite images graphical abstract ga1 keywords tropical storms flood hazard global digital elevation models sentinel 1 imagery iber model data scarce regions data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction vulnerability to river floods has increased throughout whole world in recent decades but most intensively in developing countries cao et al 2022 douglas et al 2008 di baldassarre et al 2010 rentschler et al 2022 tate et al 2021 tramblay et al 2014 wing et al 2018 moreover a number of studies indicate that flood risk is expected to increase further in coming decades due to climate change urbanization of river floodplains and changes in land use at the catchment scale areu rangel et al 2019 arnell and gosling 2016 hirabayashi et al 2013 jenkins et al 2017 jongman et al 2012 liu et al 2018 in this global context african countries are especially exposed to flood damage due to the social and economic vulnerability of their communities and to the extreme magnitude of the flood events in large rivers and basins revilla romero et al 2014 one example here is mozambique which occupies the 8th position in a ranking of 178 countries in the ecological threat report index a composite risk index based on 5 indicators rapid population growth water risk food risk temperature anomalies and natural disasters that together measure the impact of ecological threats that countries will face between now and 2050 institute for economics and peace 2021 according to the ecological threat report the population of mozambique is expected to double over the next 30 years from 32 2 million in 2021 to 65 3 million in 2050 a significant proportion of the population lives close to the river network this in order to have access to surface water resources and to fertile lands since subsistence farming constitutes the food base for many rural communities as a consequence of all this in 2020 the country had a prevalence of food insecurity of 71 10th highest in the world and a prevalence of undernourishment of 31 13th highest in the world institute for economics and peace 2021 for these reasons in recent years several developing countries including mozambique have made significant efforts to put disaster risk reduction policies in place including the evaluation of flood risk and the establishment of flood mitigation measures this has been supported by funds from the european commission and eu member states the u s agency for international development the world bank and various ngos one example of this is the intervention in the licungo basin mozambique carried out by the humanitarian implementation plan in 2018 which was supported by the directorate general for european civil protection and humanitarian operations echo the main objective being the strengthening of local preparedness and response capacities by linking early warning to early action to this end the identification of flood prone areas population exposed to flood risk main infrastructures affected by floods and safe evacuation routes all contribute significantly to the development and improvement of disaster management plans by the local and regional authorities such information also contributes to the implementation of flood early warning systems ews a type of flood mitigation measure that has been implemented in recent years in many developed and underdeveloped countries both on the local level fraga et al 2020 gonzález cao et al 2019 cools et al 2012 krajewski et al 2017 and at a national or transnational scale alfieri et al 2013 weerts et al 2011 wu et al 2014 thielen et al 2009 the evaluation of flood hazard in large basins is usually done by coupling a hydrological model that computes the water discharge along the river network of the whole catchment with a 2d hydrodynamic model that transforms water discharge into water depths velocities and flood extent at the river reach scale bermúdez et al 2017 komi et al 2017 nogherotto et al 2019 the use of lumped hydrological models in data scarce regions is very constrained due to the high dependency of such models on the availability of observed data for the calibration of parameters merz et al 2011 on the other hand physically based distributed models are to a certain degree less dependent on the calibration of input parameters and can therefore be useful tools to estimate flood hazard in regions where hydrometric data are scarce cornelissen et al 2013 nonetheless they require large amounts of spatially distributed data to define the catchment topography land uses and soil types regarding the evaluation of water depths and velocities at the river reach scale the most commonly used models today are those based on the2d fully dynamic shallow water eq 2d swe due to the capacity of these to reproduce complex local flow patterns although alternatives are available including different simplifications of the 2d swe as well as 1d 2d coupled models an alternative to the coupled hydrologic hydrodynamic modelling approach is to perform an integrated hydrological hydrodynamic simulation at the catchment scale until recently this was prohibitive because of the computational cost of modelling such a large domain with a hydrodynamic model but advances in high performance computing hpc and the development of new numerical schemes for solving the 2d swe at the catchment scale including rainfall and infiltration processes opens up the possibility of modelling rainfall runoff transformation and river hydraulics within a single integrated simulation over an entire catchment cea and blade 2015 garcía feal et al 2018 khaing et al 2019 xia et al 2019 a review of flood hazard modelling approaches can be found in cea and costabile 2022 and teng et al 2017 however one of the main handicaps in the improvement of flood management in developing countries and particularly in africa is the scarcity of quality hydrological and meteorological data which precludes a robust and accurate calibration of hydrological and hydraulic flood hazard models komi et al 2017 sampson et al 2015 sanyal et al 2014 tramblay et al 2014 on the other hand over the last decade a large number of satellite remote sensing data related to water resources has been made available by international institutions and agencies such as the national aeronautics and space administration nasa the european space agency esa and the japan aerospace exploration agency jaxa these data include digital terrain models dtm quantitative precipitation estimations qpe land uses soil types soil moisture and surface water extent among others the spatial and temporal resolution of these data products is not as detailed and accurate as data from national observation networks in developed countries but they are of great value in conducting flood hazard studies in developing countries or at a transnational scale dottori et al 2016 kugler and de groeve 2007 kundu et al 2015 pappenberger et al 2010 sakamoto et al 2007 sampson et al 2015 winsemius et al 2013 yamazaki et al 2011 in addition to the characterisation of flood hazard flood risk management plans require information on vulnerability and population exposure to floods to date those variables have received far less attention than flood hazard smith et al 2019 even though they provide information that is essential as a means of establishing emergency plans and of estimating economic and social losses detailed maps of the spatial distribution of population calka et al 2017 winsemius et al 2013 and transport infrastructures are of great value in evaluating the real exposure of a population to floods and the safest routes of evacuation in case of flooding watik and jaelani 2019 for this purpose several population data sets are currently available calka et al 2017 smith et al 2019 the main purpose of the present study is to propose a methodology for the estimation of the population exposed to river flooding at the catchment scale in data scarce regions combining satellite imagery with an integrated high resolution hydrological hydraulic modelling approach based on the model iber bladé et al 2014 garcía feal et al 2018 all the input data needed to apply the proposed methodology is retrieved from remote sensing open data sources at the global scale the estimate of the flood extent and population affected by the inundation caused by the recent tropical storm ana january 2022 in the licungo basin mozambique 23 263 km2 is presented as a case study over a 24 hour period this tropical storm left a basin averaged rainfall depth of 200 mm reaching values of 350 mm at certain locations the licungo basin suffers flooding almost every year as a consequence of tropical storms and cyclones this in a country with one of the highest exposures to weather related hazards flooding cyclones and drought and climate change in the world according to the international disaster database cred 2022 floods and storms represent respectively 35 6 and 23 7 of the 118 natural disasters that have affected mozambique over the last 56 years 1967 2022 the death toll associated with these closely related events in that period exceeds 100 000 people while the total population affected was over 40 million with economic losses estimated as 5 6 billion usd representing 56 2 of the total losses due to natural hazards in mozambique whereas the present study focusses on the licungo basin the methodology proposed can be applied worldwide since all the data and software required are freely available on the world wide web and is therefore of especial interest in data scarce regions and developing countries the following sections of the paper are organized thus section 2 presents a description of the licungo basin and the main facts relating to tropical storm ana the methodology open data sources and numerical model used in this study plus their relation to other available data packages and models is described in section 3 in section 4 we present and discuss the results related to flood extent and population affected by tropical storm ana finally section 5 summarizes the main conclusions including the advantages and limitations of the study 2 case study mozambique is a country with a high exposure to natural hazards and climate variability world bank 2019a b and is a paradigm of southeast africa vulnerability to floods over 60 of its population is concentrated on the coastline which is located on the path of tropical cyclones tc and tropical storms ts that form in or pass through the western part of the indian ocean wmo 2019 the country s exposure and vulnerability to floods is exacerbated by its relatively flat topography and scarce vegetation cover on average one ts or tc hits the coast of mozambique every two years between the months of october and april however the frequency of these tropical events has increased in recent years due to higher ocean temperatures brought about by climate change in the first months of 2022 mozambique was affected by two ts and one tc ts ana gdacs 2022a ocha 2022a ts dumako ocha 2022b and tc gombe gdacs 2022b ocha 2022c these three events had an impact on extensive areas of central and north mozambique the regions of zambezia and nampula were affected by all three of them within a period of approximately two months as a consequence and according to the estimates of the national institute for disaster management of mozambique ingd over one million people were affected around 10 000 people were displaced and more than 100 people died the floods affected over 200 000 ha with serious damages to crop production and food security according to the latest data released by the ingd these three storms also destroyed 153 611 houses damaged 95 health centres 46 water supply systems 2902 power poles 4436 km of roads and 781 schools impacting a total of 353 485 students the licungo basin is located in northern mozambique and has an area of approximately 23 263 km2 fig 1 the axis of the basin follows an nw se orientation and is 343 km long the average altitude is 474 m above mean sea level with the highest altitude at 2348 m the average slope of the basin hills is 10 6 which can be described as moderately sloping approximately 58 of the basin has a flat to undulating topography with slopes ranging from 0 to 8 the mozambique national water resources plan identifies the licungo as one of the 11 basins in the country most exposed to flood damage over the last 52 years the licungo basin has experienced catastrophic floods in the following years 1970 1984 1995 1998 2014 2015 2019 and 2022 among these the most severe in terms of material economic and human life damages occurred in 2015 and was associated with the tropical cyclone events chedza and bansi drrt 2015 recently during the first trimester of 2022 and barely one month apart the aforementioned ts ana ts dumako and tc gombe caused severe flooding and extensive damage in the basin according to the köppen geiger climate classification the licungo is located in a tropical savanna area the average annual precipitation over the basin in the period 1981 2010 as estimated using the chirps climate hazards centre infrared precipitation with station data pentadal data set funk et al 2015 was 1518 mm although there are regions in the centre and northeast of the basin in which the annual precipitation exceeds 2000 mm the rainy season extends from october to march in which about 80 of total annual precipitation is typically experienced the basin is divided into 9 administrative districts these subdivided into a total of 22 administrative posts ap as shown in fig 1 the main population settlements are the cities of mocuba located at the confluence of the licungo and lugela rivers in the central part of the basin and gurué in the northeast of the basin the communities most vulnerable to flooding are those located in the middle and lower part of the basin ap of mocuba mugeba munhamade macuze namacurra and nante in this study we focused on the evaluation of the effects of ts ana in terms of population exposed to flooding within the licungo basin ts ana took place between 24 01 2022 and 27 01 2022 leaving a basin averaged rainfall depth of 200 mm in the first 24 h and maximum rainfall depths of 350 mm at certain locations in the basin according to the report issued on 14 02 2022 by the united nations office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs ocha ts ana affected 185 429 people leading to 38 deaths and injuries to a further 207 people and destroyed 11 757 houses across the whole of mozambique ocha 2022a the final numbers were probably even greater given that this evaluation of damages was carried out just two weeks after the storm 3 data and methodology 3 1 open data sources the different satellite data sets used in this study are listed in table 1 which also includes the url where each data set can be accessed freely the spatial resolution varies from 10 m to 10 km depending on the data set the following sections describe the most pertinent features of each data set for hydrological modelling purposes as well as the relations to alternative satellite data sources 3 1 1 digital elevation model having a digital elevation model with the highest available spatial resolution and vertical accuracy is probably the most important requirement for a successful flood simulation this is especially true for data scarce regions where the availability of topographic data are limited to satellite remote sensors álvarez et al 2017 currently there are several global digital elevation models gdem that were obtained after processing data from satellite missions carried out by international space agencies some of the gdem commonly used in hydrological studies are those issued by the shuttle radar topography mission srtm from the us geological survey farr et al 2007 the advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer aster from nasa tadono et al 2014 the advanced land observing satellite alos from jaxa abrams 2000 and the tandem x data set from the german aerospace agency and airbus rizzoli et al 2017 the srtm data were obtained during a single 11 day mission in 2000 and is the basis for several gdem that have been processed by different algorithms e g void and sink filling removal of outliers smoothing of elevation or merging with other satellite data among others in order to reduce vertical errors and to facilitate the application of the data to hydrological studies some srtm based gdem commonly used in hydrological studies are srtm v3 the one provided by the cgiar consortium for spatial information cgiar csi the bare earth dem o loughlin et al 2016 the multi error removed improved terrain merit yamazaki et al 2017 and the recently released nasadem which was obtained after reprocessing the entire original srtm raw data set with improved processing algorithms and is expected to be nasa s finest resolution 1 arc sec roughly 30 m freely available gdem product for the foreseeable future the srtm data are also used in the hydrosheds package hydrological data and maps based on shuttle elevation derivatives at multiple scales that includes global digital data layers as catchment boundaries river networks and lakes at multiple resolutions and scales lehner et al 2008 most of these dem products cgiar bare earth merit hydrosheds v1 are provided at 3 arc sec resolutions roughly 90 m while only two nasadem and srtm v3 at 1 arc sec roughly 30 m the tandem x mission is far more recent than srtm the data were obtained between 2011 and 2015 and consists of two twin satellites tandem x and terrasar x that orbit the earth in close formation krieger et al 2013 zink et al 2021 the main practical improvements over srtm is that the tandem x mission covers the entire earth also the highest latitudes above 60o n and below 60o s with a higher vertical accuracy lower than 2 m and a horizontal resolution of 12 m although data with this resolution is not freely available the original version of the tandem x dem is a non edited product which leads to local errors that typically appear on ridges and canyons marešová et al 2021 airbus defence and space released an edited commercial version of tandem x with a spatial resolution of 12 m known as worlddem which significantly improves the vertical accuracy of other available gdems bayburt et al 2017 and which was used by the european space agency esa to generate three copernicus dems eea 10 0 4 arc sec glo 30 1 arc sec and glo 90 3 arc sec the first of these covering only european states tandem x data are also being used to produce the next version of the hydrosheds package recent studies indicate that copernicus glo 30 is the dem with the best overall performance that is freely available guth and geoffroy 2021 assessed the performance of copernicus glo 30 in eight regions representing a variety of reliefs and concluded that it provides the best representation of the terrain when compared to other commonly used 1 arc sec dems alos aster nasadem and srtm v3 maresova et al 2021 compared the performance of several gdems in three european mountain ranges alps pyrenees and carpathians showing that copernicus glo 30 gives a more accurate representation of the terrain than tandem x srtm v3 and nasadem garrote 2022 analysed the suitability for hydraulic modelling of eight freely available gdems in a river reach of the licungo basin and in line with the previous studies concluded that copernicus glo 30 is clearly the best option for hydraulic modelling in this region although we didn t perform a detailed comparison of all the previous gdems for modelling purposes in the licungo basin we did compare the topography and water depths obtained with srtm v3 and copernicus glo 30 concluding that glo 30 clearly outperforms srtm v3 in this case with a far more precise and less noisy definition of the main channel and floodplains fig 2 considering the previous studies and especially the comparative dem analysis presented by garrote 2022 applied to flood modelling in a reach of the licungo river we used copernicus glo 30 to represent the topography of the whole licungo catchment fig 2 in the integrated hydrological hydraulic modelling performed with iber 3 1 2 rainfall a correct characterization of the spatial and temporal variability of rainfall is of utmost importance for the estimation of flood hazard the spatial and temporal resolution of the rainfall input in hydrological models must be in accordance with the catchment characteristics that determine its characteristic response time during a storm event land cover size slopes drainage network and shape in small catchments of a few km2 a time resolution of 10 15 min and a spatial resolution of 1 km is usually needed for larger catchments over a thousand km2 a time resolution of one hour and a spatial resolution of 10 km are generally sufficient precipitation gauges still provide the most accurate point estimates of rainfall intensity however their practical application is limited due to the sparse spatial distribution of gauges over the majority of african countries on the other hand satellite rainfall estimates although less accurate than rain gauge data have an almost global coverage and provide valuable products for hydrological simulations in data scarce regions liu et al 2020 in recent years several satellite missions providing satellite rainfall estimates sre have become operational and their products are freely available however for most of these the temporal resolution is too low for use in flood inundation studies being oriented towards water resources or climate change studies for the evaluation of extreme floods the following are worth mentioning the precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks persiann hsu and sorooshian 2008 the persiann ccs hong et al 2004 nguyen et al 2018 the global satellite mapping of precipitation gsmap kubota et al 2007 the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm huffman et al 2007 and the global precipitation measurement gpm mission huffman et al 2020 the trmm operated from 1997 to 2015 providing rainfall estimates between latitudes 35on and 35os with a time resolution of 3 h and a spatial resolution of 0 25o roughly 25 km that have been used in many flood studies curtis et al 2007 harris et al 2007 komi et al 2017 li et al 2009 tekeli et al 2016 yang et al 2017 the gpm mission is the follow up to the trmm that was launched in order to continue and improve upon satellite based rainfall and snowfall observations on a global scale the level 3 integrated multi satellite retrievals for gpm imerg product provides precipitation estimates since march 2014 within the 60o n s latitude band from the combined use of passive microwave pmw and infrared ir sensors the gpm imerg data set is available in the form of near real time data divided into three different categories near real time early run er with a latency of 4 h near real time reprocessed late run lr with a latency of 14 h and final run fr with more precise precipitations estimates but with a higher latency of approximately 3 4 months these products have a spatial resolution of 0 1o roughly 10 km and temporal resolutions of 30 min 3 h 1 day 3 days 7 days and 1 month a comprehensive review of gpm imerg validation studies from 2016 to 2019 around the globe characterized by various locations topography and climatic regions can be found in pradhan et al 2022 in the present study we used the gpm imerg late precipitation l3 half hourly 0 1o data set the licungo basin is covered by 236 rainfall pixels the rainfall estimates during the simulation period from 24 01 2022 at 00 00 until 28 01 2022 at 03 00 were retrieved 198 files and used as the rainfall input for the numerical model fig 3 shows the spatial distribution of rainfall depth in the licungo basin during the simulation period as well as the basin averaged rainfall depth duration curve which shows that most of the rainfall 94 fall during the first 24 h 3 1 3 land cover land cover data are needed for flood estimation in order to characterize hydrological processes as flow resistance and evapotranspiration there are several land cover data products available for free in this study we have used the land cover maps developed by the european space agency esa through the globcover project those maps were derived from the meris sensor observations on board the envisat satellite mission during 2005 2006 and 2009 and they are provided globally at a resolution of 300 m however for this study we have used a prototype land cover product that was released only for africa by the globcover project with a spatial resolution of 20 m based on sentinel 2a observations from december 2015 to december 2016 fig 4 according to this land cover map 47 of the basin is covered by trees while cropland and grassland are the other two predominant land uses covering 30 and 20 of the basin respectively these three land uses occupy 97 of the basin s surface two alternative land cover data sources that could also be used for our purposes are the climate change initiative cci land cover project from the esa esa 2017 which includes global land cover maps at 300 m spatial resolution on an annual basis since 1992 and the terra and aqua combined moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis land cover type which provides global land cover types at yearly intervals 2001 2018 with a spatial resolution of 500 m 3 1 4 infiltration infiltration together with rainfall is one of the most important processes in the generation of floods the infiltration capacity of the terrain depends mainly on the soil type land cover slope and moisture content from the many formulations available the soil conservation service curve number scs cn is among the most widely used for the estimation of infiltration losses in flood studies it characterizes the infiltration capacity of the soil using a single parameter the curve number cn this having been extensively tabulated as a function of the hydrological soil group the land cover and the terrain slope mishra and singh 2003 corrections due to antecedent soil moisture condition amc can also be considered but these are difficult to calibrate in the absence of discharge field data and might be dependent on the study region in fact several studies have pointed out the limitations of the standard corrections used to correct the cn as a function of the 5 day antecedent rainfall and have recognized that in order to account properly for the amc effect on the scs cn method more sophisticated approaches should be implemented that are difficult to apply when no observed data are available see for instance caletka et al 2020 cea and fraga 2018 hope and schulze 1982 huang et al 2007 shi and wang 2020 soulis 2021 the land cover and the terrain slope can easily be derived from any of the gdems and land cover maps mentioned in sections 3 1 1 and 3 1 2 the hydrological soil groups can be obtained with a resolution of 250 m from the hysogs250m global data set ross et al 2018 the hysogs250m data set were derived from soil texture classes and depth to bedrock data provided by the fao harmonized world soil database in order to support scs cn runoff modelling at regional and continental scales and hence are especially suitable for the estimation of the cn in this study we have used the global cn estimation gcn250 presented recently by jaafar et al 2019 which is based on the hydrological soil groups from the hysog250m data set and on the land cover classification of 2015 from the esa cci land cover project the gcn250 data set has a spatial resolution of 250 m and is provided for average dry and wet antecedent soil moisture conditions according to this data set the cn in the licungo basin varies between 59 and 98 with a basin averaged value of 77 a mode of 79 and a median of 78 3 1 5 flood extent earth observation data from space can be used to estimate the extent of floods associated with extreme rainfall events in large and inaccessible territories as is the case with floods caused by tropical cyclones in mozambique this information can then be used to assess economic damages quantify the exposed population and define evacuation routes an observed estimate of the flood extent can also be very valuable for the validation of hydrological and hydraulic models in data scarce regions di baldassarre et al 2009 domeneghetti et al 2014 schumann and moller 2015 sun et al 2012 the esa satellites sentinel 1 sentinel 2 and sentinel 3 provide images that can be used during the different phases of a flood management plan kuntla and manjusree 2021 sentinel 1a is equipped with a c band advanced synthetic aperture radar with a pixel spacing of 10 m and processed to level 1 ground range detected with high resolution grdh one of the biggest advantages of using sar measurements over optical imagery for flood mapping is that sar is not limited by the presence of clouds and is able to effectively capture images during rain and other adverse weather conditions both day and night in sar imagery water appears to be dark due to the low backscatter from its smooth surface whereas the surrounding terrain appears bright due to its roughness that causes moderate backscatter kuntla and manjusree 2020 sentinel 1 imagery is the base of the dashboard unosat s 1 floodai monitoring dashboard which is managed by the united nations satellite centre unosat for the analysis of the flood exposed population in several countries of africa and asia including mozambique nemni et al 2020 in the present study the flood extent over the licungo basin was estimated using the sentinel application platform snap toolkit developed by esa for processing sar c images zuhlke et al 2015 this process was done following a standardised procedure to process level 1 grdh products in order to obtain final sigma nought images and interferograms corresponding to the flood extent the only two available images from esa during ts ana are those taken by sentinel 1a on 28 01 2022 at 03 00 utc which cover partially the licungo basin fig 5 the area covered by the two images is limited to the east part of the basin and it only represents 28 6415 km2 of the catchment area nonetheless the images cover the aps of mocuba nante namacurra and macuze which are the locations that include most of the flood prone areas in the basin and where most of the population is concentrated 3 1 6 population maps in order to estimate the number of people exposed to a storm event it is necessary to know the spatial distribution of population in the flooded areas population maps in combination with flood extent maps can be used here global gridded population data sets provide estimates of population figures in a uniform grid across the world contributing to a better understanding of where groups of people are settled leyk et al 2019 there are currently several global population data sets that can be used for this purpose such as the gridded population of the world gpw the global human settlement layer population ghs pop the landscan global population database landscan global the world population estimate wpe the high resolution settlement layer hrsl and the worldpop a detailed description can be found in leyk et al 2019 and dahmm et al 2020 in this study we used the worldpop gridded population data set tatem 2017 worldpop et al 2018 which is freely available for the whole world with a spatial resolution of 3 arc sec roughly 90 m it was derived using a random forest model to produce a predictive weighting layer for asymetrically redistributing population counts into gridded cells stevens et al 2015 one of strengths of worldpop is that it offers population estimates every year since 2000 which makes it comparable over time and facilitates the monitoring of population evolution in the case of mozambique the latest available estimate is for 2020 which was the one used in this study fig 6 3 2 integrated hydrological hydraulic modelling there are several modelling approaches that can be used to evaluate flood hazard cea and costabile 2022 teng et al 2017 in large catchments the standard two stage approach consists of using a hydrological model first to transform rainfall fields into water discharges along the main river network and then using those discharges as the input for a detailed hydraulic model to compute the extent of the inundation water depths and velocities only at specific flood prone river reaches the so called areas of potential significant flood risk apsfr the rainfall discharge transformation can be done with a lumped semi distributed or fully distributed hydrological model while the local hydraulic modelling in the apsfr is often performed with a 2d depth averaged shallow water model although other configurations are possible recently different integrated modelling approaches have been proposed in which the rainfall runoff transformation in the whole catchment and the flood inundation in the river network are computed simultaneously khaing et al 2019 sanz ramos et al 2021 xia et al 2019 with these integrated approaches there is a continuous spatially distributed contribution of surface runoff to the river streams and over the apsfr which is a far better representation of reality than the classical two stage approach in addition an integrated hydrological hydraulic modelling approach has the advantage of providing a global estimate of inundation in the entire catchment and river network with just one simulation the main drawback of such approaches is the different spatial scales involved in the modelling of an entire catchment including hillslope runoff and river flow this implies the use of discretisation grids with a very large number of elements requiring enhanced computational performance of the numerical solver for instance xia et al 2019 presented an integrated simulation of a flood event in a 2500 km2 catchment in which the 2d swes were solved in a uniform structured grid with 100 million computational cells element size of 25 m2 such a modelling approach required a multi gpu parallelization scheme and the use of 8 nvidia tesla k80 gpus in order to obtain a computational time 2 5 times faster than real time this means that the same modelling approach applied to a four day event in the licungo catchment 23 263 km2 would require over two weeks of computational time using eight high performance gpus and a very complex high performance computing implementation in addition such a spatial resolution would need to handle a mesh of one billion elements this is very far from being affordable for most inundation studies in developing countries and thus the computational requirements must be relaxed for practical purposes in this study we have used an integrated modelling approach based on solving the 2d swe in the whole catchment using an unstructured computational mesh with a lower spatial resolution than xia et al 2019 given the far larger size of the licungo basin 23 263 km2 the advantage of using an unstructured mesh is that the grid can be adapted to the catchment morphology using different element sizes in the hillslopes and in the river network where the flow concentrates in our case study we have used triangular elements with edge sizes ranging from 30 m in some river reaches to 140 m in the hillslopes to this end the river network width was digitized manually from an ortophoto obtained from sentinel 2 obtaining the main river channels as shown in fig 7 a similar procedure to define the river network width was followed by komi et al 2017 alternatively the definition of the river width can also be done based on the contributing drainage area cda at each river cross section this for instance is done by neal et al 2012 using the empirical hydraulic morphological relationships proposed by leopold and maddock 1953 or by uber et al 2021 based on visual inspection of the river network at cross sections with different cdas however for the purposes of the present case study we considered digitization from a visual inspection of the ortophoto although more laborious to be the most appropriate approach this zonification produced a river network with a total length of 700 km and a surface of 331 km2 fig 7 with this geometry and mesh configuration the 331 km2 of main channels were discretised with approximately 0 3 million elements while 2 9 million elements were used to discretise the floodplains and hillslopes which occupy an area of 22 932 km2 the total number of elements of the mesh was 3 2 million the 2d swes were solved with the numerical model iber garcía feal et al 2018 which is a gpu parallelized implementation of the software iber bladé et al 2014 and is available free of cost at www iberaula com the equations solved by the model can be expressed as 1 h t q x x q y y r i 2 q x t x q x 2 h g h 2 2 y q x q y h gh z b x g n 2 h 7 3 q q x 3 q y t x q x q y h y q y 2 h g h 2 2 gh z b y g n 2 h 7 3 q q y where h is the water depth q x q y and q are the two components of the unit discharge and its modulus z b is the bed elevation n is the manning coefficient g is the gravity acceleration r is the rainfall intensity and i is the infiltration rate all the input data and parameters rainfall fields infiltration parameters and manning coefficient can vary in space iber implements an unstructured finite volume solver for the 2d swes it was initially developed to model river flow but in recent years several numerical implementations have broadened its range of application to hydrological processes cea and blade 2015 allowing the simulation of rainfall runoff transformation and river inundation processes simultaneously the model has previously been applied and validated in rainfall runoff computations at different spatial scales cea et al 2016 cea and blade 2015 fraga et al 2019 sanz ramos et al 2018 sanz ramos et al 2021 tamagnone et al 2020 uber et al 2021 and its reliability and computational efficiency has led to its implementation in several flood early warning systems fernández nóvoa et al 2020 fraga et al 2020 gonzález cao et al 2019 as mentioned in section 3 1 4 the soil infiltration capacity was modelled with the scs cn method using the spatial distribution of cn provided by jaafar et al 2019 for normal antecedent soil moisture conditions fig 4 in order to define the manning s coefficient six different land covers were considered trees shrubs grassland cropland built up areas and rivers their spatial distribution over the hillslopes and floodplains was retrieved from the high resolution land cover map provided by the esa cci project for africa at 20 m resolution previously mentioned in section 3 1 3 and shown in fig 4 except for the rivers land cover which was defined manually for the whole stream network as shown in fig 7 since the open water cover defined in the esa cci map does not include a precise definition of the whole river network for modelling purposes the manning coefficients defined in table 2 were assigned to each land use fig 8 rainfall was defined in the model as raster files of precipitation intensity obtained from the gpm database as detailed in section 3 1 2 with a spatial and temporal resolutions of 10 km and 30 min respectively the simulated period is from 24 01 2022 at 00 00 the time at which the tc ana hit the licungo basin until 28 01 2022 at 03 00 the time at which the sentinel 1 image used to estimate the flood extent was taken as shown in fig 3 most of the rainfall 94 took place in the first 24 h with the numerical setup described above it took around 1 h of computational time to model the whole simulation period of 4 1 days i e 100 times faster than real time using a standard laptop with a nvidia geforce rtx 3080 ti which is an affordable hardware configuration 3 3 flood extent based performance indices the predictive capacity of the numerical model in the licungo catchment was assessed by comparing the water extent computed numerically with the one estimated from the sentinel 1 image taken on 28 01 2022 at 03 00 this image was processed as described in section 3 1 5 in order to obtain a raster with the observed flood extent with a spatial resolution of 10 m this raster was compared on a pixel basis with the prediction obtained using iber for the same date and time to do so the flood extent in iber was defined as the envelope of the wet mesh elements and the water depths computed within the flood extent were transferred from the triangular elements to the centre of the pixels using a linear interpolation scheme to quantify the agreement between both inundation maps the following indices were computed 1 hit rate proportion of the area observed as flooded that the model also predicts as flooded 2 false alarm ratio proportion of the area predicted as flooded by the model that has been classified as dry by the observation 3 bias ratio of the area predicted as flooded and the area observed as flooded and 4 f 1 score combination of the hit rate and false alarm ratio in a single performance measure that varies between 0 and 1 these indices were computed as hr tp tp fn far fp tp fp bias tp fp tp fn f 1 2 hr 1 far hr 1 far where hr is the hit rate far is the false alarm ratio tp are the true positives number of grid cells correctly predicted as flooded fp are the false positives number of cells that the model predicted as flooded but were observed as dry and fn are the false negatives number of cells predicted as dry but observed as flooded table 3 the hr and f 1 score vary between 0 worst performance and 1 best performance the far varies between 0 best performance and 1 worst performance the bias varies between 0 and infinite if bias 1 the modelled and observed flooded areas are equal if bias 1 the model underestimates the flood extent if bias 1 the model overestimates the flood extent this kind of cell by cell performance indices are commonly used in the comparison of 2d models with field observations bennett et al 2013 bermúdez et al 2019 costabile et al 2020 falter et al 2013 grimaldi et al 2016 the performance indices were evaluated both within the region of the licungo basin covered by the sentinel 1 images and at the reach scale in three river reaches with lengths from 15 to 25 km including their associated floodplains fig 1 reach 1 is located at the confluence between the rivers lugela right tributary and licungo left tributary around the city of mocuba and has a meandering morphology reach 2 is rather straight and confined and is located approximately 20 km downstream from reach 1 both reaches have a length of approximately 15 km reach 3 is the longest around 25 km is located near the basin outlet and has a relatively flat topography with a braided morphology these three reaches were chosen because they represent different river morphologies and are located in administrative posts with a high number of people exposed to flooding as will be shown in the following sections for ease of reference and as opposed to reach scale we will refer to the comparison within the region covered by the sentinel 1 images as catchment scale even if it does not cover the whole licungo basin 4 results and discussion 4 1 flood extent and validation tropical strom ana hit the licungo basin on 24 01 2022 at 00 00 leaving a basin averaged rainfall depth of 213 mm most of which fell within the first 24 h fig 3 the rainfall depth at certain locations on the west part of the basin reached values of around 350 mm the only available observed data that can be used to estimate the extent of the flood is the image taken by sentinel 1 on 28 01 2022 at 03 00 fig 5 this image covers only the east part of the basin and was taken 4 days after the start of the storm with the flood in its recession period thus the flooded area observed is much smaller than the maximum flood extent during the storm event fig 9 shows the flooded area estimated from sentinel 1 as well as the area computed with iber at the same time assuming in the latter case that the flooded areas are those with a water depth greater than 0 1 m a water depth threshold is needed to define the flood extent in the numerical model for two reasons first because the model input is rainfall and thus there is a positive water depth for almost every computational cell second because very small water depths will not be classified as flooded in the analysis of the satellite image the specific threshold chosen 0 1 m might have an effect on the results but it has been verified that the analysis and conclusions based on the performance measures presented below do indeed hold for thresholds between 0 05 and 0 20 m thresholds of the same order of magnitude have been used in other studies eilander et al 2022 wing et al 2017 table 4 shows the flood extent based performance measures computed from the comparison of the satellite image and the prediction of iber the sentinel 1 coverage column includes the performance scores computed for the whole area covered by the sentinel 1 image within the licungo basin red contour in fig 9 that is at the catchment scale at this scale the hr is quite high 0 79 meaning that most of the observed flooded area is captured by the model on the other hand at the catchment scale the model predicts a lot of flooded areas that are not identified in the satellite image and would therefore be classified as false positives thus the far and the bias are quite high 0 60 and 0 53 respectively nevertheless the values of the far and bias at the catchment scale should be taken with caution since most of the false positives lie in the hillslopes or in tributaries of the licungo and lugela rivers that are not captured by the analysis of the satellite image as clearly seen in fig 10 with the flood still in its recession phase all those tributaries that are captured by iber red areas in fig 10 should be conveying a significant amount of water although they are not identified as flooded areas in the analysis of the satellite image blue areas in fig 10 thus the water extension predicted by iber in all those small tributaries is contributing to the number of false positives when computing the far and bias which explains the high value of these performance measures when computed at the catchment scale the limitations of using sar images to derive flood extent maps have been analysed in recent studies which point out the importance of defining exclusion maps that identify the pixels in which the satellite derived estimation is not reliable this in order to avoid a substantial reduction in the performance measures of hydrological models zhao et al 2021 di mauro et al 2021 in our case the most likely reason why the satellite derived map fails to capture the water extent in the tributaries is the presence of riparian vegetation that masks the water in and around small rivers the presence of sand bars and braided streams at some locations also contributes to the difficulty of identifying some narrow tributaries moreover the fact that the width of the water table in many of these tributaries is equivalent to a few pixels in the satellite image also hinders their identification as flooded areas a second possible explanation of the high values of the far and bias computed for the whole sentinel 1 coverage is that the propagation of surface runoff in the numerical model creates local and isolated areas with water depths greater than 0 10 m that are not identified as flooded in the sentinel 1 image fig 10 the existence and extension of these isolated flooded areas is very much dependant on the local topography and thus in the quality of the dem as well as on the water depth threshold used to define the flood extension in iber 0 10 m increasing the water depth threshold diminishes the number of false positives but also reduces the number of true positives therefore it was maintained at 0 10 m in order to explore the performance of the model at the reach scale three river reaches with lengths varying from 15 to 25 km and different morphology were also analysed the location of the reaches is shown in fig 1 and their description was provided above in section 3 4 the overlapping between the flood extent computed with iber and estimated from sentinel 1 is much higher at the reach scale than at the catchment scale the hr computed at reaches 1 and 2 is only slightly better than at the catchment scale table 4 but the far is far lower and the bias is almost zero meaning that at the reach scales there is not a significant overprediction of the flood extent the performance measures computed at reach 3 are not as good as in the other two reaches but is still far better than at the catchment scale this is due to the braided configuration of reach 3 which makes the water depth results very dependent on the accuracy and spatial resolution of the dem from the above results we can conclude that the flood extent predicted by the numerical model is very reliable in the main river reaches and associated floodplains at the basin scale it is difficult to assess the performance of the model because the satellite data do not provide a reliable estimate of the water extent in most of the tributaries of the main river streams it seems that the model tends to overpredict the flood extent due to the presence of small and isolated flooded areas but it is difficult to give precise and reliable performance measures 4 2 estimation of the population affected by ts ana from satellite imagery fig 12 and table 5 show the estimates of the population exposed to flooding on 28 01 2022 at 03 00 obtained from overlying the worldpop raster and the flood extent obtained from sentinel 1 the data were aggregated by administrative posts ap the smallest administrative unit in mozambique and are presented as the total number of people exposed in each ap and as the percentage of people exposed in each ap within the area covered by the sentinel 1 image the estimate obtained from iber at the same date and time is also presented for comparison and validation purposes according to the estimate obtained from sentinel 1 more than 33 000 people were exposed to flooding at that time from a total of 569 000 people living within the area covered by sentinel 1 table 5 this is approximately 6 of the population covered by the satellite image in the aps located in the lower part of the basin the percentage of people exposed was far higher reaching values of 35 in macuze fig 12 and table 5 in this part of the basin the higher discharges in combination with a relatively flat topography and a braided river morphology lead to large flooded areas most of which are urbanised these figures probably underestimate the population that was actually exposed to flooding at that time and in that region since the satellite image does not identify as flooded most of the small tributaries of the licungo as discussed in the previous section and shown in fig 10 comparing the estimates obtained from the satellite image with those from iber at the same time the numerical model clearly predicts a far greater population exposed to flooding with an overall overestimation factor of 1 6 between iber and sentinel 1 this factor should not be taken directly as a modelling error at the basin scale for the reasons already mentioned the agreement between the satellite and numerical estimates is better in the aps located near the outlet of the catchment macuze nante namacurra and mocuba where the overestimation factors vary between 1 2 and 1 4 and deteriorates progressively as we move northwards with overestimation factors between 1 4 and 3 0 in the aps of munhamade mugeba and namarroi and greater than 3 in the northernmost aps ile a molocue and socone this spatial pattern on the agreement between iber and sentinel 1 is clearly related to the configuration of the stream network and with the spatial resolution of the numerical model while in the southern catchment there is one single main channel that is well defined and resolved in the numerical model the stream network in the northern part is very ramified and consists of multiple headwater catchments with small tributaries that are not so accurately defined with the spatial resolution of the numerical mesh and dem fig 9 added to this is the fact that the reliability of the flood extent estimate done from sentinel 1 is more reliable in large and confined streams than in small intermittent and braided tributaries 4 3 estimation of the population affected by ts ana from hydrological hydraulic modelling the comparative analysis of the flood extent presented in the previous sections was done on 28 01 2022 at 03 00 because it is the only time at which there is a satellite image available however at that time the flood was already receding so the percentage of people affected during the entire ts ana event was far greater in addition the satellite image only covers 28 of the catchment surface so the total population exposed in the whole basin was even larger fig 13 shows the hydrographs computed with iber at the basin outlet and at the confluence between the rivers lugela and licungo reach 1 in fig 11 according to the model at the basin outlet the river discharge was approximately 2000 m3 s at the time at which the sentinel 1 image was taken while the peak discharge occurred 51 h prior to this 26 01 2022 at 00 00 and was over 14 000 m3 s that is seven times more the difference is even greater at the confluence between the licungo and lugela where the peak discharge reached 16 000 m3 s i e 16 times more than the 1000 m3 s that were flowing when the sentinel 1 image was taken to illustrate the implications of these differences on the extension of the inundation the middle and right panels of fig 9 show respectively the predictions of the flood extent obtained with iber on 28 01 2022 at 03 00 and for the whole ts ana event even if these are simply numerical estimates and the previous ratios might be slightly different in reality they provide evidence that the number of people exposed to flooding during the whole event was much larger than the estimate obtained from the sentinel 1 image according to the numerical results for the whole catchment over 273 000 people were exposed to flooding during the entire event this is almost three times greater than the estimate made with iber for the whole basin at the time when the sentinel 1 image was taken table 6 and fig 14 in the lower part of the catchment where the estimates obtained from iber and sentinel 1 are closer table 5 this ratio varies between 1 7 and 3 9 see aps of mocuba nante namacurra and macuze in table 6 and fig 14 in the upper catchment the ratio is even larger reaching values higher than 4 in several aps although as mentioned in section 4 2 the numerical estimate of exposed population in the upper part of the catchment is less reliable than in the lower part those ratios provide an approximation of the underestimation factor introduced when analysing the effects of the flood extent on 28 01 2022 at 03 00 rather than at the time of maximum flooding fig 14 and fig 15 if we now compare the estimates of people exposed to flooding in the whole catchment during the entire ts ana event 273 937 people with those corresponding to the date and area of the sentinel 1 image 52 606 people both obtained from iber it can be seen that there is a difference of a factor of 5 2 again implying that the estimate that can be drawn from the satellite image is just a small fraction of the real flood impact fig 14 it could be argued that the iber derived predictions of exposed population 273 937 people might overpredict the actual number of people affected by the flood due to the inherent limitations of the numerical model s predictions as an alternative to the estimate obtained directly from the numerical model we can use the iber derived factors that relate the number of people exposed in the whole basin and or during the whole ts ana event with those exposed on 28 01 2022 at 03 00 within the area covered by the sentinel 1 image in order to extrapolate the satellite derived estimate of exposed population to the whole event and catchment the extrapolation of the satellite derived estimates done in such a way are shown in fig 14 with an oblique fill pattern in order to distinguish them from the direct estimates from the satellite image assuming that the numerical overestimation factor is similar during the whole event and for the whole catchment the total exposed population would be about 5 2 times larger than the estimate obtained directly from sentinel 1 leading to 172 655 33 203 5 2 people that could have been exposed to the flood at some point during the ts ana event it is difficult to assess which of the previous estimates 273 937 or 172 655 people is more realistic but the actual exposed population was probably somewhere between these two numbers probably nearer to 273 000 than to 172 000 since the model s overprediction at the reach scale is not so high table 4 in any case these figures are far more representative of the real number of people affected by the flood than the estimate that can be done using only the satellite imagery 33 244 people 5 conclusions estimation of the population affected by major flooding events in data scarce regions and especially by tropical storms in east africa is generally done on the basis of the analysis of satellite images such images are used to delineate the water extent and then overlapped with population density maps in order to identify the areas most affected by a flood while this procedure provides very useful and timely information for flood management its main limitation is that the date and time at which the satellite image is available is usually not the time of maximum flooding and therefore the water extent that can be derived from these images might be far smaller than the maximum flood extent this is especially true during flash flood events in large catchments as in the case study presented here since the maximum flooding does not take place at the same time in the whole river network but instead propagates progressively from the headwater subcatchments to the basin outlet it is therefore not possible to capture the maximum flood extent in a single image moreover large catchments might not be fully captured by the available satellite images during a single storm event preventing an estimate of the flooded area in the whole basin using an integrated hydrological hydraulic modelling approach that relies in freely available software and global satellite data we have estimated the maximum flood extent during ts ana in the whole licungo catchment and from that the total population affected by the flood we also estimated the area covered by the water during the flood recession which was the time at which the satellite sentinel 1 took an image of the east part of the basin a comparison between the water extent computed with iber and with sentinel 1 showed a relatively good hit ratio 0 79 when considering the whole area of the basin covered by the satellite images the false alarm ratio for the whole sentinel 1 coverage was also high 0 60 but this value is overestimated since most of the false positives lie in tributaries of the licungo and lugela rivers that are not captured by the analysis of the satellite image in the licungo and lugela rivers where the water extension defined from sentinel 1 is more reliable the hit ratio is still of the order of 0 80 the far decreases to around 0 20 and there is no significant bias between the iber and sentinel 1 predictions the numerical results obtained with iber indicate that over 273 000 people were exposed to flooding during the whole event in the whole catchment while only around 95 000 people were being exposed at the time the sentinel 1 image was taken since the flood had already been receding for more than 48 h by that time moreover according to the numerical results around 52 000 people were exposed to flooding inside the area covered by the sentinel 1 image around 28 of the total basin surface at the time the image was taken even if those numbers are just numerical estimates they contrast with the estimate of 33 000 people exposed to flooding obtained from the analysis of the satellite image alone and are far more representative of the actual number of people affected by ts ana in the licungo basin the numerical methodology used in this study also provides estimates of the maximum water depths and velocities reached during the whole event in all the river network of the catchment these estimates could be combined with vulnerability maps and damage curves in order to give a more detailed definition of flood risk and economical damages during a storm event such an analysis was not performed here due to the lack of detailed spatial information about vulnerability and stage damage curves within the study region all the data sets used in this study are available for free and at the global scale through the urls provided in section 3 the modelling software iber is also available free of charge from www iberaula com thus the methodology followed here can be reproduced in almost any region of the world although it is especially suitable and interesting for the

7827,study region licungo basin mozambique study focus the licungo basin 23 263 km2 suffers frequent severe flooding due to tropical storms in a country that is among the world s most vulnerable in terms of exposure to weather related hazards and climate change we propose a methodology for the estimation of the population exposed to flooding at the catchment scale in data scarce regions combining satellite imagery with integrated high resolution hydrological hydraulic modelling all the input data needed are retrieved from freely available global satellite products the numerical model is also freeware the methodology is therefore replicable worldwide an estimate of the flood extent and exposed population during tropical storm ana january 2022 is presented as a case study new hydrological insights for the region current freely available satellite products in combination with high resolution hydrological hydraulic models can be used to estimate the population exposed to flooding in the whole catchment this estimate is more realistic than the one obtained using satellite imagery alone since satellite images are very rarely taken at the time of maximum flooding using the proposed methodology we estimate that over 273 000 people out of 1 5 million were exposed to flooding in the licungo basin during tropical storm ana this represents 18 of the basin population and is 8 times larger than the estimate obtained using only the available satellite images graphical abstract ga1 keywords tropical storms flood hazard global digital elevation models sentinel 1 imagery iber model data scarce regions data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction vulnerability to river floods has increased throughout whole world in recent decades but most intensively in developing countries cao et al 2022 douglas et al 2008 di baldassarre et al 2010 rentschler et al 2022 tate et al 2021 tramblay et al 2014 wing et al 2018 moreover a number of studies indicate that flood risk is expected to increase further in coming decades due to climate change urbanization of river floodplains and changes in land use at the catchment scale areu rangel et al 2019 arnell and gosling 2016 hirabayashi et al 2013 jenkins et al 2017 jongman et al 2012 liu et al 2018 in this global context african countries are especially exposed to flood damage due to the social and economic vulnerability of their communities and to the extreme magnitude of the flood events in large rivers and basins revilla romero et al 2014 one example here is mozambique which occupies the 8th position in a ranking of 178 countries in the ecological threat report index a composite risk index based on 5 indicators rapid population growth water risk food risk temperature anomalies and natural disasters that together measure the impact of ecological threats that countries will face between now and 2050 institute for economics and peace 2021 according to the ecological threat report the population of mozambique is expected to double over the next 30 years from 32 2 million in 2021 to 65 3 million in 2050 a significant proportion of the population lives close to the river network this in order to have access to surface water resources and to fertile lands since subsistence farming constitutes the food base for many rural communities as a consequence of all this in 2020 the country had a prevalence of food insecurity of 71 10th highest in the world and a prevalence of undernourishment of 31 13th highest in the world institute for economics and peace 2021 for these reasons in recent years several developing countries including mozambique have made significant efforts to put disaster risk reduction policies in place including the evaluation of flood risk and the establishment of flood mitigation measures this has been supported by funds from the european commission and eu member states the u s agency for international development the world bank and various ngos one example of this is the intervention in the licungo basin mozambique carried out by the humanitarian implementation plan in 2018 which was supported by the directorate general for european civil protection and humanitarian operations echo the main objective being the strengthening of local preparedness and response capacities by linking early warning to early action to this end the identification of flood prone areas population exposed to flood risk main infrastructures affected by floods and safe evacuation routes all contribute significantly to the development and improvement of disaster management plans by the local and regional authorities such information also contributes to the implementation of flood early warning systems ews a type of flood mitigation measure that has been implemented in recent years in many developed and underdeveloped countries both on the local level fraga et al 2020 gonzález cao et al 2019 cools et al 2012 krajewski et al 2017 and at a national or transnational scale alfieri et al 2013 weerts et al 2011 wu et al 2014 thielen et al 2009 the evaluation of flood hazard in large basins is usually done by coupling a hydrological model that computes the water discharge along the river network of the whole catchment with a 2d hydrodynamic model that transforms water discharge into water depths velocities and flood extent at the river reach scale bermúdez et al 2017 komi et al 2017 nogherotto et al 2019 the use of lumped hydrological models in data scarce regions is very constrained due to the high dependency of such models on the availability of observed data for the calibration of parameters merz et al 2011 on the other hand physically based distributed models are to a certain degree less dependent on the calibration of input parameters and can therefore be useful tools to estimate flood hazard in regions where hydrometric data are scarce cornelissen et al 2013 nonetheless they require large amounts of spatially distributed data to define the catchment topography land uses and soil types regarding the evaluation of water depths and velocities at the river reach scale the most commonly used models today are those based on the2d fully dynamic shallow water eq 2d swe due to the capacity of these to reproduce complex local flow patterns although alternatives are available including different simplifications of the 2d swe as well as 1d 2d coupled models an alternative to the coupled hydrologic hydrodynamic modelling approach is to perform an integrated hydrological hydrodynamic simulation at the catchment scale until recently this was prohibitive because of the computational cost of modelling such a large domain with a hydrodynamic model but advances in high performance computing hpc and the development of new numerical schemes for solving the 2d swe at the catchment scale including rainfall and infiltration processes opens up the possibility of modelling rainfall runoff transformation and river hydraulics within a single integrated simulation over an entire catchment cea and blade 2015 garcía feal et al 2018 khaing et al 2019 xia et al 2019 a review of flood hazard modelling approaches can be found in cea and costabile 2022 and teng et al 2017 however one of the main handicaps in the improvement of flood management in developing countries and particularly in africa is the scarcity of quality hydrological and meteorological data which precludes a robust and accurate calibration of hydrological and hydraulic flood hazard models komi et al 2017 sampson et al 2015 sanyal et al 2014 tramblay et al 2014 on the other hand over the last decade a large number of satellite remote sensing data related to water resources has been made available by international institutions and agencies such as the national aeronautics and space administration nasa the european space agency esa and the japan aerospace exploration agency jaxa these data include digital terrain models dtm quantitative precipitation estimations qpe land uses soil types soil moisture and surface water extent among others the spatial and temporal resolution of these data products is not as detailed and accurate as data from national observation networks in developed countries but they are of great value in conducting flood hazard studies in developing countries or at a transnational scale dottori et al 2016 kugler and de groeve 2007 kundu et al 2015 pappenberger et al 2010 sakamoto et al 2007 sampson et al 2015 winsemius et al 2013 yamazaki et al 2011 in addition to the characterisation of flood hazard flood risk management plans require information on vulnerability and population exposure to floods to date those variables have received far less attention than flood hazard smith et al 2019 even though they provide information that is essential as a means of establishing emergency plans and of estimating economic and social losses detailed maps of the spatial distribution of population calka et al 2017 winsemius et al 2013 and transport infrastructures are of great value in evaluating the real exposure of a population to floods and the safest routes of evacuation in case of flooding watik and jaelani 2019 for this purpose several population data sets are currently available calka et al 2017 smith et al 2019 the main purpose of the present study is to propose a methodology for the estimation of the population exposed to river flooding at the catchment scale in data scarce regions combining satellite imagery with an integrated high resolution hydrological hydraulic modelling approach based on the model iber bladé et al 2014 garcía feal et al 2018 all the input data needed to apply the proposed methodology is retrieved from remote sensing open data sources at the global scale the estimate of the flood extent and population affected by the inundation caused by the recent tropical storm ana january 2022 in the licungo basin mozambique 23 263 km2 is presented as a case study over a 24 hour period this tropical storm left a basin averaged rainfall depth of 200 mm reaching values of 350 mm at certain locations the licungo basin suffers flooding almost every year as a consequence of tropical storms and cyclones this in a country with one of the highest exposures to weather related hazards flooding cyclones and drought and climate change in the world according to the international disaster database cred 2022 floods and storms represent respectively 35 6 and 23 7 of the 118 natural disasters that have affected mozambique over the last 56 years 1967 2022 the death toll associated with these closely related events in that period exceeds 100 000 people while the total population affected was over 40 million with economic losses estimated as 5 6 billion usd representing 56 2 of the total losses due to natural hazards in mozambique whereas the present study focusses on the licungo basin the methodology proposed can be applied worldwide since all the data and software required are freely available on the world wide web and is therefore of especial interest in data scarce regions and developing countries the following sections of the paper are organized thus section 2 presents a description of the licungo basin and the main facts relating to tropical storm ana the methodology open data sources and numerical model used in this study plus their relation to other available data packages and models is described in section 3 in section 4 we present and discuss the results related to flood extent and population affected by tropical storm ana finally section 5 summarizes the main conclusions including the advantages and limitations of the study 2 case study mozambique is a country with a high exposure to natural hazards and climate variability world bank 2019a b and is a paradigm of southeast africa vulnerability to floods over 60 of its population is concentrated on the coastline which is located on the path of tropical cyclones tc and tropical storms ts that form in or pass through the western part of the indian ocean wmo 2019 the country s exposure and vulnerability to floods is exacerbated by its relatively flat topography and scarce vegetation cover on average one ts or tc hits the coast of mozambique every two years between the months of october and april however the frequency of these tropical events has increased in recent years due to higher ocean temperatures brought about by climate change in the first months of 2022 mozambique was affected by two ts and one tc ts ana gdacs 2022a ocha 2022a ts dumako ocha 2022b and tc gombe gdacs 2022b ocha 2022c these three events had an impact on extensive areas of central and north mozambique the regions of zambezia and nampula were affected by all three of them within a period of approximately two months as a consequence and according to the estimates of the national institute for disaster management of mozambique ingd over one million people were affected around 10 000 people were displaced and more than 100 people died the floods affected over 200 000 ha with serious damages to crop production and food security according to the latest data released by the ingd these three storms also destroyed 153 611 houses damaged 95 health centres 46 water supply systems 2902 power poles 4436 km of roads and 781 schools impacting a total of 353 485 students the licungo basin is located in northern mozambique and has an area of approximately 23 263 km2 fig 1 the axis of the basin follows an nw se orientation and is 343 km long the average altitude is 474 m above mean sea level with the highest altitude at 2348 m the average slope of the basin hills is 10 6 which can be described as moderately sloping approximately 58 of the basin has a flat to undulating topography with slopes ranging from 0 to 8 the mozambique national water resources plan identifies the licungo as one of the 11 basins in the country most exposed to flood damage over the last 52 years the licungo basin has experienced catastrophic floods in the following years 1970 1984 1995 1998 2014 2015 2019 and 2022 among these the most severe in terms of material economic and human life damages occurred in 2015 and was associated with the tropical cyclone events chedza and bansi drrt 2015 recently during the first trimester of 2022 and barely one month apart the aforementioned ts ana ts dumako and tc gombe caused severe flooding and extensive damage in the basin according to the köppen geiger climate classification the licungo is located in a tropical savanna area the average annual precipitation over the basin in the period 1981 2010 as estimated using the chirps climate hazards centre infrared precipitation with station data pentadal data set funk et al 2015 was 1518 mm although there are regions in the centre and northeast of the basin in which the annual precipitation exceeds 2000 mm the rainy season extends from october to march in which about 80 of total annual precipitation is typically experienced the basin is divided into 9 administrative districts these subdivided into a total of 22 administrative posts ap as shown in fig 1 the main population settlements are the cities of mocuba located at the confluence of the licungo and lugela rivers in the central part of the basin and gurué in the northeast of the basin the communities most vulnerable to flooding are those located in the middle and lower part of the basin ap of mocuba mugeba munhamade macuze namacurra and nante in this study we focused on the evaluation of the effects of ts ana in terms of population exposed to flooding within the licungo basin ts ana took place between 24 01 2022 and 27 01 2022 leaving a basin averaged rainfall depth of 200 mm in the first 24 h and maximum rainfall depths of 350 mm at certain locations in the basin according to the report issued on 14 02 2022 by the united nations office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs ocha ts ana affected 185 429 people leading to 38 deaths and injuries to a further 207 people and destroyed 11 757 houses across the whole of mozambique ocha 2022a the final numbers were probably even greater given that this evaluation of damages was carried out just two weeks after the storm 3 data and methodology 3 1 open data sources the different satellite data sets used in this study are listed in table 1 which also includes the url where each data set can be accessed freely the spatial resolution varies from 10 m to 10 km depending on the data set the following sections describe the most pertinent features of each data set for hydrological modelling purposes as well as the relations to alternative satellite data sources 3 1 1 digital elevation model having a digital elevation model with the highest available spatial resolution and vertical accuracy is probably the most important requirement for a successful flood simulation this is especially true for data scarce regions where the availability of topographic data are limited to satellite remote sensors álvarez et al 2017 currently there are several global digital elevation models gdem that were obtained after processing data from satellite missions carried out by international space agencies some of the gdem commonly used in hydrological studies are those issued by the shuttle radar topography mission srtm from the us geological survey farr et al 2007 the advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer aster from nasa tadono et al 2014 the advanced land observing satellite alos from jaxa abrams 2000 and the tandem x data set from the german aerospace agency and airbus rizzoli et al 2017 the srtm data were obtained during a single 11 day mission in 2000 and is the basis for several gdem that have been processed by different algorithms e g void and sink filling removal of outliers smoothing of elevation or merging with other satellite data among others in order to reduce vertical errors and to facilitate the application of the data to hydrological studies some srtm based gdem commonly used in hydrological studies are srtm v3 the one provided by the cgiar consortium for spatial information cgiar csi the bare earth dem o loughlin et al 2016 the multi error removed improved terrain merit yamazaki et al 2017 and the recently released nasadem which was obtained after reprocessing the entire original srtm raw data set with improved processing algorithms and is expected to be nasa s finest resolution 1 arc sec roughly 30 m freely available gdem product for the foreseeable future the srtm data are also used in the hydrosheds package hydrological data and maps based on shuttle elevation derivatives at multiple scales that includes global digital data layers as catchment boundaries river networks and lakes at multiple resolutions and scales lehner et al 2008 most of these dem products cgiar bare earth merit hydrosheds v1 are provided at 3 arc sec resolutions roughly 90 m while only two nasadem and srtm v3 at 1 arc sec roughly 30 m the tandem x mission is far more recent than srtm the data were obtained between 2011 and 2015 and consists of two twin satellites tandem x and terrasar x that orbit the earth in close formation krieger et al 2013 zink et al 2021 the main practical improvements over srtm is that the tandem x mission covers the entire earth also the highest latitudes above 60o n and below 60o s with a higher vertical accuracy lower than 2 m and a horizontal resolution of 12 m although data with this resolution is not freely available the original version of the tandem x dem is a non edited product which leads to local errors that typically appear on ridges and canyons marešová et al 2021 airbus defence and space released an edited commercial version of tandem x with a spatial resolution of 12 m known as worlddem which significantly improves the vertical accuracy of other available gdems bayburt et al 2017 and which was used by the european space agency esa to generate three copernicus dems eea 10 0 4 arc sec glo 30 1 arc sec and glo 90 3 arc sec the first of these covering only european states tandem x data are also being used to produce the next version of the hydrosheds package recent studies indicate that copernicus glo 30 is the dem with the best overall performance that is freely available guth and geoffroy 2021 assessed the performance of copernicus glo 30 in eight regions representing a variety of reliefs and concluded that it provides the best representation of the terrain when compared to other commonly used 1 arc sec dems alos aster nasadem and srtm v3 maresova et al 2021 compared the performance of several gdems in three european mountain ranges alps pyrenees and carpathians showing that copernicus glo 30 gives a more accurate representation of the terrain than tandem x srtm v3 and nasadem garrote 2022 analysed the suitability for hydraulic modelling of eight freely available gdems in a river reach of the licungo basin and in line with the previous studies concluded that copernicus glo 30 is clearly the best option for hydraulic modelling in this region although we didn t perform a detailed comparison of all the previous gdems for modelling purposes in the licungo basin we did compare the topography and water depths obtained with srtm v3 and copernicus glo 30 concluding that glo 30 clearly outperforms srtm v3 in this case with a far more precise and less noisy definition of the main channel and floodplains fig 2 considering the previous studies and especially the comparative dem analysis presented by garrote 2022 applied to flood modelling in a reach of the licungo river we used copernicus glo 30 to represent the topography of the whole licungo catchment fig 2 in the integrated hydrological hydraulic modelling performed with iber 3 1 2 rainfall a correct characterization of the spatial and temporal variability of rainfall is of utmost importance for the estimation of flood hazard the spatial and temporal resolution of the rainfall input in hydrological models must be in accordance with the catchment characteristics that determine its characteristic response time during a storm event land cover size slopes drainage network and shape in small catchments of a few km2 a time resolution of 10 15 min and a spatial resolution of 1 km is usually needed for larger catchments over a thousand km2 a time resolution of one hour and a spatial resolution of 10 km are generally sufficient precipitation gauges still provide the most accurate point estimates of rainfall intensity however their practical application is limited due to the sparse spatial distribution of gauges over the majority of african countries on the other hand satellite rainfall estimates although less accurate than rain gauge data have an almost global coverage and provide valuable products for hydrological simulations in data scarce regions liu et al 2020 in recent years several satellite missions providing satellite rainfall estimates sre have become operational and their products are freely available however for most of these the temporal resolution is too low for use in flood inundation studies being oriented towards water resources or climate change studies for the evaluation of extreme floods the following are worth mentioning the precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks persiann hsu and sorooshian 2008 the persiann ccs hong et al 2004 nguyen et al 2018 the global satellite mapping of precipitation gsmap kubota et al 2007 the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm huffman et al 2007 and the global precipitation measurement gpm mission huffman et al 2020 the trmm operated from 1997 to 2015 providing rainfall estimates between latitudes 35on and 35os with a time resolution of 3 h and a spatial resolution of 0 25o roughly 25 km that have been used in many flood studies curtis et al 2007 harris et al 2007 komi et al 2017 li et al 2009 tekeli et al 2016 yang et al 2017 the gpm mission is the follow up to the trmm that was launched in order to continue and improve upon satellite based rainfall and snowfall observations on a global scale the level 3 integrated multi satellite retrievals for gpm imerg product provides precipitation estimates since march 2014 within the 60o n s latitude band from the combined use of passive microwave pmw and infrared ir sensors the gpm imerg data set is available in the form of near real time data divided into three different categories near real time early run er with a latency of 4 h near real time reprocessed late run lr with a latency of 14 h and final run fr with more precise precipitations estimates but with a higher latency of approximately 3 4 months these products have a spatial resolution of 0 1o roughly 10 km and temporal resolutions of 30 min 3 h 1 day 3 days 7 days and 1 month a comprehensive review of gpm imerg validation studies from 2016 to 2019 around the globe characterized by various locations topography and climatic regions can be found in pradhan et al 2022 in the present study we used the gpm imerg late precipitation l3 half hourly 0 1o data set the licungo basin is covered by 236 rainfall pixels the rainfall estimates during the simulation period from 24 01 2022 at 00 00 until 28 01 2022 at 03 00 were retrieved 198 files and used as the rainfall input for the numerical model fig 3 shows the spatial distribution of rainfall depth in the licungo basin during the simulation period as well as the basin averaged rainfall depth duration curve which shows that most of the rainfall 94 fall during the first 24 h 3 1 3 land cover land cover data are needed for flood estimation in order to characterize hydrological processes as flow resistance and evapotranspiration there are several land cover data products available for free in this study we have used the land cover maps developed by the european space agency esa through the globcover project those maps were derived from the meris sensor observations on board the envisat satellite mission during 2005 2006 and 2009 and they are provided globally at a resolution of 300 m however for this study we have used a prototype land cover product that was released only for africa by the globcover project with a spatial resolution of 20 m based on sentinel 2a observations from december 2015 to december 2016 fig 4 according to this land cover map 47 of the basin is covered by trees while cropland and grassland are the other two predominant land uses covering 30 and 20 of the basin respectively these three land uses occupy 97 of the basin s surface two alternative land cover data sources that could also be used for our purposes are the climate change initiative cci land cover project from the esa esa 2017 which includes global land cover maps at 300 m spatial resolution on an annual basis since 1992 and the terra and aqua combined moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis land cover type which provides global land cover types at yearly intervals 2001 2018 with a spatial resolution of 500 m 3 1 4 infiltration infiltration together with rainfall is one of the most important processes in the generation of floods the infiltration capacity of the terrain depends mainly on the soil type land cover slope and moisture content from the many formulations available the soil conservation service curve number scs cn is among the most widely used for the estimation of infiltration losses in flood studies it characterizes the infiltration capacity of the soil using a single parameter the curve number cn this having been extensively tabulated as a function of the hydrological soil group the land cover and the terrain slope mishra and singh 2003 corrections due to antecedent soil moisture condition amc can also be considered but these are difficult to calibrate in the absence of discharge field data and might be dependent on the study region in fact several studies have pointed out the limitations of the standard corrections used to correct the cn as a function of the 5 day antecedent rainfall and have recognized that in order to account properly for the amc effect on the scs cn method more sophisticated approaches should be implemented that are difficult to apply when no observed data are available see for instance caletka et al 2020 cea and fraga 2018 hope and schulze 1982 huang et al 2007 shi and wang 2020 soulis 2021 the land cover and the terrain slope can easily be derived from any of the gdems and land cover maps mentioned in sections 3 1 1 and 3 1 2 the hydrological soil groups can be obtained with a resolution of 250 m from the hysogs250m global data set ross et al 2018 the hysogs250m data set were derived from soil texture classes and depth to bedrock data provided by the fao harmonized world soil database in order to support scs cn runoff modelling at regional and continental scales and hence are especially suitable for the estimation of the cn in this study we have used the global cn estimation gcn250 presented recently by jaafar et al 2019 which is based on the hydrological soil groups from the hysog250m data set and on the land cover classification of 2015 from the esa cci land cover project the gcn250 data set has a spatial resolution of 250 m and is provided for average dry and wet antecedent soil moisture conditions according to this data set the cn in the licungo basin varies between 59 and 98 with a basin averaged value of 77 a mode of 79 and a median of 78 3 1 5 flood extent earth observation data from space can be used to estimate the extent of floods associated with extreme rainfall events in large and inaccessible territories as is the case with floods caused by tropical cyclones in mozambique this information can then be used to assess economic damages quantify the exposed population and define evacuation routes an observed estimate of the flood extent can also be very valuable for the validation of hydrological and hydraulic models in data scarce regions di baldassarre et al 2009 domeneghetti et al 2014 schumann and moller 2015 sun et al 2012 the esa satellites sentinel 1 sentinel 2 and sentinel 3 provide images that can be used during the different phases of a flood management plan kuntla and manjusree 2021 sentinel 1a is equipped with a c band advanced synthetic aperture radar with a pixel spacing of 10 m and processed to level 1 ground range detected with high resolution grdh one of the biggest advantages of using sar measurements over optical imagery for flood mapping is that sar is not limited by the presence of clouds and is able to effectively capture images during rain and other adverse weather conditions both day and night in sar imagery water appears to be dark due to the low backscatter from its smooth surface whereas the surrounding terrain appears bright due to its roughness that causes moderate backscatter kuntla and manjusree 2020 sentinel 1 imagery is the base of the dashboard unosat s 1 floodai monitoring dashboard which is managed by the united nations satellite centre unosat for the analysis of the flood exposed population in several countries of africa and asia including mozambique nemni et al 2020 in the present study the flood extent over the licungo basin was estimated using the sentinel application platform snap toolkit developed by esa for processing sar c images zuhlke et al 2015 this process was done following a standardised procedure to process level 1 grdh products in order to obtain final sigma nought images and interferograms corresponding to the flood extent the only two available images from esa during ts ana are those taken by sentinel 1a on 28 01 2022 at 03 00 utc which cover partially the licungo basin fig 5 the area covered by the two images is limited to the east part of the basin and it only represents 28 6415 km2 of the catchment area nonetheless the images cover the aps of mocuba nante namacurra and macuze which are the locations that include most of the flood prone areas in the basin and where most of the population is concentrated 3 1 6 population maps in order to estimate the number of people exposed to a storm event it is necessary to know the spatial distribution of population in the flooded areas population maps in combination with flood extent maps can be used here global gridded population data sets provide estimates of population figures in a uniform grid across the world contributing to a better understanding of where groups of people are settled leyk et al 2019 there are currently several global population data sets that can be used for this purpose such as the gridded population of the world gpw the global human settlement layer population ghs pop the landscan global population database landscan global the world population estimate wpe the high resolution settlement layer hrsl and the worldpop a detailed description can be found in leyk et al 2019 and dahmm et al 2020 in this study we used the worldpop gridded population data set tatem 2017 worldpop et al 2018 which is freely available for the whole world with a spatial resolution of 3 arc sec roughly 90 m it was derived using a random forest model to produce a predictive weighting layer for asymetrically redistributing population counts into gridded cells stevens et al 2015 one of strengths of worldpop is that it offers population estimates every year since 2000 which makes it comparable over time and facilitates the monitoring of population evolution in the case of mozambique the latest available estimate is for 2020 which was the one used in this study fig 6 3 2 integrated hydrological hydraulic modelling there are several modelling approaches that can be used to evaluate flood hazard cea and costabile 2022 teng et al 2017 in large catchments the standard two stage approach consists of using a hydrological model first to transform rainfall fields into water discharges along the main river network and then using those discharges as the input for a detailed hydraulic model to compute the extent of the inundation water depths and velocities only at specific flood prone river reaches the so called areas of potential significant flood risk apsfr the rainfall discharge transformation can be done with a lumped semi distributed or fully distributed hydrological model while the local hydraulic modelling in the apsfr is often performed with a 2d depth averaged shallow water model although other configurations are possible recently different integrated modelling approaches have been proposed in which the rainfall runoff transformation in the whole catchment and the flood inundation in the river network are computed simultaneously khaing et al 2019 sanz ramos et al 2021 xia et al 2019 with these integrated approaches there is a continuous spatially distributed contribution of surface runoff to the river streams and over the apsfr which is a far better representation of reality than the classical two stage approach in addition an integrated hydrological hydraulic modelling approach has the advantage of providing a global estimate of inundation in the entire catchment and river network with just one simulation the main drawback of such approaches is the different spatial scales involved in the modelling of an entire catchment including hillslope runoff and river flow this implies the use of discretisation grids with a very large number of elements requiring enhanced computational performance of the numerical solver for instance xia et al 2019 presented an integrated simulation of a flood event in a 2500 km2 catchment in which the 2d swes were solved in a uniform structured grid with 100 million computational cells element size of 25 m2 such a modelling approach required a multi gpu parallelization scheme and the use of 8 nvidia tesla k80 gpus in order to obtain a computational time 2 5 times faster than real time this means that the same modelling approach applied to a four day event in the licungo catchment 23 263 km2 would require over two weeks of computational time using eight high performance gpus and a very complex high performance computing implementation in addition such a spatial resolution would need to handle a mesh of one billion elements this is very far from being affordable for most inundation studies in developing countries and thus the computational requirements must be relaxed for practical purposes in this study we have used an integrated modelling approach based on solving the 2d swe in the whole catchment using an unstructured computational mesh with a lower spatial resolution than xia et al 2019 given the far larger size of the licungo basin 23 263 km2 the advantage of using an unstructured mesh is that the grid can be adapted to the catchment morphology using different element sizes in the hillslopes and in the river network where the flow concentrates in our case study we have used triangular elements with edge sizes ranging from 30 m in some river reaches to 140 m in the hillslopes to this end the river network width was digitized manually from an ortophoto obtained from sentinel 2 obtaining the main river channels as shown in fig 7 a similar procedure to define the river network width was followed by komi et al 2017 alternatively the definition of the river width can also be done based on the contributing drainage area cda at each river cross section this for instance is done by neal et al 2012 using the empirical hydraulic morphological relationships proposed by leopold and maddock 1953 or by uber et al 2021 based on visual inspection of the river network at cross sections with different cdas however for the purposes of the present case study we considered digitization from a visual inspection of the ortophoto although more laborious to be the most appropriate approach this zonification produced a river network with a total length of 700 km and a surface of 331 km2 fig 7 with this geometry and mesh configuration the 331 km2 of main channels were discretised with approximately 0 3 million elements while 2 9 million elements were used to discretise the floodplains and hillslopes which occupy an area of 22 932 km2 the total number of elements of the mesh was 3 2 million the 2d swes were solved with the numerical model iber garcía feal et al 2018 which is a gpu parallelized implementation of the software iber bladé et al 2014 and is available free of cost at www iberaula com the equations solved by the model can be expressed as 1 h t q x x q y y r i 2 q x t x q x 2 h g h 2 2 y q x q y h gh z b x g n 2 h 7 3 q q x 3 q y t x q x q y h y q y 2 h g h 2 2 gh z b y g n 2 h 7 3 q q y where h is the water depth q x q y and q are the two components of the unit discharge and its modulus z b is the bed elevation n is the manning coefficient g is the gravity acceleration r is the rainfall intensity and i is the infiltration rate all the input data and parameters rainfall fields infiltration parameters and manning coefficient can vary in space iber implements an unstructured finite volume solver for the 2d swes it was initially developed to model river flow but in recent years several numerical implementations have broadened its range of application to hydrological processes cea and blade 2015 allowing the simulation of rainfall runoff transformation and river inundation processes simultaneously the model has previously been applied and validated in rainfall runoff computations at different spatial scales cea et al 2016 cea and blade 2015 fraga et al 2019 sanz ramos et al 2018 sanz ramos et al 2021 tamagnone et al 2020 uber et al 2021 and its reliability and computational efficiency has led to its implementation in several flood early warning systems fernández nóvoa et al 2020 fraga et al 2020 gonzález cao et al 2019 as mentioned in section 3 1 4 the soil infiltration capacity was modelled with the scs cn method using the spatial distribution of cn provided by jaafar et al 2019 for normal antecedent soil moisture conditions fig 4 in order to define the manning s coefficient six different land covers were considered trees shrubs grassland cropland built up areas and rivers their spatial distribution over the hillslopes and floodplains was retrieved from the high resolution land cover map provided by the esa cci project for africa at 20 m resolution previously mentioned in section 3 1 3 and shown in fig 4 except for the rivers land cover which was defined manually for the whole stream network as shown in fig 7 since the open water cover defined in the esa cci map does not include a precise definition of the whole river network for modelling purposes the manning coefficients defined in table 2 were assigned to each land use fig 8 rainfall was defined in the model as raster files of precipitation intensity obtained from the gpm database as detailed in section 3 1 2 with a spatial and temporal resolutions of 10 km and 30 min respectively the simulated period is from 24 01 2022 at 00 00 the time at which the tc ana hit the licungo basin until 28 01 2022 at 03 00 the time at which the sentinel 1 image used to estimate the flood extent was taken as shown in fig 3 most of the rainfall 94 took place in the first 24 h with the numerical setup described above it took around 1 h of computational time to model the whole simulation period of 4 1 days i e 100 times faster than real time using a standard laptop with a nvidia geforce rtx 3080 ti which is an affordable hardware configuration 3 3 flood extent based performance indices the predictive capacity of the numerical model in the licungo catchment was assessed by comparing the water extent computed numerically with the one estimated from the sentinel 1 image taken on 28 01 2022 at 03 00 this image was processed as described in section 3 1 5 in order to obtain a raster with the observed flood extent with a spatial resolution of 10 m this raster was compared on a pixel basis with the prediction obtained using iber for the same date and time to do so the flood extent in iber was defined as the envelope of the wet mesh elements and the water depths computed within the flood extent were transferred from the triangular elements to the centre of the pixels using a linear interpolation scheme to quantify the agreement between both inundation maps the following indices were computed 1 hit rate proportion of the area observed as flooded that the model also predicts as flooded 2 false alarm ratio proportion of the area predicted as flooded by the model that has been classified as dry by the observation 3 bias ratio of the area predicted as flooded and the area observed as flooded and 4 f 1 score combination of the hit rate and false alarm ratio in a single performance measure that varies between 0 and 1 these indices were computed as hr tp tp fn far fp tp fp bias tp fp tp fn f 1 2 hr 1 far hr 1 far where hr is the hit rate far is the false alarm ratio tp are the true positives number of grid cells correctly predicted as flooded fp are the false positives number of cells that the model predicted as flooded but were observed as dry and fn are the false negatives number of cells predicted as dry but observed as flooded table 3 the hr and f 1 score vary between 0 worst performance and 1 best performance the far varies between 0 best performance and 1 worst performance the bias varies between 0 and infinite if bias 1 the modelled and observed flooded areas are equal if bias 1 the model underestimates the flood extent if bias 1 the model overestimates the flood extent this kind of cell by cell performance indices are commonly used in the comparison of 2d models with field observations bennett et al 2013 bermúdez et al 2019 costabile et al 2020 falter et al 2013 grimaldi et al 2016 the performance indices were evaluated both within the region of the licungo basin covered by the sentinel 1 images and at the reach scale in three river reaches with lengths from 15 to 25 km including their associated floodplains fig 1 reach 1 is located at the confluence between the rivers lugela right tributary and licungo left tributary around the city of mocuba and has a meandering morphology reach 2 is rather straight and confined and is located approximately 20 km downstream from reach 1 both reaches have a length of approximately 15 km reach 3 is the longest around 25 km is located near the basin outlet and has a relatively flat topography with a braided morphology these three reaches were chosen because they represent different river morphologies and are located in administrative posts with a high number of people exposed to flooding as will be shown in the following sections for ease of reference and as opposed to reach scale we will refer to the comparison within the region covered by the sentinel 1 images as catchment scale even if it does not cover the whole licungo basin 4 results and discussion 4 1 flood extent and validation tropical strom ana hit the licungo basin on 24 01 2022 at 00 00 leaving a basin averaged rainfall depth of 213 mm most of which fell within the first 24 h fig 3 the rainfall depth at certain locations on the west part of the basin reached values of around 350 mm the only available observed data that can be used to estimate the extent of the flood is the image taken by sentinel 1 on 28 01 2022 at 03 00 fig 5 this image covers only the east part of the basin and was taken 4 days after the start of the storm with the flood in its recession period thus the flooded area observed is much smaller than the maximum flood extent during the storm event fig 9 shows the flooded area estimated from sentinel 1 as well as the area computed with iber at the same time assuming in the latter case that the flooded areas are those with a water depth greater than 0 1 m a water depth threshold is needed to define the flood extent in the numerical model for two reasons first because the model input is rainfall and thus there is a positive water depth for almost every computational cell second because very small water depths will not be classified as flooded in the analysis of the satellite image the specific threshold chosen 0 1 m might have an effect on the results but it has been verified that the analysis and conclusions based on the performance measures presented below do indeed hold for thresholds between 0 05 and 0 20 m thresholds of the same order of magnitude have been used in other studies eilander et al 2022 wing et al 2017 table 4 shows the flood extent based performance measures computed from the comparison of the satellite image and the prediction of iber the sentinel 1 coverage column includes the performance scores computed for the whole area covered by the sentinel 1 image within the licungo basin red contour in fig 9 that is at the catchment scale at this scale the hr is quite high 0 79 meaning that most of the observed flooded area is captured by the model on the other hand at the catchment scale the model predicts a lot of flooded areas that are not identified in the satellite image and would therefore be classified as false positives thus the far and the bias are quite high 0 60 and 0 53 respectively nevertheless the values of the far and bias at the catchment scale should be taken with caution since most of the false positives lie in the hillslopes or in tributaries of the licungo and lugela rivers that are not captured by the analysis of the satellite image as clearly seen in fig 10 with the flood still in its recession phase all those tributaries that are captured by iber red areas in fig 10 should be conveying a significant amount of water although they are not identified as flooded areas in the analysis of the satellite image blue areas in fig 10 thus the water extension predicted by iber in all those small tributaries is contributing to the number of false positives when computing the far and bias which explains the high value of these performance measures when computed at the catchment scale the limitations of using sar images to derive flood extent maps have been analysed in recent studies which point out the importance of defining exclusion maps that identify the pixels in which the satellite derived estimation is not reliable this in order to avoid a substantial reduction in the performance measures of hydrological models zhao et al 2021 di mauro et al 2021 in our case the most likely reason why the satellite derived map fails to capture the water extent in the tributaries is the presence of riparian vegetation that masks the water in and around small rivers the presence of sand bars and braided streams at some locations also contributes to the difficulty of identifying some narrow tributaries moreover the fact that the width of the water table in many of these tributaries is equivalent to a few pixels in the satellite image also hinders their identification as flooded areas a second possible explanation of the high values of the far and bias computed for the whole sentinel 1 coverage is that the propagation of surface runoff in the numerical model creates local and isolated areas with water depths greater than 0 10 m that are not identified as flooded in the sentinel 1 image fig 10 the existence and extension of these isolated flooded areas is very much dependant on the local topography and thus in the quality of the dem as well as on the water depth threshold used to define the flood extension in iber 0 10 m increasing the water depth threshold diminishes the number of false positives but also reduces the number of true positives therefore it was maintained at 0 10 m in order to explore the performance of the model at the reach scale three river reaches with lengths varying from 15 to 25 km and different morphology were also analysed the location of the reaches is shown in fig 1 and their description was provided above in section 3 4 the overlapping between the flood extent computed with iber and estimated from sentinel 1 is much higher at the reach scale than at the catchment scale the hr computed at reaches 1 and 2 is only slightly better than at the catchment scale table 4 but the far is far lower and the bias is almost zero meaning that at the reach scales there is not a significant overprediction of the flood extent the performance measures computed at reach 3 are not as good as in the other two reaches but is still far better than at the catchment scale this is due to the braided configuration of reach 3 which makes the water depth results very dependent on the accuracy and spatial resolution of the dem from the above results we can conclude that the flood extent predicted by the numerical model is very reliable in the main river reaches and associated floodplains at the basin scale it is difficult to assess the performance of the model because the satellite data do not provide a reliable estimate of the water extent in most of the tributaries of the main river streams it seems that the model tends to overpredict the flood extent due to the presence of small and isolated flooded areas but it is difficult to give precise and reliable performance measures 4 2 estimation of the population affected by ts ana from satellite imagery fig 12 and table 5 show the estimates of the population exposed to flooding on 28 01 2022 at 03 00 obtained from overlying the worldpop raster and the flood extent obtained from sentinel 1 the data were aggregated by administrative posts ap the smallest administrative unit in mozambique and are presented as the total number of people exposed in each ap and as the percentage of people exposed in each ap within the area covered by the sentinel 1 image the estimate obtained from iber at the same date and time is also presented for comparison and validation purposes according to the estimate obtained from sentinel 1 more than 33 000 people were exposed to flooding at that time from a total of 569 000 people living within the area covered by sentinel 1 table 5 this is approximately 6 of the population covered by the satellite image in the aps located in the lower part of the basin the percentage of people exposed was far higher reaching values of 35 in macuze fig 12 and table 5 in this part of the basin the higher discharges in combination with a relatively flat topography and a braided river morphology lead to large flooded areas most of which are urbanised these figures probably underestimate the population that was actually exposed to flooding at that time and in that region since the satellite image does not identify as flooded most of the small tributaries of the licungo as discussed in the previous section and shown in fig 10 comparing the estimates obtained from the satellite image with those from iber at the same time the numerical model clearly predicts a far greater population exposed to flooding with an overall overestimation factor of 1 6 between iber and sentinel 1 this factor should not be taken directly as a modelling error at the basin scale for the reasons already mentioned the agreement between the satellite and numerical estimates is better in the aps located near the outlet of the catchment macuze nante namacurra and mocuba where the overestimation factors vary between 1 2 and 1 4 and deteriorates progressively as we move northwards with overestimation factors between 1 4 and 3 0 in the aps of munhamade mugeba and namarroi and greater than 3 in the northernmost aps ile a molocue and socone this spatial pattern on the agreement between iber and sentinel 1 is clearly related to the configuration of the stream network and with the spatial resolution of the numerical model while in the southern catchment there is one single main channel that is well defined and resolved in the numerical model the stream network in the northern part is very ramified and consists of multiple headwater catchments with small tributaries that are not so accurately defined with the spatial resolution of the numerical mesh and dem fig 9 added to this is the fact that the reliability of the flood extent estimate done from sentinel 1 is more reliable in large and confined streams than in small intermittent and braided tributaries 4 3 estimation of the population affected by ts ana from hydrological hydraulic modelling the comparative analysis of the flood extent presented in the previous sections was done on 28 01 2022 at 03 00 because it is the only time at which there is a satellite image available however at that time the flood was already receding so the percentage of people affected during the entire ts ana event was far greater in addition the satellite image only covers 28 of the catchment surface so the total population exposed in the whole basin was even larger fig 13 shows the hydrographs computed with iber at the basin outlet and at the confluence between the rivers lugela and licungo reach 1 in fig 11 according to the model at the basin outlet the river discharge was approximately 2000 m3 s at the time at which the sentinel 1 image was taken while the peak discharge occurred 51 h prior to this 26 01 2022 at 00 00 and was over 14 000 m3 s that is seven times more the difference is even greater at the confluence between the licungo and lugela where the peak discharge reached 16 000 m3 s i e 16 times more than the 1000 m3 s that were flowing when the sentinel 1 image was taken to illustrate the implications of these differences on the extension of the inundation the middle and right panels of fig 9 show respectively the predictions of the flood extent obtained with iber on 28 01 2022 at 03 00 and for the whole ts ana event even if these are simply numerical estimates and the previous ratios might be slightly different in reality they provide evidence that the number of people exposed to flooding during the whole event was much larger than the estimate obtained from the sentinel 1 image according to the numerical results for the whole catchment over 273 000 people were exposed to flooding during the entire event this is almost three times greater than the estimate made with iber for the whole basin at the time when the sentinel 1 image was taken table 6 and fig 14 in the lower part of the catchment where the estimates obtained from iber and sentinel 1 are closer table 5 this ratio varies between 1 7 and 3 9 see aps of mocuba nante namacurra and macuze in table 6 and fig 14 in the upper catchment the ratio is even larger reaching values higher than 4 in several aps although as mentioned in section 4 2 the numerical estimate of exposed population in the upper part of the catchment is less reliable than in the lower part those ratios provide an approximation of the underestimation factor introduced when analysing the effects of the flood extent on 28 01 2022 at 03 00 rather than at the time of maximum flooding fig 14 and fig 15 if we now compare the estimates of people exposed to flooding in the whole catchment during the entire ts ana event 273 937 people with those corresponding to the date and area of the sentinel 1 image 52 606 people both obtained from iber it can be seen that there is a difference of a factor of 5 2 again implying that the estimate that can be drawn from the satellite image is just a small fraction of the real flood impact fig 14 it could be argued that the iber derived predictions of exposed population 273 937 people might overpredict the actual number of people affected by the flood due to the inherent limitations of the numerical model s predictions as an alternative to the estimate obtained directly from the numerical model we can use the iber derived factors that relate the number of people exposed in the whole basin and or during the whole ts ana event with those exposed on 28 01 2022 at 03 00 within the area covered by the sentinel 1 image in order to extrapolate the satellite derived estimate of exposed population to the whole event and catchment the extrapolation of the satellite derived estimates done in such a way are shown in fig 14 with an oblique fill pattern in order to distinguish them from the direct estimates from the satellite image assuming that the numerical overestimation factor is similar during the whole event and for the whole catchment the total exposed population would be about 5 2 times larger than the estimate obtained directly from sentinel 1 leading to 172 655 33 203 5 2 people that could have been exposed to the flood at some point during the ts ana event it is difficult to assess which of the previous estimates 273 937 or 172 655 people is more realistic but the actual exposed population was probably somewhere between these two numbers probably nearer to 273 000 than to 172 000 since the model s overprediction at the reach scale is not so high table 4 in any case these figures are far more representative of the real number of people affected by the flood than the estimate that can be done using only the satellite imagery 33 244 people 5 conclusions estimation of the population affected by major flooding events in data scarce regions and especially by tropical storms in east africa is generally done on the basis of the analysis of satellite images such images are used to delineate the water extent and then overlapped with population density maps in order to identify the areas most affected by a flood while this procedure provides very useful and timely information for flood management its main limitation is that the date and time at which the satellite image is available is usually not the time of maximum flooding and therefore the water extent that can be derived from these images might be far smaller than the maximum flood extent this is especially true during flash flood events in large catchments as in the case study presented here since the maximum flooding does not take place at the same time in the whole river network but instead propagates progressively from the headwater subcatchments to the basin outlet it is therefore not possible to capture the maximum flood extent in a single image moreover large catchments might not be fully captured by the available satellite images during a single storm event preventing an estimate of the flooded area in the whole basin using an integrated hydrological hydraulic modelling approach that relies in freely available software and global satellite data we have estimated the maximum flood extent during ts ana in the whole licungo catchment and from that the total population affected by the flood we also estimated the area covered by the water during the flood recession which was the time at which the satellite sentinel 1 took an image of the east part of the basin a comparison between the water extent computed with iber and with sentinel 1 showed a relatively good hit ratio 0 79 when considering the whole area of the basin covered by the satellite images the false alarm ratio for the whole sentinel 1 coverage was also high 0 60 but this value is overestimated since most of the false positives lie in tributaries of the licungo and lugela rivers that are not captured by the analysis of the satellite image in the licungo and lugela rivers where the water extension defined from sentinel 1 is more reliable the hit ratio is still of the order of 0 80 the far decreases to around 0 20 and there is no significant bias between the iber and sentinel 1 predictions the numerical results obtained with iber indicate that over 273 000 people were exposed to flooding during the whole event in the whole catchment while only around 95 000 people were being exposed at the time the sentinel 1 image was taken since the flood had already been receding for more than 48 h by that time moreover according to the numerical results around 52 000 people were exposed to flooding inside the area covered by the sentinel 1 image around 28 of the total basin surface at the time the image was taken even if those numbers are just numerical estimates they contrast with the estimate of 33 000 people exposed to flooding obtained from the analysis of the satellite image alone and are far more representative of the actual number of people affected by ts ana in the licungo basin the numerical methodology used in this study also provides estimates of the maximum water depths and velocities reached during the whole event in all the river network of the catchment these estimates could be combined with vulnerability maps and damage curves in order to give a more detailed definition of flood risk and economical damages during a storm event such an analysis was not performed here due to the lack of detailed spatial information about vulnerability and stage damage curves within the study region all the data sets used in this study are available for free and at the global scale through the urls provided in section 3 the modelling software iber is also available free of charge from www iberaula com thus the methodology followed here can be reproduced in almost any region of the world although it is especially suitable and interesting for the

7828,study region eight main basins at eastern china study focus this study proposes a comprehensive framework using shannon s entropy weighting method for assessing satellite precipitation data from spatial and temporal perspectives first three new spatial evaluation metrics the false monitoring score fms spatial coverage approximation sca and precipitation spatial difference index psdi were introduced based on spatial distribution differences of daily precipitation then the error and performance of the five satellite precipitation datasets over eastern china were analyzed new hydrological insights for the region the spatial metrics sca psdi and fraction skill score fss provide an effective quantitative evaluation of the daily spatial distribution of precipitation cmads and mswep appear to be superior at reproducing the spatial distribution of precipitation except for chirps all other four datasets have a tendency to underestimate precipitation measurements in the study area according to the evaluation the latest version of mswep may be a suitable alternative for use in water and climate research due to its relatively high accuracy in eastern china the spatial error analysis method utilized in this study can be transferred to evaluating other gridded precipitation products meanwhile the spatial error indices are also acceptable as optimization targets for future

precipitation databases are of great importance to water resource managers for the effective monitoring of droughts and floods and for hydrometeorologists to carry out relevant research such as hydrological prediction climate change assessments disaster preparedness and mitigation hong et al 2004 huffman et al 2007 yong et al 2015 precipitation also plays a vital role in agricultural production and the provision of domestic water supplies jalota et al 2006 however obtaining a long term and reliable global precipitation record with a high spatiotemporal resolution is challenging mei et al 2014 tang et al 2020 conventionally precipitation is measured using ground based gauges this simple and straightforward method can provide rainfall information with a high temporal frequency on a point scale unfortunately the uneven distribution and scarcity of rain gauge networks in many regions particularly in developing countries means that the spatial variation of rainfall cannot be accurately captured xie et al 2003 alternatively weather radars can monitor precipitation at finer spatial resolutions with greater time efficiency however radar precipitation estimates are also subject to uncertainties that arise from the imprecise reflectivity rainfall z r relationship signal attenuation and landform occlusion especially in complex terrain beauchamp and chandrasekar 2016 gebregiorgis et al 2017 zulkafli et al 2014 in addition the low cost effectiveness and high technical threshold of radar mean that it cannot be deployed worldwide recent decades have demonstrated that satellite remote is a promising alternative for monitoring precipitation at regional or even global scales satellites collect instantaneous information about precipitating clouds to estimate the precipitation rate through self equipped infrared sensors precipitation radar and passive microwave pmw radiometers sun et al 2018 furthermore satellite derived merged precipitation datasets sps that include characteristics such as high space time continuity and resolution have been developed by merging aspects of the above three types of observations with other ground observations the launch of the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm satellite constellation in 1998 which was the predecessor of the current global precipitation measurement gpm ushered in a new era for satellite rainfall

of the user community beck et al 2019 funk et al 2015 because of their easy access sps are considered a valuable alternative to gauged observations the use of sps in hydrological or land surface

despite their many advantages sps also suffer several inherent uncertainties that mainly originate in the retrieval algorithms used local weather conditions topography and sampling frequency as reported sps have obvious deficiencies in capturing low intensity precipitation events during the winter because of the impact that a cold surface background has on pmw retrievals the performance is significantly better during the summer and in hot regions gebregiorgis et al 2017 yong et al 2015 such drawbacks are more serious in frequently snow and ice covered high mountainous regions tang et al 2017 in this context the validation of sp datasets is of great importance for end users it is beneficial to understand the performance of these products and acknowledge their limitations before integrating them into decision making meaning that significant efforts should be made to quantify the uncertainties and evaluate their reliability recently prakash 2019 compared chirps mswep sm2rain climate change initiative sm2rain cci and trmm multi satellite precipitation analysis tmpa over india against gauged observations on a monthly scale from 1998 to 2015 the results indicated that chirps and tmpa have the best performance in the area studied followed by mswep sm2rain cci underestimates precipitation for most of india and thus requires bias correction the integrated multi satellite retrievals of gpm imerg v05 tmpa 3b42v7 and era5 products covering complex terrain and diverse climates over turkey were evaluated by amjad et al 2020 who discovered that both imerg and tmpa underestimated precipitation in wet regions and overestimated precipitation in relatively dry high slope regions chen et al 2020 evaluated and compared six satellite precipitation products gsmap nrt gsmap mvk imerg early imerg late persiann ccs and tmpa rt over two year period they stated that imerg late performed the best and gsmap nrt the worst and that all six products were highly unreliable for detecting precipitation events with intensities exceeding 32 mm d imerg and gsmap showed more uncertainties in detecting light rainfall overestimating the occurrence with significant absolute error however the situation may differ because of the different geographical nature of the study region according to sharma et al 2020 tmpa and imerg performed well in capturing events of intense precipitation and drought over the central himalayas these studies have made an essential contribution to understanding sps in reality the errors and uncertainties in sps are present not only in the precipitation estimate at a particular point but also in the estimate of the spatial extent of the spatial distribution however the majority of the above cited studies calculated the statistical metrics between the time series values of sps and reference observations ro on a grid to grid or grid to point scale and then spatially presented the metric score to explain the spatial performance of the sps as precipitation events have intrinsic distribution attributes that change over time these spatially displayed results of time dimensional comparison based on grids or points cannot effectively reveal the spatial disparity between sps and ros the spatial evolution of precipitating clouds during their lifecycle may result in a variety of satellite observational responses for different precipitation types li et al 2021a petkovic and kummerow 2017 understanding the relationship between precipitation distribution on the ground and the corresponding spatial pattern of precipitating clouds is beneficial for the retrieval algorithm development imaoka and nakamura 2012 meanwhile user feedback indicates that precipitation datasets that accurately reproduce all temporal variations over a particular region may not provide spatial patterns that are consistent with observations dembele et al 2020 guan et al 2020 laverde barajas et al 2020 the accuracy of the spatial patterns of daily precipitation has a significant impact on the simulation results of distributed hydrological and land surface models particularly at the basin scale to the best of our knowledge few studies have evaluated the daily spatial distribution of sps islam et al 2020 used a map comparison method to evaluate the spatial distribution of the mean annual precipitation for five sp datasets in australia they found that a grid to grid comparison did not reveal certain spatial differences for storm event detection in hydrological modeling laverde barajas et al 2020 tested a 3d pattern clustering method to decompose the errors in sp cmorph nrt data the results demonstrated that the spatial distribution was the primary source of error influencing the peak of the simulated streamflow thus there is an urgent need to explore the errors in the daily spatial distribution of sps and develop metrics to quantitatively represent spatial errors it is possible that these will be helpful for thoroughly evaluating the performance of sps as well as exploring potential methods for improving satellite retrieval and bias correction models in this study four spatial evaluation metrics fms sca psdi and fss and a comprehensive evaluation framework were utilized to assess the performance of five sps including the latest released mswep version 2 8 over eight basins in eastern china on a daily scale from 2011 to 2015 fms sca and psdi are introduced based on spatial distribution differences and spatial occurrences of daily precipitation this study evaluates not only the temporal distribution on a grid to grid scale but also the spatial distribution on a daily scale based on the results the sps are ranked for use in different basins according to a metric set using the entropy method this study is anticipated to expand the current understanding of sp evaluation and provide relevant information for data developers and users the remaining sections of this paper are structured as follows section 2 introduces the study area and datasets in detail section 3 describes the quantitative evaluation metrics and comprehensive evaluation methods section 4 presents the evaluation results and a summary and conclusions are presented in section 5 2 study area and data 2 1 study area china has various topographical and geomorphological types fig 1 from the perspective of water resource management and river classification mainland china is divided into nine basins 1 songliao river basin 2 haihe river basin 3 huaihe river basin 4 yellow river basin 5 yangtze river basin 6 pearl river basin 7 southeast basin 8 southwest basin and 9 continental basin see fig 1 the distribution of precipitation over mainland china decreases from the southeast to the northwest with annual precipitation ranging from more than 2000 mm in the southeastern coast to 300 mm in the northwestern inland loess plateau area most of the study area experiences higher precipitation during the summer and autumn and lower precipitation in winter and spring due to its diverse topography and variable precipitation distribution mainland china has always been a region of interest for evaluating the performance of sps here we focus only on the eight basins in eastern china because the gauging stations are scarce and unevenly distributed in the continental basin 2 2 reference dataset china gauge based daily precipitation analysis cgdpa was used for the ro cgdpa is produced by the national meteorological information center nmic of the china meteorological administration cma shen and xiong 2016 and has a 0 25 spatial resolution and a daily temporal resolution gauge observed daily precipitation from a dense network of more than 2400 stations see fig 1 was interpolated using the objective analysis technique to generate the cgdpa all data entered into the cgdpa is subject to strict quality control including checks for extreme values internal consistency checks and detection of inhomogeneity shen et al 2010 the climatology based optimal interpolation oi method is used to generate the cgdpa dataset chen et al 2008 xie and xiong 2011 the parameter elevation regressions on independent slopes model prism for monthly precipitation climatology that was created by daly et al 1997 is employed to reduce the orographic effects chen et al 2016 shen and xiong 2016 systematically conducted an independent validation of the cgdpa dataset using data from a dense network of automatic weather stations awss and concluded that the daily cgdpa analysis showed perfect agreement with the aws observations in climatically distinct regions of mainland china cgdpa can therefore be regarded as a reliable product that can be used to validate both satellite products and climatological studies conducted on the chinese mainland guo et al 2016 several studies have chosen this dataset to validate high resolution satellite precipitation chen et al 2016 guo et al 2016 li et al 2018 tang et al 2020 a similar interpolated grid dataset derived from gauge observations has also been used as a reference for sps validation studies in china india and australia islam et al 2020 prakash 2019

metrics several spatial statistical metrics were used to evaluate the spatial performance of the sps systematically based on the spatial observations of daily precipitation in sps and ro errors in the estimation of the spatial occurrence of precipitation can be categorized into four types see fig 2 type 1 is precipitation detected by sps but absent from ro type 2 describes the situation in which sps fail to detect precipitation events observed in the ro type 3 denotes a precipitation event that occurs in both the ro and sps in zones that do not overlap type 4 describes the condition in which a precipitation event is detected by both ro and sps but does not fully overlap on the basis of these error types four spatial statistical metrics reflecting the spatial distribution accuracy of precipitation detected by sps were developed among them fms evaluates the frequency of serious error observation events sca and fss evaluate the accuracy of the spatial extent of whether precipitation occurs and psdi assesses the similarity of spatial precipitation overlapping area observed by sps and ro simultaneously to differentiate between rainy and non rainy days we chose 1 mm per day as the threshold detailed information is given below 3 1 1 false monitoring score compared with error type 4 error types 1 3 lead to a more serious incorrect estimation of the spatial distribution of precipitation these types of errors introduce additional uncertainty in the application of sps especially in land surface models and flood forecasting the fms with 0 as the perfect value was developed to indicate the number of occurrences of false monitoring within a specific period monthly seasonally or yearly over the region of interest roi the fms is estimated as follows 1 fms d t 1 d t 2 d t 3 n where d t 1 d t 2 and d t 3 are the number of days in which error types 1 2 and 3 occur in a specific time cycle respectively the total number of study cycles such as months seasons or years is represented by n 3 1 2 spatial coverage approximation based on the four error types the spatial coverage approximation sca of daily precipitation with 1 as the perfect value is introduced as the ratio of an area where precipitation events both occurring and not occurring have been detected correctly to the area of roi the sca score is 1 when no precipitation is recognized the equations are defined as follows 2 s ca a ro a sp a ro a sp a roi if a ro 0 or a sp 0 1 if a ro 0 and a sp 0 where a ro is the spatial coverage area of precipitation recorded by ro a sp is the spatial coverage area of precipitation detected by sps a ro and a sp are the spatial supplementary set of a ro and a sp respectively and a roi represents the entire roi this metric can measure the location accuracy in the spatial distribution of daily precipitation 3 1 3 precipitation spatial difference index investigating the differences in spatial distribution variance and quantity between sps and or in areas where precipitation is detected by both sps and or as the intersection area of error type 4 shown in fig 2 d is crucial for a comprehensive evaluation inspired by the concept of multi component synthesis from the kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 which is widely used to assess discharge simulations in hydrological modeling pool et al 2018 a spatial evaluation metric called the precipitation spatial difference index psdi is proposed 3 psdi 1 α 1 2 β 1 2 γ 1 2 where α is the spatial correlation coefficient between the sps and ro on the spatial grid to grid scale β is the spatial variability calculated by σ s μ s σ ro μ ro and γ is the similarity in the spatial patterns of sps and ro which can be expressed as 1 minus jsd the jensen shannon divergence jsd fuglede and topsoe 2004 was used to determine the degree to which a probability distribution differs from a reference probability distribution and can be calculated using eqs 4 and 5 4 kl p q i 1 n p x log p x q x 5 jsd p q 1 2 kl p x p x q x 2 1 2 kl q x p x q x 2 p x and q x are the precipitation probability distributions of the sps and ro in the overlapping region on the same day respectively jsd has been widely used in image similarity and change detection especially for gray scale images such as satellite images bruni and vitulano 2016 yang et al 2014 3 1 4 fractions skill score the fss which was first introduced by roberts and lean 2008 is another indicator that can be used to quantify the spatial agreement between sps and ro fss varies between 0 and 1 with a value closer to 1 indicating higher agreement between the simulated and observed precipitation in this study the fss between the sps and ro was computed using the following equation 6 fss 1 mse ms e ws mse is the mean square error and ms e ws reflects the worst scenarios with no agreement both can be calculated using the following equation 7 mse 1 n h n v i 1 n h j 1 n v o n i j p n i j 2 8 mse ws 1 n h n v i 1 n h j 1 n v o n i j 2 i 1 n h j 1 n v p n i j 2 where n h and n v are the numbers of columns and rows in the calculation area respectively o n i j and p n i j indicate the number of grids in which precipitation occurs inside the n n moving window for ro and sps respectively please refer to roberts and lean 2008 for a detailed description of the fss calculation 3 2 temporal evaluation metrics several conventional evaluation metrics including the correlation coefficient cc relative bias rb root mean square error rmse kge probability of detection pod and false alarm ratio far were used to quantitatively evaluate the performance of five sps in the study area from 2011 to 2015 these metrics were estimated using a time series of daily sps and ro based on grid to grid pairs detailed information on these metrics is provided in table 2 3 3 comprehensive evaluation framework after obtaining the two sets of metrics mentioned above a comprehensive evaluation framework can be constructed using shannon s entropy weighting method chowdhury et al 2021 the framework consists of three layers the highest being the target layer the second being the criteria layers which include the temporal evaluation criteria and spatial evaluation criteria and the last layer consists of ten metrics as described in sections 3 1 and 3 2 fig 3 shows the schematic diagram of the comprehensive evaluation the entropy method automatically assigns weights to different metrics the main advantage of the entropy method is its ability to spontaneously determine the weights of each metric and minimize the bias towards any particular metric the calculation steps are 9 e p m 1 ln n i 1 n k i m ln k i m for m 1 2 m where e p m is the entropy value of each metric and n is the number of sps m represents the number of metrics k i m represents the normalized index for indicator m in sps i the level of diversification and the weights of each metric are obtained by eqs 10 and 11 respectively 10 d d m 1 e p m 11 w m d d m m 1 m d d m where d d m reflects the level of diversification and w m is the normalized weight of the metrics then the final comprehensive evaluation value cei for sps i is computed as 12 cei c 1 m 1 n 1 k i m w m c 2 m 1 n 2 k i m w m where c 1 and c 2 are the criteria weights set as 0 5 in this study n 1 and n 2 are the number of metrics in the corresponding criteria khosravi et al 2016 song et al 2017 here 4 for spatial metrics and 6 for time series metrics respectively 4 results 4 1 conventional metrics analysis figs 4 and 5 depict the results of six time series metrics calculated grid by grid for the five sps as well as the average scores for each basin statistics of six metrics for the eight river basins over eastern china were shown in table a1 for cc first column in fig 4 mswep cmads and itpcas share similarities with average scores exceeding 0 75 in each basin except the southwest basin indicating that they can capture the daily variations of precipitation relatively well chirps and persiann also show comparable results but their performance is inferior to that of the other three rmse and rb second and third columns in fig 4 reflect the total differences of the precipitation in one grid it is obvious that the rmse values for mswep cmads and itpcas are relatively small whereas chirps shows the worst performance particularly over the southeastern region of eastern china in all eight basins cmads underestimated precipitation with larger biases in the north itpcas also has a slight underestimation tendency in the haihe yellow yangtze pearl and southeastern basins while it overestimates precipitation in the songliao huaihe and southwestern basins mswep underestimates precipitation in the southern part of eastern china especially in the southeastern basin 11 7 whereas it overestimates precipitation in the southwestern basin chirps and persiann tended to overestimate precipitation in almost all basins with the largest bias observed in the southwestern basin itpcas cmads and mswep outperformed chirps and persiann in terms of kge first column in fig 5 the spatial distributions of kge for the five sps were almost identical to those of the cc mswep and itpcas demonstrated the best pod performance second column in fig 5 followed by cmads and persiann chirps displays obvious inadequacy in precipitation event detection at the point scale with most average pod scores lower than 0 5 high far values last column of fig 5 are the most common features for all five sps except for cmads the results of this metric are worse for northern basins than those in the southeast overall from the perspective of temporal analysis the latest versions of mswep cmads and itpcas are superior to chirps and persiann table a1 shows that mswep and itcas have the highest cc values that mswep has the highest pod that cmads has the lowest far and rmse and that itpcas has the highest kge and the lowest absolute rb moreover cmads resulted in an apparent underestimation in the study area 4 2 spatial metrics analysis 4 2 1 precipitation occurrence errors in the fms analysis for all five sps error type 1 contributes more than error types 2 and 3 at the seasonal scale especially in the northern and southeastern basins fig 6 error type 3 is another main source of errors with error type 2 occurring infrequently with the exception of chirps and persiann none of the sps were particularly prone to these three types of errors during summer however the opposite occurs in autumn and winter obviously in addition the five sps performed better in southern basins than in northern basins the possible causes behind this were the differences in climate and precipitation types in winter the cold land surface that results from snow and ice cover in the north may interfere with the scatter signal received by pmw radiometers from precipitating clouds cold cirrus clouds that are associated with low brightness temperatures also induce more precipitation estimates when data are collected via the infrared retrieval algorithm gebregiorgis et al 2017 it is worth noting that mswep performed the best in the fms analysis error types 2 3 and 4 are summarized to obtain the spatial distribution of the misdetection ratio frequency of missing detected precipitation graphical examples of missing detected precipitation events and false alerted precipitation events are shown in fig a1 over eastern china fig 7 a e it is obvious that mswep and itpcas exhibit very low values less than 1 throughout the study area followed by cmads with relatively high values in the upper reaches of the yangtze southwest basins whereas persiann and chirps perform poorly particularly in southern china where the terrain is complex and more precipitation occurs correspondingly the false detection ratio frequency of false alerted precipitation fig 7 f j was also calculated based on events where error types 1 3 and 4 occurred chirps and cmads exhibited low false detection ratios of almost less than 15 in the study area mswep has more than 25 false detection ratios over the southwestern regions with high precipitation but comparatively low values in the north due to its small fms values we speculate that the primary cause is events of error type 4 in which sps identify precipitation but the rainy area detected is either not totally matched with the ro or is larger than the ro contrary to mswep false events detected using persiann are mainly concentrated in the northern part of the study area similar to mswep this high false detection ratio in this zone is aggravated by events of error type 4 the false detection ratio is evenly distributed for itpcas which may be due to the systemic error that is caused by adjustment fig 8 illustrates the probability distributions of precipitation intensities and corresponding event areas for misdetection and false detection events it is evident that the probability distributions of missed precipitation intensities for mswep and itpcas are narrow and steep with precipitation intensities ranging from 0 to 5 mm d cmads shows comparable shapes but with larger peak value fig 8 a this means that mswep itpcas and cmads tend to misdetect light precipitation 5 mm day the distributions for chirps and persiann are wide and flat indicating their high uncertainty in estimating precipitation the same situation occurs for the probability distribution of event areas for this type the distribution ranges are very narrow for mswep and itpcas followed by cmads and persiann and the worst is chirps fig 8 c with respect to falsely detected precipitation the intensity distributions are similar to those of misdetected precipitation with a narrower range and zero closed peak values fig 8 b light rain 2 mm d is prone to false alerts by itpcas mswep and cmads the distributions of event areas are totally different with narrow and zero closed peak values for cmads and chirps and the opposite for the other three sps fig 8 d this further confirms the results of the false detection ratio shown in fig 7 f j overall it is concluded that the cmads monitors the spatial occurrence of precipitation events more accurately than the other four products 4 2 2 analysis of sca psdi and fss for all sps there is no significant annual variation in sca the average daily sca scores for the northern basins songliao haihe huaihe and yellow were slightly higher than those of the southern basins yangtze pearl southeast and southwest fig 9 with cmads showing the highest sca score for all basins with mswep and itpcas showing the second and third highest respectively chirps performs better than persiann except in the pearl basin where they have the same score no noticeable monthly fluctuation was observed in the cmads for all basins except those in the southwest fig a2 in all basins except pearl the other four sps displayed slight seasonal variations with higher scores in winter but lower scores in summer persiann exhibits the most notable fluctuations indicating its high uncertainty in monitoring the precipitation covered area on a daily scale psdi can simultaneously measure the spatial similarity of precipitation monitored by sps and ro the optimal value is 1 while the minimum acceptable value is negative infinity the yearly monthly and daily psdi series as well as monthly average psdi series are illustrated in fig 10 and a3 in the yangtze river basin all five products have satisfactory results with cmads performing the best similar to its performance in the sca cmads has the highest value in nearly all basins except for songliao where mswep has a higher value indicating its high capability to reproduce the spatial distribution of the observed precipitation itpcas outperformed mswep in the assessment of spatial distribution however persiann performs worse than chirps with obvious annual changes especially for haihe huaihe pearl and southeast river basins considering the seasonal variation the northern basins songliao haihe huaihe and yellow have high psdi scores in summer and low scores in winter this phenomenon gradually diminishes in the southern basins this may be due to climate differences as summer precipitation in the north is greater than winter precipitation another possible reason is the high uncertainty of satellite precipitation monitoring in capturing winter snowfall petkovic and kummerow 2017 additionally we compared the precipitation amount at locations where sps and ors detected precipitation events it should be noted that compared amount of precipitation is the spatial average interestingly mswep has high kge scores and low rmse values in most northern basins relative to cmads while the absolute rb values for mswep are lower than those for cmads see fig 11 except for chirps all the other products underestimated precipitation to varying degrees with cmads and persiann having the most apparent biases this partially aligns with the findings presented in section 4 1 generally for fss five sps had no significant annual variation cmads exhibited the best performance in all eight basins followed by mswep and itpcas then chirps and persiann the worst fig 12 the results also show significant seasonal variation with low fss values in spring and winter and high values in summer fig a4 the events of error types 1 3 and their spatial range may be the main contributor to the low fss value according to the definition of fss and error types also events of error types 1 3 happen more frequently in spring and winter than in summer and autumn as fig 6 shows so the results of fss can be partly explained by the occurrence of events of these three error types all five sps have worse performance at northern basins compared to southern basins the high fss value of cmads may be explained by the fact that the spatial range of these three error types corresponding to spatial areas affected by misdetection events and false detection events for cmads is relatively low as illustrated in fig 8 c and d 4 3 case study for spatial indicators the spatial distributions of precipitation for the five sps and observations on july 15 2012 a randomly selected rainy day are used as an example to further demonstrate the effectiveness of sca psdi and fss in quantifying the spatial distribution and characteristics of precipitation fig 13 during this period precipitation was primarily distributed over the southern portion of the yangtze river basin the northern part of the pearl river basin the entire southeastern basin and most of the southwestern basin in addition slight rainfall also occurred in the songliao basin the center of heavy rainfall 60 mm day was mainly distributed along an east west band in the southern yangtze river basin fig 13 a cmads and chirps reproduce the spatial coverage of precipitation more accurately with high sca and fss values the remaining three products erroneously alerted slight precipitation in the vicinity of the actual precipitation region showing relatively low sca and fss values cmads and itpcas efficiently captured the locations of heavy precipitation centers along the south of the yangtze river basin with psdi values as high as 0 78 and 0 77 respectively for psdi mswep was inferior to cmads and itpcas but it detected the locations of heavy rain centers better than chirps and persiann persiann did not accurately monitor the locations of heavy rain and had the lowest psdi value overall a similar conclusion can be drawn by intuitive comparison of precipitation images but the use of the three metrics could provide a quantitative evaluation 4 4 comprehensive ranks of sps finally after obtaining the results of the two categories of ten metrics we integrated them into the comprehensive evaluation system described in section 3 3 the resulting ranks are shown in fig 14 generally mswep cmads and itpcas are superior to chirps and persiann mswep performs consistently better in northern basins such as the songliao haihe huaihe and yellow river basins than in southern basins cmads ranks first in southern basins including those of the yangtze pearl and southeast rivers but not in northern basins itpcas is stable and ranks second in most basins chirps and persiann have similar ranks but in general chirps is better for most basins it should be noted that mswep and persiann are global products and are more accessible than cmads and itpcas which are local products covering east asia and china this information may be of interest to data users who want to choose these long term datasets for hydrometeorological studies in eastern china 5 discussion recent developments of remote sensing observation and retrieval merging algorithms have created unprecedented opportunities for the improvement of sps the five sps used here are satellite precipitation that merged and corrected by observations with the long term record user demands for the accuracy of the spatial distribution of sps are also gradually increasing particularly in the aspect of distributed hydrological simulation abrupt drought flood alternations analysis and research into the spatial evolution of drought processes kazemzadeh et al 2022 wang et al 2020 yang et al 2022 yin et al 2021 in this study four spatial error types of precipitation and four spatial evaluation indicators based on a daily scale were introduced into the comprehensive assessment framework of sps when it comes to detecting precipitation events from a spatial perspective events of spatial error types 1 3 are more unacceptable due to the total wrong precipitation detection though error type 4 may also introduce misdetection and false detection over the none overlapping area according to the statistical results of the occurrence of events of the first three error types as shown in fig 6 mswep had the lowest score compared to the other four sps thus misdetection events for mswep were mainly caused by error type 4 error type 3 could also be another trigger albeit with a relatively low percentage further when we explored the spatial distribution range of misdetection and false detection caused by all four error types we found that the spatial range of misdetection events for mswep and itpcas was primarily less than 0 3 106 km3 over eastern china however this value was much larger for cmads and persiann reaching 1 0 106 km3 fig 8 c regarding to spatial range of false detection events as shown in fig 8 d the distribution center for mswep was larger than that for cmads located at around 1 2 106 km3 this implied that once the events of daily spatial precipitation false detection happened for mswep the extent was relatively large in addition fig 7 demonstrated that mswep had a higher false detection ratio than cmads this was in contrast to the findings that mswep had fewer occurrences of error types 1 and 3 that led to false detection displayed in fig 6 we could speculate that the relatively high false detection ratio for mswep in comparison to cmads was due to events of error type 4 which indicated that mswep could reproduce single day precipitation events with reasonably high accuracy but tended to overestimate the spatial coverage the example shown in fig 13 could also support the above inference mswep fig 13 c demonstrated a broader coverage of precipitation compared to the observation fig 13 a with lower sca and fss values than cmads fig 13 d this may cause by the fact that mswep incorporated more satellite reanalysis and radar image which may increase the possibility of identifying the precipitable cloud areas as precipitation events beck et al 2019 petkovic and kummerow 2017 the previous study has also reported the high false alert rate for the last version of mswep ver 2 2 at the yellow river basin of china yang et al 2020 persiann and itpcas had the same false detection problems as mswep but the false detection events for persiann mainly happened in the northern part of the whole study area whereas itpcas happened homogenously so reducing this overestimation of spatial coverage on daily precipitation may be paid more attention by data produces and it has been shown that the accuracy of hydrological simulations driven by blended satellite precipitation can be effectively improved by reducing the false detection rate yin et al 2021 in the case of daily rainfall events detected by both satellite and ground based observations precipitation amount of overlapping area in error type 4 the sps yielded significantly lower precipitation value than the or except for chirps this should also be noticed by data user when they considered using sps in application of flooding modeling kim and lee 2019 the results shown in fig 15 and a5 of the error decomposition which divided the total precipitation error at grid scale into hit bias missed precipitation and false precipitation chen et al 2021 partially corroborated the aforementioned findings fig 15 illustrates the error distribution along with elevation while fig a5 depicts their spatial distribution all five sps exhibit significant false precipitation error with chirps and persiann exhibiting the greatest error up to 200 mm per year this was one source of estimation error one possible explanation is that the amount of precipitation falling on the ground is less than the amount of precipitation in the precipitating clouds due to sub cloud evapotranspiration this effect has the potential to cause significant uncertainty in precipitation retrieval algorithms monsieurs et al 2018 prajapati et al 2022 fig 8 b demonstrates that the erroneously detected precipitation resembles light rain however the spatial distributions of false precipitation amount fig a5 fourth column were not identical to those of the false detection ratio fig 7f j mswep and itpcas had a high false detection ratio and a low false precipitation amount whereas chirps had a low false detection ratio and a high false precipitation amount regarding missed precipitation mswep itpcas and cmads had relatively low values for both missed precipitation amount and miss detection ratio whereas chirps and persiann performed poorly as shown in figs 7 15 and a5 this issue may be attributable to the inability of satellite sensors to detect the warm rain process and convective rainfall typically short duration rainfall events particularly in humid regions el kenawy et al 2019 wang et al 2019 moreover mswep itpcas and cmads incorporated more daily gauged precipitation data whereas chirps and persiann merged monthly and sparsely distributed gauged data as shown in fig 15 and a5 the hit bias of all products besides chirps tends to underestimate precipitation this was consistent with the results shown in fig 11 the identical situation occurred for six etccdi extreme precipitation indices as shown in supplementary table a2 and fig a6 other researchers also discovered a significant overestimation of chirps in eastern china shen et al 2020 mswep and iptcas errors changing along with elevation were relatively flat except for total error and hit bias for persiann and missed and false precipitation for cmads other products exhibited no obvious topographic dependency the current primary approach to sp error analysis is still based on calculating indicators at the point to grid or grid to grid scale and then placing the indicator values in space as a proxy for their spatial performance sun et al 2018 however the precipitation event itself has spatial and temporal properties in terms of the precipitation development process da silva et al 2021 hong et al 2006 li et al 2015 therefore analyzing the error characteristics of sps on a grid scale provides a limited view that is insufficient to reveal the sources of errors in satellite observation of a precipitation process and cannot provide better assistance for error correction and improvement of satellite merging retrieval algorithms with the continuous improvement of ground based precipitation observation networks in developed regions precipitation grid data with high spatial and temporal resolution based on pure ground based observation networks have gradually become available allowing us to analyze sps errors from the perspective of the spatial and temporal distribution of precipitation events some researchers have begun to work on this part of the research li et al 2021b we hope that the spatial analysis method provided in this paper will also inspire and help other researchers furthermore when applying these long time sps to ungauged regions or using them directly data users must analyze and judge what spatial and temporal scales of the data are appropriate for the specific application and the uncertainty analysis of sps in specific applications deserves further discussion 6 conclusions this study aimed to comprehensively evaluate five long term satellite derived precipitation datasets including the most recent mswep version 2 8 from the temporal perspective at the grid scale and spatial perspective of daily precipitation occurrence and distribution in eastern china to achieve this objective four spatial performance evaluation metrics and a comprehensive evaluation system were introduced the major findings of this study are as follows except for chirps all products underestimated precipitation in the southern basins with cmads understanding the most the miss detection ratio is very low for mswep and itpcas throughout the entire study area followed by cmads whereas persiann and chirps likely underestimate precipitation events especially in the complex terrain and rainy areas in the south because satellite sensors cannot capture warm rain and convective rainfall typically short duration events especially in humid regions and also mswep itpcas and cmads integrated more observed information than persiann and chirps chirps and cmads showed low false detection ratios less than 15 over the study area the high false detection ratio of mswep is primarily caused when spatial precipitation coverage detected by mswep is not totally matched with or larger than that observed mswep itpcas and cmads show uncertainties in detecting slight rainfall 2 mm day and are prone to false alerts for this type of precipitation sub cloud evapotranspiration effect has the potential to introduce significant uncertainty into precipitation retrieval algorithms resulting in these false alarms overall cmads monitors the occurrence and spatial distribution of daily precipitation events more accurately three metrics sca psdi and fss provide an effective quantitative evaluation of the spatial distribution characteristics of daily precipitation the results show that cmads has significant advantages in obtaining the spatial distribution of precipitation while mswep performs well in the northern basins none of the products mswep cmads and itpcas rank first in all basins considering the data acquisition and update latency issues for cmads and itpcas the latest version of mswep version 2 8 may be a satisfactory alternative with relatively high accuracy and may therefore be useful to research community involved in water and climate related studies however it should be noted that with the exception of chirps all sps tend to underestimate precipitation amounts for correctly detected spatial precipitation events in light of the growing demand for long term satellite precipitation datasets with reliable spatial accuracy we anticipate that the above findings will offer data providers and end users a better understanding of their inherent uncertainties the metrics associated with the spatial evaluation may be utilized in future studies that require validation of the spatial correctness of the data prior to executing operational works such as forcing land surface models or fully distributed hydrological models and drought assessments the spatial metrics sca psdi and fss presented in this study can also be considered as optimal

7828,study region eight main basins at eastern china study focus this study proposes a comprehensive framework using shannon s entropy weighting method for assessing satellite precipitation data from spatial and temporal perspectives first three new spatial evaluation metrics the false monitoring score fms spatial coverage approximation sca and precipitation spatial difference index psdi were introduced based on spatial distribution differences of daily precipitation then the error and performance of the five satellite precipitation datasets over eastern china were analyzed new hydrological insights for the region the spatial metrics sca psdi and fraction skill score fss provide an effective quantitative evaluation of the daily spatial distribution of precipitation cmads and mswep appear to be superior at reproducing the spatial distribution of precipitation except for chirps all other four datasets have a tendency to underestimate precipitation measurements in the study area according to the evaluation the latest version of mswep may be a suitable alternative for use in water and climate research due to its relatively high accuracy in eastern china the spatial error analysis method utilized in this study can be transferred to evaluating other gridded precipitation products meanwhile the spatial error indices are also acceptable as optimization targets for future satellite precipitation data production graphical abstract graphical abstract ga1 keywords comprehensive evaluation spatial errors satellite precipitation products eastern china data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction precipitation is one of the critical variables in the water and energy cycles that occur on earth kucera et al 2013 tan et al 2018 accurate precipitation databases are of great importance to water resource managers for the effective monitoring of droughts and floods and for hydrometeorologists to carry out relevant research such as hydrological prediction climate change assessments disaster preparedness and mitigation hong et al 2004 huffman et al 2007 yong et al 2015 precipitation also plays a vital role in agricultural production and the provision of domestic water supplies jalota et al 2006 however obtaining a long term and reliable global precipitation record with a high spatiotemporal resolution is challenging mei et al 2014 tang et al 2020 conventionally precipitation is measured using ground based gauges this simple and straightforward method can provide rainfall information with a high temporal frequency on a point scale unfortunately the uneven distribution and scarcity of rain gauge networks in many regions particularly in developing countries means that the spatial variation of rainfall cannot be accurately captured xie et al 2003 alternatively weather radars can monitor precipitation at finer spatial resolutions with greater time efficiency however radar precipitation estimates are also subject to uncertainties that arise from the imprecise reflectivity rainfall z r relationship signal attenuation and landform occlusion especially in complex terrain beauchamp and chandrasekar 2016 gebregiorgis et al 2017 zulkafli et al 2014 in addition the low cost effectiveness and high technical threshold of radar mean that it cannot be deployed worldwide recent decades have demonstrated that satellite remote is a promising alternative for monitoring precipitation at regional or even global scales satellites collect instantaneous information about precipitating clouds to estimate the precipitation rate through self equipped infrared sensors precipitation radar and passive microwave pmw radiometers sun et al 2018 furthermore satellite derived merged precipitation datasets sps that include characteristics such as high space time continuity and resolution have been developed by merging aspects of the above three types of observations with other ground observations the launch of the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm satellite constellation in 1998 which was the predecessor of the current global precipitation measurement gpm ushered in a new era for satellite rainfall observations since then numerous sp products have been made available to the public tan et al 2016 including trmm 3b42 v7 the climate prediction center cpc morphing technique morph and the precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks climate data record persiann cdr are typical examples ashouri et al 2015 huffman et al 2007 joyce et al 2004 subsequently the climate hazards group infrared precipitation with station data chirps and multi source weighted ensemble precipitation mswep products were developed to meet the long term record needs of the user community beck et al 2019 funk et al 2015 because of their easy access sps are considered a valuable alternative to gauged observations the use of sps in hydrological or land surface modeling regional water resource management and the detection of extreme weather events such as meteorological droughts and floods has exhibited a worldwide upward trend dembele et al 2020 lakew 2020 despite their many advantages sps also suffer several inherent uncertainties that mainly originate in the retrieval algorithms used local weather conditions topography and sampling frequency as reported sps have obvious deficiencies in capturing low intensity precipitation events during the winter because of the impact that a cold surface background has on pmw retrievals the performance is significantly better during the summer and in hot regions gebregiorgis et al 2017 yong et al 2015 such drawbacks are more serious in frequently snow and ice covered high mountainous regions tang et al 2017 in this context the validation of sp datasets is of great importance for end users it is beneficial to understand the performance of these products and acknowledge their limitations before integrating them into decision making meaning that significant efforts should be made to quantify the uncertainties and evaluate their reliability recently prakash 2019 compared chirps mswep sm2rain climate change initiative sm2rain cci and trmm multi satellite precipitation analysis tmpa over india against gauged observations on a monthly scale from 1998 to 2015 the results indicated that chirps and tmpa have the best performance in the area studied followed by mswep sm2rain cci underestimates precipitation for most of india and thus requires bias correction the integrated multi satellite retrievals of gpm imerg v05 tmpa 3b42v7 and era5 products covering complex terrain and diverse climates over turkey were evaluated by amjad et al 2020 who discovered that both imerg and tmpa underestimated precipitation in wet regions and overestimated precipitation in relatively dry high slope regions chen et al 2020 evaluated and compared six satellite precipitation products gsmap nrt gsmap mvk imerg early imerg late persiann ccs and tmpa rt over two year period they stated that imerg late performed the best and gsmap nrt the worst and that all six products were highly unreliable for detecting precipitation events with intensities exceeding 32 mm d imerg and gsmap showed more uncertainties in detecting light rainfall overestimating the occurrence with significant absolute error however the situation may differ because of the different geographical nature of the study region according to sharma et al 2020 tmpa and imerg performed well in capturing events of intense precipitation and drought over the central himalayas these studies have made an essential contribution to understanding sps in reality the errors and uncertainties in sps are present not only in the precipitation estimate at a particular point but also in the estimate of the spatial extent of the spatial distribution however the majority of the above cited studies calculated the statistical metrics between the time series values of sps and reference observations ro on a grid to grid or grid to point scale and then spatially presented the metric score to explain the spatial performance of the sps as precipitation events have intrinsic distribution attributes that change over time these spatially displayed results of time dimensional comparison based on grids or points cannot effectively reveal the spatial disparity between sps and ros the spatial evolution of precipitating clouds during their lifecycle may result in a variety of satellite observational responses for different precipitation types li et al 2021a petkovic and kummerow 2017 understanding the relationship between precipitation distribution on the ground and the corresponding spatial pattern of precipitating clouds is beneficial for the retrieval algorithm development imaoka and nakamura 2012 meanwhile user feedback indicates that precipitation datasets that accurately reproduce all temporal variations over a particular region may not provide spatial patterns that are consistent with observations dembele et al 2020 guan et al 2020 laverde barajas et al 2020 the accuracy of the spatial patterns of daily precipitation has a significant impact on the simulation results of distributed hydrological and land surface models particularly at the basin scale to the best of our knowledge few studies have evaluated the daily spatial distribution of sps islam et al 2020 used a map comparison method to evaluate the spatial distribution of the mean annual precipitation for five sp datasets in australia they found that a grid to grid comparison did not reveal certain spatial differences for storm event detection in hydrological modeling laverde barajas et al 2020 tested a 3d pattern clustering method to decompose the errors in sp cmorph nrt data the results demonstrated that the spatial distribution was the primary source of error influencing the peak of the simulated streamflow thus there is an urgent need to explore the errors in the daily spatial distribution of sps and develop metrics to quantitatively represent spatial errors it is possible that these will be helpful for thoroughly evaluating the performance of sps as well as exploring potential methods for improving satellite retrieval and bias correction models in this study four spatial evaluation metrics fms sca psdi and fss and a comprehensive evaluation framework were utilized to assess the performance of five sps including the latest released mswep version 2 8 over eight basins in eastern china on a daily scale from 2011 to 2015 fms sca and psdi are introduced based on spatial distribution differences and spatial occurrences of daily precipitation this study evaluates not only the temporal distribution on a grid to grid scale but also the spatial distribution on a daily scale based on the results the sps are ranked for use in different basins according to a metric set using the entropy method this study is anticipated to expand the current understanding of sp evaluation and provide relevant information for data developers and users the remaining sections of this paper are structured as follows section 2 introduces the study area and datasets in detail section 3 describes the quantitative evaluation metrics and comprehensive evaluation methods section 4 presents the evaluation results and a summary and conclusions are presented in section 5 2 study area and data 2 1 study area china has various topographical and geomorphological types fig 1 from the perspective of water resource management and river classification mainland china is divided into nine basins 1 songliao river basin 2 haihe river basin 3 huaihe river basin 4 yellow river basin 5 yangtze river basin 6 pearl river basin 7 southeast basin 8 southwest basin and 9 continental basin see fig 1 the distribution of precipitation over mainland china decreases from the southeast to the northwest with annual precipitation ranging from more than 2000 mm in the southeastern coast to 300 mm in the northwestern inland loess plateau area most of the study area experiences higher precipitation during the summer and autumn and lower precipitation in winter and spring due to its diverse topography and variable precipitation distribution mainland china has always been a region of interest for evaluating the performance of sps here we focus only on the eight basins in eastern china because the gauging stations are scarce and unevenly distributed in the continental basin 2 2 reference dataset china gauge based daily precipitation analysis cgdpa was used for the ro cgdpa is produced by the national meteorological information center nmic of the china meteorological administration cma shen and xiong 2016 and has a 0 25 spatial resolution and a daily temporal resolution gauge observed daily precipitation from a dense network of more than 2400 stations see fig 1 was interpolated using the objective analysis technique to generate the cgdpa all data entered into the cgdpa is subject to strict quality control including checks for extreme values internal consistency checks and detection of inhomogeneity shen et al 2010 the climatology based optimal interpolation oi method is used to generate the cgdpa dataset chen et al 2008 xie and xiong 2011 the parameter elevation regressions on independent slopes model prism for monthly precipitation climatology that was created by daly et al 1997 is employed to reduce the orographic effects chen et al 2016 shen and xiong 2016 systematically conducted an independent validation of the cgdpa dataset using data from a dense network of automatic weather stations awss and concluded that the daily cgdpa analysis showed perfect agreement with the aws observations in climatically distinct regions of mainland china cgdpa can therefore be regarded as a reliable product that can be used to validate both satellite products and climatological studies conducted on the chinese mainland guo et al 2016 several studies have chosen this dataset to validate high resolution satellite precipitation chen et al 2016 guo et al 2016 li et al 2018 tang et al 2020 a similar interpolated grid dataset derived from gauge observations has also been used as a reference for sps validation studies in china india and australia islam et al 2020 prakash 2019 yang et al 2020 2 3 satellite merged precipitation data five satellite gauge merged corrected sps chirps mswep cmads persiann cdr and itpcas with high spatiotemporal resolution and long term records covering over 30 years were compared to cgdpa from 2011 to 2015 basic information about the gridded products is provided in table 1 for analysis at a spatial resolution of 0 25 chirps with 0 05 was spatially averaged to 0 25 iptcas and mswep 0 1 were divided into 0 05 and then averaged to 0 25 this method has been widely used in many studies chen et al 2021 gehne et al 2016 shen et al 2020 2 3 1 chirps the long term chirps dataset which was developed by the climate hazards group of the university of california santa barbara was originally used for drought monitoring the dataset is generated by merging gauged observations and monthly precipitation climatology with satellite derived precipitation estimates thermal infrared cold cloud duration ccd observations are used to produce long term and high resolution precipitation estimates then multi source gauged observations from the global historical climate network and global telecommunication system of wmo are incorporated using a modified inverse distancing weight idw method funk et al 2015 the latest version 2 0 was initialized in 1981 and has continued gathering data at spatial resolutions of 0 05 and 0 25 since the daily data with a resolution of 0 25 that were used in this study are available at https data chc ucsb edu products chirps 2 0 global daily netcdf p25 2 3 2 mswep2 8 mswep version 2 8 released on february 4 2021 is a global precipitation product that has produced data at resolutions of 3 h and 0 1 from 1979 to the present anon 2021 the product merges gauge satellite and reanalysis data to obtain precipitation estimates mswep incorporates daily gauge observations and accounts for gauge reporting times to reduce temporal mismatches between satellite reanalysis estimates and gauge observations mswep v2 8 features new data sources improved weight maps less peaky precipitation estimates a longer record and near real time estimates compared to the older versions two datasets era5 and imerg with improved performance were incorporated with the version used in this study gridded satellite gridsat was still used prior to 2000 the merging was performed for four zones with various air temperatures 0 c 0 10 c 10 20 c and 20 c to account for the influence of the different precipitation regimes convective versus frontal weight maps were produced for each temperature zone using random forest regression based on seven climate and topography related predictors in order to improve the performance in sparsely gauged regions chelsa climatologies at high resolution for the earth s land surface areas was selected for monthly climatological corrections anon 2021 to our knowledge this is the first study to evaluate the new mswep dataset in eastern china more information and links from

data with relatively high uncertainly from around 36 000 automatic weather stations and radar detection estimates from nmic joyce et al 2004 a data integration method that includes loop nesting the projection of resampling models pattern estimation and bilinear interpolation is used to combine the data meng et al 2018 the latest cmads l v1 1 dataset provides daily precipitation at a spatial

metrics several spatial statistical metrics were used to evaluate the spatial performance of the sps systematically based on the spatial observations of daily precipitation in sps and ro errors in the estimation of the spatial occurrence of precipitation can be categorized into four types see fig 2 type 1 is precipitation detected by sps but absent from ro type 2 describes the situation in which sps fail to detect precipitation events observed in the ro type 3 denotes a precipitation event that occurs in both the ro and sps in zones that do not overlap type 4 describes the condition in which a precipitation event is detected by both ro and sps but does not fully overlap on the basis of these error types four spatial statistical metrics reflecting the spatial distribution accuracy of precipitation detected by sps were developed among them fms evaluates the frequency of serious error observation events sca and fss evaluate the accuracy of the spatial extent of whether precipitation occurs and psdi assesses the similarity of spatial precipitation overlapping area observed by sps and ro simultaneously to differentiate between rainy and non rainy days we chose 1 mm per day as the threshold detailed information is given below 3 1 1 false monitoring score compared with error type 4 error types 1 3 lead to a more serious incorrect estimation of the spatial distribution of precipitation these types of errors introduce additional uncertainty in the application of sps especially in land surface models and flood forecasting the fms with 0 as the perfect value was developed to indicate the number of occurrences of false monitoring within a specific period monthly seasonally or yearly over the region of interest roi the fms is estimated as follows 1 fms d t 1 d t 2 d t 3 n where d t 1 d t 2 and d t 3 are the number of days in which error types 1 2 and 3 occur in a specific time cycle respectively the total number of study cycles such as months seasons or years is represented by n 3 1 2 spatial coverage approximation based on the four error types the spatial coverage approximation sca of daily precipitation with 1 as the perfect value is introduced as the ratio of an area where precipitation events both occurring and not occurring have been detected correctly to the area of roi the sca score is 1 when no precipitation is recognized the equations are defined as follows 2 s ca a ro a sp a ro a sp a roi if a ro 0 or a sp 0 1 if a ro 0 and a sp 0 where a ro is the spatial coverage area of precipitation recorded by ro a sp is the spatial coverage area of precipitation detected by sps a ro and a sp are the spatial supplementary set of a ro and a sp respectively and a roi represents the entire roi this metric can measure the location accuracy in the spatial distribution of daily precipitation 3 1 3 precipitation spatial difference index investigating the differences in spatial distribution variance and quantity between sps and or in areas where precipitation is detected by both sps and or as the intersection area of error type 4 shown in fig 2 d is crucial for a comprehensive evaluation inspired by the concept of multi component synthesis from the kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 which is widely used to assess discharge simulations in hydrological modeling pool et al 2018 a spatial evaluation metric called the precipitation spatial difference index psdi is proposed 3 psdi 1 α 1 2 β 1 2 γ 1 2 where α is the spatial correlation coefficient between the sps and ro on the spatial grid to grid scale β is the spatial variability calculated by σ s μ s σ ro μ ro and γ is the similarity in the spatial patterns of sps and ro which can be expressed as 1 minus jsd the jensen shannon divergence jsd fuglede and topsoe 2004 was used to determine the degree to which a probability distribution differs from a reference probability distribution and can be calculated using eqs 4 and 5 4 kl p q i 1 n p x log p x q x 5 jsd p q 1 2 kl p x p x q x 2 1 2 kl q x p x q x 2 p x and q x are the precipitation probability distributions of the sps and ro in the overlapping region on the same day respectively jsd has been widely used in image similarity and change detection especially for gray scale images such as satellite images bruni and vitulano 2016 yang et al 2014 3 1 4 fractions skill score the fss which was first introduced by roberts and lean 2008 is another indicator that can be used to quantify the spatial agreement between sps and ro fss varies between 0 and 1 with a value closer to 1 indicating higher agreement between the simulated and observed precipitation in this study the fss between the sps and ro was computed using the following equation 6 fss 1 mse ms e ws mse is the mean square error and ms e ws reflects the worst scenarios with no agreement both can be calculated using the following equation 7 mse 1 n h n v i 1 n h j 1 n v o n i j p n i j 2 8 mse ws 1 n h n v i 1 n h j 1 n v o n i j 2 i 1 n h j 1 n v p n i j 2 where n h and n v are the numbers of columns and rows in the calculation area respectively o n i j and p n i j indicate the number of grids in which precipitation occurs inside the n n moving window for ro and sps respectively please refer to roberts and lean 2008 for a detailed description of the fss calculation 3 2 temporal evaluation metrics several conventional evaluation metrics including the correlation coefficient cc relative bias rb root mean square error rmse kge probability of detection pod and false alarm ratio far were used to quantitatively evaluate the performance of five sps in the study area from 2011 to 2015 these metrics were estimated using a time series of daily sps and ro based on grid to grid pairs detailed information on these metrics is provided in table 2 3 3 comprehensive evaluation framework after obtaining the two sets of metrics mentioned above a comprehensive evaluation framework can be constructed using shannon s entropy weighting method chowdhury et al 2021 the framework consists of three layers the highest being the target layer the second being the criteria layers which include the temporal evaluation criteria and spatial evaluation criteria and the last layer consists of ten metrics as described in sections 3 1 and 3 2 fig 3 shows the schematic diagram of the comprehensive evaluation the entropy method automatically assigns weights to different metrics the main advantage of the entropy method is its ability to spontaneously determine the weights of each metric and minimize the bias towards any particular metric the calculation steps are 9 e p m 1 ln n i 1 n k i m ln k i m for m 1 2 m where e p m is the entropy value of each metric and n is the number of sps m represents the number of metrics k i m represents the normalized index for indicator m in sps i the level of diversification and the weights of each metric are obtained by eqs 10 and 11 respectively 10 d d m 1 e p m 11 w m d d m m 1 m d d m where d d m reflects the level of diversification and w m is the normalized weight of the metrics then the final comprehensive evaluation value cei for sps i is computed as 12 cei c 1 m 1 n 1 k i m w m c 2 m 1 n 2 k i m w m where c 1 and c 2 are the criteria weights set as 0 5 in this study n 1 and n 2 are the number of metrics in the corresponding criteria khosravi et al 2016 song et al 2017 here 4 for spatial metrics and 6 for time series metrics respectively 4 results 4 1 conventional metrics analysis figs 4 and 5 depict the results of six time series metrics calculated grid by grid for the five sps as well as the average scores for each basin statistics of six metrics for the eight river basins over eastern china were shown in table a1 for cc first column in fig 4 mswep cmads and itpcas share similarities with average scores exceeding 0 75 in each basin except the southwest basin indicating that they can capture the daily variations of precipitation relatively well chirps and persiann also show comparable results but their performance is inferior to that of the other three rmse and rb second and third columns in fig 4 reflect the total differences of the precipitation in one grid it is obvious that the rmse values for mswep cmads and itpcas are relatively small whereas chirps shows the worst performance particularly over the southeastern region of eastern china in all eight basins cmads underestimated precipitation with larger biases in the north itpcas also has a slight underestimation tendency in the haihe yellow yangtze pearl and southeastern basins while it overestimates precipitation in the songliao huaihe and southwestern basins mswep underestimates precipitation in the southern part of eastern china especially in the southeastern basin 11 7 whereas it overestimates precipitation in the southwestern basin chirps and persiann tended to overestimate precipitation in almost all basins with the largest bias observed in the southwestern basin itpcas cmads and mswep outperformed chirps and persiann in terms of kge first column in fig 5 the spatial distributions of kge for the five sps were almost identical to those of the cc mswep and itpcas demonstrated the best pod performance second column in fig 5 followed by cmads and persiann chirps displays obvious inadequacy in precipitation event detection at the point scale with most average pod scores lower than 0 5 high far values last column of fig 5 are the most common features for all five sps except for cmads the results of this metric are worse for northern basins than those in the southeast overall from the perspective of temporal analysis the latest versions of mswep cmads and itpcas are superior to chirps and persiann table a1 shows that mswep and itcas have the highest cc values that mswep has the highest pod that cmads has the lowest far and rmse and that itpcas has the highest kge and the lowest absolute rb moreover cmads resulted in an apparent underestimation in the study area 4 2 spatial metrics analysis 4 2 1 precipitation occurrence errors in the fms analysis for all five sps error type 1 contributes more than error types 2 and 3 at the seasonal scale especially in the northern and southeastern basins fig 6 error type 3 is another main source of errors with error type 2 occurring infrequently with the exception of chirps and persiann none of the sps were particularly prone to these three types of errors during summer however the opposite occurs in autumn and winter obviously in addition the five sps performed better in southern basins than in northern basins the possible causes behind this were the differences in climate and precipitation types in winter the cold land surface that results from snow and ice cover in the north may interfere with the scatter signal received by pmw radiometers from precipitating clouds cold cirrus clouds that are associated with low brightness temperatures also induce more precipitation estimates when data are collected via the infrared retrieval algorithm gebregiorgis et al 2017 it is worth noting that mswep performed the best in the fms analysis error types 2 3 and 4 are summarized to obtain the spatial distribution of the misdetection ratio frequency of missing detected precipitation graphical examples of missing detected precipitation events and false alerted precipitation events are shown in fig a1 over eastern china fig 7 a e it is obvious that mswep and itpcas exhibit very low values less than 1 throughout the study area followed by cmads with relatively high values in the upper reaches of the yangtze southwest basins whereas persiann and chirps perform poorly particularly in southern china where the terrain is complex and more precipitation occurs correspondingly the false detection ratio frequency of false alerted precipitation fig 7 f j was also calculated based on events where error types 1 3 and 4 occurred chirps and cmads exhibited low false detection ratios of almost less than 15 in the study area mswep has more than 25 false detection ratios over the southwestern regions with high precipitation but comparatively low values in the north due to its small fms values we speculate that the primary cause is events of error type 4 in which sps identify precipitation but the rainy area detected is either not totally matched with the ro or is larger than the ro contrary to mswep false events detected using persiann are mainly concentrated in the northern part of the study area similar to mswep this high false detection ratio in this zone is aggravated by events of error type 4 the false detection ratio is evenly distributed for itpcas which may be due to the systemic error that is caused by adjustment fig 8 illustrates the probability distributions of precipitation intensities and corresponding event areas for misdetection and false detection events it is evident that the probability distributions of missed precipitation intensities for mswep and itpcas are narrow and steep with precipitation intensities ranging from 0 to 5 mm d cmads shows comparable shapes but with larger peak value fig 8 a this means that mswep itpcas and cmads tend to misdetect light precipitation 5 mm day the distributions for chirps and persiann are wide and flat indicating their high uncertainty in estimating precipitation the same situation occurs for the probability distribution of event areas for this type the distribution ranges are very narrow for mswep and itpcas followed by cmads and persiann and the worst is chirps fig 8 c with respect to falsely detected precipitation the intensity distributions are similar to those of misdetected precipitation with a narrower range and zero closed peak values fig 8 b light rain 2 mm d is prone to false alerts by itpcas mswep and cmads the distributions of event areas are totally different with narrow and zero closed peak values for cmads and chirps and the opposite for the other three sps fig 8 d this further confirms the results of the false detection ratio shown in fig 7 f j overall it is concluded that the cmads monitors the spatial occurrence of precipitation events more accurately than the other four products 4 2 2 analysis of sca psdi and fss for all sps there is no significant annual variation in sca the average daily sca scores for the northern basins songliao haihe huaihe and yellow were slightly higher than those of the southern basins yangtze pearl southeast and southwest fig 9 with cmads showing the highest sca score for all basins with mswep and itpcas showing the second and third highest respectively chirps performs better than persiann except in the pearl basin where they have the same score no noticeable monthly fluctuation was observed in the cmads for all basins except those in the southwest fig a2 in all basins except pearl the other four sps displayed slight seasonal variations with higher scores in winter but lower scores in summer persiann exhibits the most notable fluctuations indicating its high uncertainty in monitoring the precipitation covered area on a daily scale psdi can simultaneously measure the spatial similarity of precipitation monitored by sps and ro the optimal value is 1 while the minimum acceptable value is negative infinity the yearly monthly and daily psdi series as well as monthly average psdi series are illustrated in fig 10 and a3 in the yangtze river basin all five products have satisfactory results with cmads performing the best similar to its performance in the sca cmads has the highest value in nearly all basins except for songliao where mswep has a higher value indicating its high capability to reproduce the spatial distribution of the observed precipitation itpcas outperformed mswep in the assessment of spatial distribution however persiann performs worse than chirps with obvious annual changes especially for haihe huaihe pearl and southeast river basins considering the seasonal variation the northern basins songliao haihe huaihe and yellow have high psdi scores in summer and low scores in winter this phenomenon gradually diminishes in the southern basins this may be due to climate differences as summer precipitation in the north is greater than winter precipitation another possible reason is the high uncertainty of satellite precipitation monitoring in capturing winter snowfall petkovic and kummerow 2017 additionally we compared the precipitation amount at locations where sps and ors detected precipitation events it should be noted that compared amount of precipitation is the spatial average interestingly mswep has high kge scores and low rmse values in most northern basins relative to cmads while the absolute rb values for mswep are lower than those for cmads see fig 11 except for chirps all the other products underestimated precipitation to varying degrees with cmads and persiann having the most apparent biases this partially aligns with the findings presented in section 4 1 generally for fss five sps had no significant annual variation cmads exhibited the best performance in all eight basins followed by mswep and itpcas then chirps and persiann the worst fig 12 the results also show significant seasonal variation with low fss values in spring and winter and high values in summer fig a4 the events of error types 1 3 and their spatial range may be the main contributor to the low fss value according to the definition of fss and error types also events of error types 1 3 happen more frequently in spring and winter than in summer and autumn as fig 6 shows so the results of fss can be partly explained by the occurrence of events of these three error types all five sps have worse performance at northern basins compared to southern basins the high fss value of cmads may be explained by the fact that the spatial range of these three error types corresponding to spatial areas affected by misdetection events and false detection events for cmads is relatively low as illustrated in fig 8 c and d 4 3 case study for spatial indicators the spatial distributions of precipitation for the five sps and observations on july 15 2012 a randomly selected rainy day are used as an example to further demonstrate the effectiveness of sca psdi and fss in quantifying the spatial distribution and characteristics of precipitation fig 13 during this period precipitation was primarily distributed over the southern portion of the yangtze river basin the northern part of the pearl river basin the entire southeastern basin and most of the southwestern basin in addition slight rainfall also occurred in the songliao basin the center of heavy rainfall 60 mm day was mainly distributed along an east west band in the southern yangtze river basin fig 13 a cmads and chirps reproduce the spatial coverage of precipitation more accurately with high sca and fss values the remaining three products erroneously alerted slight precipitation in the vicinity of the actual precipitation region showing relatively low sca and fss values cmads and itpcas efficiently captured the locations of heavy precipitation centers along the south of the yangtze river basin with psdi values as high as 0 78 and 0 77 respectively for psdi mswep was inferior to cmads and itpcas but it detected the locations of heavy rain centers better than chirps and persiann persiann did not accurately monitor the locations of heavy rain and had the lowest psdi value overall a similar conclusion can be drawn by intuitive comparison of precipitation images but the use of the three metrics could provide a quantitative evaluation 4 4 comprehensive ranks of sps finally after obtaining the results of the two categories of ten metrics we integrated them into the comprehensive evaluation system described in section 3 3 the resulting ranks are shown in fig 14 generally mswep cmads and itpcas are superior to chirps and persiann mswep performs consistently better in northern basins such as the songliao haihe huaihe and yellow river basins than in southern basins cmads ranks first in southern basins including those of the yangtze pearl and southeast rivers but not in northern basins itpcas is stable and ranks second in most basins chirps and persiann have similar ranks but in general chirps is better for most basins it should be noted that mswep and persiann are global products and are more accessible than cmads and itpcas which are local products covering east asia and china this information may be of interest to data users who want to choose these long term datasets for hydrometeorological studies in eastern china 5 discussion recent developments of remote sensing observation and retrieval merging algorithms have created unprecedented opportunities for the improvement of sps the five sps used here are satellite precipitation that merged and corrected by observations with the long term record user demands for the accuracy of the spatial distribution of sps are also gradually increasing particularly in the aspect of distributed hydrological simulation abrupt drought flood alternations analysis and research into the spatial evolution of drought processes kazemzadeh et al 2022 wang et al 2020 yang et al 2022 yin et al 2021 in this study four spatial error types of precipitation and four spatial evaluation indicators based on a daily scale were introduced into the comprehensive assessment framework of sps when it comes to detecting precipitation events from a spatial perspective events of spatial error types 1 3 are more unacceptable due to the total wrong precipitation detection though error type 4 may also introduce misdetection and false detection over the none overlapping area according to the statistical results of the occurrence of events of the first three error types as shown in fig 6 mswep had the lowest score compared to the other four sps thus misdetection events for mswep were mainly caused by error type 4 error type 3 could also be another trigger albeit with a relatively low percentage further when we explored the spatial distribution range of misdetection and false detection caused by all four error types we found that the spatial range of misdetection events for mswep and itpcas was primarily less than 0 3 106 km3 over eastern china however this value was much larger for cmads and persiann reaching 1 0 106 km3 fig 8 c regarding to spatial range of false detection events as shown in fig 8 d the distribution center for mswep was larger than that for cmads located at around 1 2 106 km3 this implied that once the events of daily spatial precipitation false detection happened for mswep the extent was relatively large in addition fig 7 demonstrated that mswep had a higher false detection ratio than cmads this was in contrast to the findings that mswep had fewer occurrences of error types 1 and 3 that led to false detection displayed in fig 6 we could speculate that the relatively high false detection ratio for mswep in comparison to cmads was due to events of error type 4 which indicated that mswep could reproduce single day precipitation events with reasonably high accuracy but tended to overestimate the spatial coverage the example shown in fig 13 could also support the above inference mswep fig 13 c demonstrated a broader coverage of precipitation compared to the observation fig 13 a with lower sca and fss values than cmads fig 13 d this may cause by the fact that mswep incorporated more satellite reanalysis and radar image which may increase the possibility of identifying the precipitable cloud areas as precipitation events beck et al 2019 petkovic and kummerow 2017 the previous study has also reported the high false alert rate for the last version of mswep ver 2 2 at the yellow river basin of china yang et al 2020 persiann and itpcas had the same false detection problems as mswep but the false detection events for persiann mainly happened in the northern part of the whole study area whereas itpcas happened homogenously so reducing this overestimation of spatial coverage on daily precipitation may be paid more attention by data produces and it has been shown that the accuracy of hydrological simulations driven by blended satellite precipitation can be effectively improved by reducing the false detection rate yin et al 2021 in the case of daily rainfall events detected by both satellite and ground based observations precipitation amount of overlapping area in error type 4 the sps yielded significantly lower precipitation value than the or except for chirps this should also be noticed by data user when they considered using sps in application of flooding modeling kim and lee 2019 the results shown in fig 15 and a5 of the error decomposition which divided the total precipitation error at grid scale into hit bias missed precipitation and false precipitation chen et al 2021 partially corroborated the aforementioned findings fig 15 illustrates the error distribution along with elevation while fig a5 depicts their spatial distribution all five sps exhibit significant false precipitation error with chirps and persiann exhibiting the greatest error up to 200 mm per year this was one source of estimation error one possible explanation is that the amount of precipitation falling on the ground is less than the amount of precipitation in the precipitating clouds due to sub cloud evapotranspiration this effect has the potential to cause significant uncertainty in precipitation retrieval algorithms monsieurs et al 2018 prajapati et al 2022 fig 8 b demonstrates that the erroneously detected precipitation resembles light rain however the spatial distributions of false precipitation amount fig a5 fourth column were not identical to those of the false detection ratio fig 7f j mswep and itpcas had a high false detection ratio and a low false precipitation amount whereas chirps had a low false detection ratio and a high false precipitation amount regarding missed precipitation mswep itpcas and cmads had relatively low values for both missed precipitation amount and miss detection ratio whereas chirps and persiann performed poorly as shown in figs 7 15 and a5 this issue may be attributable to the inability of satellite sensors to detect the warm rain process and convective rainfall typically short duration rainfall events particularly in humid regions el kenawy et al 2019 wang et al 2019 moreover mswep itpcas and cmads incorporated more daily gauged precipitation data whereas chirps and persiann merged monthly and sparsely distributed gauged data as shown in fig 15 and a5 the hit bias of all products besides chirps tends to underestimate precipitation this was consistent with the results shown in fig 11 the identical situation occurred for six etccdi extreme precipitation indices as shown in supplementary table a2 and fig a6 other researchers also discovered a significant overestimation of chirps in eastern china shen et al 2020 mswep and iptcas errors changing along with elevation were relatively flat except for total error and hit bias for persiann and missed and false precipitation for cmads other products exhibited no obvious topographic dependency the current primary approach to sp error analysis is still based on calculating indicators at the point to grid or grid to grid scale and then placing the indicator values in space as a proxy for their spatial performance sun et al 2018 however the precipitation event itself has spatial and temporal properties in terms of the precipitation development process da silva et al 2021 hong et al 2006 li et al 2015 therefore analyzing the error characteristics of sps on a grid scale provides a limited view that is insufficient to reveal the sources of errors in satellite observation of a precipitation process and cannot provide better assistance for error correction and improvement of satellite merging retrieval algorithms with the continuous improvement of ground based precipitation observation networks in developed regions precipitation grid data with high spatial and temporal resolution based on pure ground based observation networks have gradually become available allowing us to analyze sps errors from the perspective of the spatial and temporal distribution of precipitation events some researchers have begun to work on this part of the research li et al 2021b we hope that the spatial analysis method provided in this paper will also inspire and help other researchers furthermore when applying these long time sps to ungauged regions or using them directly data users must analyze and judge what spatial and temporal scales of the data are appropriate for the specific application and the uncertainty analysis of sps in specific applications deserves further discussion 6 conclusions this study aimed to comprehensively evaluate five long term satellite derived precipitation datasets including the most recent mswep version 2 8 from the temporal perspective at the grid scale and spatial perspective of daily precipitation occurrence and distribution in eastern china to achieve this objective four spatial performance evaluation metrics and a comprehensive evaluation system were introduced the major findings of this study are as follows except for chirps all products underestimated precipitation in the southern basins with cmads understanding the most the miss detection ratio is very low for mswep and itpcas throughout the entire study area followed by cmads whereas persiann and chirps likely underestimate precipitation events especially in the complex terrain and rainy areas in the south because satellite sensors cannot capture warm rain and convective rainfall typically short duration events especially in humid regions and also mswep itpcas and cmads integrated more observed information than persiann and chirps chirps and cmads showed low false detection ratios less than 15 over the study area the high false detection ratio of mswep is primarily caused when spatial precipitation coverage detected by mswep is not totally matched with or larger than that observed mswep itpcas and cmads show uncertainties in detecting slight rainfall 2 mm day and are prone to false alerts for this type of precipitation sub cloud evapotranspiration effect has the potential to introduce significant uncertainty into precipitation retrieval algorithms resulting in these false alarms overall cmads monitors the occurrence and spatial distribution of daily precipitation events more accurately three metrics sca psdi and fss provide an effective quantitative evaluation of the spatial distribution characteristics of daily precipitation the results show that cmads has significant advantages in obtaining the spatial distribution of precipitation while mswep performs well in the northern basins none of the products mswep cmads and itpcas rank first in all basins considering the data acquisition and update latency issues for cmads and itpcas the latest version of mswep version 2 8 may be a satisfactory alternative with relatively high accuracy and may therefore be useful to research community involved in water and climate related studies however it should be noted that with the exception of chirps all sps tend to underestimate precipitation amounts for correctly detected spatial precipitation events in light of the growing demand for long term satellite precipitation datasets with reliable spatial accuracy we anticipate that the above findings will offer data providers and end users a better understanding of their inherent uncertainties the metrics associated with the spatial evaluation may be utilized in future studies that require validation of the spatial correctness of the data prior to executing operational works such as forcing land surface models or fully distributed hydrological models and drought assessments the spatial metrics sca psdi and fss presented in this study can also be considered as optimal

7829,study region upper blue nile river basin ethiopia study focus this study aims to determine possible trends in monthly seasonal and annual precipitation and streamflow series the discrete wavelet transform dwt was used to obtain detailed information about the time frequency conditions of six meteorological and five streamflow stations during 1984 2014 the mann kendall test was also applied to the original and the dwt components to determine which periodicities are dominant in reproducing the observed trends the combined dwt and mann kendall test has not been explored in the ubnrb context we used three criteria to determine a suitable wavelet decomposition level and signal extension mode from these criteria the bias ratio between the wavelet approximation series and the original time series was proposed and explored in this study new hydrological insights for the region results show that almost all the precipitation stations experience an insignificant but increasing trend whereas the streamflow stations exhibit an increasing trend at a 5 significance level the combined use of dwt and the mann kendall test show that periodic events up to 4 years are more influential in affecting the observed trends graphical abstract ga1 keywords precipitation streamflow trend analysis wavelet transform mann kendall test data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction examining the nature of trends in hydro meteorological settings is one of the key tasks to managing local and regional water resources better numerous trend studies have been conducted in different regions of the world to study hydrologic regime changes due to climatic and land use variations these studies use certain variables such as precipitation partal and kahya 2006 sang et al 2014 tekleab et al 2013 streamflow douglas et al 2000 ekolu et al 2022 gebremicael et al 2013 tesemma et al 2010 yue et al 2002 zamani et al 2017 and water quality hipel et al 1988 hirsch et al 1982 yu et al 1993 as an indicator of the hydrologic change previous studies used the mann kendall mk trend test to identify possible hydroclimatic variations partal and kahya 2006 applied the mann kendall and sen s t tests on 96 precipitation stations across turkey to determine annual mean and monthly total precipitation trends after identifying the trend they used sen s slope estimator to estimate the linear trend they found that certain stations show significant trends for january february and september precipitations and annual means arrieta castro et al 2020 also applied similar methods to detect existing trends in meta river colombia using seven gauging stations they found that more than 30 of the evaluated datasets show a significant trend similarly ekolu et al 2022 studied the trends and variability in sub saharan africa s hydrological flood and drought characteristics after reconstructing a 65 year long daily streamflow dataset they evaluated how decadal variability influences historical trends their results show significant decadal variations and highlight the importance of considering multiple periods when analyzing recent trends similar trend analyses in the upper blue nile river basin ubnrb region were conducted for different hydro meteorological variables bayissa et al 2015 gebrehiwot et al 2014 mengistu et al 2014 tekleab et al 2013 tesemma et al 2010 using average monthly basin wide rainfall and monthly discharge data tesemma et al 2010 analyzed historical rainfall trends and runoff over ubnrb they also assessed the causes behind the observed trends using rainfall runoff modeling their results show no significant trend in the seasonal and annual basin wide average rainfall however significant trends were observed in discharge during the june september rainy season the cause for the increasing trend in the discharge was associated with erosion of hillside lands that stored some of the water before they became eroded and were transformed into contributing areas of direct runoff tekleab et al 2013 analyzed trends of precipitation temperature and streamflow of ubnrb for monthly seasonal and annual time scales they found that seasonal and mean annual precipitation time series did not show any statistically significant trend however temperature and streamflow datasets show mixed results of increasing and decreasing trends wavelet analysis involves matching a given signal time series to a set of scale and time limited mathematical functions called wavelets the analysis is similar to windowed fourier transforms in decomposing the time series into frequency and time domains however unlike fourier analysis which typically characterizes a given time series using trigonometric functions of infinite extent the wavelet analysis uses finite extent wavelets to decompose and describe high and low frequency components gargour et al 2009 mallat 2009 rioul and vetterli 1991 there are several basic wavelet shapes available to work with these wavelets have typical characteristics of being non zero over limited portions and have zero mean torrence and compo 1998 these basic wavelets also known as mother wavelets can decompose a time series into its lower resolution components by controlling the wavelet s scale and shifting factors foufoula georgiou and kumar 1994 percival and walden 2007 these lower resolution components represent the various periodicities affecting the overall structure of the original time series despite the numerous benefits of using wavelet analysis there are three major limitations shift sensitivity poor directionality and lack of phase information shift sensitivity indicates the introduction of unpredictable changes in transform coefficients due to shifting in time during the transform operation poor directionality arises when the transform coefficients reveal only a few feature orientations in the spatial domain on the other hand lack of phase information refers to the absence of phase information for complex valued signals for a detailed treatment of these limitations and their mitigation measures we refer to fernandes et al 2003 although wavelet analysis is a powerful tool to decompose and reveal hidden features of natural signals such as precipitation and streamflow its application for hydro meteorological studies over the ubnrb is limited only a few pieces of literature exist documenting the successful application of wavelet analysis in the region for example melesse et al 2009 applied the continuous wavelet transform cwt to characterize the ubnrb system they performed the cwt on rainfall and streamflow stations and revealed the existence of inter and intra annual variability of rainfall and streamflow at various scales elsanabary et al 2014 used a wavelet empirical orthogonal function to investigate seasonal rainfall over ethiopia their result shows precipitation in the country s long rainy season june september exhibits inter annual oscillations the oscillations appear to occur at 2 4 and 5 7 year cycles wavelet analysis can be successfully combined with trend analysis to reveal dominant time scales contributing to the overall trends of time series nalley et al 2012 partal 2010 partal and küçük 2006 partal and küçük 2006 demonstrated the use of discrete wavelet transform dwt and mann kendall test to determine trends in annual total precipitation over turkey they found that some periodic events affect the trend of precipitation series for example the 16 year periodic events were identified as the effective component responsible for producing the trend observed in the baikesir station nalley et al 2012 also used dwt to analyze trends in streamflow and precipitation in canada after decomposition of monthly seasonal and annual precipitation and streamflow datasets they applied the suitable version of the mann kendall test to identify the periodicities affecting the trends their results show that intra and inter annual events of up to 4 years are more influential in the observed trends so far no wavelet transform based trend analysis of streamflow and precipitation has been conducted in ubnrb therefore in this study we aim to apply dwt along with the mann kendall trend test to identify dominant time scales contributing to the trends in the original precipitation and streamflow measurements furthermore we proposed and explored a new criterion to determine the best wavelet type time series decomposition level and signal extension mode for a better dwt application the criterion is the bias ratio between the approximation component and the original time series the significance of this study lies in its application of the mann kendall test to assess trends in hidden components of the observed time series usual trend analysis studies use raw observations to identify trends however in this study we used the dwt technique to decompose the raw time series and applied the mann kendall test on the raw and decomposed time series to identify trends the application reveals the influence of various time scales on the trends of original observations 2 the study area and data the blue nile river locally known as abbay originates from lake tana area 3060 km2 ethiopia it traverses through deep gorges and lowlands to join the white nile near khartoum sudan the upper blue nile river basin ubnrb is the upper portion of the blue nile river basin whose outlet is located at the border between ethiopia and sudan the ubnrb contributes about 60 of the nile river s annual flow conway 2005 the basin covers a catchment area of 176 000 km2 conway 2000 and is characterized by diverse climate and topography the basin receives its highest precipitation during the june september rainy season a short rainy season from march to may also provides significant precipitation to the basin for the rest of the months the basin remains dry we obtained monthly precipitation records for six meteorological stations from the national meteorological agency nma of ethiopia monthly streamflow data for five stations were also collected from the ethiopian ministry of water and irrigation and various literature the location of these stations is shown in fig 1 the temporal extent of both datasets spans 31 years 1984 2014 we conducted a thorough quality check on the datasets including assessing missing data detecting outliers and conforming homogeneity to detect outliers we compared the observations of a given month with the observations of other years within the same month to check the consistency and homogeneity of each station we used the double mass curve technique searcy et al 1960 for precipitation stations for example we plotted the cumulative precipitation of each station against the mean of the cumulative precipitation of nearby stations the plot should be a straight line so long as the data are proportional the line s slope represents the proportionality constant between individual stations and the groups of nearby stations a break in the slope of the plot indicates a change in the precipitation regime a similar procedure was applied to the streamflow stations as well the double mass curves produced for the debre markos precipitation station and gilgel abay streamflow stations are given in fig 2 the curves demonstrate the consistency of the precipitation and streamflow records both curves show a consistent record of precipitation and streamflow data at the two stations and a break in slope was not observed throughout the record length similar results were obtained for other precipitation and streamflow stations as well based on the quality checking procedures we found out that the common period of analysis for the precipitation and streamflow stations was 1984 2014 consequently the analysis period was fixed between the years 1984 and 2014 after the quality checks monthly datasets were aggregated to generate seasonal and annual time series for precipitation and streamflow we used the monthly datasets to investigate short term fluctuations such as intra and inter annual variations the seasonal datasets were used to examine changes due to seasonal cycles the annual time series was used to analyze long term fluctuations such as multi year decadal and multi decadal events 3 theoretical background 3 1 wavelet analysis the general wavelet analysis procedure in time series involves the following main tasks a suitable wavelet of a particular scale is chosen first the time series is then convolved with the wavelet the convolution is done by sliding the wavelet across the entire time series at each time step a multiplication of the wavelet and the time series is performed and corresponding wavelet coefficients are generated the coefficients measure the level of correlation between the wavelet and the time series the wavelet scale is increased and the process is repeated in the end sets of wavelet coefficients at different scales are obtained the lower and higher scales represent the compressed and stretched versions of the mother wavelet respectively drago and boxall 2002 nalley et al 2012 wavelet coefficients associated with lower scales identify the signal s high frequency or rapidly changing components on the other hand higher scales identify the low frequency or slowly changing elements the main advantage of using wavelet transforms in hydro meteorological time series is its robustness it does not include any assumption of statistical distributions and parametric testing protocols kisi and cimen 2011 furthermore wavelet transform can extract local spectra and temporal information simultaneously there are also a wide variety of mother wavelets tailored to the needs of different time series characteristics there are two types of wavelet transform continuous wavelet transform cwt and discrete wavelet transform dwt the main difference between these two types is the cwt uses every possible wavelet over a range of scales and locations i e the translation and scale parameters of the wavelets vary continuously in contrast the dwt uses a finite set of discretely sampled wavelets the most common and practical form of dwt is the one that employs scales and locations arranged in dyadic arrangement i e powers of two mallat 1989 the dwt is easier to use compared to the cwt the following are the main advantages of dwt over cwt the cwt is a highly redundant transform while the dwt provides a sparse representation of time series as a result the computational resources required to compute the cwt and store the coefficients are much larger than the dwt the dwt provides a perfect reconstruction of the time series upon inversion in other words the dwt coefficients can be used to synthesize an exact reproduction of the original time series within numerical precision the same reconstruction can be done using the cwt but it is often the case that the reconstruction is not perfect reconstructing a signal from the cwt coefficients is a much less stable numerical operation based on the advantages mentioned above we chose to apply dwt to decompose the precipitation and streamflow datasets into their temporal components 3 1 1 discrete wavelet transform dwt using scales and positions in powers of two also known as dyadic arrangement yields a much more efficient and accurate analysis than using arbitrary scales as in the case of cwt mallat 1989 the discrete form of a wavelet function can be given as 1 ψ m n t τ s s 0 m 2 ψ t n τ 0 s 0 m s 0 m where m and n are integers used to control wavelet dilation scale and translation time s 0 is fixed dilation step greater than one and τ 0 is the location parameter and must be greater than zero the most common and simplest choice of s 0 and τ 0 is two and one time steps respectively for a discrete time series x i the dwt is then given by convolving the time series x i with scaled and translated versions of the wavelet function of eq 1 as 2 w m n 2 m 2 i 0 n 1 x i ψ 2 m i n where w m n is wavelet coefficient for the discrete wavelet of scale s 2 m and location τ 2 m n the characteristics of the original time series in frequency s 0 and time τ 0 at the same time are reflected by w m n when the frequency resolution of the dilated and translated wavelet is low but the time resolution is high s 0 becomes small in the case of high frequency and low time resolution s 0 becomes large kisi and cimen 2011 dwt applies two sets of functions named high pass and low pass filters the original time series passes through these filters at different scales and its high and low frequency components are identified the high frequency components known as periodic components or details comprise the rapidly changing events of the time series in contrast the low frequency components known as approximations represent slowly changing events such as time series trends kisi and cimen 2011 3 2 trend analysis trend analysis is done to extract an underlying pattern of behavior in time series for time series having a normal distribution their trend can be assumed linear and a simple linear regression can be performed to estimate the trend however for those time series that comes from a different distribution or possess a trend of other shapes than linear other methods parametric or non parametric are required to reveal the trend in this respect the mann kendall trend test is a widely used non parametric test for identifying monotonic trends in time series data kendall 1957 mann 1945 the mk test is a modified version of the kendall rank correlation coefficient used to measure the ordinal association between two measured quantities kendall 1938 mk test is sensitive to the dependence of sample data and the test results may be biased due to these dependencies ehsanzadeh et al 2011 the dependence typical to hydro meteorological time series could be in the form of serial correlation or seasonal relationships hirsch et al 1982 hirsch and slack 1984 for example a time series containing a positive serial correlation has a reduced number of independent samples this reduced sample in turn increases the variance of the mk statistic and enhances the possibility of rejecting the null hypothesis of no trend the opposite is true for negative serial correlation ehsanzadeh et al 2011 various modifications of mk tests are proposed to account for autocorrelation and seasonality factors hamed and ramachandra rao 1998 hirsch and slack 1984 yue et al 2002 in the following sub sections we reviewed the original mk test the mk test modified by hamed and ramachandra rao 1998 which accounts for serial correlation only and the mk test modified by hirsch and slack 1984 which accounts for both autocorrelation and seasonality 3 2 1 original mann kendall test the original mk test commonly known as kendall s τ statistic has been widely used in hydro meteorological settings due to its non parametric nature and its resistance to the influence of extreme values the null hypothesis h 0 of the test assumes the deseasonalized time series x 1 x 2 x n represent a sample of n independent and identically distributed random variables the alternative hypothesis h 1 of a two sided test is that the distribution of x i and x j is not identical for all i j n with i j the test statistic s is computed as 3 s i 1 n 1 j k 1 n sgn x j x i 4 sgn x j x i 1 if x j x i 0 0 if x j x i 0 1 if x j x i 0 for independently and identically distributed data with zero mean the variance of s can be calculated as var s n n 1 2 n 5 t t t 1 2 t 5 18 where t is the extent of any given tie and t denotes the summation over all ties then the mk test statistic z for all cases where n is larger than ten is given by douglas et al 2000 5 z s 1 var s if s 0 0 if s 0 s 1 var s if s 0 the significance of the trend in the time series is assessed by comparing the z value given in eq 5 with the standard normal variate the pre specified level of statistical significance in a two sided test the null hypothesis should be accepted for a given level of significance α if z z α 2 an increasing trend is represented by a positive value of z while a negative value of z indicates a decreasing trend 3 2 2 modified mann kendall test for autocorrelated data a modified version of the mk test was proposed by hamed and ramachandra rao 1998 to account for serial correlation in time series the modification is performed by applying a correction on the variance s of the original mk test as follows 6 v s var s n n s n n 1 2 n 5 18 n n s where n n s represents a correction due to the autocorrelation in the data and it is estimated as 7 n n s 1 2 n n 1 n 2 i 1 n 1 n i n i 1 n i 2 ρ s i where n is the actual number of observations and ρ s i is the autocorrelation function of the ranks of the observations 3 2 3 modified mann kendall test for autocorrelated and seasonally dependent data hirsch and slack 1984 proposed a multivariate modification of the original mk test to account for seasonality let the matrix 8 x x 11 x 12 x 1 p x 21 x 22 x 2 p x n 1 x n 2 x np represent a sequence of observations taken over p seasons for n years in this case the null hypothesis assumes the n observations for each p season are randomly ordered on the other hand the alternative hypothesis assumes a monotonic trend in one or more seasons the matrix of ranks corresponding to the observations in x can be given as 9 r r 11 r 12 r 1 p r 21 r 22 r 2 p r n 1 r n 2 r np since the values within each season are ranked among themselves the mk test statistic for each season becomes 10 s g i j sgn x jg x ig g 1 2 p then the seasonal kendall test statistic is given by 11 s g 1 p s g which is asymptotically normal with a mean of 0 and variance 12 var s g σ g 2 g h g h σ gh where σ g 2 var s g and σ gh cov s g s h 4 methodology we followed the steps described in this section to reveal the trend structure and contributing periodicities in the precipitation and streamflow measurements of ubnrb fig 3 shows the workflow of the current study 4 1 autocorrelation analysis autocorrelation also known as serial correlation reveals information about the degree of relationship correlation of a time series between two successive time intervals it shows how subsequent lagged time series versions relate to the original measurement with this analysis it is possible to assess the variability in the dataset and find repeating periodic patterns if any autocorrelation values range from with negative values indicating negative autocorrelation i e lagged values increase as the original time series decrease or vice versa similarly positive autocorrelation values indicate a positive correlation where the lagged and the original time series move in tandem i e increase or decrease significant autocorrelation in a time series can affect the variance component during mk trend tests ehsanzadeh et al 2011 besides autocorrelation and seasonality are common in hydro meteorological observations such as precipitation and streamflow we performed an autocorrelation analysis to characterize the correlation structure and seasonality in the datasets the analysis provides correlation values at each lag and we can also examine seasonal dependencies if any from autocorrelation plots of several lags a significant first lag lag 1 correlation coefficient indicates the presence of autocorrelation in the dataset the presence of a repeating pattern in significant autocorrelation coefficients over certain lags suggests the presence of seasonality in the dataset 4 2 time series decomposition via the dwt performing a dwt generally involves 1 identification of the mother wavelet to use for the decomposition 2 deciding the level of decomposition and 3 determining the signal extension mode in this section we provide a brief explanation of these dwt procedures for this study we used the pywavelets python library lee et al 2019 to conduct the dwt analysis for the precipitation and streamflow datasets pywavelets is a python package implementing discrete and continuous wavelet transforms lee et al 2019 the package includes various predefined wavelets and can specify custom wavelet filter banks the pywavelets features are similar to matlab s wavelet toolbox it also allows n dimensional n 3 transform and supports for both real and complex valued data in either single or double precision further information can be found in lee et al 2019 identification of the mother wavelet is the first step to conducting a dwt since wavelet transforms have several wavelet families to choose from it is necessary to identify the one that best fits the features we are looking for in the signal time series the pywavelets library has fourteen mother wavelets including haar daubechies db and symlets sym among others lee et al 2019 each wavelet family is different in shape compactness and smoothness enabling them to be useful in different situations in this study we used the daubechies db wavelets because they have non zero basis functions over a limited interval and full scaling and translational orthonormality properties which are effective for feature localization shoaib et al 2014 in addition numerous hydro meteorological wavelet based studies successfully employed the daubechies wavelets in their analysis chen et al 2016 nalley et al 2012 partal 2010 wright et al 2017 the daubechies wavelet family daubechies 1990 has several sub categories depending on the number of wavelet coefficients vanishing moments in the pywavelets implementation the daubechies wavelet family has 38 sub categories from order one db1 to 38 db38 the sub categories differ by the number of vanishing moments and the level of decomposition they can accommodate the order numbers in the wavelet sub categories indicate the number of vanishing moments for example db5 has five vanishing moments and db7 has seven vanishing moments and so on the number of vanishing moments determines the approximation order and smoothness of the wavelet for example a db5 wavelet has five vanishing moments and can approximate polynomials of degree four as the number of vanishing moments increase the polynomial degree of the wavelet also increases larger vanishing moments make the corresponding wavelets smoother generally daubechies wavelets of order five or more are considered smooth in hydro meteorological time series smoother wavelets are preferred the preference is because the trends in these datasets are supposed to be gradual and represent slowly changing processes nalley et al 2012 in addition several wavelet based trend studies successfully used smooth daubechies wavelets in this study we first tested smooth daubechies wavelets db5 db9 and applied the suitable one for each dataset i e monthly seasonal and annual precipitation and streamflow measurements since we are analyzing 31 years of data having 372 data points the maximum daubechies wavelet order we can perform is up to the next dyadic arrangement to 372 which is 512 29 hence the maximum db order is 9 once the suitable mother wavelet is chosen the next task is to determine the maximum level of decomposition the maximum level depends on the length of the input time series and the wavelet type at each subsequent dwt decomposition the number of samples in the time series is reduced by half due to this down sampling at some stage in the process the number of samples required for the next level decomposition becomes smaller than the sample size filter length required by the wavelet this level is known as the maximum decomposition level one of the various signal extension modes must compensate the sample deficit for continuing the decomposition beyond this level however too much use of signal extension introduces uncertainties known as the border or edge effect su et al 2011 the maximum decomposition level is given by log 2 n k 1 where n is the number of data points in the time series and k is the filter length of the wavelet used the filter length is twice the vanishing moment of the given wavelet for example for our monthly data series of 31 years we have 372 data points and if a db5 wavelet number of vanishing moments 5 is used the maximum decomposition level will be 5 similarly if db9 were used the maximum decomposition level would be 4 in this study we tested both level 4 and level 5 dwt decomposition for each time series another essential aspect of dwt is to determine the signal extension mode a signal extension is needed to continue the convolution process when the signal length is smaller than the wavelet filter length su et al 2011 in this case a border extension mode is used to extend the signal on both ends and provide options for dealing with the problem of border distortion in the signal the most commonly used signal extension modes in the hydro meteorological settings are zero padding periodic padding and symmetric padding the zero padding method applies zero samples at both ends of the signal whereas periodic padding employs periodic replication of the original signal at both ends symmetric padding on the other hand involves symmetric boundary value replication this study tested these modes for each time series and smooth wavelet the choice of the specific wavelet type decomposition level and signal extension mode for each time series are made using three criteria the first one the mean relative error mre was proposed for use in wavelet based trend analysis by de artigas et al 2006 and was computed using the following equation 13 mre 1 n j 1 n a j x j x j where x j is original time series n is the number of data points in the original series and a j is dwt approximation value of x j the second criterion relative error er was proposed by nalley et al 2012 and involved computation of relative error based on mann kendall z values obtained from dwt approximation components the equation used to compute er is given as 14 er z a z o z o where z a is mann kendal z value of the approximation obtained from the maximum decomposition level z o is mann kendal z value of the original time series the third criterion is proposed in this study and is based on bias ratio br the computation of the br was done using the following equation 15 br a j x j where x j represents the mean value of the original time series while a j represents the mean value of the dwt approximation value of the original time series the br is simple to compute and does not include any assumption of statistical distributions and parametric testing nor is it dependent on spatial differences it is derived purely from the data at hand therefore it can be applied anywhere in other studies 4 3 applying the mk trend tests once suitable wavelet type decomposition level and signal extension mode are determined the time series decomposition is performed for each dataset i e monthly seasonal and annual precipitation and streamflow this procedure obtained detail and approximation components for the prospective analysis since the mk trend analysis results on the detailed components can be better interpreted with their respective approximation added partal 2010 partal and küçük 2006 the mk trend test was applied to the original detail approximation as well as combinations of details and approximation components of each dataset we applied the original mk test if there was no significant lag 1 autocorrelation and seasonality for the original detail approximation and combined datasets mk test by hamed and ramachandra rao 1998 was applied for those time series with significant lag 1 autocorrelation without seasonality factor for the remaining datasets with strong seasonality irrespective of significant lag 1 autocorrelation we used the mk test by hirsch and slack 1984 both modified mk tests can be applied to auto correlated time series however the test by hirsch and slack 1984 is not as powerful when there is long term persistence or when there are less than five years worth of monthly data hirsch and slack 1984 the hamed and ramachandra rao 1998 modification is proposed to address these shortcomings it is preferred because autocorrelations may still exist past the first lag therefore in our study we chose the powerful modified mk test by hamed and ramachandra rao 1998 for stations with significant autocorrelation but without seasonal dependence 4 4 determination of dominant trend component the final procedure in this study was to examine which periodic component or detail with approximation added of the dwt decomposition contributes more to the trends observed if any in the original time series to determine the dominant contributor we used two strategies the first one is comparing the closeness of mk z values between the periodic component details with approximation added and the original series and the second one is to compute the bias ratio eq 15 and choose the periodic component with optimal bias ratio value it s important to note that bias ratio values close to unity one indicate better performance 4 5 open source software our research heavily relies on open source software the programming language of choice is python 3 8 0 the main library used for the dwt analysis is pywavelets lee et al 2019 the libraries we use for pre and post processing our data and for data management in general are numpy harris et al 2020 pandas mckinney 2010 statsmodels seabold and perktold 2010 and matplotlib hunter 2007 5 results and discussions 5 1 preliminary data analysis results of the autocorrelation analysis on the original streamflow and precipitation time series datasets are discussed in this section fig 4 and fig 5 show autocorrelation plots of monthly precipitation and streamflow for each station in the study area respectively autocorrelation plots for the seasonal and annual time series are given in the supplement on the plots the autocorrelation values are represented by the points on the vertical lines for various lags the shaded regions represent the confidence intervals the autocorrelation values inside these intervals are not considered statistically significant at a 5 significance level the significance level we used for all of our autocorrelation analyses as it s obvious from the plots all the streamflow and precipitation stations exhibit significant lag 1 autocorrelation values on a monthly scale furthermore the autocorrelations become pronounced every 12th lag indicating a strong annual cycle in both measurements table 1 shows the numerical values of the autocorrelations for all streamflow and precipitation stations in the table statistically significant autocorrelations are marked by an asterisk whereas strong seasonality is indicated by the upper case letter s inside a square bracket s for the seasonal time series all lag 1 autocorrelations are not statistically significant however significant autocorrelation values are observed at every 4th lag indicating strong annual seasonality in these datasets see fig s1 fig s2 in the supplement and table 1 most streamflow and precipitation stations didn t show significant autocorrelation and seasonality for the annual time series only one precipitation station gondar acf 0 66 and one streamflow station megech acf 0 93 show significant autocorrelations at 5 significance level see fig s3 fig s4 in the supplement and table 1 all the streamflow and precipitation stations didn t show significant seasonality on the annual scale significant lag 1 autocorrelation and seasonal dependencies determine the mk test s choice for the subsequent analysis as a result we adopted the mk trend test by hirsch and slack 1984 for all monthly and seasonal streamflow and precipitation datasets due to the presence of seasonality irrespective of significant lag 1 autocorrelations on the other hand we applied the original mk test for the annual datasets as the datasets are not affected by autocorrelations and seasonality the exceptions being the gondar precipitation station and megech streamflow station we used the mk test by hamed and ramachandra rao 1998 for these two stations the selection of suitable wavelet type decomposition level and signal extension mode for each time series monthly seasonal and annual was conducted using the three criteria discussed in section 3 3 2 we tested the five smooth wavelets db5 db9 for the monthly datasets with decomposition levels of four and five and all three signal extension modes similarly we tested level three and four decompositions for seasonal and annual datasets with all the five wavelet types db5 db9 and signal extension modes each of the three criteria yielded slightly different results for example for the assossa precipitation station mre yielded a db7 wavelet level 4 decomposition and zero padding for the dwt analysis for the monthly precipitation time series this result is slightly different compared to er db9 level 4 zero padding and br db8 level 4 symmetric padding to determine which criterion provides the best wavelet type decomposition level and signal extension mode we plotted and compared the linear fit of the original series with the resulting dwt approximations for each criterion then we selected the criterion that provides a linear fit of the approximation close to the original one an example plot for the monthly precipitation stations is shown in fig 6 although all the three criteria provided comparable results a close examination reveals that the br criterion proposed in this study provides the closest linear fit of the dwt approximation to the original series for most stations therefore we used the br criterion to determine the best wavelet decomposition level and signal extension mode for each monthly seasonal and annual precipitation and streamflow dataset table 2 shows the best wavelet signal extension and decomposition level for each station using the br criterion based on the br criterion we used level four decomposition for monthly time series of precipitation and streamflow the wavelet type and border extensions may vary from one station to another similarly for seasonal data we found that level three decomposition provides the smallest error the wavelet type and border extensions may vary from one station to another for the annual series level three decompositions yielded the smallest error therefore we used level three dwt for the annual time series the wavelet type and border extensions may vary from station to station after decomposing the time series with the suitable wavelet type the resulting wavelet coefficients can be used to reconstruct the original time series fig 7 shows an example plot of the original and reconstructed time series at different decomposition levels the plots show that reconstruction from level one decomposition yields a perfect match with the original series the reconstruction skill diminishes as the level of decomposition increases the reason could be artificial values at both ends of the time series due to the signal extension mode 5 2 monthly data analysis 5 2 1 monthly precipitation an example plot of the dwt decomposition of monthly precipitation for the debre markos station is shown in fig 8 similar decomposition was done for the remaining precipitation stations the result was obtained after applying dwt using a db7 wavelet with four decomposition levels and periodic padding the first panel shows the original time series plot for the entire study period 1984 2014 each detail component represents the 2 month periodicity d1 4 month periodicity d2 8 month periodicity d3 and 16 month periodicity d4 the a4 represents the approximation component at the fourth level of decomposition the details represent the rapidly changing component of the original time series whereas the approximation represents the slowly changing component results of mk application on the original detail approximation and combinations details and approximation components for the monthly precipitation and streamflow datasets are given in table 3 since all the monthly data exhibit strong seasonality and significant lag 1autocorrelation the results of table 3 are obtained from the mk test by hirsch and slack 1984 all precipitation stations show an increasing trend for the original time series only the bahir dar station exhibits a significant trend at a 5 significance level z 2 29 a similar statistically insignificant increasing trend for a basin wide study over the ubnrb is also reported in mekonnen et al 2018 they found that eleven stations out of fifteen didn t show a significant trend on a monthly scale on the other hand the detail components d1 d4 show a mix of positive and negative trends except for the d2 component of bahir dar station none of the mk z values of the details is statistically significant however the approximation component of all the precipitation stations experiences significant mk z values except for the jimma station which has a significant and decreasing trend all the approximation component trends are significant and positive after adding the approximation a4 to each detail most trend values for the combination details approximation become statistically significant this improvement is due to the relatively high mk z values of the a4 additionally the trend magnitude of the combination gets enhanced compared to the individual detail components this fact shows that most of the trend is contained in the approximation component although the original precipitation series didn t show significant trends in almost all stations the mk test application on the decomposed series may reveal some significant trends this situation shows the contribution of lower resolution periodicities to the overall trend observed in the original series to examine which details with approximation added contribute more to the trends observed in the original series we used the two measures described in section 3 3 4 the dominant periodic components represented by values typed in boldface in table 3 vary from station to station this change may be due to differences in their location generally the d3 component with a4 added is more influential indicating that the 8 month periodicity is the main driver behind the observed trends in the original series 5 2 2 monthly streamflow fig 9 shows an example plot of the dwt decomposition of monthly streamflow for bn at kessie station a similar decomposition was done for the remaining streamflow stations the result was obtained after applying dwt using a db9 wavelet with four decomposition levels and symmetric padding the corresponding mk test results using hirsch and slack 1984 are shown in table 4 all the streamflow stations for the original series show a significant increasing trend mekonnen et al 2018 also reported that statistically significant increasing trends were observed throughout the ubnrb similar to the precipitation stations positive and negative mk z values were obtained from the detail components d1 d4 although all of the original series are significant none of the details are statistically significant except for the bn at bahir dar station z 1 05 all approximation components show an increasing and statistically significant trend the magnitudes of the trends in the approximations are also relatively larger than the original series we can observe the effect of these approximations in changing the trend structure when they are added to each detail component except for all the detail components of bn at bahir dar and d2 and d4 components of gilgel abay station all the detail components become statistically significant after the addition of the approximation except for the bn at bahir dar station the approximation addition also preserved the trend direction observed in the original series this trend improvement clearly shows the important role the approximation components play in containing the trends of the original series the dominant periodic components shown in boldface in table 3 vary from station to station this variation may be due to differences in their location and the catchment area they represent generally the d3 and d4 components with a4 added are more influential indicating that the events that occurred in 8 month and 16 month periodicities are the main drivers behind the observed trends in the original series 5 3 seasonal data analysis 5 3 1 seasonal precipitation mk trend test results for the seasonal precipitation and streamflow series are given in table 4 the original series follows a similar trend pattern as the monthly precipitation only the bahir dar station shows a significant trend a similar absence of a significant trend in seasonal precipitation over the ubnrb is also reported in mekonnen et al 2018 and tesemma et al 2010 the details d1 d3 experience a mix of positive and negative trend values all of the details exhibit statistically insignificant mk z values each detail component represents the 6 month periodicity d1 12 month periodicity d2 and 24 month periodicity d3 except for assossa and debre markos stations the remaining stations show significant mk z values for the approximation a3 component after adding the a3 to each detail component all exhibit a positive trend as the original series therefore the a3 component still plays a crucial role in explaining the observed trends in each precipitation station for the assossa and debre markos stations the most dominant periodicities contributing to the observed trends are the 6 month d1 and 24 month d3 respectively gondar jimma and mota seasonal precipitation trends appear to be equally influenced by the 6 and 12 month periodicities for these three stations the annual cycle plays an important role in modulating the trends 5 3 2 seasonal streamflow for the original seasonal streamflow three bn at el diem bn at kessie and megech of the five stations experience significant trend values tesemma et al 2010 also reported similar trend behavior for bn at el diem and bn at kessie stations however their finding of a significant trend for the bn at bahir dar station didn t agree with ours the reason could be the use of a different temporal extent they used data from 1964 to 2003 for their analysis none of the details show significant mk z values after adding a3 to each detail most of the mk z values become statistically significant for the bn at bahir dar and gilgel abay stations the most influential periodicity in contributing to the observed trends appear to be the 24 month events for the bn at el diem and bn at kessie the annual cycle plays a vital role in producing the observed trend 5 4 annual data analysis 5 4 1 annual precipitation table 5 shows the results of the mk test on original and dwt decompositions for annual precipitation and streamflow time series the bahir dar and mota stations show a significant increasing trend for the original time series the remaining precipitation stations exhibit an increasing but statistically insignificant trend gebremicael et al 2013 also reported the absence of a significant trend for the gondar bahir dar and debre markos stations during their study period 1970 2005 however their finding of a significantly decreasing trend for the assossa station didn t agree with our analysis the reason for this discrepancy could be using a different analysis period similar to the monthly and seasonal precipitations the detail components show a mix of positive and negative mk z values but they are still insignificant however adding the approximation a3 improved their magnitude and most stations experienced significant trends afterward on the annual scale it is difficult to get a uniform periodicity affecting the observed trends in all the stations the 2 and 8 year events appear to influence the trend elsanabary et al 2014 also reported a similar result ethiopia s rainfall exhibits inter annual oscillations in 2 4 and 5 7 year cycles these cycles may be associated with the cycles of el niño southern oscillation enso which has a period of 3 04 4 60 year the enso is known to modify the annual cycles and significantly affect the total ethiopian monsoon rainfall variability segele et al 2009 5 4 2 annual streamflow annual streamflow of the original series for three stations bn at el diem bn at kessie and megech show statistically significant trends the remaining two stations bn at bahir dar and gilgel abay exhibit non significant trends from which the bn at bahir dar station shows a decreasing trend mekonnen et al 2018 and gebremicael et al 2013 also reported a similar statistically significant trend for the bn at el diem station similarly tesemma et al 2010 also reported a significant increasing trend for bn at bahir dar and bn at kessie stations most streamflow stations show an increasing trend although many precipitation stations over ubnrb didn t this inconsistency could be associated with modification of catchment responses due to land use land cover changes over the basin gebremicael et al 2013 tesemma et al 2010 these changes could result in enhanced surface runoff and increased measurements at the catchment outlets except for the gilgel abay station z 2 21 all the detailed components experience insignificant mk z values after adding the a3 component to each of these details however most stations show statistically significant trends similar to the annual precipitation condition it s difficult to observe a unifying periodicity influencing the observed trends however the gilgel abay and bn at bahir dar stations appear to be influenced by 2 and 8 year periodic events respectively 6 conclusion this study conducted wavelet decomposition and mann kendall trend analysis for ubnrb streamflow and precipitation measurements best wavelet types level of decomposition and signal extension modes were identified using a bias ratio criterion proposed in this study along with mean relative error and mk z values based relative errors the bias ratio criterion performed better as it provided most stations closest linear fit of the dwt approximation to the original series after performing the dwt autocorrelation analysis was conducted on each original and decomposed series to determine a suitable mann kendall version to account for autocorrelation and seasonality in the time series results show insignificant positive trends dominate the original monthly seasonal and annual precipitation series most stations exhibit significantly increasing trends for the streamflow series original monthly seasonal and annual measurements the details in both streamflow and precipitation series experience a mix of positive and negative trends but almost all are statistically insignificant however most approximation components experienced significant trends and indicated their essential role in carrying the trends observed in the original measurements dominant time scales affecting the observed trends for the monthly precipitation were the 8 month events whereas for the monthly streamflow the 8 to 16 month events were influential on the seasonal scale the annual cycles 12 months played a significant role in the observed trends in most precipitation and streamflow measurements on the annual scale however obtaining a unifying periodicity affecting the trends across all the stations was difficult in general it can be concluded that for the precipitation and streamflow observations over the ubnrb the trends are influenced by fluctuations of up to 4 years finally the results obtained in this study can serve as a benchmark for further studies related to wavelet applications in hydro meteorological time series in ubnrb furthermore the information regarding the crucial periodicities affecting precipitation and streamflow trends over ubnrb can be used as inputs to various modeling and water management activities it is important to note that this study is limited by the lack of dense precipitation and streamflow station information primarily we could not get quality data for the basin s mid and southwest portions therefore we recommend additional investigations with better stations to capture the complete picture of the trends over ubnrb funding this work was supported by the national science fund for

7829,study region upper blue nile river basin ethiopia study focus this study aims to determine possible trends in monthly seasonal and annual precipitation and streamflow series the discrete wavelet transform dwt was used to obtain detailed information about the time frequency conditions of six meteorological and five streamflow stations during 1984 2014 the mann kendall test was also applied to the original and the dwt components to determine which periodicities are dominant in reproducing the observed trends the combined dwt and mann kendall test has not been explored in the ubnrb context we used three criteria to determine a suitable wavelet decomposition level and signal extension mode from these criteria the bias ratio between the wavelet approximation series and the original time series was proposed and explored in this study new hydrological insights for the region results show that almost all the precipitation stations experience an insignificant but increasing trend whereas the streamflow stations exhibit an increasing trend at a 5 significance level the combined use of dwt and the mann kendall test show that periodic events up to 4 years are more influential in affecting the observed trends graphical abstract ga1 keywords precipitation streamflow trend analysis wavelet transform mann kendall test data availability the authors do not have permission to share

conducted in different regions of the world to study hydrologic regime changes due to climatic and land use variations these studies use certain variables such as precipitation partal and kahya 2006 sang et al 2014 tekleab et al 2013 streamflow douglas et al 2000 ekolu et al 2022 gebremicael et al 2013 tesemma et al 2010 yue et al 2002 zamani et al 2017 and water quality hipel et al 1988 hirsch et al 1982 yu et al 1993 as an indicator of the hydrologic change previous studies used the mann kendall mk trend test to identify possible hydroclimatic variations partal and kahya 2006 applied the mann kendall and sen s t tests on 96 precipitation stations across turkey to determine annual mean and monthly total precipitation trends after identifying the trend they used sen s slope estimator to estimate the linear trend they found that certain stations show significant trends for january february and september precipitations and annual means arrieta castro et al 2020 also applied similar methods to detect existing trends in meta river colombia using seven gauging stations they found that more than 30 of the evaluated datasets show a significant trend similarly ekolu et al 2022 studied the trends and variability in sub saharan africa s hydrological flood and drought characteristics after reconstructing a 65 year long daily streamflow dataset they evaluated how decadal variability influences historical trends their results show significant decadal variations and highlight the importance of considering multiple periods when analyzing recent trends similar trend analyses in the upper blue nile river basin ubnrb region were conducted for different hydro meteorological variables bayissa et al 2015 gebrehiwot et al 2014 mengistu et al 2014 tekleab et al 2013 tesemma et al 2010 using average monthly basin wide rainfall and monthly discharge data tesemma et al 2010 analyzed historical rainfall trends and runoff over ubnrb they also assessed the causes behind the observed trends using rainfall runoff modeling their results show no significant trend in the seasonal and annual basin wide average rainfall however significant trends were observed in discharge during the june september rainy season the cause for the increasing trend in the discharge was associated with erosion of hillside lands that stored some of the water before they became eroded and were transformed into contributing areas of direct runoff tekleab et al 2013 analyzed trends of precipitation temperature and streamflow of ubnrb for monthly seasonal and annual time scales they found that seasonal and mean annual precipitation time series did not show any statistically significant trend however temperature and streamflow datasets show mixed results of increasing and decreasing trends wavelet analysis involves matching a given signal time series to a set of scale and time limited mathematical functions called wavelets the analysis is similar to windowed fourier transforms in decomposing the time series into frequency and time domains however unlike fourier analysis which typically characterizes a given time series using trigonometric functions of infinite extent the wavelet analysis uses finite extent wavelets to decompose and describe high and low frequency components gargour et al 2009 mallat 2009 rioul and vetterli 1991 there are several basic wavelet shapes available to work with these wavelets have typical characteristics of being non zero over limited portions and have zero mean torrence and compo 1998 these basic wavelets also known as mother wavelets can decompose a time series into its lower resolution components by controlling the wavelet s scale and shifting factors foufoula georgiou and kumar 1994 percival and walden 2007 these lower resolution components represent the various periodicities affecting the overall structure of the original time series despite the numerous benefits of using wavelet analysis there are three major limitations shift sensitivity poor directionality and lack of phase information shift sensitivity indicates the introduction of unpredictable changes in transform coefficients due to shifting in time during the transform operation poor directionality arises when the transform coefficients reveal only a few feature orientations in the spatial domain on the other hand lack of phase information refers to the absence of phase information for complex valued signals for a detailed treatment of these limitations and their mitigation measures we refer to fernandes et al 2003 although wavelet analysis is a powerful tool to decompose and reveal hidden features of natural signals such as precipitation and streamflow its application for hydro meteorological studies over the ubnrb is limited only a few pieces of literature exist documenting the successful application of wavelet analysis in the region for example melesse et al 2009 applied the continuous wavelet transform cwt to characterize the ubnrb system they performed the cwt on rainfall and streamflow stations and revealed the existence of inter and intra annual variability of rainfall and streamflow at various scales elsanabary et al 2014 used a wavelet empirical orthogonal function to investigate seasonal rainfall over ethiopia their result shows precipitation in the country s long rainy season june september exhibits inter annual oscillations the oscillations appear to occur at 2 4 and 5 7 year cycles wavelet analysis can be successfully combined with trend analysis to reveal dominant time scales contributing to the overall trends of time series nalley et al 2012 partal 2010 partal and küçük 2006 partal and küçük 2006 demonstrated the use of discrete wavelet transform dwt and mann kendall test to determine trends in annual total precipitation over turkey they found that some periodic events affect the trend of precipitation series for example the 16 year periodic events were identified as the effective component responsible for producing the trend observed in the baikesir station nalley et al 2012 also used dwt to analyze trends in streamflow and precipitation in canada after decomposition of monthly seasonal and annual precipitation and streamflow datasets they applied the suitable version of the mann kendall test to identify the periodicities affecting the trends their results show that intra and inter annual events of up to 4 years are more influential in the observed trends so far no wavelet transform based trend analysis of streamflow and precipitation has been conducted in ubnrb therefore in this study we aim to apply dwt along with the mann kendall trend test to identify dominant time scales contributing to the trends in the original precipitation and streamflow measurements furthermore we proposed and explored a new criterion to determine the best wavelet type time series decomposition level and signal extension mode for a better dwt application the criterion is the bias ratio between the approximation component and the original time series the significance of this study lies in its application of the mann kendall test to assess trends in hidden components of the observed time series usual trend analysis studies use raw observations to identify trends however in this study we used the dwt technique to decompose the raw time series and applied the mann kendall test on the raw and decomposed time series to identify trends the application reveals the influence of various time scales on the trends of original observations 2 the study area and data the blue nile river locally known as abbay originates from lake tana area 3060 km2 ethiopia it traverses through deep gorges and lowlands to join the white nile near khartoum sudan the upper blue nile river basin ubnrb is the upper portion of the blue nile river basin whose outlet is located at the border between ethiopia and sudan the ubnrb contributes about 60 of the nile river s annual flow conway 2005 the basin covers a catchment area of 176 000 km2 conway 2000 and is characterized by diverse climate and topography the basin receives its highest precipitation during the june september rainy season a short rainy season from march to may also provides significant precipitation to the basin for the rest of the months the basin remains dry we obtained monthly precipitation records for six meteorological stations from the national meteorological agency nma of ethiopia monthly streamflow data for five stations were also collected from the ethiopian ministry of water and irrigation and various literature the location of these stations is shown in fig 1 the temporal extent of both datasets spans 31 years 1984 2014 we conducted a thorough quality check on the datasets including assessing missing data detecting outliers and conforming homogeneity to detect outliers we compared the observations of a given month with the observations of other years within the same month to check the consistency and homogeneity of each station we used the double mass curve technique searcy et al 1960 for precipitation stations for example we plotted the cumulative precipitation of each station against the mean of the cumulative precipitation of nearby stations the plot should be a straight line so long as the data are proportional the line s slope represents the proportionality constant between individual stations and the groups of nearby stations a break in the slope of the plot indicates a change in the precipitation regime a similar procedure was applied to the streamflow stations as well the double mass curves produced for the debre markos precipitation station and gilgel abay streamflow stations are given in fig 2 the curves demonstrate the consistency of the precipitation and streamflow records both curves show a consistent record of precipitation and streamflow data at the two stations and a break in slope was not observed throughout the record length similar results were obtained for other precipitation and streamflow stations as well based on the quality checking procedures we found out that the common period of analysis for the precipitation and streamflow stations was 1984 2014 consequently the analysis period was fixed between the years 1984 and 2014 after the quality checks monthly datasets were aggregated to generate seasonal and annual time series for precipitation and streamflow we used the monthly datasets to investigate short term fluctuations such as intra and inter annual variations the seasonal datasets were used to examine changes due to seasonal cycles the annual time series was used to analyze long term fluctuations such as multi year decadal and multi decadal events 3 theoretical background 3 1 wavelet analysis the general wavelet analysis procedure in time series involves the following main tasks a suitable wavelet of a particular scale is chosen first the time series is then convolved with the wavelet the convolution is done by sliding the wavelet across the entire time series at each time step a multiplication of the wavelet and the time series is performed and corresponding wavelet coefficients are generated the coefficients measure the level of correlation between the wavelet and the time series the wavelet scale is increased and the process is repeated in the end sets of wavelet coefficients at different scales are obtained the lower and higher scales represent the compressed and stretched versions of the mother wavelet respectively drago and boxall 2002 nalley et al 2012 wavelet coefficients associated with lower scales identify the signal s high frequency or rapidly changing components on the other hand higher scales identify the low frequency or slowly changing elements the main advantage of using wavelet transforms in hydro meteorological time series is its robustness it does not include any assumption of statistical distributions and parametric testing protocols kisi and cimen 2011 furthermore wavelet transform can extract local spectra and temporal information simultaneously there are also a wide variety of mother wavelets tailored to the needs of different time series characteristics there are two types of wavelet transform continuous wavelet transform cwt and discrete wavelet transform dwt the main difference between these two types is the cwt uses every possible wavelet over a range of scales and locations i e the translation and scale parameters of the wavelets vary continuously in contrast the dwt uses a finite set of discretely sampled wavelets the most common and practical form of dwt is the one that employs scales and locations arranged in dyadic arrangement i e powers of two mallat 1989 the dwt is easier to use compared to the cwt the following are the main advantages of dwt over cwt the cwt is a highly redundant transform while the dwt provides a sparse representation of time series as a result the computational resources required to compute the cwt and store the coefficients are much larger than the dwt the dwt provides a perfect reconstruction of the time series upon inversion in other words the dwt coefficients can be used to synthesize an exact reproduction of the original time series within numerical precision the same reconstruction can be done using the cwt but it is often the case that the reconstruction is not perfect reconstructing a signal from the cwt coefficients is a much less stable numerical operation based on the advantages mentioned above we chose to apply dwt to decompose the precipitation and streamflow datasets into their temporal components 3 1 1 discrete wavelet transform dwt using scales and positions in powers of two also known as dyadic arrangement yields a much more efficient and accurate analysis than using arbitrary scales as in the case of cwt mallat 1989 the discrete form of a wavelet function can be given as 1 ψ m n t τ s s 0 m 2 ψ t n τ 0 s 0 m s 0 m where m and n are integers used to control wavelet dilation scale and translation time s 0 is fixed dilation step greater than one and τ 0 is the location parameter and must be greater than zero the most common and simplest choice of s 0 and τ 0 is two and one time steps respectively for a discrete time series x i the dwt is then given by convolving the time series x i with scaled and translated versions of the wavelet function of eq 1 as 2 w m n 2 m 2 i 0 n 1 x i ψ 2 m i n where w m n is wavelet coefficient for the discrete wavelet of scale s 2 m and location τ 2 m n the characteristics of the original time series in frequency s 0 and time τ 0 at the same time are reflected by w m n when the frequency resolution of the dilated and translated wavelet is low but the time resolution is high s 0 becomes small in the case of high frequency and low time resolution s 0 becomes large kisi and cimen 2011 dwt applies two sets of functions named high pass and low pass filters the original time series passes through these filters at different scales and its high and low frequency components are identified the high frequency components known as periodic components or details comprise the rapidly changing events of the time series in contrast the low frequency components known as approximations represent slowly changing events such as time series trends kisi and cimen 2011 3 2 trend analysis trend analysis is done to extract an underlying pattern of behavior in time series for time series having a normal distribution their trend can be assumed linear and a simple linear regression can be performed to estimate the trend however for those time series that comes from a different distribution or possess a trend of other shapes than linear other methods parametric or non parametric are required to reveal the trend in this respect the mann kendall trend test is a widely used non parametric test for identifying monotonic trends in time series data kendall 1957 mann 1945 the mk test is a modified version of the kendall rank correlation coefficient used to measure the ordinal association between two measured quantities kendall 1938 mk test is sensitive to the dependence of sample data and the test results may be biased due to these dependencies ehsanzadeh et al 2011 the dependence typical to hydro meteorological time series could be in the form of serial correlation or seasonal relationships hirsch et al 1982 hirsch and slack 1984 for example a time series containing a positive serial correlation has a reduced number of independent samples this reduced sample in turn increases the variance of the mk statistic and enhances the possibility of rejecting the null hypothesis of no trend the opposite is true for negative serial correlation ehsanzadeh et al 2011 various modifications of mk tests are proposed to account for autocorrelation and seasonality factors hamed and ramachandra rao 1998 hirsch and slack 1984 yue et al 2002 in the following sub sections we reviewed the original mk test the mk test modified by hamed and ramachandra rao 1998 which accounts for serial correlation only and the mk test modified by hirsch and slack 1984 which accounts for both autocorrelation and seasonality 3 2 1 original mann kendall test the original mk test commonly known as kendall s τ statistic has been widely used in hydro meteorological settings due to its non parametric nature and its resistance to the influence of extreme values the null hypothesis h 0 of the test assumes the deseasonalized time series x 1 x 2 x n represent a sample of n independent and identically distributed random variables the alternative hypothesis h 1 of a two sided test is that the distribution of x i and x j is not identical for all i j n with i j the test statistic s is computed as 3 s i 1 n 1 j k 1 n sgn x j x i 4 sgn x j x i 1 if x j x i 0 0 if x j x i 0 1 if x j x i 0 for independently and identically distributed data with zero mean the variance of s can be calculated as var s n n 1 2 n 5 t t t 1 2 t 5 18 where t is the extent of any given tie and t denotes the summation over all ties then the mk test statistic z for all cases where n is larger than ten is given by douglas et al 2000 5 z s 1 var s if s 0 0 if s 0 s 1 var s if s 0 the significance of the trend in the time series is assessed by comparing the z value given in eq 5 with the standard normal variate the pre specified level of statistical significance in a two sided test the null hypothesis should be accepted for a given level of significance α if z z α 2 an increasing trend is represented by a positive value of z while a negative value of z indicates a decreasing trend 3 2 2 modified mann kendall test for autocorrelated data a modified version of the mk test was proposed by hamed and ramachandra rao 1998 to account for serial correlation in time series the modification is performed by applying a correction on the variance s of the original mk test as follows 6 v s var s n n s n n 1 2 n 5 18 n n s where n n s represents a correction due to the autocorrelation in the data and it is estimated as 7 n n s 1 2 n n 1 n 2 i 1 n 1 n i n i 1 n i 2 ρ s i where n is the actual number of observations and ρ s i is the autocorrelation function of the ranks of the observations 3 2 3 modified mann kendall test for autocorrelated and seasonally dependent data hirsch and slack 1984 proposed a multivariate modification of the original mk test to account for seasonality let the matrix 8 x x 11 x 12 x 1 p x 21 x 22 x 2 p x n 1 x n 2 x np represent a sequence of observations taken over p seasons for n years in this case the null hypothesis assumes the n observations for each p season are randomly ordered on the other hand the alternative hypothesis assumes a monotonic trend in one or more seasons the matrix of ranks corresponding to the observations in x can be given as 9 r r 11 r 12 r 1 p r 21 r 22 r 2 p r n 1 r n 2 r np since the values within each season are ranked among themselves the mk test statistic for each season becomes 10 s g i j sgn x jg x ig g 1 2 p then the seasonal kendall test statistic is given by 11 s g 1 p s g which is asymptotically normal with a mean of 0 and variance 12 var s g σ g 2 g h g h σ gh where σ g 2 var s g and σ gh cov s g s h 4 methodology we followed the steps described in this section to reveal the trend structure and contributing periodicities in the precipitation and streamflow measurements of ubnrb fig 3 shows the workflow of the current study 4 1 autocorrelation analysis autocorrelation also known as serial correlation reveals information about the degree of relationship correlation of a time series between two successive time intervals it shows how subsequent lagged time series versions relate to the original measurement with this analysis it is possible to assess the variability in the dataset and find repeating periodic patterns if any autocorrelation values range from with negative values indicating negative autocorrelation i e lagged values increase as the original time series decrease or vice versa similarly positive autocorrelation values indicate a positive correlation where the lagged and the original time series move in tandem i e increase or decrease significant autocorrelation in a time series can affect the variance component during mk trend tests ehsanzadeh et al 2011 besides autocorrelation and seasonality are common in hydro meteorological observations such as precipitation and streamflow we performed an autocorrelation analysis to characterize the correlation structure and seasonality in the datasets the analysis provides correlation values at each lag and we can also examine seasonal dependencies if any from autocorrelation plots of several lags a significant first lag lag 1 correlation coefficient indicates the presence of autocorrelation in the dataset the presence of a repeating pattern in significant autocorrelation coefficients over certain lags suggests the presence of seasonality in the dataset 4 2 time series decomposition via the dwt performing a dwt generally involves 1 identification of the mother wavelet to use for the decomposition 2 deciding the level of decomposition and 3 determining the signal extension mode in this section we provide a brief explanation of these dwt procedures for this study we used the pywavelets python library lee et al 2019 to conduct the dwt analysis for the precipitation and streamflow datasets pywavelets is a python package implementing discrete and continuous wavelet transforms lee et al 2019 the package includes various predefined wavelets and can specify custom wavelet filter banks the pywavelets features are similar to matlab s wavelet toolbox it also allows n dimensional n 3 transform and supports for both real and complex valued data in either single or double precision further information can be found in lee et al 2019 identification of the mother wavelet is the first step to conducting a dwt since wavelet transforms have several wavelet families to choose from it is necessary to identify the one that best fits the features we are looking for in the signal time series the pywavelets library has fourteen mother wavelets including haar daubechies db and symlets sym among others lee et al 2019 each wavelet family is different in shape compactness and smoothness enabling them to be useful in different situations in this study we used the daubechies db wavelets because they have non zero basis functions over a limited interval and full scaling and translational orthonormality properties which are effective for feature localization shoaib et al 2014 in addition numerous hydro meteorological wavelet based studies successfully employed the daubechies wavelets in their analysis chen et al 2016 nalley et al 2012 partal 2010 wright et al 2017 the daubechies wavelet family daubechies 1990 has several sub categories depending on the number of wavelet coefficients vanishing moments in the pywavelets implementation the daubechies wavelet family has 38 sub categories from order one db1 to 38 db38 the sub categories differ by the number of vanishing moments and the level of decomposition they can accommodate the order numbers in the wavelet sub categories indicate the number of vanishing moments for example db5 has five vanishing moments and db7 has seven vanishing moments and so on the number of vanishing moments determines the approximation order and smoothness of the wavelet for example a db5 wavelet has five vanishing moments and can approximate polynomials of degree four as the number of vanishing moments increase the polynomial degree of the wavelet also increases larger vanishing moments make the corresponding wavelets smoother generally daubechies wavelets of order five or more are considered smooth in hydro meteorological time series smoother wavelets are preferred the preference is because the trends in these datasets are supposed to be gradual and represent slowly changing processes nalley et al 2012 in addition several wavelet based trend studies successfully used smooth daubechies wavelets in this study we first tested smooth daubechies wavelets db5 db9 and applied the suitable one for each dataset i e monthly seasonal and annual precipitation and streamflow measurements since we are analyzing 31 years of data having 372 data points the maximum daubechies wavelet order we can perform is up to the next dyadic arrangement to 372 which is 512 29 hence the maximum db order is 9 once the suitable mother wavelet is chosen the next task is to determine the maximum level of decomposition the maximum level depends on the length of the input time series and the wavelet type at each subsequent dwt decomposition the number of samples in the time series is reduced by half due to this down sampling at some stage in the process the number of samples required for the next level decomposition becomes smaller than the sample size filter length required by the wavelet this level is known as the maximum decomposition level one of the various signal extension modes must compensate the sample deficit for continuing the decomposition beyond this level however too much use of signal extension introduces uncertainties known as the border or edge effect su et al 2011 the maximum decomposition level is given by log 2 n k 1 where n is the number of data points in the time series and k is the filter length of the wavelet used the filter length is twice the vanishing moment of the given wavelet for example for our monthly data series of 31 years we have 372 data points and if a db5 wavelet number of vanishing moments 5 is used the maximum decomposition level will be 5 similarly if db9 were used the maximum decomposition level would be 4 in this study we tested both level 4 and level 5 dwt decomposition for each time series another essential aspect of dwt is to determine the signal extension mode a signal extension is needed to continue the convolution process when the signal length is smaller than the wavelet filter length su et al 2011 in this case a border extension mode is used to extend the signal on both ends and provide options for dealing with the problem of border distortion in the signal the most commonly used signal extension modes in the hydro meteorological settings are zero padding periodic padding and symmetric padding the zero padding method applies zero samples at both ends of the signal whereas periodic padding employs periodic replication of the original signal at both ends symmetric padding on the other hand involves symmetric boundary value replication this study tested these modes for each time series and smooth wavelet the choice of the specific wavelet type decomposition level and signal extension mode for each time series are made using three criteria the first one the mean relative error mre was proposed for use in wavelet based trend analysis by de artigas et al 2006 and was computed using the following equation 13 mre 1 n j 1 n a j x j x j where x j is original time series n is the number of data points in the original series and a j is dwt approximation value of x j the second criterion relative error er was proposed by nalley et al 2012 and involved computation of relative error based on mann kendall z values obtained from dwt approximation components the equation used to compute er is given as 14 er z a z o z o where z a is mann kendal z value of the approximation obtained from the maximum decomposition level z o is mann kendal z value of the original time series the third criterion is proposed in this study and is based on bias ratio br the computation of the br was done using the following equation 15 br a j x j where x j represents the mean value of the original time series while a j represents the mean value of the dwt approximation value of the original time series the br is simple to compute and does not include any assumption of statistical distributions and parametric testing nor is it dependent on spatial differences it is derived purely from the data at hand therefore it can be applied anywhere in other studies 4 3 applying the mk trend tests once suitable wavelet type decomposition level and signal extension mode are determined the time series decomposition is performed for each dataset i e monthly seasonal and annual precipitation and streamflow this procedure obtained detail and approximation components for the prospective analysis since the mk trend analysis results on the detailed components can be better interpreted with their respective approximation added partal 2010 partal and küçük 2006 the mk trend test was applied to the original detail approximation as well as combinations of details and approximation components of each dataset we applied the original mk test if there was no significant lag 1 autocorrelation and seasonality for the original detail approximation and combined datasets mk test by hamed and ramachandra rao 1998 was applied for those time series with significant lag 1 autocorrelation without seasonality factor for the remaining datasets with strong seasonality irrespective of significant lag 1 autocorrelation we used the mk test by hirsch and slack 1984 both modified mk tests can be applied to auto correlated time series however the test by hirsch and slack 1984 is not as powerful when there is long term persistence or when there are less than five years worth of monthly data hirsch and slack 1984 the hamed and ramachandra rao 1998 modification is proposed to address these shortcomings it is preferred because autocorrelations may still exist past the first lag therefore in our study we chose the powerful modified mk test by hamed and ramachandra rao 1998 for stations with significant autocorrelation but without seasonal dependence 4 4 determination of dominant trend component the final procedure in this study was to examine which periodic component or detail with approximation added of the dwt decomposition contributes more to the trends observed if any in the original time series to determine the dominant contributor we used two strategies the first one is comparing the closeness of mk z values between the periodic component details with approximation added and the original series and the second one is to compute the bias ratio eq 15 and choose the periodic component with optimal bias ratio value it s important to note that bias ratio values close to unity one indicate better performance 4 5 open source software our research heavily relies on open source software the programming language of choice is python 3 8 0 the main library used for the dwt analysis is pywavelets lee et al 2019 the libraries we use for pre and post processing our data and for data management in general are numpy harris et al 2020 pandas mckinney 2010 statsmodels seabold and perktold 2010 and matplotlib hunter 2007 5 results and discussions 5 1 preliminary data analysis results of the autocorrelation analysis on the original streamflow and precipitation time series datasets are discussed in this section fig 4 and fig 5 show autocorrelation plots of monthly precipitation and streamflow for each station in the study area respectively autocorrelation plots for the seasonal and annual time series are given in the supplement on the plots the autocorrelation values are represented by the points on the vertical lines for various lags the shaded regions represent the confidence intervals the autocorrelation values inside these intervals are not considered statistically significant at a 5 significance level the significance level we used for all of our autocorrelation analyses as it s obvious from the plots all the streamflow and precipitation stations exhibit significant lag 1 autocorrelation values on a monthly scale furthermore the autocorrelations become pronounced every 12th lag indicating a strong annual cycle in both measurements table 1 shows the numerical values of the autocorrelations for all streamflow and precipitation stations in the table statistically significant autocorrelations are marked by an asterisk whereas strong seasonality is indicated by the upper case letter s inside a square bracket s for the seasonal time series all lag 1 autocorrelations are not statistically significant however significant autocorrelation values are observed at every 4th lag indicating strong annual seasonality in these datasets see fig s1 fig s2 in the supplement and table 1 most streamflow and precipitation stations didn t show significant autocorrelation and seasonality for the annual time series only one precipitation station gondar acf 0 66 and one streamflow station megech acf 0 93 show significant autocorrelations at 5 significance level see fig s3 fig s4 in the supplement and table 1 all the streamflow and precipitation stations didn t show significant seasonality on the annual scale significant lag 1 autocorrelation and seasonal dependencies determine the mk test s choice for the subsequent analysis as a result we adopted the mk trend test by hirsch and slack 1984 for all monthly and seasonal streamflow and precipitation datasets due to the presence of seasonality irrespective of significant lag 1 autocorrelations on the other hand we applied the original mk test for the annual datasets as the datasets are not affected by autocorrelations and seasonality the exceptions being the gondar precipitation station and megech streamflow station we used the mk test by hamed and ramachandra rao 1998 for these two stations the selection of suitable wavelet type decomposition level and signal extension mode for each time series monthly seasonal and annual was conducted using the three criteria discussed in section 3 3 2 we tested the five smooth wavelets db5 db9 for the monthly datasets with decomposition levels of four and five and all three signal extension modes similarly we tested level three and four decompositions for seasonal and annual datasets with all the five wavelet types db5 db9 and signal extension modes each of the three criteria yielded slightly different results for example for the assossa precipitation station mre yielded a db7 wavelet level 4 decomposition and zero padding for the dwt analysis for the monthly precipitation time series this result is slightly different compared to er db9 level 4 zero padding and br db8 level 4 symmetric padding to determine which criterion provides the best wavelet type decomposition level and signal extension mode we plotted and compared the linear fit of the original series with the resulting dwt approximations for each criterion then we selected the criterion that provides a linear fit of the approximation close to the original one an example plot for the monthly precipitation stations is shown in fig 6 although all the three criteria provided comparable results a close examination reveals that the br criterion proposed in this study provides the closest linear fit of the dwt approximation to the original series for most stations therefore we used the br criterion to determine the best wavelet decomposition level and signal extension mode for each monthly seasonal and annual precipitation and streamflow dataset table 2 shows the best wavelet signal extension and decomposition level for each station using the br criterion based on the br criterion we used level four decomposition for monthly time series of precipitation and streamflow the wavelet type and border extensions may vary from one station to another similarly for seasonal data we found that level three decomposition provides the smallest error the wavelet type and border extensions may vary from one station to another for the annual series level three decompositions yielded the smallest error therefore we used level three dwt for the annual time series the wavelet type and border extensions may vary from station to station after decomposing the time series with the suitable wavelet type the resulting wavelet coefficients can be used to reconstruct the original time series fig 7 shows an example plot of the original and reconstructed time series at different decomposition levels the plots show that reconstruction from level one decomposition yields a perfect match with the original series the reconstruction skill diminishes as the level of decomposition increases the reason could be artificial values at both ends of the time series due to the signal extension mode 5 2 monthly data analysis 5 2 1 monthly precipitation an example plot of the dwt decomposition of monthly precipitation for the debre markos station is shown in fig 8 similar decomposition was done for the remaining precipitation stations the result was obtained after applying dwt using a db7 wavelet with four decomposition levels and periodic padding the first panel shows the original time series plot for the entire study period 1984 2014 each detail component represents the 2 month periodicity d1 4 month periodicity d2 8 month periodicity d3 and 16 month periodicity d4 the a4 represents the approximation component at the fourth level of decomposition the details represent the rapidly changing component of the original time series whereas the approximation represents the slowly changing component results of mk application on the original detail approximation and combinations details and approximation components for the monthly precipitation and streamflow datasets are given in table 3 since all the monthly data exhibit strong seasonality and significant lag 1autocorrelation the results of table 3 are obtained from the mk test by hirsch and slack 1984 all precipitation stations show an increasing trend for the original time series only the bahir dar station exhibits a significant trend at a 5 significance level z 2 29 a similar statistically insignificant increasing trend for a basin wide study over the ubnrb is also reported in mekonnen et al 2018 they found that eleven stations out of fifteen didn t show a significant trend on a monthly scale on the other hand the detail components d1 d4 show a mix of positive and negative trends except for the d2 component of bahir dar station none of the mk z values of the details is statistically significant however the approximation component of all the precipitation stations experiences significant mk z values except for the jimma station which has a significant and decreasing trend all the approximation component trends are significant and positive after adding the approximation a4 to each detail most trend values for the combination details approximation become statistically significant this improvement is due to the relatively high mk z values of the a4 additionally the trend magnitude of the combination gets enhanced compared to the individual detail components this fact shows that most of the trend is contained in the approximation component although the original precipitation series didn t show significant trends in almost all stations the mk test application on the decomposed series may reveal some significant trends this situation shows the contribution of lower resolution periodicities to the overall trend observed in the original series to examine which details with approximation added contribute more to the trends observed in the original series we used the two measures described in section 3 3 4 the dominant periodic components represented by values typed in boldface in table 3 vary from station to station this change may be due to differences in their location generally the d3 component with a4 added is more influential indicating that the 8 month periodicity is the main driver behind the observed trends in the original series 5 2 2 monthly streamflow fig 9 shows an example plot of the dwt decomposition of monthly streamflow for bn at kessie station a similar decomposition was done for the remaining streamflow stations the result was obtained after applying dwt using a db9 wavelet with four decomposition levels and symmetric padding the corresponding mk test results using hirsch and slack 1984 are shown in table 4 all the streamflow stations for the original series show a significant increasing trend mekonnen et al 2018 also reported that statistically significant increasing trends were observed throughout the ubnrb similar to the precipitation stations positive and negative mk z values were obtained from the detail components d1 d4 although all of the original series are significant none of the details are statistically significant except for the bn at bahir dar station z 1 05 all approximation components show an increasing and statistically significant trend the magnitudes of the trends in the approximations are also relatively larger than the original series we can observe the effect of these approximations in changing the trend structure when they are added to each detail component except for all the detail components of bn at bahir dar and d2 and d4 components of gilgel abay station all the detail components become statistically significant after the addition of the approximation except for the bn at bahir dar station the approximation addition also preserved the trend direction observed in the original series this trend improvement clearly shows the important role the approximation components play in containing the trends of the original series the dominant periodic components shown in boldface in table 3 vary from station to station this variation may be due to differences in their location and the catchment area they represent generally the d3 and d4 components with a4 added are more influential indicating that the events that occurred in 8 month and 16 month periodicities are the main drivers behind the observed trends in the original series 5 3 seasonal data analysis 5 3 1 seasonal precipitation mk trend test results for the seasonal precipitation and streamflow series are given in table 4 the original series follows a similar trend pattern as the monthly precipitation only the bahir dar station shows a significant trend a similar absence of a significant trend in seasonal precipitation over the ubnrb is also reported in mekonnen et al 2018 and tesemma et al 2010 the details d1 d3 experience a mix of positive and negative trend values all of the details exhibit statistically insignificant mk z values each detail component represents the 6 month periodicity d1 12 month periodicity d2 and 24 month periodicity d3 except for assossa and debre markos stations the remaining stations show significant mk z values for the approximation a3 component after adding the a3 to each detail component all exhibit a positive trend as the original series therefore the a3 component still plays a crucial role in explaining the observed trends in each precipitation station for the assossa and debre markos stations the most dominant periodicities contributing to the observed trends are the 6 month d1 and 24 month d3 respectively gondar jimma and mota seasonal precipitation trends appear to be equally influenced by the 6 and 12 month periodicities for these three stations the annual cycle plays an important role in modulating the trends 5 3 2 seasonal streamflow for the original seasonal streamflow three bn at el diem bn at kessie and megech of the five stations experience significant trend values tesemma et al 2010 also reported similar trend behavior for bn at el diem and bn at kessie stations however their finding of a significant trend for the bn at bahir dar station didn t agree with ours the reason could be the use of a different temporal extent they used data from 1964 to 2003 for their analysis none of the details show significant mk z values after adding a3 to each detail most of the mk z values become statistically significant for the bn at bahir dar and gilgel abay stations the most influential periodicity in contributing to the observed trends appear to be the 24 month events for the bn at el diem and bn at kessie the annual cycle plays a vital role in producing the observed trend 5 4 annual data analysis 5 4 1 annual precipitation table 5 shows the results of the mk test on original and dwt decompositions for annual precipitation and streamflow time series the bahir dar and mota stations show a significant increasing trend for the original time series the remaining precipitation stations exhibit an increasing but statistically insignificant trend gebremicael et al 2013 also reported the absence of a significant trend for the gondar bahir dar and debre markos stations during their study period 1970 2005 however their finding of a significantly decreasing trend for the assossa station didn t agree with our analysis the reason for this discrepancy could be using a different analysis period similar to the monthly and seasonal precipitations the detail components show a mix of positive and negative mk z values but they are still insignificant however adding the approximation a3 improved their magnitude and most stations experienced significant trends afterward on the annual scale it is difficult to get a uniform periodicity affecting the observed trends in all the stations the 2 and 8 year events appear to influence the trend elsanabary et al 2014 also reported a similar result ethiopia s rainfall exhibits inter annual oscillations in 2 4 and 5 7 year cycles these cycles may be associated with the cycles of el niño southern oscillation enso which has a period of 3 04 4 60 year the enso is known to modify the annual cycles and significantly affect the total ethiopian monsoon rainfall variability segele et al 2009 5 4 2 annual streamflow annual streamflow of the original series for three stations bn at el diem bn at kessie and megech show statistically significant trends the remaining two stations bn at bahir dar and gilgel abay exhibit non significant trends from which the bn at bahir dar station shows a decreasing trend mekonnen et al 2018 and gebremicael et al 2013 also reported a similar statistically significant trend for the bn at el diem station similarly tesemma et al 2010 also reported a significant increasing trend for bn at bahir dar and bn at kessie stations most streamflow stations show an increasing trend although many precipitation stations over ubnrb didn t this inconsistency could be associated with modification of catchment responses due to land use land cover changes over the basin gebremicael et al 2013 tesemma et al 2010 these changes could result in enhanced surface runoff and increased measurements at the catchment outlets except for the gilgel abay station z 2 21 all the detailed components experience insignificant mk z values after adding the a3 component to each of these details however most stations show statistically significant trends similar to the annual precipitation condition it s difficult to observe a unifying periodicity influencing the observed trends however the gilgel abay and bn at bahir dar stations appear to be influenced by 2 and 8 year periodic events respectively 6 conclusion this study conducted wavelet decomposition and mann kendall trend analysis for ubnrb streamflow and precipitation measurements best wavelet types level of decomposition and signal extension modes were identified using a bias ratio criterion proposed in this study along with mean relative error and mk z values based relative errors the bias ratio criterion performed better as it provided most stations closest linear fit of the dwt approximation to the original series after performing the dwt autocorrelation analysis was conducted on each original and decomposed series to determine a suitable mann kendall version to account for autocorrelation and seasonality in the time series results show insignificant positive trends dominate the original monthly seasonal and annual precipitation series most stations exhibit significantly increasing trends for the streamflow series original monthly seasonal and annual measurements the details in both streamflow and precipitation series experience a mix of positive and negative trends but almost all are statistically insignificant however most approximation components experienced significant trends and indicated their essential role in carrying the trends observed in the original measurements dominant time scales affecting the observed trends for the monthly precipitation were the 8 month events whereas for the monthly streamflow the 8 to 16 month events were influential on the seasonal scale the annual cycles 12 months played a significant role in the observed trends in most precipitation and streamflow measurements on the annual scale however obtaining a unifying periodicity affecting the trends across all the stations was difficult in general it can be concluded that for the precipitation and streamflow observations over the ubnrb the trends are influenced by fluctuations of up to 4 years finally the results obtained in this study can serve as a benchmark for further studies related to wavelet applications in hydro meteorological time series in ubnrb furthermore the information regarding the crucial periodicities affecting precipitation and streamflow trends over ubnrb can be used as inputs to various modeling and water management activities it is important to note that this study is limited by the lack of dense precipitation and streamflow station information primarily we could not get quality data for the basin s mid and southwest portions therefore we recommend additional investigations with better stations to capture the complete picture of the trends over ubnrb funding this work was supported by the national science fund for
