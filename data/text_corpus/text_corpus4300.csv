21500,the present study numerically investigates the breaking and spectral characteristics and geometric properties of breaking irregular waves over slopes for different incident waves the growth of wave non linearity and wave energy redistribution during shoaling and breaking process are observed to be major factors in determining the free surface elevation skewness and spectral bandwidth in general the variation of the breaker indices with the surf similarity parameter is found to be mainly governed by the type of wave breakers the wave breaker type further depends on the seabed slope incident wave parameters and water depth at the location of wave breaking the study further explores the geometric properties for both spilling and plunging irregular wave breakers the wave deformation due to wave seabed interaction plays a major role in affecting the breaker shapes every individual breaking wave in the irregular wave train possesses different wave profiles and breaker characteristics in order to study these parameters in a probabilistic way the statistics of the breaker characteristics and the breaker shape parameters are investigated the lognormal distribution is noticed to be the most suitable fit for the wave crest steepness and asymmetry factors this study is performed using the open source computational fluid dynamics cfd based numerical model the numerical model is validated for a submerged bar under breaking irregular waves and the numerical results are compared with experimental data the transformations of the free surface elevation due to wave shoaling wave breaking and wave decomposition are explored keywords geometric properties irregular wave breaking wave deformation submerged bar 1 introduction during the last few decades considerable efforts have been made to study wave breaking in the coastal regions wave breaking primarily governs the various hydrodynamic processes in the surf zone like destabilization of the sea bed wave setup and wave energy dissipation a lot of research has been dedicated in the past towards the wave hydrodynamics investigation of breaking regular waves goda 1970 hwang 1984 weggel 1972 camenen and larson 2007 their studies revealed many important parameters to quantify and understand the regular wave breaking process however the study of breaking regular waves is not sufficient to describe and investigate the real sea state the real sea state is highly irregular and composed of many harmonic wave components in contrast to regular waves there is no well defined breaking point for irregular waves the breaking location is different for each individual wave component depending on the individual wave steepness therefore the energy dissipation of irregular waves occurs over a larger surf zone area in comparison to regular waves the breaker type also varies for each wave component of an irregular wave train the breaking characteristics and the geometric properties of discrete breaking events in the irregular wave train are distinct from each other due to the different amplitudes and frequencies the hydrodynamics of breaking irregular waves are still not fully understood and are relatively uncertain when the beach slope is constant the temporal and spatial variability of wave breaking should solely depend on the incident wave spectrum ting 2001 some researchers have attempted to investigate the individual wave breaking frequency and statistics of breaking irregular waves a field study was conducted by thorpe and humphries 1980 to study the relationship between the mean frequency of wave breaking at a fixed point and the average distance between irregular breaking waves the wavelet method has been used analytically to determine and quantify the breaking statistics by mori and yasuda 1994 and liu 2000 their study revealed that the surface jumps associated with the breaking waves can be well detected in the wavelet spectra ochi et al 1996 investigated the joint probability distribution of wave excursion and the associated time interval of non narrow banded random process they showed that the breaking probability depends on the shape of the wave spectrum for deep water waves seyama and kimura 1988 measured the properties of breaking irregular waves over a slope they concluded that the shoaling property of zero down cross waves can be approximated by linear wave theory also the wave properties during the breaking process and after breaking differ considerably from those for periodic waves beji and battjes 1993 studied the irregular wave propagation over a submerged bar experimentally and further investigated wave breaking and wave shoaling under irregular waves for different spectral wave steepnesses ting 2001 explored the wave and turbulence characteristics of broad and narrow banded irregular waves over a sloping sea bed they also reported the probability distributions for the wave height and peak velocities for the breaking irregular waves kjeldsen and myrhaug 1978 conducted a study to investigate the geometric properties of breaking waves a wave crest deformation can be observed both horizontally and vertically at the onset of wave breaking several numerical and analytical studies have been performed to investigate breaking regular waves the numerical studies of non linear surface waves have been conducted in the past by using potential flow theory watson and west 1975 longuet higgins and cokelet 1976 chen et al 1999 reported that this approach is unable to capture the complete breaking process accurately the assumptions in the potential flow theory are valid up to the breaking point these assumptions become invalid at the onset of wave breaking the detailed information about the flow properties for the free surface flows can be computed by computational fluid dynamics cfd in order to capture the complete breaking process cfd can be used without defining any empirical breaking criterion explicitly a number of cfd investigations have been carried out to study breaking regular waves lin and liu 1998 bradford 2000 the turbulence scales in their simulations were represented with the turbulence models many studies were also performed using two phase models to investigate breaking waves since two phase models give a more realistic representation of the wave breaking process hieu et al 2004 garcia et al 2004 christensen 2006 lara et al 2006 the detailed reviews on the previous work with cfd modelling for breaking waves can be found in lara et al 2006 bradford 2000 and hieu et al 2004 alagan chella et al 2015 2016 studied the breaking characteristics and geometric properties of breaking regular waves over slopes using a cfd based model they compared the numerical results with experimental data by ting and kirby 1996 the numerical results showed good agreement with the experimental data for free surface elevation horizontal and vertical velocities and turbulent kinetic energy paulsen et al 2013 simulated non breaking irregular waves using cfd to study the wave loads on monopile structures however there is limited literature available for breaking irregular waves propagating over slopes in shallow waters there are only a few studies performed in the past to investigate the transformations in the parameters like free surface elevation skewness spectral bandwidth breaking characteristics and geometric wave profile properties during the breaking process for irregular waves in shallow water over slopes due to the complex phenomena involved during wave breaking most of the studies involving breaking irregular waves are limited to field and laboratory experiments already developed and tested approaches like cfd modelling can be used to investigate these less explored aspects of breaking irregular waves over slopes the objective of the present paper is to numerically investigate breaking irregular waves over slopes in the time and frequency domains and to analyse the transformations in the free surface elevation skewness spectral bandwidth breaking characteristics and wave crest profile during the wave propagation over slopes the previous studies related to breaking irregular waves in shallow water have not been focused on addressing these aspects in detail the breaking characteristics of irregular waves are relatively complex to study as there is no clearly defined breaking point and no clear distinction between the different breaker types the regular wave breaking characteristics have been relatively well studied in the past alagan chella et al 2015 2016 the present study includes the investigation of the breaking and spectral characteristics of irregular waves the energy transfer from the spectral peak region towards higher frequencies during the wave shoaling and wave breaking processes is quantified by using the method used by tian et al 2011 for breaking focused wave groups further the analysis of the geometric properties of irregular wave breakers is performed for different breaker types to explore the role of seabed slope and incident wave parameters in the wave breaking process many numerical and experimental studies have been carried out in the past to study the geometric properties of regular breaking waves but only a few studies exist which have addressed the geometric properties of irregular wave breakers to the best of the authors knowledge the present study is the first attempt to investigate these parameters for breaking irregular waves over slopes the numerical simulations are conducted using a cfd based two phase numerical model reef3d bihs et al 2016 bihs and kamath 2017 this model has been successfully used to investigate different coastal and marine engineering problems afzal et al 2015 ong et al 2017 aggarwal et al 2019a b 2020 afzal et al 2020 the numerical model employs higher order numerical schemes capable of capturing the complete breaking process the validation for modelling of breaking irregular waves is performed by comparing the numerical results for breaking irregular waves over a submerged bar with the experiments performed by beji and battjes 1993 during the complex transformation processes like wave shoaling and wave breaking next the propagation of irregular breaking waves over sloping seabeds is investigated the wave energy transfer from the spectral peak region towards the different frequency ranges breaking wave statistics and the changes in free surface elevation skewness and spectral bandwidth during the breaking process are studied in detail an extensive analysis to explore the breaking wave characteristics and the geometric properties for different cases is performed the wave crest steepness and asymmetry parameters are examined in order to understand the influence of water depth and incident wave steepness in determining the deformation in the wave crest the statistics of breaking wave characteristics and geometric properties of the breakers are also analysed and discussed to quantify these parameters 2 numerical model 2 1 governing equations the present study is performed using a cfd based numerical model reef3d bihs et al 2016 bihs and kamath 2017 the reynolds averaged navier stokes equations rans are defined with the assumption of an incompressible fluid the momentum conservation equation together with the continuity equation define the navier stokes equations 1 u i x i 0 2 u i t u j u i x j 1 ρ p x i x j ν ν t u i x j u j x i g i where u is the velocity averaged over time t ρ is the fluid density p is the pressure ν is the kinematic viscosity ν t is the eddy viscosity i and j denote the indices in x and y direction respectively and g i is the acceleration due to gravity the solution for the pressure in the navier stokes equations is obtained from the projection method chorin 1968 the poisson pressure equation is solved with the hypre integrated conjugate gradient solver preconditioned with geometric multigrid falgout and yang 2002 the fifth order finite difference weighted essentially non oscillatory weno scheme in multi space dimensions is utilized in the present study jiang and shu 1996 the third order tvd runge kutta scheme is applied for the time discretization shu and oscher 1988 the viscous terms are source term dependent and result in very low cfl numbers when discretized explicitly in order to avoid this the viscous terms are treated with an implicit method to take it out of the cfl criterion adaptive time stepping is used in order to control the time step size based on the cfl number griebel et al 1998 the numerical model utilizes a cartesian grid in order to use higher order discretization schemes the

to capture the free surface the level set function gives the closest distance to the interface and the two phases are distinguished by the change of the sign the function can be written as 7 ϕ x t 0 i f x is in phase 1 0 i f x is at the interface 0 i f x is in phase 2 2 2 irregular wave generation the relaxation method is utilized for the wave generation and absorption mayer et al 1998 the values for the velocities and the free surface are ramped up from the computational values to the ones obtained from wave theory also the reflected waves which travel back towards the inlet are absorbed with this method a numerical beach is needed at the end of the wave flume in order to dissipate waves and avoid reflections in the relaxation method a smooth transition is made from the computational solution to the still water conditions the irregular waves are composed of the super positioning of regular wave components the first order irregular waves are generated by summation of the linear regular waves components the free surface η is defined as 8 η i 1 n a i c o s θ i 9 a i 2 s ω i δ ω i 10 θ i k i x ω i t ϵ i 11 ω i 2 g k i tanh k i h where n is the number of components a i is the amplitude of each wave component s ω i is the spectral density and θ i is the phase ϵ i is a random number rectangularly distributed between 0 and 2 π ω i is the angular frequency λ i is the wavelength and k i is the wave number k i 2 π λ i similarly the wave induced horizontal velocity u and the wave induced vertical velocity w are computed as the sum of the individual u and w components in the irregular wave train the second order irregular wave theory given by dalzell 1999 which takes into account the second order wave wave interaction is used for the higher spectral wave steepness cases 12 η η 1 η 2 u u 1 u 2 w w 1 w 2 where η 1 u 1 and w 1 represent the first order components and η 2 u 2 and w 2 represent the second order components the details of the second order irregular wave theory can be found in dalzell 1999 in the present study the joint north sea wave project jonswap spectrum is used for the generation of irregular waves hasselmann et al 1980 the waves propagating close to the coast are usually fetch limited and are never fully developed the required significant wave height h s the peak angular frequency ω p and number of components n are given as

breaking irregular waves over an impermeable submerged bar by comparing the numerical results with the experiments by beji and battjes 1993 in the experimental setup the length of the wave flume is 37 70 m the width is 0 8 m and the height is 0 75 m the still water level over the horizontal bottom is d 0 4 m in the experiments a piston type wavemaker was used for generating irregular waves based on the jonswap spectrum a submerged trapezoidal bar with a weather side slope of 1 20 and a 2 m long horizontal crest followed by a 1 10 lee side slope was installed at a distance of x 6 m from the wavemaker eight wave gauges were installed along the length of the wave flume in the experimental setup to measure the free surface elevation a two dimensional numerical wave tank is used to simulate the experiments described above the numerical setup including the wave gauge locations is illustrated in fig 1 the numerical tests are performed for the grid convergence study with input h s 0 054 m and the spectral peak period t p 2 π ω p 2 5 s for four different uniform grid sizes d x 0 10 m 0 05 m 0 01 m and 0 005 m for the wave gauge located at x 11 m fig 2 presents the comparison of experimental and numerical spectral wave density at x 11 m with d x 0 10 m total number of mesh elements 3440 0 05 m total number of mesh elements 13760 d x 0 01 m total number of mesh elements 344000 and d x 0 005 m total number of mesh elements 1 38 million the wall time simulation time is around 3 h with d x 0 10 m 12 h with d x 0 05 m 120 h for case with d x 0 01 m and 230 h for case with d x 0 005 m the simulations are performed to obtain 200 s of the flow data furthermore 128 processors are used for the present simulations the computations are conducted on the supercomputer which is based on the intel xeon e5 2670 processor with 2 6 ghz speed and a memory of 2 gb per core the present simulations employ the cartesian grid approach which means that the grid size is uniform in both directions for a 2d wave tank dx dy the spectral densities s η are normalized by the total spectral density at wg1 x 6 m it is observed that the numerical results with d x 0 10 m and 0 05 m underestimate the peak spectral density by 45 and 26 respectively also the spectral density in the higher frequency range 0 75 hz 2 0 hz is not correctly represented this is due to the insufficient number of cells per wavelength the difference between the peak experimental and numerical spectral wave density reduces to 3 and the spectral wave density at all frequencies is represented with a reasonable accuracy with d x 0 01 m and 0 005 m the increase in accuracy on changing d x from 0 01 m to 0 005 m is not very significant but the computational costs increase by almost a factor of 2 thus d x 0 01 m is chosen for the further simulations the reduction in the spectral density is due to the loss of energy during the wave breaking process for the wave gauges located on the downslope a large reduction in incident spectral density is observed because most of the waves in the irregular wave train have already broken and a large amount of the wave energy has already been dissipated during the breaking and redistributed during the wave decomposition process fig 3 presents the comparison of s η for the wave surface elevations at the six different wave gauge locations x 11 m 12 m 13 m 15 m 16 m and 17 m with d x 0 01 m correlation coefficient r van loco et al 2002 is also calculated to compare numerical and experimental spectral wave densities r can have a maximum value of 1 and it would mean a perfect correlation the spectral peak and energy distributions are well represented for wg2 at x 11 m with r 0 997 fig 3a a major portion of the spectral density lies between the frequency range from 0 to 1 5 hz at x 12 m wg3 the still water depth is reduced to its minimum value resulting in further shoaling and the value of r is 0 993 fig 3b the peak value of the spectrum is slightly reduced and the wave spectrum becomes broader 0 hz to 2 hz as compared to the spectrum for the previous wave gauge location 0 hz to 1 7 hz this is due the increasing contribution of the wave energy of the shorter waves as can be expected during the shoaling process this observation is consistent with the experiments fig 3c shows the results at x 13 m wg4 and has r 0 992 at this location many waves in the wave train have already broken and the peak of the spectrum is further reduced the contribution of wave energy towards higher frequencies is further increased the wave gauge located at x 15 m wg6 on the lee side slope of the bar indicates further reduction of the spectrum with energy transfer towards higher frequencies with r 0 995 fig 3d this is caused by the wave decomposition process attributed to the increasing water depth on the lee side of the slope kamath et al 2017 the waves are decomposed into secondary and tertiary components visible through the multiple peaks at the higher frequencies in the wave spectrum the total energy spectral density of the wave train is also considerably reduced figs 3e with r 0 993 and 3f with r 0 992 the redistribution of the wave energy takes place and the energy from the primary peak is transferred towards the secondary and tertiary peaks at the higher frequencies the size of the sampling interval for fft and the spectral smoothening process might be the reason for some irregularities in the wave spectra 3 breaking irregular waves over impermeable slopes alagan chella et al 2015 2016 have performed a numerical study on the breaking of regular waves and compared their numerical results with the experiments by ting and kirby 1996 the present investigation focuses on breaking irregular waves over slopes the setup used in the present study is similar to that of ting and kirby 1996 the spectral wave steepness s for the irregular waves is defined as 14 s 2 π h s o g t p 2 where h s o is the offshore significant wave height and t p is the spectral peak period the breaking of regular waves can be defined by four types spilling plunging collapsing and surging depending on the surf similarity parameter the surf similarity parameter at breaking ξ b is a function of the wave steepness at breaking s b and the slope of the seabed m battjes 1974 15 ξ b m s b s b 2 π h b g t 2 16 ξ b 0 4 spilling 0 4 ξ b 2 0 plunging ξ b 2 0 surging or collapsing the spectral surf similarity parameter ξ is defined as a function of the spectral wave steepness s and the slope of the seabed m 17 ξ m s the breaker depth index γ b and breaker height index ω b are two parameters used to investigate the breaking characteristics of waves they are defined as 18 γ b h b d b ω b h b h s o where d b is the depth at breaking t is the zero crossing period of individual waves at breaking h b is the local wave height at breaking and h s o is the offshore significant wave height kjeldsen and myrhaug 1978 defined the steepness and asymmetry parameters for the local wave crest asymmetry at breaking the wave crest front steepness ε the wave crest rear steepness δ the horizontal asymmetry factor μ and the vertical asymmetry factor λ the present study uses these steepness and asymmetry parameters to study the geometric properties of breaking irregular waves over different slopes 3 1 computational setup and test cases the two dimensional numerical wave tank is 20 5 m long and 1 m high as shown in fig 4 the water depth is d 0 4 m the wave breaking is prominently influenced by the spectral steepness of the incident wave spectrum and the slope of the seabed the numerical simulations are performed for three different seabed slopes m 1 25 1 35 and 1 45 wave spectra with four different wave steepnesses s 0 0142 0 0267 0 0445 and 0 0623 are tested on each slope therefore an investigation of 12 different cases in total is performed table 1 all simulations are run for t 200 s with the number of wave components n 499 nine wave gauges are placed along the numerical wave tank the distance of the wave gauge x is measured from the toe of the slope fig 4 for m 1 35 the locations of the wave gauges are changed with each change in slope i e becoming more crowded together for the 1 25 slope and l s is the length of the slope which shortens and is different with the increasing slope value m occurrence of wave breaking changes in the spectral characteristics and the wave transformations are analysed and presented for all 12 cases further the study investigates the energy level evolution the breaker characteristics and the geometric properties of breaking irregular waves over slopes in order to demonstrate the effect of environmental parameters on the breaking characteristics two different scenarios are presented in more detail the wave spectrum with lower spectral steepness on a steeper slope case a1 and the wave spectrum with higher spectral steepness on a milder slope case c4 3 2 wave transformation 3 2 1 irregular wave breaking process when the irregular wave train approaches the shore the wave height wave length and the energy content of each wave component change as the water depth decreases the wave length becomes shorter as the wave height and wave energy increase due to the shoaling process this process continues until the fluid particle velocity exceeds the wave crest velocity which leads to wave breaking fig 5 presents the computed free surface profile with velocity variations during the wave propagation over the slope at t 52 7 s 52 9 s 53 05 s 53 2 s 53 27 s and 53 39 s respectively when the waves propagate over the slope they undergo shoaling which is observed by the increase in wave crest heights as the waves propagate further over the slope the main wave crest becomes almost vertical which denotes the onset of wave breaking as can be seen in fig 5a the wave breaking is embarked by the small water jet at the wave crest the profile of the wave crest becomes highly deformed and asymmetric when the fluid particle velocity at the wave crest exceeds the wave celerity an over turning motion of the wave crest is induced fig 5b the overturning wave crest breaks with an encasement of an air pocket fig 5c referred to as the splash up phenomenon and generates another small jet of water in the downstream direction figs 5d 5e 5f the results for the wave profile deformation during the breaking process are consistent with previous studies lubin et al 2006 christensen 2006 alagan chella et al 2016 fig 6 presents the distribution of the normalized significant wave height h s h s o versus the normalized distance along the wave tank x l s for a cases a1 a4 with m 1 25 b cases b1 b4 with m 1 35 and c cases c1 c4 with m 1 45 where l s is the length of the slope in the order of the lower to the upper symbols in fig 6 for a given slope the waves with lower spectral wave steepness s undergo more shoaling and have a higher value of h s h s o in the breaking zone compared to the waves with higher spectral wave steepness s for case a4 s 0 0623 m 1 25 the wave height becomes 1 29 h s o in contrast to case a1 where the wave height is 1 37 h s o in the breaking zone as expected the wave breaking zone around which most of the waves in the irregular wave train break i e x l s shifts farther offshore as the spectral wave steepness increases for a given slope the waves with larger s lose most of the incident wave energy when they reach shallower water depths due to the breaking at relatively deeper depths the waves with lower s contain relatively more energy when they approach shallower water depths and thus a higher value of h s h s o in comparison with the waves with larger s and the breaking zone is relatively more onshore 3 2 2 energy level evolution this section demonstrates the energy transfer between the different frequency ranges of the wave spectrum by tracking the wave energy levels at different frequency ranges during the wave shoaling and wave breaking processes five different frequency ranges of the wave spectrum are considered spectral peak region f f p 0 9 1 1 e 1 above peak region f f p 1 2 1 5 e 2 higher frequency region f f p 1 5 2 5 e 3 low frequency range 0 5 0 9 e 4 significantly high frequency region 2 5 5 e 5 and total energy e e 1 e 2 e 3 e 4 e 5 this is similar to the methodology used by tian et al 2011 to investigate the energy transfer for breaking focused wave groups these energy levels are non dimensionalized with the total incident wave energy e 0 m fig 7 presents the variation of the energy levels at different frequency ranges versus the normalized distance in the nwt for case a1 s 0 0142 m 2 1 25 as the waves propagate over the slope the energy levels from the spectral peak region e 1 and low frequency range e 4 are slightly reduced due to wave shoaling and this energy is transferred to the above peak region e 2 as noticed by an increase in e 2 fig 7a the energy levels during the wave shoaling process in the higher frequency region e 3 and the significantly high frequency region e 5 remain almost constant after breaking the energy from the spectral peak region is significantly reduced 54 this is due to the energy dissipation during breaking and energy transfer towards e 2 and e 3 as noticed by the increase in their energy levels after breaking the energy levels in the significantly high frequency range e 5 are not affected much for case c4 a similar behaviour is observed fig 7b however the wave breaking occurs at larger water depths for this case due to which the energy dissipation from the spectral peak e 1 for case c4 occurs earlier and some of the energy is transferred to the higher frequencies in e 2 and e 3 3 2 3 free surface elevation skewness and spectral bandwidth the skewness and kurtosis of the free surface elevation η measures the deviation from the linear theory with reference to the mean η value the skewness β and kurtosis are defined respectively as goda 2010 19 β 1 η r m s 3 1 n i 1 n η i η 3 20 k u r t o s i s 1 η r m s 4 1 n i 1 n η i η 4 3 where η is the mean value and η r m s is the rms root mean square value the bandwidth of the spectrum ν quantifies the broadness or narrowness of the spectrum longuet higgins 1975 21 ν 2 m 0 m 2 m 1 2 1 where m n is the spectral moment defined as 22 m n 0 ω n s ω d ω n 0 1 2 fig 8 presents the distribution of the skewness β along the wave tank x l s for a cases a1 a4 with m 1 25 b cases b1 b4 with m 1 35 and c cases c1 c4 with m 1 45 in the order of the lower to the upper symbols in fig 8 an increase in β is observed in the shoaling zone and a decreasing trend is noticed inside the surf zone the surf zone starts from the location of wave breaking and extends till the beach the values of β for cases a4 s 0 0623 m 1 25 and c4 s 0 0623 m 1 45 are 0 87 and 0 84 respectively at the breaking point after breaking the skewness value is reduced to β 0 52 for case a4 and β 0 54 for case c4 fig 9 presents the distribution of the kurtosis along the wave tank x l s for a cases a1 a4 with m 1 25 b cases b1 b4 with m 1 35 and c cases c1 c4 with m 1 45 in the order of the lower to the upper symbols in fig 9 the changes in the skewness and kurtosis are mainly caused by the increasing contribution of the higher frequency wave components during the wave propagation over the slope the waves with a smaller value of s are relatively longer and interact more with the slope herbers et al 2002 the results are consistent with the findings reported by goda 2010 for a given wave steepness waves on a steeper slope have a slightly larger skewness and kurtosis compared to waves on a relatively milder slope however the incident wave steepness is found to be the major factor in estimating the skewness and kurtosis fig 10 presents the distribution of the normalized bandwidth ν ˆ over the distance along the wave tank x l s for a cases a1 a4 with m 1 25 b cases b1 b4 with m 1 35 and c cases c1 c4 with m 1 45 in the order of the lower to the upper symbols in fig 10 the bandwidth ν ˆ is normalized with the spectral bandwidth measured at the wave gauge located closest to the wave generation in general the spectral bandwidth increases with wave shoaling reaches its maximum value at the breaking point and then decreases after breaking for a given slope the maximum ν ˆ at breaking is larger for waves with a higher spectral wave steepness s the value of ν ˆ is 1 49 at the breaking point and reduces to 1 39 after breaking for case a4 for case a1 the value of ν ˆ becomes 1 44 at the breaking point and reduces to 1 17 after breaking for a given spectral wave steepness s the bandwidth increase is slightly larger for steeper seabed slopes compared to milder slopes the values of ν ˆ for cases a4 s 0 0623 m 1 25 and c4 s 0 0623 m 1 45 are 1 49 and 1 42 respectively at breaking it is also noticed from fig 10 that the bandwidth increase is higher for waves with larger values of s the increase in the spectral bandwidth is due to the growth of the higher frequency components and redistribution of energy across the wave spectrum via energy transfers as observed in fig 7 therefore the shoaling process leads to the widening of the wave spectrum i e energy transfer from the peak region to other frequency components after breaking the spectral bandwidth is reduced mainly due to the energy loss in the peak region during breaking these observations are consistent with the results reported by tian et al 2011 for breaking focused waves 3 3 individual wave breaking an irregular wave train is composed of regular wave components of different wave heights and periods the geometric criteria based on the wave slope limit are used to determine breaking waves kjeldsen and myrhaug 1978 bonmarin 1989 the percentage of total number of breaking waves in a given irregular wave train including breaking at all locations p b is defined as 23 p b n b n i 100 where n b is the total number of breaking waves in a given irregular wave train including breaking at all locations s and n i is the total number of incident waves in a given irregular wave train fig 11a shows the percentage of total number of breaking waves in a given irregular wave train including breaking at all locations p b versus the normalized simulation time t t p for a given seabed slope m 1 35 case b1 to b4 where t is the simulation time it is observed from fig 11a that p b for case b4 s 0 0623 has the highest value of 29 while for case b1 s 0 0142 this value is 21 the value of p b is larger for the higher spectral wave steepness at each value of the normalized time step t t p for a given slope however the difference in p b values until t t p 50 for the different wave steepness cases is very small the p b value increases sharply after t t p 50 for the wave spectra with the higher wave steepness s 0 0445 and 0 0623 in comparison to the low steepness cases the early wave breaking is induced for the higher wave steepnesses the individual waves possess higher incident wave heights and they break farther offshore the waves with lower wave steepness undergo more wave shoaling and wave deformation suggesting more onshore wave breaking for the case with the largest spectral wave steepness s and steepest slope m case a4 p b is largest 38 9 while for the case with the lowest s and lowest m case c1 p b is smallest 21 5 fig 11b shows p b versus s for different m as expected for a given steepness it appears that p b is larger for the steeper slope 3 4 breaking wave characteristics fig 12 presents the breaker depth index γ b fig 12a and the breaker height index ω b fig 12b versus the surf similarity parameter at breaking ξ b for cases a1 and c4 for case a1 s 0 0142 m 1 25 it is observed that the values of γ b and ω b decrease as ξ b increases and most of the waves break as plunging breakers when the slope is relatively steep m 1 25 the waves break farther offshore with lower h b and with more reflections from the slope for ξ b 0 4 an expected overall range as per the model given by ostendorf and madsen 1979 for γ b is between 0 3 and 2 0 most of the γ b values are in this range as shown in fig 12a the values lower than this range might indicate steepness limited breaking due to wave wave interactions such as overtaking and or reflection while the values higher than this range might be due to the coincidence of a reflected wave trough and an incident wave crest as it nears incipient breaking which would shift the onset of breaking of the incident wave into shallower water the low frequency waves propagate faster and experience more reflections from the slope according to battjes 1974 the reflection coefficient is directly proportional to ξ b 2 the plunging breakers experience more reflections due to larger ξ b 2 only few waves have a value of more than 1 for ω b case a1 which means that only few waves grow more than h s o during the shoaling process and have a breaking height h b higher than h s o in the irregular wave train for case c4 s 0 0623 m 1 45 the trend of γ b increases and ω b decreases as ξ b increases here all the waves break as spilling breakers and have values for ω b lower than 1 which means that none of the waves in the irregular wave train have a higher h b than h s o during the shoaling process the spilling breakers experience less reflections due to lower ξ b 2 on a relatively milder slope the waves break more onshore at shallower water depths and experience more deformation the wave spectra with larger spectral wave steepness s on milder slopes undergo less deformation hajime and kirby 1992 specifically for the irregular wave train dominated by plunging breakers the breaking is also affected by their interaction with the slope in order to investigate the statistics of the breaker indices the cumulative distribution functions cdf for both breaker indices γ b and ω b are analysed figs 13 and 14 present the cumulative distribution functions cdf for the normalized breaker indices γ b ˆ and ω ˆ b respectively for cases a1 and c4 the breaker indices are normalized with their corresponding rms values two different distributions the weibull distribution and the lognormal distribution are tested the lognormal probability density function pdf is given by 24 p x 1 x σ l 2 π e x p ln x μ l 2 2 σ l 2 where μ l and σ l represent the log mean and log standard deviation of x respectively the best fit values of μ l and σ l for γ b ˆ and ω ˆ b are given in table a 1 the weibull pdf is given by 25 p x b a x a b 1 e x p x a b where b is the shape parameter and a is the scale parameter the best fit values of a and b for γ b ˆ and ω ˆ b are presented in table a 1 figs 13a and 13b indicate that the lognormal distribution is more appropriate for the breaker depth index γ b ˆ due to a better fit with the numerical data compared to the weibull distribution for both cases spilling and plunging breakers cases c4 and a1 this is also obvious by comparing the log likelihood l l values in table a 1 i e the l l values can be used to compare the best fit between two distributions a relatively higher or smaller negative l l value gives a better distribution fit for the data kececioglu 1993 the normalized breaker height index ω ˆ b follows the trend similar to γ b ˆ for case a1 fig 14a the lognormal distribution gives the best fit in case of the irregular wave train dominated by the plunging breakers case a1 for case c4 spilling breakers the weibull distribution is more appropriate as suggested by a better fit to the numerical data fig 14b see table a 1 3 5 geometric properties of wave profile at breaking during the breaking process the waves become more steep and asymmetric the present study further investigates the geometric properties of the wave profile at breaking by using the steepness and asymmetry parameters fig 15 defined by kjeldsen and myrhaug 1978 3 5 1 study of the breaker shape with the surf similarity parameter at breaking the variation of different steepness and asymmetry parameters of the wave crest with the surf similarity parameter at breaking ξ b is investigated here figs 16a 16b 16c and 16d present the crest front wave steepness ε the crest rear wave steepness δ the horizontal asymmetry factor μ and the vertical asymmetry factor λ respectively versus the surf similarity parameter at breaking ξ b for cases a1 and c4 the crest front steepness ε values decrease in general as ξ b increases for both cases a1 and c4 figs 16a and 16b the values of ε for case c4 are slightly larger as compared to case a1 which is dominated by plunging breakers the crest rear steepness δ decrease slightly as ξ b increases for both case a1 dominated by plunging breakers and case c4 spilling breakers the present findings are consistent with the results for breaking regular waves over slopes by alagan chella et al 2015 however some scatter is observed in the values of the breaker shape parameters this could be due to wave wave interactions and the superimposition of the reflected waves with the incident waves the wave crest becomes more steep and skewed when the irregular wave train propagates over milder slopes for spilling breakers compared to steeper slopes for plunging breakers the low frequency waves long waves propagate faster and undergo more deformation in case of the high frequency shorter waves waves they interact less with the slope and the wave crest becomes relatively less deformed the present results further confirm the findings for spilling breakers by lader 2002 it is noticed from figs 16c and 16d that μ and λ increase slightly as ξ b increases for both cases a1 and c4 for the spilling breaker the front and rear faces of the wave crest become steeper with a gradual slight increase of the vertical asymmetry and the forward wave trough flattens at wave breaking for the plunging breaker the front face of the wave crest becomes very steep without much change in the rear face of the wave crest due to more offshore wave breaking and undergoes less deformation 3 5 2 statistics for breaker shape parameters figs 17 and 18 present the cdfs for the normalized crest front steepness ε ˆ and the normalized crest rear steepness δ ˆ for cases a1 and c4 i e ε and δ are normalized with their rms values ε r m s and δ r m s respectively figs 17a and 17b indicate that the lognormal distribution gives the best fit for ε ˆ for cases a1 and the weibull distribution is better suited for case c4 spilling breaker the weibull and lognormal parameters as well as the l l values for ε ˆ and δ ˆ are given in table a 1 for the crest rear steepness δ ˆ the lognormal distribution is more appropriate and fits the numerical data in a satisfactory manner for both cases a1 and c4 as observed in fig 18 myrhaug and kjeldsen 1984 reported that the weibull distribution is the best fit for the normalized crest front steepness for the given field data in deep water this suggests that the crest front steepness follows different distributions in deep and shallow water which can be attributed to the wave transformations originated by the changing water depths close to the coasts fig 19 presents the cdfs for the normalized vertical asymmetry factor λ ˆ for cases a1 and c4 where λ is normalized with the rms value λ r m s the lognormal distribution is better suited for λ ˆ for case a1 plunging breaker and the weibull distribution is better suited for case c4 spilling breaker as seen in fig 19 for the normalized horizontal asymmetry factor μ ˆ none of the distributions give a good fit therefore the figures are not presented here myrhaug and kjeldsen 1984 reported that the lognormal distribution gives the best fit for the normalized vertical asymmetry factor for deep water waves measured in the field according to peregrine et al 1980 the water accelerations exceed the acceleration of gravity g in a thin region on the front face of the wave up to about 5 g in the subsequent development of the overturning wave crest the region on and beneath the rear slope of the wave has low fluid accelerations this region ensures that the high pressure gradients and wave asymmetry required to produce the acceleration near the wave crest front can exist the wave crest and asymmetry parameters in combination with the breaker indices which gives information about h b and d b are important in describing the rough sea state they can further be used to assess the probability of occurrence of steep and asymmetric waves in shallow water the different combinations of the wave crest parameters suggest different sea states table 2 myrhaug and kjeldsen 1984 1986 it could be important for the coastal and naval engineers for the performance and reliability analysis of coastal structures and ships under severe sea conditions ploeg 1982 4 conclusions a two phase cfd model is used to investigate some unexplored aspects of breaking irregular waves over sloping seabeds the numerical model is first validated for modelling of breaking irregular waves over a submerged bar by comparing with the beji and battjes 1993 experimental data at different wave gauge locations along the wave tank during the complex wave transformation processes involving wave shoaling and wave breaking an extensive numerical analysis is performed to study breaking irregular waves over slopes using the setup similar to ting and kirby 1996 the investigation is carried out for multiple incident irregular wave trains propagating over different slopes the wave breaking process is initiated by an increase of wave crest height which is followed by an overturning motion of the jet resulting in the downward directed motion of the water jet with an enclosed air pocket first the energy transfer from the spectral peak region towards higher frequencies is investigated and its role in influencing the free surface elevation skewness and spectral bandwidth during wave shoaling and wave breaking processes is also highlighted the incident wave parameters and sloping sea bed play major roles in affecting the breaking wave characteristics and wave crest geometric parameters the wave crest deformation is mainly affected by the length and steepness of the slope the waves with larger incident wave steepness undergo less deformation due to farther offshore wave breaking at larger water depths further cumulative distribution fits are estimated for breaker indices and wave crest geometric parameters the following conclusions can be drawn from the study as expected the percentage of breaking waves in the irregular wave train increases as the spectral wave steepness or the steepness of the slope over which the waves are propagating increases 39 of the wave components in the steepest incident irregular wave train s 0 0623 break during the propagation over the steepest slope m 1 25 most of these waves break farther offshore at larger water depths the non linear energy transfer from the spectral peak region f f p 0 9 1 1 to the above peak region f f p 1 2 1 5 and higher frequency region f f p 1 5 2 5 during the wave transformation process governs the changes in free surface elevation skewness and spectral bandwidth the waves with lower incident spectral wave steepness tend to have a higher skewness value after breaking the bandwidth of the wave spectrum increases until wave breaking and decreases after breaking the bandwidth is mainly affected by the incident irregular wave parameters rather than the seabed slope for a steeper seabed slope m 1 25 most of the waves in the wave spectrum with the lower spectral wave steepness break as plunging breakers for the wave spectrum with a higher spectral wave steepness propagating over milder slopes m 1 45 the number of waves breaking as spilling breakers increases for the irregular waves with a lower spectral wave steepness s 0 0267 propagating over a steep seabed slope m 1 25 few waves in the irregular wave train exceed h s o during the shoaling process and have a breaking height h b higher than h s o for the incident wave spectrum with a larger spectral steepness s 0 0623 over a milder slope m 1 45 none of the waves in the irregular wave train have a higher h b than h s o during the shoaling process the weibull and lognormal distributions can be used to predict the statistics of the breaker height and the breaker depth indices respectively the crest front wave and crest rear wave steepnesses decrease as the surf similarity parameter increases at breaking the steepness of the forward face of the wave crest increases as the waves approach the shore the wave crest becomes more steep and skewed when the irregular wave train propagates over milder slopes for spilling breakers as compared to steeper slopes for plunging breakers the low frequency waves long waves propagate faster and undergo more deformation in case of the high frequency shorter waves they interact less with the slope and the wave crest becomes relatively less deformed in general the lognormal

21500,the present study numerically investigates the breaking and spectral characteristics and geometric properties of breaking irregular waves over slopes for different incident waves the growth of wave non linearity and wave energy redistribution during shoaling and breaking process are observed to be major factors in determining the free surface elevation skewness and spectral bandwidth in general the variation of the breaker indices with the surf similarity parameter is found to be mainly governed by the type of wave breakers the wave breaker type further depends on the seabed slope incident wave parameters and water depth at the location of wave breaking the study further explores the geometric properties for both spilling and plunging irregular wave breakers the wave deformation due to wave seabed interaction plays a major role in affecting the breaker shapes every individual breaking wave in the irregular wave train possesses different wave profiles and breaker characteristics in order to study these parameters in a probabilistic way the statistics of the breaker characteristics and the breaker shape parameters are investigated the lognormal distribution is noticed to be the most suitable fit for the wave crest steepness and asymmetry factors this study is performed using the open source computational fluid dynamics cfd based numerical model the numerical model is validated for a submerged bar under breaking irregular waves and the numerical results are compared with experimental data the transformations of the free surface elevation due to wave shoaling wave breaking and wave decomposition are explored keywords geometric properties irregular wave breaking wave deformation submerged bar 1 introduction during the last few decades considerable efforts have been made to study wave breaking in the coastal regions wave breaking primarily governs the various hydrodynamic processes in the surf zone like destabilization of the sea bed wave setup and wave energy dissipation a lot of research has been dedicated in the past towards the wave hydrodynamics investigation of breaking regular waves goda 1970 hwang 1984 weggel 1972 camenen and larson 2007 their studies revealed many important parameters to quantify and understand the regular wave breaking process however the study of breaking regular waves is not sufficient to describe and investigate the real sea state the real sea state is highly irregular and composed of many harmonic wave components in contrast to regular waves there is no well defined breaking point for irregular waves the breaking location is different for each individual wave component depending on the individual wave steepness therefore the energy dissipation of irregular waves occurs over a larger surf zone area in comparison to regular waves the breaker type also varies for each wave component of an irregular wave train the breaking characteristics and the geometric properties of discrete breaking events in the irregular wave train are distinct from each other due to the different amplitudes and frequencies the hydrodynamics of breaking irregular waves are still not fully understood and are relatively uncertain when the beach slope is constant the temporal and spatial variability of wave breaking should solely depend on the incident wave spectrum ting 2001 some researchers have attempted to investigate the individual wave breaking frequency and statistics of breaking irregular waves a field study was conducted by thorpe and humphries 1980 to study the relationship between the mean frequency of wave breaking at a fixed point and the average distance between irregular breaking waves the wavelet method has been used analytically to determine and quantify the breaking statistics by mori and yasuda 1994 and liu 2000 their study revealed that the surface jumps associated with the breaking waves can be well detected in the wavelet spectra ochi et al 1996 investigated the joint probability distribution of wave excursion and the associated time interval of non narrow banded random process they showed that the breaking probability depends on the shape of the wave spectrum for deep water waves seyama and kimura 1988 measured the properties of breaking irregular waves over a slope they concluded that the shoaling property of zero down cross waves can be approximated by linear wave theory also the wave properties during the breaking process and after breaking differ considerably from those for periodic waves beji and battjes 1993 studied the irregular wave propagation over a submerged bar experimentally and further investigated wave breaking and wave shoaling under irregular waves for different spectral wave steepnesses ting 2001 explored the wave and turbulence characteristics of broad and narrow banded irregular waves over a sloping sea bed they also reported the probability distributions for the wave height and peak velocities for the breaking irregular waves kjeldsen and myrhaug 1978 conducted a study to investigate the geometric properties of breaking waves a wave crest deformation can be observed both horizontally and vertically at the onset of wave breaking several numerical and analytical studies have been performed to investigate breaking regular waves the numerical studies of non linear surface waves have been conducted in the past by using potential flow theory watson and west 1975 longuet higgins and cokelet 1976 chen et al 1999 reported that this approach is unable to capture the complete breaking process accurately the assumptions in the potential flow theory are valid up to the breaking point these assumptions become invalid at the onset of wave breaking the detailed information about the flow properties for the free surface flows can be computed by computational fluid dynamics cfd in order to capture the complete breaking process cfd can be used without defining any empirical breaking criterion explicitly a number of cfd investigations have been carried out to study breaking regular waves lin and liu 1998 bradford 2000 the turbulence scales in their simulations were represented with the turbulence models many studies were also performed using two phase models to investigate breaking waves since two phase models give a more realistic representation of the wave breaking process hieu et al 2004 garcia et al 2004 christensen 2006 lara et al 2006 the detailed reviews on the previous work with cfd modelling for breaking waves can be found in lara et al 2006 bradford 2000 and hieu et al 2004 alagan chella et al 2015 2016 studied the breaking characteristics and geometric properties of breaking regular waves over slopes using a cfd based model they compared the numerical results with experimental data by ting and kirby 1996 the numerical results showed good agreement with the experimental data for free surface elevation horizontal and vertical velocities and turbulent kinetic energy paulsen et al 2013 simulated non breaking irregular waves using cfd to study the wave loads on monopile structures however there is limited literature available for breaking irregular waves propagating over slopes in shallow waters there are only a few studies performed in the past to investigate the transformations in the parameters like free surface elevation skewness spectral bandwidth breaking characteristics and geometric wave profile properties during the breaking process for irregular waves in shallow water over slopes due to the complex phenomena involved during wave breaking most of the studies involving breaking irregular waves are limited to field and laboratory experiments already developed and tested approaches like cfd modelling can be used to investigate these less explored aspects of breaking irregular waves over slopes the objective of the present paper is to numerically investigate breaking irregular waves over slopes in the time and frequency domains and to analyse the transformations in the free surface elevation skewness spectral bandwidth breaking characteristics and wave crest profile during the wave propagation over slopes the previous studies related to breaking irregular waves in shallow water have not been focused on addressing these aspects in detail the breaking characteristics of irregular waves are relatively complex to study as there is no clearly defined breaking point and no clear distinction between the different breaker types the regular wave breaking characteristics have been relatively well studied in the past alagan chella et al 2015 2016 the present study includes the investigation of the breaking and spectral characteristics of irregular waves the energy transfer from the spectral peak region towards higher frequencies during the wave shoaling and wave breaking processes is quantified by using the method used by tian et al 2011 for breaking focused wave groups further the analysis of the geometric properties of irregular wave breakers is performed for different breaker types to explore the role of seabed slope and incident wave parameters in the wave breaking process many numerical and experimental studies have been carried out in the past to study the geometric properties of regular breaking waves but only a few studies exist which have addressed the geometric properties of irregular wave breakers to the best of the authors knowledge the present study is the first attempt to investigate these parameters for breaking irregular waves over slopes the numerical simulations are conducted using a cfd based two phase numerical model reef3d bihs et al 2016 bihs and kamath 2017 this model has been successfully used to investigate different coastal and marine engineering problems afzal et al 2015 ong et al 2017 aggarwal et al 2019a b 2020 afzal et al 2020 the numerical model employs higher order numerical schemes capable of capturing the complete breaking process the validation for modelling of breaking irregular waves is performed by comparing the numerical results for breaking irregular waves over a submerged bar with the experiments performed by beji and battjes 1993 during the complex transformation processes like wave shoaling and wave breaking next the propagation of irregular breaking waves over sloping seabeds is investigated the wave energy transfer from the spectral peak region towards the different frequency ranges breaking wave statistics and the changes in free surface elevation skewness and spectral bandwidth during the breaking process are studied in detail an extensive analysis to explore the breaking wave characteristics and the geometric properties for different cases is performed the wave crest steepness and asymmetry parameters are examined in order to understand the influence of water depth and incident wave steepness in determining the deformation in the wave crest the statistics of breaking wave characteristics and geometric properties of the breakers are also analysed and discussed to quantify these parameters 2 numerical model 2 1 governing equations the present study is performed using a cfd based numerical model reef3d bihs et al 2016 bihs and kamath 2017 the reynolds averaged navier stokes equations rans are defined with the assumption of an incompressible fluid the momentum conservation equation together with the continuity equation define the navier stokes equations 1 u i x i 0 2 u i t u j u i x j 1 ρ p x i x j ν ν t u i x j u j x i g i where u is the

integrated conjugate gradient solver preconditioned with geometric multigrid falgout and yang 2002 the fifth order finite difference weighted essentially non oscillatory weno scheme in multi space dimensions is utilized in the present study jiang and shu 1996 the third order tvd runge kutta scheme is applied for the time discretization shu and oscher 1988 the viscous terms are source term dependent and result in very low cfl numbers when discretized explicitly in order to avoid this the viscous terms are treated with an implicit method to take it out of the cfl criterion adaptive time stepping is used in order to control the time step size based on the cfl number griebel et al 1998 the numerical model utilizes a cartesian grid in order to use higher order discretization schemes the

to capture the free surface the level set function gives the closest distance to the interface and the two phases are distinguished by the change of the sign the function can be written as 7 ϕ x t 0 i f x is in phase 1 0 i f x is at the interface 0 i f x is in phase 2 2 2 irregular wave generation the relaxation method is utilized for the wave generation and absorption mayer et al 1998 the values for the velocities and the free surface are ramped up from the computational values to the ones obtained from wave theory also the reflected waves which travel back towards the inlet are absorbed with this method a numerical beach is needed at the end of the wave flume in order to dissipate waves and avoid reflections in the relaxation method a smooth transition is made from the computational solution to the still water conditions the irregular waves are composed of the super positioning of regular wave components the first order irregular waves are generated by summation of the linear regular waves components the free surface η is defined as 8 η i 1 n a i c o s θ i 9 a i 2 s ω i δ ω i 10 θ i k i x ω i t ϵ i 11 ω i 2 g k i tanh k i h where n is the number of components a i is the amplitude of each wave component s ω i is the spectral density and θ i is the phase ϵ i is a random number rectangularly distributed between 0 and 2 π ω i is the angular frequency λ i is the wavelength and k i is the wave number k i 2 π λ i similarly the wave induced horizontal velocity u and the wave induced vertical velocity w are computed as the sum of the individual u and w components in the irregular wave train the second order irregular wave theory given by dalzell 1999 which takes into account the second order wave wave interaction is used for the higher spectral wave steepness cases 12 η η 1 η 2 u u 1 u 2 w w 1 w 2 where η 1 u 1 and w 1 represent the first order components and η 2 u 2 and w 2 represent the second order components the details of the second order irregular wave theory can be found in dalzell 1999 in the present study the joint north sea wave project jonswap spectrum is used for the generation of irregular waves hasselmann et al 1980 the waves propagating close to the coast are usually fetch limited and are never fully developed the required significant wave height h s the peak angular frequency ω p and number of components n are given as

breaking irregular waves over an impermeable submerged bar by comparing the numerical results with the experiments by beji and battjes 1993 in the experimental setup the length of the wave flume is 37 70 m the width is 0 8 m and the height is 0 75 m the still water level over the horizontal bottom is d 0 4 m in the experiments a piston type wavemaker was used for generating irregular waves based on the jonswap spectrum a submerged trapezoidal bar with a weather side slope of 1 20 and a 2 m long horizontal crest followed by a 1 10 lee side slope was installed at a distance of x 6 m from the wavemaker eight wave gauges were installed along the length of the wave flume in the experimental setup to measure the free surface elevation a two dimensional numerical wave tank is used to simulate the experiments described above the numerical setup including the wave gauge locations is illustrated in fig 1 the numerical tests are performed for the grid convergence study with input h s 0 054 m and the spectral peak period t p 2 π ω p 2 5 s for four different uniform grid sizes d x 0 10 m 0 05 m 0 01 m and 0 005 m for the wave gauge located at x 11 m fig 2 presents the comparison of experimental and numerical spectral wave density at x 11 m with d x 0 10 m total number of mesh elements 3440 0 05 m total number of mesh elements 13760 d x 0 01 m total number of mesh elements 344000 and d x 0 005 m total number of mesh elements 1 38 million the wall time simulation time is around 3 h with d x 0 10 m 12 h with d x 0 05 m 120 h for case with d x 0 01 m and 230 h for case with d x 0 005 m the simulations are performed to obtain 200 s of the flow data furthermore 128 processors are used for the present simulations the computations are conducted on the supercomputer which is based on the intel xeon e5 2670 processor with 2 6 ghz speed and a memory of 2 gb per core the present simulations employ the cartesian grid approach which means that the grid size is uniform in both directions for a 2d wave tank dx dy the spectral densities s η are normalized by the total spectral density at wg1 x 6 m it is observed that the numerical results with d x 0 10 m and 0 05 m underestimate the peak spectral density by 45 and 26 respectively also the spectral density in the higher frequency range 0 75 hz 2 0 hz is not correctly represented this is due to the insufficient number of cells per wavelength the difference between the peak experimental and numerical spectral wave density reduces to 3 and the spectral wave density at all frequencies is represented with a reasonable accuracy with d x 0 01 m and 0 005 m the increase in accuracy on changing d x from 0 01 m to 0 005 m is not very significant but the computational costs increase by almost a factor of 2 thus d x 0 01 m is chosen for the further simulations the reduction in the spectral density is due to the loss of energy during the wave breaking process for the wave gauges located on the downslope a large reduction in incident spectral density is observed because most of the waves in the irregular wave train have already broken and a large amount of the wave energy has already been dissipated during the breaking and redistributed during the wave decomposition process fig 3 presents the comparison of s η for the wave surface elevations at the six different wave gauge locations x 11 m 12 m 13 m 15 m 16 m and 17 m with d x 0 01 m correlation coefficient r van loco et al 2002 is also calculated to compare numerical and experimental spectral wave densities r can have a maximum value of 1 and it would mean a perfect correlation the spectral peak and energy distributions are well represented for wg2 at x 11 m with r 0 997 fig 3a a major portion of the spectral density lies between the frequency range from 0 to 1 5 hz at x 12 m wg3 the still water depth is reduced to its minimum value resulting in further shoaling and the value of r is 0 993 fig 3b the peak value of the spectrum is slightly reduced and the wave spectrum becomes broader 0 hz to 2 hz as compared to the spectrum for the previous wave gauge location 0 hz to 1 7 hz this is due the increasing contribution of the wave energy of the shorter waves as can be expected during the shoaling process this observation is consistent with the experiments fig 3c shows the results at x 13 m wg4 and has r 0 992 at this location many waves in the wave train have already broken and the peak of the spectrum is further reduced the contribution of wave energy towards higher frequencies is further increased the wave gauge located at x 15 m wg6 on the lee side slope of the bar indicates further reduction of the spectrum with energy transfer towards higher frequencies with r 0 995 fig 3d this is caused by the wave decomposition process attributed to the increasing water depth on the lee side of the slope kamath et al 2017 the waves are decomposed into secondary and tertiary components visible through the multiple peaks at the higher frequencies in the wave spectrum the total energy spectral density of the wave train is also considerably reduced figs 3e with r 0 993 and 3f with r 0 992 the redistribution of the wave energy takes place and the energy from the primary peak is transferred towards the secondary and tertiary peaks at the higher frequencies the size of the sampling interval for fft and the spectral smoothening process might be the reason for some irregularities in the wave spectra 3 breaking irregular waves over impermeable slopes alagan chella et al 2015 2016 have performed a numerical study on the breaking of regular waves and compared their numerical results with the experiments by ting and kirby 1996 the present investigation focuses on breaking irregular waves over slopes the setup used in the present study is similar to that of ting and kirby 1996 the spectral wave steepness s for the irregular waves is defined as 14 s 2 π h s o g t p 2 where h s o is the offshore significant wave height and t p is the spectral peak period the breaking of regular waves can be defined by four types spilling plunging collapsing and surging depending on the surf similarity parameter the surf similarity parameter at breaking ξ b is a function of the wave steepness at breaking s b and the slope of the seabed m battjes 1974 15 ξ b m s b s b 2 π h b g t 2 16 ξ b 0 4 spilling 0 4 ξ b 2 0 plunging ξ b 2 0 surging or collapsing the spectral surf similarity parameter ξ is defined as a function of the spectral wave steepness s and the slope of the seabed m 17 ξ m s the breaker depth index γ b and breaker height index ω b are two parameters used to investigate the breaking characteristics of waves they are defined as 18 γ b h b d b ω b h b h s o where d b is the depth at breaking t is the zero crossing period of individual waves at breaking h b is the local wave height at breaking and h s o is the offshore significant wave height kjeldsen and myrhaug 1978 defined the steepness and asymmetry parameters for the local wave crest asymmetry at breaking the wave crest front steepness ε the wave crest rear steepness δ the horizontal asymmetry factor μ and the vertical asymmetry factor λ the present study uses these steepness and asymmetry parameters to study the geometric properties of breaking irregular waves over different slopes 3 1 computational setup and test cases the two dimensional numerical wave tank is 20 5 m long and 1 m high as shown in fig 4 the water depth is d 0 4 m the wave breaking is prominently influenced by the spectral steepness of the incident wave spectrum and the slope of the seabed the numerical simulations are performed for three different seabed slopes m 1 25 1 35 and 1 45 wave spectra with four different wave steepnesses s 0 0142 0 0267 0 0445 and 0 0623 are tested on each slope therefore an investigation of 12 different cases in total is performed table 1 all simulations are run for t 200 s with the number of wave components n 499 nine wave gauges are placed along the numerical wave tank the distance of the wave gauge x is measured from the toe of the slope fig 4 for m 1 35 the locations of the wave gauges are changed with each change in slope i e becoming more crowded together for the 1 25 slope and l s is the length of the slope which shortens and is different with the increasing slope value m occurrence of wave breaking changes in the spectral characteristics and the wave transformations are analysed and presented for all 12 cases further the study investigates the energy level evolution the breaker characteristics and the geometric properties of breaking irregular waves over slopes in order to demonstrate the effect of environmental parameters on the breaking characteristics two different scenarios are presented in more detail the wave spectrum with lower spectral steepness on a steeper slope case a1 and the wave spectrum with higher spectral steepness on a milder slope case c4 3 2 wave transformation 3 2 1 irregular wave breaking process when the irregular wave train approaches the shore the wave height wave length and the energy content of each wave component change as the water depth decreases the wave length becomes shorter as the wave height and wave energy increase due to the shoaling process this process continues until the fluid particle velocity exceeds the wave crest velocity which leads to wave breaking fig 5 presents the computed free surface profile with velocity variations during the wave propagation over the slope at t 52 7 s 52 9 s 53 05 s 53 2 s 53 27 s and 53 39 s respectively when the waves propagate over the slope they undergo shoaling which is observed by the increase in wave crest heights as the waves propagate further over the slope the main wave crest becomes almost vertical which denotes the onset of wave breaking as can be seen in fig 5a the wave breaking is embarked by the small water jet at the wave crest the profile of the wave crest becomes highly deformed and asymmetric when the fluid particle velocity at the wave crest exceeds the wave celerity an over turning motion of the wave crest is induced fig 5b the overturning wave crest breaks with an encasement of an air pocket fig 5c referred to as the splash up phenomenon and generates another small jet of water in the downstream direction figs 5d 5e 5f the results for the wave profile deformation during the breaking process are consistent with previous studies lubin et al 2006 christensen 2006 alagan chella et al 2016 fig 6 presents the distribution of the normalized significant wave height h s h s o versus the normalized distance along the wave tank x l s for a cases a1 a4 with m 1 25 b cases b1 b4 with m 1 35 and c cases c1 c4 with m 1 45 where l s is the length of the slope in the order of the lower to the upper symbols in fig 6 for a given slope the waves with lower spectral wave steepness s undergo more shoaling and have a higher value of h s h s o in the breaking zone compared to the waves with higher spectral wave steepness s for case a4 s 0 0623 m 1 25 the wave height becomes 1 29 h s o in contrast to case a1 where the wave height is 1 37 h s o in the breaking zone as expected the wave breaking zone around which most of the waves in the irregular wave train break i e x l s shifts farther offshore as the spectral wave steepness increases for a given slope the waves with larger s lose most of the incident wave energy when they reach shallower water depths due to the breaking at relatively deeper depths the waves with lower s contain relatively more energy when they approach shallower water depths and thus a higher value of h s h s o in comparison with the waves with larger s and the breaking zone is relatively more onshore 3 2 2 energy level evolution this section demonstrates the energy transfer between the different frequency ranges of the wave spectrum by tracking the wave energy levels at different frequency ranges during the wave shoaling and wave breaking processes five different frequency ranges of the wave spectrum are considered spectral peak region f f p 0 9 1 1 e 1 above peak region f f p 1 2 1 5 e 2 higher frequency region f f p 1 5 2 5 e 3 low frequency range 0 5 0 9 e 4 significantly high frequency region 2 5 5 e 5 and total energy e e 1 e 2 e 3 e 4 e 5 this is similar to the methodology used by tian et al 2011 to investigate the energy transfer for breaking focused wave groups these energy levels are non dimensionalized with the total incident wave energy e 0 m fig 7 presents the variation of the energy levels at different frequency ranges versus the normalized distance in the nwt for case a1 s 0 0142 m 2 1 25 as the waves propagate over the slope the energy levels from the spectral peak region e 1 and low frequency range e 4 are slightly reduced due to wave shoaling and this energy is transferred to the above peak region e 2 as noticed by an increase in e 2 fig 7a the energy levels during the wave shoaling process in the higher frequency region e 3 and the significantly high frequency region e 5 remain almost constant after breaking the energy from the spectral peak region is significantly reduced 54 this is due to the energy dissipation during breaking and energy transfer towards e 2 and e 3 as noticed by the increase in their energy levels after breaking the energy levels in the significantly high frequency range e 5 are not affected much for case c4 a similar behaviour is observed fig 7b however the wave breaking occurs at larger water depths for this case due to which the energy dissipation from the spectral peak e 1 for case c4 occurs earlier and some of the energy is transferred to the higher frequencies in e 2 and e 3 3 2 3 free surface elevation skewness and spectral bandwidth the skewness and kurtosis of the free surface elevation η measures the deviation from the linear theory with reference to the mean η value the skewness β and kurtosis are defined respectively as goda 2010 19 β 1 η r m s 3 1 n i 1 n η i η 3 20 k u r t o s i s 1 η r m s 4 1 n i 1 n η i η 4 3 where η is the mean value and η r m s is the rms root mean square value the bandwidth of the spectrum ν quantifies the broadness or narrowness of the spectrum longuet higgins 1975 21 ν 2 m 0 m 2 m 1 2 1 where m n is the spectral moment defined as 22 m n 0 ω n s ω d ω n 0 1 2 fig 8 presents the distribution of the skewness β along the wave tank x l s for a cases a1 a4 with m 1 25 b cases b1 b4 with m 1 35 and c cases c1 c4 with m 1 45 in the order of the lower to the upper symbols in fig 8 an increase in β is observed in the shoaling zone and a decreasing trend is noticed inside the surf zone the surf zone starts from the location of wave breaking and extends till the beach the values of β for cases a4 s 0 0623 m 1 25 and c4 s 0 0623 m 1 45 are 0 87 and 0 84 respectively at the breaking point after breaking the skewness value is reduced to β 0 52 for case a4 and β 0 54 for case c4 fig 9 presents the distribution of the kurtosis along the wave tank x l s for a cases a1 a4 with m 1 25 b cases b1 b4 with m 1 35 and c cases c1 c4 with m 1 45 in the order of the lower to the upper symbols in fig 9 the changes in the skewness and kurtosis are mainly caused by the increasing contribution of the higher frequency wave components during the wave propagation over the slope the waves with a smaller value of s are relatively longer and interact more with the slope herbers et al 2002 the results are consistent with the findings reported by goda 2010 for a given wave steepness waves on a steeper slope have a slightly larger skewness and kurtosis compared to waves on a relatively milder slope however the incident wave steepness is found to be the major factor in estimating the skewness and kurtosis fig 10 presents the distribution of the normalized bandwidth ν ˆ over the distance along the wave tank x l s for a cases a1 a4 with m 1 25 b cases b1 b4 with m 1 35 and c cases c1 c4 with m 1 45 in the order of the lower to the upper symbols in fig 10 the bandwidth ν ˆ is normalized with the spectral bandwidth measured at the wave gauge located closest to the wave generation in general the spectral bandwidth increases with wave shoaling reaches its maximum value at the breaking point and then decreases after breaking for a given slope the maximum ν ˆ at breaking is larger for waves with a higher spectral wave steepness s the value of ν ˆ is 1 49 at the breaking point and reduces to 1 39 after breaking for case a4 for case a1 the value of ν ˆ becomes 1 44 at the breaking point and reduces to 1 17 after breaking for a given spectral wave steepness s the bandwidth increase is slightly larger for steeper seabed slopes compared to milder slopes the values of ν ˆ for cases a4 s 0 0623 m 1 25 and c4 s 0 0623 m 1 45 are 1 49 and 1 42 respectively at breaking it is also noticed from fig 10 that the bandwidth increase is higher for waves with larger values of s the increase in the spectral bandwidth is due to the growth of the higher frequency components and redistribution of energy across the wave spectrum via energy transfers as observed in fig 7 therefore the shoaling process leads to the widening of the wave spectrum i e energy transfer from the peak region to other frequency components after breaking the spectral bandwidth is reduced mainly due to the energy loss in the peak region during breaking these observations are consistent with the results reported by tian et al 2011 for breaking focused waves 3 3 individual wave breaking an irregular wave train is composed of regular wave components of different wave heights and periods the geometric criteria based on the wave slope limit are used to determine breaking waves kjeldsen and myrhaug 1978 bonmarin 1989 the percentage of total number of breaking waves in a given irregular wave train including breaking at all locations p b is defined as 23 p b n b n i 100 where n b is the total number of breaking waves in a given irregular wave train including breaking at all locations s and n i is the total number of incident waves in a given irregular wave train fig 11a shows the percentage of total number of breaking waves in a given irregular wave train including breaking at all locations p b versus the normalized simulation time t t p for a given seabed slope m 1 35 case b1 to b4 where t is the simulation time it is observed from fig 11a that p b for case b4 s 0 0623 has the highest value of 29 while for case b1 s 0 0142 this value is 21 the value of p b is larger for the higher spectral wave steepness at each value of the normalized time step t t p for a given slope however the difference in p b values until t t p 50 for the different wave steepness cases is very small the p b value increases sharply after t t p 50 for the wave spectra with the higher wave steepness s 0 0445 and 0 0623 in comparison to the low steepness cases the early wave breaking is induced for the higher wave steepnesses the individual waves possess higher incident wave heights and they break farther offshore the waves with lower wave steepness undergo more wave shoaling and wave deformation suggesting more onshore wave breaking for the case with the largest spectral wave steepness s and steepest slope m case a4 p b is largest 38 9 while for the case with the lowest s and lowest m case c1 p b is smallest 21 5 fig 11b shows p b versus s for different m as expected for a given steepness it appears that p b is larger for the steeper slope 3 4 breaking wave characteristics fig 12 presents the breaker depth index γ b fig 12a and the breaker height index ω b fig 12b versus the surf similarity parameter at breaking ξ b for cases a1 and c4 for case a1 s 0 0142 m 1 25 it is observed that the values of γ b and ω b decrease as ξ b increases and most of the waves break as plunging breakers when the slope is relatively steep m 1 25 the waves break farther offshore with lower h b and with more reflections from the slope for ξ b 0 4 an expected overall range as per the model given by ostendorf and madsen 1979 for γ b is between 0 3 and 2 0 most of the γ b values are in this range as shown in fig 12a the values lower than this range might indicate steepness limited breaking due to wave wave interactions such as overtaking and or reflection while the values higher than this range might be due to the coincidence of a reflected wave trough and an incident wave crest as it nears incipient breaking which would shift the onset of breaking of the incident wave into shallower water the low frequency waves propagate faster and experience more reflections from the slope according to battjes 1974 the reflection coefficient is directly proportional to ξ b 2 the plunging breakers experience more reflections due to larger ξ b 2 only few waves have a value of more than 1 for ω b case a1 which means that only few waves grow more than h s o during the shoaling process and have a breaking height h b higher than h s o in the irregular wave train for case c4 s 0 0623 m 1 45 the trend of γ b increases and ω b decreases as ξ b increases here all the waves break as spilling breakers and have values for ω b lower than 1 which means that none of the waves in the irregular wave train have a higher h b than h s o during the shoaling process the spilling breakers experience less reflections due to lower ξ b 2 on a relatively milder slope the waves break more onshore at shallower water depths and experience more deformation the wave spectra with larger spectral wave steepness s on milder slopes undergo less deformation hajime and kirby 1992 specifically for the irregular wave train dominated by plunging breakers the breaking is also affected by their interaction with the slope in order to investigate the statistics of the breaker indices the cumulative distribution functions cdf for both breaker indices γ b and ω b are analysed figs 13 and 14 present the cumulative distribution functions cdf for the normalized breaker indices γ b ˆ and ω ˆ b respectively for cases a1 and c4 the breaker indices are normalized with their corresponding rms values two different distributions the weibull distribution and the lognormal distribution are tested the lognormal probability density function pdf is given by 24 p x 1 x σ l 2 π e x p ln x μ l 2 2 σ l 2 where μ l and σ l represent the log mean and log standard deviation of x respectively the best fit values of μ l and σ l for γ b ˆ and ω ˆ b are given in table a 1 the weibull pdf is given by 25 p x b a x a b 1 e x p x a b where b is the shape parameter and a is the scale parameter the best fit values of a and b for γ b ˆ and ω ˆ b are presented in table a 1 figs 13a and 13b indicate that the lognormal distribution is more appropriate for the breaker depth index γ b ˆ due to a better fit with the numerical data compared to the weibull distribution for both cases spilling and plunging breakers cases c4 and a1 this is also obvious by comparing the log likelihood l l values in table a 1 i e the l l values can be used to compare the best fit between two distributions a relatively higher or smaller negative l l value gives a better distribution fit for the data kececioglu 1993 the normalized breaker height index ω ˆ b follows the trend similar to γ b ˆ for case a1 fig 14a the lognormal distribution gives the best fit in case of the irregular wave train dominated by the plunging breakers case a1 for case c4 spilling breakers the weibull distribution is more appropriate as suggested by a better fit to the numerical data fig 14b see table a 1 3 5 geometric properties of wave profile at breaking during the breaking process the waves become more steep and asymmetric the present study further investigates the geometric properties of the wave profile at breaking by using the steepness and asymmetry parameters fig 15 defined by kjeldsen and myrhaug 1978 3 5 1 study of the breaker shape with the surf similarity parameter at breaking the variation of different steepness and asymmetry parameters of the wave crest with the surf similarity parameter at breaking ξ b is investigated here figs 16a 16b 16c and 16d present the crest front wave steepness ε the crest rear wave steepness δ the horizontal asymmetry factor μ and the vertical asymmetry factor λ respectively versus the surf similarity parameter at breaking ξ b for cases a1 and c4 the crest front steepness ε values decrease in general as ξ b increases for both cases a1 and c4 figs 16a and 16b the values of ε for case c4 are slightly larger as compared to case a1 which is dominated by plunging breakers the crest rear steepness δ decrease slightly as ξ b increases for both case a1 dominated by plunging breakers and case c4 spilling breakers the present findings are consistent with the results for breaking regular waves over slopes by alagan chella et al 2015 however some scatter is observed in the values of the breaker shape parameters this could be due to wave wave interactions and the superimposition of the reflected waves with the incident waves the wave crest becomes more steep and skewed when the irregular wave train propagates over milder slopes for spilling breakers compared to steeper slopes for plunging breakers the low frequency waves long waves propagate faster and undergo more deformation in case of the high frequency shorter waves waves they interact less with the slope and the wave crest becomes relatively less deformed the present results further confirm the findings for spilling breakers by lader 2002 it is noticed from figs 16c and 16d that μ and λ increase slightly as ξ b increases for both cases a1 and c4 for the spilling breaker the front and rear faces of the wave crest become steeper with a gradual slight increase of the vertical asymmetry and the forward wave trough flattens at wave breaking for the plunging breaker the front face of the wave crest becomes very steep without much change in the rear face of the wave crest due to more offshore wave breaking and undergoes less deformation 3 5 2 statistics for breaker shape parameters figs 17 and 18 present the cdfs for the normalized crest front steepness ε ˆ and the normalized crest rear steepness δ ˆ for cases a1 and c4 i e ε and δ are normalized with their rms values ε r m s and δ r m s respectively figs 17a and 17b indicate that the lognormal distribution gives the best fit for ε ˆ for cases a1 and the weibull distribution is better suited for case c4 spilling breaker the weibull and lognormal parameters as well as the l l values for ε ˆ and δ ˆ are given in table a 1 for the crest rear steepness δ ˆ the lognormal distribution is more appropriate and fits the numerical data in a satisfactory manner for both cases a1 and c4 as observed in fig 18 myrhaug and kjeldsen 1984 reported that the weibull distribution is the best fit for the normalized crest front steepness for the given field data in deep water this suggests that the crest front steepness follows different distributions in deep and shallow water which can be attributed to the wave transformations originated by the changing water depths close to the coasts fig 19 presents the cdfs for the normalized vertical asymmetry factor λ ˆ for cases a1 and c4 where λ is normalized with the rms value λ r m s the lognormal distribution is better suited for λ ˆ for case a1 plunging breaker and the weibull distribution is better suited for case c4 spilling breaker as seen in fig 19 for the normalized horizontal asymmetry factor μ ˆ none of the distributions give a good fit therefore the figures are not presented here myrhaug and kjeldsen 1984 reported that the lognormal distribution gives the best fit for the normalized vertical asymmetry factor for deep water waves measured in the field according to peregrine et al 1980 the water accelerations exceed the acceleration of gravity g in a thin region on the front face of the wave up to about 5 g in the subsequent development of the overturning wave crest the region on and beneath the rear slope of the wave has low fluid accelerations this region ensures that the high pressure gradients and wave asymmetry required to produce the acceleration near the wave crest front can exist the wave crest and asymmetry parameters in combination with the breaker indices which gives information about h b and d b are important in describing the rough sea state they can further be used to assess the probability of occurrence of steep and asymmetric waves in shallow water the different combinations of the wave crest parameters suggest different sea states table 2 myrhaug and kjeldsen 1984 1986 it could be important for the coastal and naval engineers for the performance and reliability analysis of coastal structures and ships under severe sea conditions ploeg 1982 4 conclusions a two phase cfd model is used to investigate some unexplored aspects of breaking irregular waves over sloping seabeds the numerical model is first validated for modelling of breaking irregular waves over a submerged bar by comparing with the beji and battjes 1993 experimental data at different wave gauge locations along the wave tank during the complex wave transformation processes involving wave shoaling and wave breaking an extensive numerical analysis is performed to study breaking irregular waves over slopes using the setup similar to ting and kirby 1996 the investigation is carried out for multiple incident irregular wave trains propagating over different slopes the wave breaking process is initiated by an increase of wave crest height which is followed by an overturning motion of the jet resulting in the downward directed motion of the water jet with an enclosed air pocket first the energy transfer from the spectral peak region towards higher frequencies is investigated and its role in influencing the free surface elevation skewness and spectral bandwidth during wave shoaling and wave breaking processes is also highlighted the incident wave parameters and sloping sea bed play major roles in affecting the breaking wave characteristics and wave crest geometric parameters the wave crest deformation is mainly affected by the length and steepness of the slope the waves with larger incident wave steepness undergo less deformation due to farther offshore wave breaking at larger water depths further cumulative distribution fits are estimated for breaker indices and wave crest geometric parameters the following conclusions can be drawn from the study as expected the percentage of breaking waves in the irregular wave train increases as the spectral wave steepness or the steepness of the slope over which the waves are propagating increases 39 of the wave components in the steepest incident irregular wave train s 0 0623 break during the propagation over the steepest slope m 1 25 most of these waves break farther offshore at larger water depths the non linear energy transfer from the spectral peak region f f p 0 9 1 1 to the above peak region f f p 1 2 1 5 and higher frequency region f f p 1 5 2 5 during the wave transformation process governs the changes in free surface elevation skewness and spectral bandwidth the waves with lower incident spectral wave steepness tend to have a higher skewness value after breaking the bandwidth of the wave spectrum increases until wave breaking and decreases after breaking the bandwidth is mainly affected by the incident irregular wave parameters rather than the seabed slope for a steeper seabed slope m 1 25 most of the waves in the wave spectrum with the lower spectral wave steepness break as plunging breakers for the wave spectrum with a higher spectral wave steepness propagating over milder slopes m 1 45 the number of waves breaking as spilling breakers increases for the irregular waves with a lower spectral wave steepness s 0 0267 propagating over a steep seabed slope m 1 25 few waves in the irregular wave train exceed h s o during the shoaling process and have a breaking height h b higher than h s o for the incident wave spectrum with a larger spectral steepness s 0 0623 over a milder slope m 1 45 none of the waves in the irregular wave train have a higher h b than h s o during the shoaling process the weibull and lognormal distributions can be used to predict the statistics of the breaker height and the breaker depth indices respectively the crest front wave and crest rear wave steepnesses decrease as the surf similarity parameter increases at breaking the steepness of the forward face of the wave crest increases as the waves approach the shore the wave crest becomes more steep and skewed when the irregular wave train propagates over milder slopes for spilling breakers as compared to steeper slopes for plunging breakers the low frequency waves long waves propagate faster and undergo more deformation in case of the high frequency shorter waves they interact less with the slope and the wave crest becomes relatively less deformed in general the lognormal

21501,operation and maintenance o m costs account for a large proportion of the total costs for offshore wind energy performing a reasonable maintenance strategy is an effective approach to reduce o m costs and gain more profits in this paper an opportunistic maintenance strategy for offshore wind turbine systems considering maintenance intervals of each subsystem is proposed to minimize the total maintenance cost first a non homogeneous continuous time markov process based state transition model is established to study degradation process of subsystems the influence of maintenance time schedule on the maintenance cost is studied to obtain the optimal maintenance intervals of each subsystems then an opportunistic maintenance model considering economic dependencies between multiple subsystems is proposed to optimize the maintenance strategy by combining maintenance activities of individual subsystems to a grouping maintenance activity a numerical example is used to indicate the significant effectiveness of the maintenance model the result shows that the total maintenance cost of an offshore wind turbine system will be reduced by adopting the opportunistic maintenance strategy when compared with conventional preventive maintenance strategy keywords offshore wind energy operation and maintenance maintenance optimization cost effective maintenance 1 introduction limited fossil fuel capacity and global greenhouse gas emission have become critical issues as one of the effective solutions for global warming and environmental pollution the development of renewable energy is attracting significant attention from many countries compared with biofuel water power geothermal heat and solar energy wind energy trends to be the most widely explored renewable energy resource in the near future furthermore with advantages of higher wind speed steadier wind supply and unlimited installation space fan et al 2019 offshore wind energy is showing its enormous potential especially when populations keep rising and land becomes scarcer offshore wind turbines owt operate in the complicated environment and suffer from the harsh marine conditions including waves weather winds water currents sea ice and salt fog kaldellis et al 2016 under which they face more severe risk events and degrade to break down with more probabilities shafiee 2015 adopted a fuzzy analytic network process fanp approach to evaluate the most effective risk mitigation strategy for offshore wind farms the study concluded that the improvement of maintenance activities is the most suitable solution of reducing the risks related with offshore wind farms feng et al 2019 and ren et al 2019 discussed how to reduce risks and optimize reliability for complicated systems in dynamic environments and a case study of an offshore wind farm was presented moreover lin et al 2020 proposed that the o m cost can contribute more than 30 of the total life cycle cost for offshore wind farms once the maintenance strategy is unreasonable a negative influence on the reliability and performance of the offshore wind farm will be caused resulting in lower wind power output and unnecessary maintenance costs for improving reliability of owts and reducing the o m costs it is necessary to provide an appropriate maintenance strategy for owts the existing maintenance strategies for owts can be generally categorized into two types namely corrective maintenance cm and preventive maintenance pm cm can be also called reactive maintenance only performs after failures occur during operation time aiming to restore or recover operation conditions zhong et al 2019 pm is carried out under given intervals or based on certain criterion like the age of turbines or schedule of operation irawan et al 2017 compared with cm although pm has the advantages of effectively guaranteeing the system reliability and power output but unnecessary inspection and maintenance activities for owts cannot be avoided nguyen and chou 2018 until now cm and pm are still the major maintenance strategies in offshore wind industrial practice but based on these two maintenance strategies more maintenance strategies have been developed in recent years such as condition based maintenance cbm and opportunistic maintenance due to rapid development of continuous monitoring and inspection techniques cbm has received increasing attention in the o m field of offshore wind systems based on health states and degradation process of equipment which are reflected by recorded data from condition monitoring systems the potential failure occurrences can be predicted thus maintenance performance can be scheduled in advance zhao et al 2019 as a maintenance strategy which depends on combining data driven methods with condition monitoring systems installed on owts alaswad and xiang 2017 cbm is showing its potential at aspects of reducing failure times during operation improving reliability of systems decreasing maintenance costs garcãŋa mãąrquez et al 2012 generally maintenance activities are considered to be in conflict with production operations colledani and tolio 2012 in fact although preventive maintenance can slow down the equipment degradation and reduce the need for complex and expensive corrective actions it shows a negative impact on the availability of equipment among preventive maintenance strategies opportunistic maintenance is an effective method to reduce the impact of maintenance operations in multi stage manufacturing systems iung et al 2007 mccall 1963 firstly introduced the concept of opportunistic maintenance which is an effective strategy to reduce the interference between maintenance and production operations in a multi component manufacturing system according to this strategy due to the dynamic behavior of the system preventive maintenance tasks should be performed when a suitable window of opportunity is available opportunity windows are defined as specific time intervals generated by favorable system conditions where preventive maintenance tasks can be performed by taking advantage of these opportunity windows the coordination between production and maintenance operations can be better achieved thereby reducing the impact of maintenance on system performance compared with the conventional scheduled maintenance strategy the opportunity maintenance strategy can save more maintenance costs the reason is that the opportunity maintenance strategy can repair multiple components in a single dispatch so it has obvious advantages in saving fixed maintenance costs this strategy sets the concept of maintenance opportunities that is a single repair activity to repair multiple equipment satisfying maintenance conditions and requirements under this premise only one maintenance activity is needed and a single fixed maintenance cost is generated to conduct the replacement and maintenance activities of multiple components therefore the opportunity maintenance strategy can avoid unnecessary costs making maintenance costs more reasonable the optimization of maintenance strategies for multi unit systems is usually more complicated than single unit systems shafiee and finkelstein 2015 the reason is that dependencies among units should be taken into consideration dependencies can be categorized into three types economic dekker et al 1996 structural sasieni 1956 and stochastic nakagawa and m d n 1993 as a typical multi component system which are composed of many subsystems owts also have these dependencies implying it is inevitable to consider these dependencies when optimizing maintenance strategies erguido et al 2017 in an offshore wind farm if a failure takes place on one turbine a maintenance team will set out to perform maintenance gutierrez alcoba et al 2019 the advantage of opportunistic maintenance is taking this opportunity to simultaneously repair other deteriorated components meeting maintenance conditions in this failed turbines or other operating ones eryilmaz 2018 obviously economic dependencies exist among these components and turbines in comparison with sending teams to repair single components in one single maintenance activity opportunistic maintenance policies can save a large amount of substantial cost eryilmaz and devrim 2019 yildirim et al 2017 studied the game between optimal maintenance schedule driven by real time sensor data and cost reduction brought by opportunistic maintenance zhang et al 2017 proposed an opportunistic maintenance model for wind turbines meanwhile reliability based imperfect maintenance is taken into account considered three types of maintenance including perfect imperfect and two level action to develop an opportunistic maintenance policy for wind farms ding and tian 2012 considered three types of maintenance including perfect imperfect and two level action to develop an opportunistic maintenance policy for wind farms abdollahzadeh et al 2016 optimized opportunistic maintenance for a wind farm under the situation that number of maintenance team is limited maximizing the production rates and reducing the total expected maintenance costs as low as possible are both objectives during optimization in the literature zhou and yin 2019 by analyzing condition monitoring data by an artificial neural network ann model life percentages of components can be predicted then a dynamic opportunistic condition based maintenance strategy is proposed for offshore wind farms considering the economic dependencies most of the current om models use failure rates or failure distribution such as weibull distribution to illustrate the degradation process of complicated systems these conventional models have two discrete states namely functional and failure however the binary state model is insufficient to describe multi state degradation systems which are wide spread in practice actually subsystems of owt can consecutively degrade into several operation and failure states meaning they can be assumed as multi state systems and operation performance decreases as working time goes on the markov process is a common method to analyze reliability of multi state degraded system liu et al 2015 azadeh et al 2015 hou et al 2016 proposed a continuous time markov chain based sequential analytical approach to evaluate reliability of composite power system ye et al 2019 proposed a mixed integer nonlinear programming minlp model where system failures and maintenance are considered as a continuous time markov chain then the inspection and repair tasks are optimized in terms of both time and money when paying attention to issues about reliability analysis and maintenance of wind energy markov process also demonstrates excellent capacity and potential besnard and bertling 2010 adopted a continuous time markov chain to model the deterioration process of wind turbine blades hence condition based maintenance strategies could be optimized according to the degradation status li et al 2019 improved a hidden markov model considering performance degradation in order to realize the reliability analysis of wind turbine bearing byon and ding 2010 adopted a markov model to show the aging behavior of wind turbines then studied the effect of weather failure modes imperfect or perfect repairs and revenue losses on maintenance effort and chose the most cost efficient maintenance scheduling huang et al 2017 presented a markov chain based availability model to evaluate mean availability of owts and finally found correlation between logistic activities maintenance investment and owt availability according to the literature when developing degradation models of wind turbines components the state transition rates are usually assumed to be constant indicating that these transition rates will not change as the time goes by but the systems may degenerate in a continuous manner in the practical situations so the state transition rates are continuous time hence a continuous time markov model should be adopted to describe how offshore wind turbine components will degrade during operation the study about degradation processes and maintenance strategies for owts are not sufficient enough according to the literature reviewed in order to optimize maintenance strategy for owts the turbine is always simplified as a system with critical components such as gearbox generator rotor and bearing indicating the influences of other components or subsystems and their mutual dependencies have to be neglected to some degree moreover aiming to study working states of components or subsystems markov models are usually adopted to describe the degradation processes the conventional markov models only use constant transition rates to establish the state transition processes which is obviously not reasonable enough because the states of subsystems should be dynamic and state transition rates are time dependent finally when optimizing om strategy for offshore wind systems the current study usually adopted failure rates or weibull models to determine failure events of subsystems this assumption is not convincing enough especially for owts this kind of complex multi state degraded system the objective of this study is to propose an optimal om strategy for owt systems following the criteria of minimizing the total maintenance cost first the entire owt system is separated into seven subsystems namely drivetrain electrical system generator rotor blade rotor hub control and yaw system to preserve integrity of the system as much as possible second in order to study deterioration of each subsystem more accurately the non homogeneous continuous time markov process nhctmp model is established to illustrate degradation processes then a recursion algorithm is used to efficiently calculate the time dependent state distribution of the multi state system using these state transition probabilities the optimal maintenance schedule for each subsystem can be determined thereby minimizing the expected maintenance cost per unit time eventually an om strategy is integrated and developed in owt level considering maintenance activities of each subsystems achieving the goal of reducing the total cost of maintenance to the lowest the remainder of the paper is listed as follows section 2 is devoted to the non homogeneous continuous time markov process which can illustrate degradation processes of these subsystems section 3 proposes an opportunistic maintenance strategy considering economic dependence among subsystems section 4 makes a brief introduction of offshore wind turbine system and applied case study in section 5 calculation results and analysis are presented finally conclusions and future works are presented in section 6 2 non homogeneous continuous time markov process there are several operation states corresponding to different working efficiency for subsystems of owt degradation caused by harsh marine environment leads to a decrease of system condition markov theory can be employed to analyze degradation problem of such multi state systems based on the conventional markov theory the concept of time change is introduced to develop markov process in this paper the subsystems of owt have several separate states which are defined as from perfect states to ultimate failure state the degradation process of multi state system is modeled as a non homogeneous continuous time markov chain by solving chapman kolmogorov equation the time dependent state probability can be obtained in terms of these state probabilities the optimal age based replacement time and the minimum expected cost per unit time can be determined

suitable degradation model the reliability of the multi state system can be illustrated 2 2 1 system description in the process of degradation the performance rate decreases from the initial state to failure state multi state system has n 1 different operating states and gradually degraded from state 1 to n sudden failure will make the system transfer to state n 1 immediately the system starts working at time 0 in the initial perfect state and the interval between preventive maintenance is t meaning preventive maintenance will be regularly performed at time k t k 1 2 3 the time required for inspection is relatively short compared to the duration of maintenance so this period is negligible in this maintenance model the minimum repair will be carried out when sudden failure happens it can only restore the system to the working state before the sudden failure perfect preventive maintenance can repair the system to the initial operating state imperfect preventive maintenance can restore the system into the working state before the final failure state after a preventive maintenance cycle the system returns to its original state the diagram of the non homogeneous continuous time markov model is shown in fig 1 where the parameters are defined as s 1 is the initial perfect function state s i is the degradation states of the system where i 2 n 1 s n is the ultimate failure state after gradual degradation s n 1 is the state caused by sudden failure from any working state λ i j t is the transition rate from state i to j at time t where i j 1 2 n 1 and i j the chapman kolmogorov equation of the system which follows the non homogeneous continuous time markov process can be expressed as a matrix as 17 p 1 t p 2 t p n t p n 1 t p 1 t p 2 t p n t p n 1 t λ 1 1 t λ 1 2 t λ 1 n t λ

j t t s n 1 is the failure state and absorption state in the model the system will not change once it develops into s n 1 according to the markov theory the value of λ n 1 n 1 t is 0 sheu and zhang 2013 calculated the possibilities that the system is at different states at time t based on the state transition matrix 18 p 1 t exp 0 t λ 1 1 s d s 19 p j t i 1 j 1 0 t p i τ i λ i j τ i exp τ i t λ j j s d s d τ i 20 p n 1 t 1 j 1 n p j t at the initial time 0 p 1 0 1 because the system must be in complete perfect state and it is impossible to be in other states at the beginning the reliability function r t w of the system should be selected based on the state of the system 21 r t w pr g t w g t represents working efficiency of the system only when it is greater than w the system is considered to be reliable hence the reliability function is the sum of possibilities of each acceptable state the distribution function f t w is the sum of probabilities of all unacceptable states f t w is the probability density of failure state 22 f t w f t w t t j m 1 n 1 p j t further the failure rate of system can be calculated as 23 r t w f t w r t w t j m 1 n 1 p j t j 1 m p j t 2 2 2 state transition rates the time based state transition rate of the system is a function following weibull distribution 24 λ t i j t β α i j β t β 1 the scale and shape parameters are related to the degeneration coefficient of the objects the value of α i j should meet the following requirements that with the increase of operation time transient degradation rate should increase and the possibility of degrading to the distant state is less than to the recent state the scale parameter is assumed to be iscioglu 2017 shu et al 2010 25 α i j 1 5 i 0 5 5 j because the state transition rates should also be related to m t t f so 26 λ i j t λ t i j t 1 m t t f i j based on the characteristics of markov matrix 27 λ i i t j i 1 6 λ i j t in the state classification state 5 is the ultimate failure state after degradation process and state 6 is the failure state after sudden failure which cannot meet the production requirements states from 1 to 4 are acceptable working states therefore reliability function r t w failure function f t w probability density function f t w and failure rate function r t w are obtained 2 2 3 maintenance cost rate calculation in the whole maintenance scheduling the total number of preventive maintenance before the final perfect maintenance is set as n and p k is the possibility that the first k preventive maintenance is imperfect n k then the probability that the k th repair is an imperfect repair is p k p k 1 the probability that the k th repair is perfect is sheu et al 2019 28 θ k 1 p k p k 1 in the model u k 1 is the effective life of the equipment after the k 1 th imperfect repair and a k 1 is the service life improvement factor after each imperfect repair with each maintenance the service life improvement factor will gradually weaken duan et al 2018 and 29 a k i 1 k 1 l i k 1 a l after kth imperfect repair the effective age becomes u k a k 1 u k 1 t a k 1 t the failure rate in the kth circle will be r k t w r a k 1 u k 1 s w and 0 s t p k is the probability that the first k preventive maintenances are imperfect preventive maintenance the probability of each imperfect preventive maintenance is a constant value q hence the probability of each imperfect maintenance is q the value of p k 1 decreases with the increase of k so p k is q k according to sheu et al 2015 the value of service age improvement factor a k can be obtained as k 5 k 1 the cost of perfect preventive maintenance imperfect preventive maintenance and minimum maintenance is c p m c i m and c m i n respectively and the fixed cost of each maintenance is c 0 then these expenses constitute the total maintenance cost of the system the maintenance costs of the k th maintenance scheduling can be obtained and maintenance cost rates can be calculated as 30 m t w p k k 1 p k 1 p k k 1 p k 1 p k k t c total 31 c total k 1 c im c 0 c p m c 0 c m i m c 0 0 t r k s w d s where r i t w r a i 1 u i 1 s w and 0 s t 3 opportunistic maintenance model based on the non homogeneous continuous time markov process the degradation processes of each subsystem have been analyzed and the optimal maintenance intervals have been proposed next multiple individual components will be studied as the whole system and the opportunistic maintenance can be modeled to achieve the optimization 3 1 model description when establishing an opportunistic maintenance model for a multi component system the following assumptions need to be set 1 a multi component system is composed of a number of mutually independent components the number of components is set to n 2 when the state of the component reaches a preset reliability threshold preventive maintenance operations can be performed on the component so that maintenance can be performed in advance to avoid failure 3 if the component fails before preventive maintenance then corrective maintenance measures need to be taken to return the component to normal working condition and this maintenance activity will not change the failure rate of the component when the preventive maintenance operation is completed the equipment will enter another circle of degradation process 4 when entering the opportunity maintenance phase each component under maintenance is assumed to share the same downtime and downtime loss based on the above assumptions an opportunistic maintenance model for a complex system with multiple components is established in the process of maintenance perfect repair and imperfect repair are mainly involved when perfect repair is performed the system will return to the original perfect state again and the operation life regression factor α i 0 so n i j 1 t n i j t n i j t is the failure rate function of component i before the j th preventive maintenance when imperfect repair is performed the multi component system cannot return to the original perfect state the failure rate function of component i before and after the j th preventive maintenance can be expressed as n i j 1 t n i j t α δ t i j δ t i j represents the j th preventive maintenance cycle of component i based on the previous assumptions a certain reliability threshold is set for the component in advance once the component i reaches the threshold r a preventive maintenance circle is taken so 32 0 δ t i 1 n i 1 t d t 0 δ t i j n i j t d t n f i the meaning of 0 δ t i j n i j t d t is the cumulative failure risk of component i during the j th preventive maintenance cycle in this case the number of accidental failures and the number of repairs in the model are actually the same in the total time the expected repair cost of the component i is 33 e c i c 0 c m i n f i c p i c d i τ i j δ t i j τ i j where c 0 represents the fixed cost δ t i j represents the preventive maintenance time period of component i τ i j is the time consumed for this preventive maintenance c m i is the maintenance cost required for accidental failure c p i and c d i are the cost of a preventive maintenance for component i and the economic loss due to equipment shutdown per unit time respectively 3 2 model establishment suppose t i j is the operation time of component i at the j th preventive maintenance and δ t i j the time period of preventive maintenance then t i j can be expressed as t i 1 t b e g i n δ t i 1 and 34 t i j t i j 1 δ t i j 1 τ i j 1 j 1 t b e g i n is the start time of maintenance and under the normal situation the value is 0 the time of each preventive repair of the multi component system during the whole maintenance circle can be known for a complex system with n components when performing preventive maintenance on one of the components part i will get a chance to be repaired within the maintenance duration τ k j of part k if this opportunity is adopted at this time the maintenance cost is 35 c s i k j c 0 c d i k j c m i k j c p i k j where c d i k j represents the loss of equipment shutdown when component i and component k are being repaired at the same time which can be calculated by 36 c d i k j c d i τ k c m i k j means if the repair opportunity is performed on component i the avoided economic loss caused by accidental failure during the overall maintenance plan the maintenance time will be constantly updated assume δ t i j is the preventive maintenance time at the start time and δ t i j is the updated preventive maintenance time the total time deviation accumulated after such a long time is 37 δ t i k j 1 m δ t i j δ t i j m min n i n i where n i is the number of preventive maintenance in the initial scheduling n i indicates the number of preventive maintenance in the plan as the update changes at the beginning the component failure function n i j t and the updated component failure function n i j t can be calculated and the economic loss of component i after the opportunistic maintenance is 38 c p i k j e c i δ t i k e c i j 1 m δ t i j δ t i j it can be calculated that if the opportunistic maintenance strategy is adopted for component i and component k the maintenance cost can be reduced if c s i k j 0 it means that the opportunistic repair cannot save the maintenance cost it is not appropriate to take advanced maintenance for component i if c s i k j 0 it means that the opportunistic maintenance can reduce the maintenance cost and simultaneous repair measure should be adopted for component i and component k the next step is to analyze all the components in the multi component system as a whole calculate the maintenance cost of multiple opportunities for group maintenance and select the most economical maintenance solution assuming that the maintenance timing combination of the multi component system is set g there will be a subset g 1 g 2 g l at each maintenance time and 39 g p g q p q g 1 g 2 g l g when the number of components in a multi component system increases the subset in the set g will increase rapidly so that the number of maintenance grouping schemes that need to be considered is also increasing all maintenance combinations will be calculated and the cost balance will be obtained 40 c g l i g l c s i k j i k the cost balance of different combinations will be compared then the optimal opportunistic maintenance strategy is the combination with the largest cost savings 4 offshore wind turbine system and numerical example the strategy will be applied on an offshore wind turbine system on system level of owts the overall system can be divided into several subsystems based on the fault detection and fault isolation theory considering the detection time error detection and missed detection as well as fault trigger problems and system restart faults there are various criterion for separating system mãąrquez et al mãąrquez et al 2016 divided the wind turbine system into four major subsystems namely power train foundation and tower generator electrical and electronic components and blade system based on the logicality and integrity of fault tree method odgaard et al 2013 considered failures of wind turbine system level and divided the system into sensor subsystem actuator subsystem pitch subsystem drive train subsystem generator subsystem and converter subsystem in this paper in order to facilitate reliability analysis and maintenance planning optimization research the overall system is separated into multiple subsystems mainly considering the interconnection of the various subsystems and different types of maintenance activities the separation is based on the components function the specificity of maintenance requirement and maintenance strategy the owt system is separated into seven subsystems electrical subsystem drive train generator rotor blade rotor hub electrical control yaw subsystem it is noted that this work focus on the owt system including blades and nacelle therefore the tower and foundation are not considered the degradation process of subsystem is divided into several states which have been described in ossai et al 2016 life cycles of subsystems have been studied and aging components are more likely to fail due to stress induced damage or environmentally induced ruptures the risk of failure is expected to be different in different life cycle phases it is assumed that the subsystems of the owt follow the five life cycle phases introduction maturity ageing terminal failure the residence time between states is the value of m t t f i j 5 results due to the difference of the repair types we can determine that the minimum maintenance cost is less than the imperfect maintenance and the perfect maintenance which are summarized in table 1 model parameters in the model are listed in table 2 these data can be referred to le and andrews 2016 carroll et al 2016 the production loss per day due to maintenance is assumed to be 7500 euros 5 1 maintenance cost rate according to the model establishment and calculation in section 3 the maintenance cost rates of each subsystems can be obtained in fig 2 the curves representing the cost rates are illustrated the bottom of curves is the selection of optimal maintenance intervals it can be concluded that the optimal maintenance intervals for electrical system drive train generator rotor blade rotor hub electrical control yaw system are 3 9 years 2 7 years 4 2 years 3 8 years 2 3 years 4 1 years and 5 7 years respectively according to the optimal maintenance cost rate of each subsystem the maintenance cost per unit of time will rapidly decrease within the initial period of time and as the decline rate slows down to the lowest point of the curve it will then increase the lowest point of the maintenance cost curve is the optimal maintenance intervals in the maintenance strategy the results demonstrate that in the process of formulating a maintenance strategy the total maintenance cost will vary greatly with the maintenance interval when the maintenance interval is too short or too long the maintenance strategy is not economical due to excessive maintenance costs or excessive reduction in equipment reliability resulting in high maintenance costs from the curve in the figures it can be seen that the maintenance cost rate varies not so much during a period of time near the lowest point and this point is the most economical if the maintenance interval is set in this period of time after multiple rounds of preventive maintenance the total maintenance and operation cost is the most cost effective at the same time it can be noted that maintenance cost rates are different for various subsystems this is because the formulation of maintenance strategies involves many aspects including the cost of different types of maintenance different equipment failure rates diverse weibull distribution parameters etc which shows that different subsystems need to formulate corresponding repair plans according to their characteristics 5 2 maintenance schedule based on the degradation illustrated by non homogeneous continuous time markov process the calculation results are inputted to the opportunistic maintenance model for the owt system the simulation time is set to 10 years fig 3 shows the time of maintenance schedule the blue bars represent the performance of opportunistic maintenance and the red ones represent preventive maintenance it can be found that every opportunistic maintenance must be triggered by a preventive maintenance carried out at the same time the reason is only the preventive maintenance can bring an opportunity to conduct opportunistic maintenance on components satisfying repair requirements in table 3 the number of performed maintenance on each subsystem are presented the results show that drive train and rotor system are the components which need to be checked and repaired frequently hence these repair activities can provide many maintenance opportunities for other components nearly all of the maintenance performed on electrical system generator and yaw system are opportunistic maintenance indicating that the economic profits of opportunistic maintenance strategy are mainly generated from these three components detailed maintenance schedule times are listed in table 4 from component 1 to 7 means electrical system drive train generator rotor blade rotor hub electrical control yaw system respectively 5 3 cost reduction in order to illustrate the economic profits of the proposed method a comparison analysis is presented between individual maintenance and om table 5 shows that the opportunistic maintenance model can indeed reduce the overall cost by grouping various sub components for maintenance the maintenance cost will reduce from 1636 euros day to 1533 euros day and percentage reduction will be 6 3 5 4 comparison analysis in this section a comparison analysis between previous literature and current study will be performed nguyen and chou 2018 proposed an approach to determine the optimal maintenance schedules for offshore wind system by grouping maintenance activities of different component the maintenance cost can be minimized xie et al 2019 developed an effective opportunistic maintenance strategy to reduce the maintenance costs of offshore wind turbines in consideration of their accessibility atashgar and abdollahzadeh 2016 formulated a joint redundancy and imperfect block opportunistic maintenance optimization model for wind farms and minimizing maintenance costs is one of the objectives of the proposed model generally the proposed opportunistic model in this paper can reduce the maintenance costs although the cost saving is not as significant as some literature see table 6 it can be explained by the scale effect of the numerical model the better performance of opportunistic maintenance strategy can be achieved when the number of wind turbines is larger in this paper the proposed model is applied to an offshore wind turbines instead of a large scale offshore wind farm the reason is when the number of components considered increases the number of grouping combinations will also increase exponentially resulting in great difficulty in obtaining the optimal solution 6 conclusions in this paper we develop an opportunistic maintenance strategy for offshore wind turbines aiming to decrease maintenance costs as far as possible during life time as a typical multi component system the offshore wind turbine system can be separated into several subsystems which degrade with time going by in order to evaluate operation states of offshore wind turbines a non homogeneous continuous time markov process nhctmp is adopted to illustrate degradation processes of each subsystems following the markov process the economic parameters during maintenance schedules are taken into account hence the optimal maintenance intervals for each subsystems can be obtained following the objective to reduce maintenance cost when we pay attention to the economic dependencies among subsystems a large number of opportunities will be created during implementation of maintenance activities capturing these opportunities can effectively optimize maintenance strategies for offshore wind turbines for achieving the goal of reducing o m costs for offshore wind energy there are still many topics to be explored and completed in the future the maintenance activities cannot usually carried out without any block weather conditions availability of vessels or manpower accessibility of the locations these constraints can affect the implementation of maintenance scheduling in addition the maintenance strategy can also be updated from wind turbine level to wind farm level when considering these constraints indicating the model will be more complicated but also more practical the topics will be studied in the near future in order to apply theoretical maintenance models into realistic world credit authorship contribution statement mingxin li conceptualization methodology software formal

21501,operation and maintenance o m costs account for a large proportion of the total costs for offshore wind energy performing a reasonable maintenance strategy is an effective approach to reduce o m costs and gain more profits in this paper an opportunistic maintenance strategy for offshore wind turbine systems considering maintenance intervals of each subsystem is proposed to minimize the total maintenance cost first a non homogeneous continuous time markov process based state transition model is established to study degradation process of subsystems the influence of maintenance time schedule on the maintenance cost is studied to obtain the optimal maintenance intervals of each subsystems then an opportunistic maintenance model considering economic dependencies between multiple subsystems is proposed to optimize the maintenance strategy by combining maintenance activities of individual subsystems to a grouping maintenance activity a numerical example is used to indicate the significant effectiveness of the maintenance model the result shows that the total maintenance cost of an offshore wind turbine system will be reduced by adopting the opportunistic maintenance strategy when compared with conventional preventive maintenance strategy keywords offshore wind energy operation and maintenance maintenance optimization cost effective maintenance 1 introduction limited fossil fuel capacity and global greenhouse gas emission have become critical issues as one of the effective solutions for global warming and environmental pollution the development of renewable energy is attracting significant attention from many countries compared with biofuel water power geothermal heat and solar energy wind energy trends to be the most widely explored renewable energy resource in the near future furthermore with advantages of higher wind speed steadier wind supply and unlimited installation space fan et al 2019 offshore wind energy is showing its enormous potential especially when populations keep rising and land becomes scarcer offshore wind turbines owt operate in the complicated environment and suffer from the harsh marine conditions including waves weather winds water currents sea ice and salt fog kaldellis et al 2016 under which they face more severe risk events and degrade to break down with more probabilities shafiee 2015 adopted a fuzzy analytic network process fanp approach to evaluate the most effective risk mitigation strategy for offshore wind farms the study concluded that the improvement of maintenance activities is the most suitable solution of reducing the risks related with offshore wind farms feng et al 2019 and ren et al 2019 discussed how to reduce risks and optimize reliability for complicated systems in dynamic environments and a case study of an offshore wind farm was presented moreover lin et al 2020 proposed that the o m cost can contribute more than 30 of the total life cycle cost for offshore wind farms once the maintenance strategy is unreasonable a negative influence on the reliability and performance of the offshore wind farm will be caused resulting in lower wind power output and unnecessary maintenance costs for improving reliability of owts and reducing the o m costs it is necessary to provide an appropriate maintenance strategy for owts the existing maintenance strategies for owts can be generally categorized into two types namely corrective maintenance cm and preventive maintenance pm cm can be also called reactive maintenance only performs after failures occur during operation time aiming to restore or recover operation conditions zhong et al 2019 pm is carried out under given intervals or based on certain criterion like the age of turbines or schedule of operation irawan et al 2017 compared with cm although pm has the advantages of effectively guaranteeing the system reliability and power output but unnecessary inspection and maintenance activities for owts cannot be avoided nguyen and chou 2018 until now cm and pm are still the major maintenance strategies in offshore wind industrial practice but based on these two maintenance strategies more maintenance strategies have been developed in recent years such as condition based maintenance cbm and opportunistic maintenance due to rapid development of continuous monitoring and inspection techniques cbm has received increasing attention in the o m field of offshore wind systems based on health states and degradation process of equipment which are reflected by recorded data from condition monitoring systems the potential failure occurrences can be predicted thus maintenance performance can be scheduled in advance zhao et al 2019 as a maintenance strategy which depends on combining data driven methods with condition monitoring systems installed on owts alaswad and xiang 2017 cbm is showing its potential at aspects of reducing failure times during operation improving reliability of systems decreasing maintenance costs garcãŋa mãąrquez et al 2012 generally maintenance activities are considered to be in conflict with production operations colledani and tolio 2012 in fact although preventive maintenance can slow down the equipment degradation and reduce the need for complex and expensive corrective actions it shows a negative impact on the availability of equipment among preventive maintenance strategies opportunistic maintenance is an effective method to reduce the impact of maintenance operations in multi stage manufacturing systems iung et al 2007 mccall 1963 firstly introduced the concept of opportunistic maintenance which is an effective strategy to reduce the interference between maintenance and production operations in a multi component manufacturing system according to this strategy due to the dynamic behavior of the system preventive maintenance tasks should be performed when a suitable window of opportunity is available opportunity windows are defined as specific time intervals generated by favorable system conditions where preventive maintenance tasks can be performed by taking advantage of these opportunity windows the coordination between production and maintenance operations can be better achieved thereby reducing the impact of maintenance on system performance compared with the conventional scheduled maintenance strategy the opportunity maintenance strategy can save more maintenance costs the reason is that the opportunity maintenance strategy can repair multiple components in a single dispatch so it has obvious advantages in saving fixed maintenance costs this strategy sets the concept of maintenance opportunities that is a single repair activity to repair multiple equipment satisfying maintenance conditions and requirements under this premise only one maintenance activity is needed and a single fixed maintenance cost is generated to conduct the replacement and maintenance activities of multiple components therefore the opportunity maintenance strategy can avoid unnecessary costs making maintenance costs more reasonable the optimization of maintenance strategies for multi unit systems is usually more complicated than single unit systems shafiee and finkelstein 2015 the reason is that dependencies among units should be taken into consideration dependencies can be categorized into three types economic dekker et al 1996 structural sasieni 1956 and stochastic nakagawa and m d n 1993 as a typical multi component system which are composed of many subsystems owts also have these dependencies implying it is inevitable to consider these dependencies when optimizing maintenance strategies erguido et al 2017 in an offshore wind farm if a failure takes place on one turbine a maintenance team will set out to perform maintenance gutierrez alcoba et al 2019 the advantage of opportunistic maintenance is taking this opportunity to simultaneously repair other deteriorated components meeting maintenance conditions in this failed turbines or other operating ones eryilmaz 2018 obviously economic dependencies exist among these components and turbines in comparison with sending teams to repair single components in one single maintenance activity opportunistic maintenance policies can save a large amount of substantial cost eryilmaz and devrim 2019 yildirim et al 2017 studied the game between optimal maintenance schedule driven by real time sensor data and cost reduction brought by opportunistic maintenance zhang et al 2017 proposed an opportunistic maintenance model for wind turbines meanwhile reliability based imperfect maintenance is taken into account considered three types of maintenance including perfect imperfect and two level action to develop an opportunistic maintenance policy for wind farms ding and tian 2012 considered three types of maintenance including perfect imperfect and two level action to develop an opportunistic maintenance policy for wind farms abdollahzadeh et al 2016 optimized opportunistic maintenance for a wind farm under the situation that number of maintenance team is limited maximizing the production rates and reducing the total expected maintenance costs as low as possible are both objectives during optimization in the literature zhou and yin 2019 by analyzing condition monitoring data by an artificial neural network ann model life percentages of components can be predicted then a dynamic opportunistic condition based maintenance strategy is proposed for offshore wind farms considering the economic dependencies most of the current om models use failure rates or failure distribution such as weibull distribution to illustrate the degradation process of complicated systems these conventional models have two discrete states namely functional and failure however the binary state model is insufficient to describe multi state degradation systems which are wide spread in practice actually subsystems of owt can consecutively degrade into several operation and failure states meaning they can be assumed as multi state systems and operation performance decreases as working time goes on the markov process is a common method to analyze reliability of multi state degraded system liu et al 2015 azadeh et al 2015 hou et al 2016 proposed a continuous time markov chain based sequential analytical approach to evaluate reliability of composite power system ye et al 2019 proposed a mixed integer nonlinear programming minlp model where system failures and maintenance are considered as a continuous time markov chain then the inspection and repair tasks are optimized in terms of both time and money when paying attention to issues about reliability analysis and maintenance of wind energy markov process also demonstrates excellent capacity and potential besnard and bertling 2010 adopted a continuous time markov chain to model the deterioration process of wind turbine blades hence condition based maintenance strategies could be optimized according to the degradation status li et al 2019 improved a hidden markov model considering performance degradation in order to realize the reliability analysis of wind turbine bearing byon and ding 2010 adopted a markov model to show the aging behavior of wind turbines then studied the effect of weather failure modes imperfect or perfect repairs and revenue losses on maintenance effort and chose the most cost efficient maintenance scheduling huang et al 2017 presented a markov chain based availability model to evaluate mean availability of owts and finally found correlation between logistic activities maintenance investment and owt availability according to the literature when developing degradation models of wind turbines components the state transition rates are usually assumed to be constant indicating that these transition rates will not change as the time goes by but the systems may degenerate in a continuous manner in the practical situations so the state transition rates are continuous time hence a continuous time markov model should be adopted to describe how offshore wind turbine components will degrade during operation the study about degradation processes and maintenance strategies for owts are not sufficient enough according to the literature reviewed in order to optimize maintenance strategy for owts the turbine is always simplified as a system with critical components such as gearbox generator rotor and bearing indicating the influences of other components or subsystems and their mutual dependencies have to be neglected to some degree moreover aiming to study working states of components or subsystems markov models are usually adopted to describe the degradation processes the conventional markov models only use constant transition rates to establish the state transition processes which is obviously not reasonable enough because the states of subsystems should be dynamic and state transition rates are time dependent finally when optimizing om strategy for offshore wind systems the current study usually adopted failure rates or weibull models to determine failure events of subsystems this assumption is not convincing enough especially for owts this kind of complex multi state degraded system the objective of this study is to propose an optimal om strategy for owt systems following the criteria of minimizing the total maintenance cost first the entire owt system is separated into seven subsystems namely drivetrain electrical system generator rotor blade rotor hub control and yaw system to preserve integrity of the system as much as possible second in order to study deterioration of each subsystem more accurately the non homogeneous continuous time markov process nhctmp model is established to illustrate degradation processes then a recursion algorithm is used to efficiently calculate the time dependent state distribution of the multi state system using these state transition probabilities the optimal maintenance schedule for each subsystem can be determined thereby minimizing the expected maintenance cost per unit time eventually an om strategy is integrated and developed in owt level considering maintenance activities of each subsystems achieving the goal of reducing the total cost of maintenance to the lowest the remainder of the paper is listed as follows section 2 is devoted to the non homogeneous continuous time markov process which can illustrate degradation processes of these subsystems section 3 proposes an opportunistic maintenance strategy considering economic dependence among subsystems section 4 makes a brief introduction of offshore wind turbine system and applied case study in section 5 calculation results and analysis are presented finally conclusions and future works are presented in section 6 2 non homogeneous continuous time markov process there are several operation states corresponding to different working efficiency for subsystems of owt degradation caused by harsh marine environment leads to a decrease of system condition markov theory can be employed to analyze degradation problem of such multi state systems based on the conventional markov theory the concept of time change is introduced to develop markov process in this paper the subsystems of owt have several separate states which are defined as from perfect states to ultimate failure state the degradation process of multi state system is modeled as a non homogeneous continuous time markov chain by solving chapman kolmogorov equation the time dependent state probability can be obtained in terms of these state probabilities the optimal age based replacement time and the minimum expected cost per unit time can be determined

suitable degradation model the reliability of the multi state system can be illustrated 2 2 1 system description in the process of degradation the performance rate decreases from the initial state to failure state multi state system has n 1 different operating states and gradually degraded from state 1 to n sudden failure will make the system transfer to state n 1 immediately the system starts working at time 0 in the initial perfect state and the interval between preventive maintenance is t meaning preventive maintenance will be regularly performed at time k t k 1 2 3 the time required for inspection is relatively short compared to the duration of maintenance so this period is negligible in this maintenance model the minimum repair will be carried out when sudden failure happens it can only restore the system to the working state before the sudden failure perfect preventive maintenance can repair the system to the initial operating state imperfect preventive maintenance can restore the system into the working state before the final failure state after a preventive maintenance cycle the system returns to its original state the diagram of the non homogeneous continuous time markov model is shown in fig 1 where the parameters are defined as s 1 is the initial perfect function state s i is the degradation states of the system where i 2 n 1 s n is the ultimate failure state after gradual degradation s n 1 is the state caused by sudden failure from any working state λ i j t is the transition rate from state i to j at time t where i j 1 2 n 1 and i j the chapman kolmogorov equation of the system which follows the non homogeneous continuous time markov process can be expressed as a matrix as 17 p 1 t p 2 t p n t p n 1 t p 1 t p 2 t p n t p n 1 t λ 1 1 t λ 1 2 t λ 1 n t λ

j t t s n 1 is the failure state and absorption state in the model the system will not change once it develops into s n 1 according to the markov theory the value of λ n 1 n 1 t is 0 sheu and zhang 2013 calculated the possibilities that the system is at different states at time t based on the state transition matrix 18 p 1 t exp 0 t λ 1 1 s d s 19 p j t i 1 j 1 0 t p i τ i λ i j τ i exp τ i t λ j j s d s d τ i 20 p n 1 t 1 j 1 n p j t at the initial time 0 p 1 0 1 because the system must be in complete perfect state and it is impossible to be in other states at the beginning the reliability function r t w of the system should be selected based on the state of the system 21 r t w pr g t w g t represents working efficiency of the system only when it is greater than w the system is considered to be reliable hence the reliability function is the sum of possibilities of each acceptable state the distribution function f t w is the sum of probabilities of all unacceptable states f t w is the probability density of failure state 22 f t w f t w t t j m 1 n 1 p j t further the failure rate of system can be calculated as 23 r t w f t w r t w t j m 1 n 1 p j t j 1 m p j t 2 2 2 state transition rates the time based state transition rate of the system is a function following weibull distribution 24 λ t i j t β α i j β t β 1 the scale and shape parameters are related to the degeneration coefficient of the objects the value of α i j should meet the following requirements that with the increase of operation time transient degradation rate should increase and the possibility of degrading to the distant state is less than to the recent state the scale parameter is assumed to be iscioglu 2017 shu et al 2010 25 α i j 1 5 i 0 5 5 j because the state transition rates should also be related to m t t f so 26 λ i j t λ t i j t 1 m t t f i j based on the characteristics of markov matrix 27 λ i i t j i 1 6 λ i j t in the state classification state 5 is the ultimate failure state after degradation process and state 6 is the failure state after sudden failure which cannot meet the production requirements states from 1 to 4 are acceptable working states therefore reliability function r t w failure function f t w probability density function f t w and failure rate function r t w are obtained 2 2 3 maintenance cost rate calculation in the whole maintenance scheduling the total number of preventive maintenance before the final perfect maintenance is set as n and p k is the possibility that the first k preventive maintenance is imperfect n k then the probability that the k th repair is an imperfect repair is p k p k 1 the probability that the k th repair is perfect is sheu et al 2019 28 θ k 1 p k p k 1 in the model u k 1 is the effective life of the equipment after the k 1 th imperfect repair and a k 1 is the service life improvement factor after each imperfect repair with each maintenance the service life improvement factor will gradually weaken duan et al 2018 and 29 a k i 1 k 1 l i k 1 a l after kth imperfect repair the effective age becomes u k a k 1 u k 1 t a k 1 t the failure rate in the kth circle will be r k t w r a k 1 u k 1 s w and 0 s t p k is the probability that the first k preventive maintenances are imperfect preventive maintenance the probability of each imperfect preventive maintenance is a constant value q hence the probability of each imperfect maintenance is q the value of p k 1 decreases with the increase of k so p k is q k according to sheu et al 2015 the value of service age improvement factor a k can be obtained as k 5 k 1 the cost of perfect preventive maintenance imperfect preventive maintenance and minimum maintenance is c p m c i m and c m i n respectively and the fixed cost of each maintenance is c 0 then these expenses constitute the total maintenance cost of the system the maintenance costs of the k th maintenance scheduling can be obtained and maintenance cost rates can be calculated as 30 m t w p k k 1 p k 1 p k k 1 p k 1 p k k t c total 31 c total k 1 c im c 0 c p m c 0 c m i m c 0 0 t r k s w d s where r i t w r a i 1 u i 1 s w and 0 s t 3 opportunistic maintenance model based on the non homogeneous continuous time markov process the degradation processes of each subsystem have been analyzed and the optimal maintenance intervals have been proposed next multiple individual components will be studied as the whole system and the opportunistic maintenance can be modeled to achieve the optimization 3 1 model description when establishing an opportunistic maintenance model for a multi component system the following assumptions need to be set 1 a multi component system is composed of a number of mutually independent components the number of components is set to n 2 when the state of the component reaches a preset reliability threshold preventive maintenance operations can be performed on the component so that maintenance can be performed in advance to avoid failure 3 if the component fails before preventive maintenance then corrective maintenance measures need to be taken to return the component to normal working condition and this maintenance activity will not change the failure rate of the component when the preventive maintenance operation is completed the equipment will enter another circle of degradation process 4 when entering the opportunity maintenance phase each component under maintenance is assumed to share the same downtime and downtime loss based on the above assumptions an opportunistic maintenance model for a complex system with multiple components is established in the process of maintenance perfect repair and imperfect repair are mainly involved when perfect repair is performed the system will return to the original perfect state again and the operation life regression factor α i 0 so n i j 1 t n i j t n i j t is the failure rate function of component i before the j th preventive maintenance when imperfect repair is performed the multi component system cannot return to the original perfect state the failure rate function of component i before and after the j th preventive maintenance can be expressed as n i j 1 t n i j t α δ t i j δ t i j represents the j th preventive maintenance cycle of component i based on the previous assumptions a certain reliability threshold is set for the component in advance once the component i reaches the threshold r a preventive maintenance circle is taken so 32 0 δ t i 1 n i 1 t d t 0 δ t i j n i j t d t n f i the meaning of 0 δ t i j n i j t d t is the cumulative failure risk of component i during the j th preventive maintenance cycle in this case the number of accidental failures and the number of repairs in the model are actually the same in the total time the expected repair cost of the component i is 33 e c i c 0 c m i n f i c p i c d i τ i j δ t i j τ i j where c 0 represents the fixed cost δ t i j represents the preventive maintenance time period of component i τ i j is the time consumed for this preventive maintenance c m i is the maintenance cost required for accidental failure c p i and c d i are the cost of a preventive maintenance for component i and the economic loss due to equipment shutdown per unit time respectively 3 2 model establishment suppose t i j is the operation time of component i at the j th preventive maintenance and δ t i j the time period of preventive maintenance then t i j can be expressed as t i 1 t b e g i n δ t i 1 and 34 t i j t i j 1 δ t i j 1 τ i j 1 j 1 t b e g i n is the start time of maintenance and under the normal situation the value is 0 the time of each preventive repair of the multi component system during the whole maintenance circle can be known for a complex system with n components when performing preventive maintenance on one of the components part i will get a chance to be repaired within the maintenance duration τ k j of part k if this opportunity is adopted at this time the maintenance cost is 35 c s i k j c 0 c d i k j c m i k j c p i k j where c d i k j represents the loss of equipment shutdown when component i and component k are being repaired at the same time which can be calculated by 36 c d i k j c d i τ k c m i k j means if the repair opportunity is performed on component i the avoided economic loss caused by accidental failure during the overall maintenance plan the maintenance time will be constantly updated assume δ t i j is the preventive maintenance time at the start time and δ t i j is the updated preventive maintenance time the total time deviation accumulated after such a long time is 37 δ t i k j 1 m δ t i j δ t i j m min n i n i where n i is the number of preventive maintenance in the initial scheduling n i indicates the number of preventive maintenance in the plan as the update changes at the beginning the component failure function n i j t and the updated component failure function n i j t can be calculated and the economic loss of component i after the opportunistic maintenance is 38 c p i k j e c i δ t i k e c i j 1 m δ t i j δ t i j it can be calculated that if the opportunistic maintenance strategy is adopted for component i and component k the maintenance cost can be reduced if c s i k j 0 it means that the opportunistic repair cannot save the maintenance cost it is not appropriate to take advanced maintenance for component i if c s i k j 0 it means that the opportunistic maintenance can reduce the maintenance cost and simultaneous repair measure should be adopted for component i and component k the next step is to analyze all the components in the multi component system as a whole calculate the maintenance cost of multiple opportunities for group maintenance and select the most economical maintenance solution assuming that the maintenance timing combination of the multi component system is set g there will be a subset g 1 g 2 g l at each maintenance time and 39 g p g q p q g 1 g 2 g l g when the number of components in a multi component system increases the subset in the set g will increase rapidly so that the number of maintenance grouping schemes that need to be considered is also increasing all maintenance combinations will be calculated and the cost balance will be obtained 40 c g l i g l c s i k j i k the cost balance of different combinations will be compared then the optimal opportunistic maintenance strategy is the combination with the largest cost savings 4 offshore wind turbine system and numerical example the strategy will be applied on an offshore wind turbine system on system level of owts the overall system can be divided into several subsystems based on the fault detection and fault isolation theory considering the detection time error detection and missed detection as well as fault trigger problems and system restart faults there are various criterion for separating system mãąrquez et al mãąrquez et al 2016 divided the wind turbine system into four major subsystems namely power train foundation and tower generator electrical and electronic components and blade system based on the logicality and integrity of fault tree method odgaard et al 2013 considered failures of wind turbine system level and divided the system into sensor subsystem actuator subsystem pitch subsystem drive train subsystem generator subsystem and converter subsystem in this paper in order to facilitate reliability analysis and maintenance planning optimization research the overall system is separated into multiple subsystems mainly considering the interconnection of the various subsystems and different types of maintenance activities the separation is based on the components function the specificity of maintenance requirement and maintenance strategy the owt system is separated into seven subsystems electrical subsystem drive train generator rotor blade rotor hub electrical control yaw subsystem it is noted that this work focus on the owt system including blades and nacelle therefore the tower and foundation are not considered the degradation process of subsystem is divided into several states which have been described in ossai et al 2016 life cycles of subsystems have been studied and aging components are more likely to fail due to stress induced damage or environmentally induced ruptures the risk of failure is expected to be different in different life cycle phases it is assumed that the subsystems of the owt follow the five life cycle phases introduction maturity ageing terminal failure the residence time between states is the value of m t t f i j 5 results due to the difference of the repair types we can determine that the minimum maintenance cost is less than the imperfect maintenance and the perfect maintenance which are summarized in table 1 model parameters in the model are listed in table 2 these data can be referred to le and andrews 2016 carroll et al 2016 the production loss per day due to maintenance is assumed to be 7500 euros 5 1 maintenance cost rate according to the model establishment and calculation in section 3 the maintenance cost rates of each subsystems can be obtained in fig 2 the curves representing the cost rates are illustrated the bottom of curves is the selection of optimal maintenance intervals it can be concluded that the optimal maintenance intervals for electrical system drive train generator rotor blade rotor hub electrical control yaw system are 3 9 years 2 7 years 4 2 years 3 8 years 2 3 years 4 1 years and 5 7 years respectively according to the optimal maintenance cost rate of each subsystem the maintenance cost per unit of time will rapidly decrease within the initial period of time and as the decline rate slows down to the lowest point of the curve it will then increase the lowest point of the maintenance cost curve is the optimal maintenance intervals in the maintenance strategy the results demonstrate that in the process of formulating a maintenance strategy the total maintenance cost will vary greatly with the maintenance interval when the maintenance interval is too short or too long the maintenance strategy is not economical due to excessive maintenance costs or excessive reduction in equipment reliability resulting in high maintenance costs from the curve in the figures it can be seen that the maintenance cost rate varies not so much during a period of time near the lowest point and this point is the most economical if the maintenance interval is set in this period of time after multiple rounds of preventive maintenance the total maintenance and operation cost is the most cost effective at the same time it can be noted that maintenance cost rates are different for various subsystems this is because the formulation of maintenance strategies involves many aspects including the cost of different types of maintenance different equipment failure rates diverse weibull distribution parameters etc which shows that different subsystems need to formulate corresponding repair plans according to their characteristics 5 2 maintenance schedule based on the degradation illustrated by non homogeneous continuous time markov process the calculation results are inputted to the opportunistic maintenance model for the owt system the simulation time is set to 10 years fig 3 shows the time of maintenance schedule the blue bars represent the performance of opportunistic maintenance and the red ones represent preventive maintenance it can be found that every opportunistic maintenance must be triggered by a preventive maintenance carried out at the same time the reason is only the preventive maintenance can bring an opportunity to conduct opportunistic maintenance on components satisfying repair requirements in table 3 the number of performed maintenance on each subsystem are presented the results show that drive train and rotor system are the components which need to be checked and repaired frequently hence these repair activities can provide many maintenance opportunities for other components nearly all of the maintenance performed on electrical system generator and yaw system are opportunistic maintenance indicating that the economic profits of opportunistic maintenance strategy are mainly generated from these three components detailed maintenance schedule times are listed in table 4 from component 1 to 7 means electrical system drive train generator rotor blade rotor hub electrical control yaw system respectively 5 3 cost reduction in order to illustrate the economic profits of the proposed method a comparison analysis is presented between individual maintenance and om table 5 shows that the opportunistic maintenance model can indeed reduce the overall cost by grouping various sub components for maintenance the maintenance cost will reduce from 1636 euros day to 1533 euros day and percentage reduction will be 6 3 5 4 comparison analysis in this section a comparison analysis between previous literature and current study will be performed nguyen and chou 2018 proposed an approach to determine the optimal maintenance schedules for offshore wind system by grouping maintenance activities of different component the maintenance cost can be minimized xie et al 2019 developed an effective opportunistic maintenance strategy to reduce the maintenance costs of offshore wind turbines in consideration of their accessibility atashgar and abdollahzadeh 2016 formulated a joint redundancy and imperfect block opportunistic maintenance optimization model for wind farms and minimizing maintenance costs is one of the objectives of the proposed model generally the proposed opportunistic model in this paper can reduce the maintenance costs although the cost saving is not as significant as some literature see table 6 it can be explained by the scale effect of the numerical model the better performance of opportunistic maintenance strategy can be achieved when the number of wind turbines is larger in this paper the proposed model is applied to an offshore wind turbines instead of a large scale offshore wind farm the reason is when the number of components considered increases the number of grouping combinations will also increase exponentially resulting in great difficulty in obtaining the optimal solution 6 conclusions in this paper we develop an opportunistic maintenance strategy for offshore wind turbines aiming to decrease maintenance costs as far as possible during life time as a typical multi component system the offshore wind turbine system can be separated into several subsystems which degrade with time going by in order to evaluate operation states of offshore wind turbines a non homogeneous continuous time markov process nhctmp is adopted to illustrate degradation processes of each subsystems following the markov process the economic parameters during maintenance schedules are taken into account hence the optimal maintenance intervals for each subsystems can be obtained following the objective to reduce maintenance cost when we pay attention to the economic dependencies among subsystems a large number of opportunities will be created during implementation of maintenance activities capturing these opportunities can effectively optimize maintenance strategies for offshore wind turbines for achieving the goal of reducing o m costs for offshore wind energy there are still many topics to be explored and completed in the future the maintenance activities cannot usually carried out without any block weather conditions availability of vessels or manpower accessibility of the locations these constraints can affect the implementation of maintenance scheduling in addition the maintenance strategy can also be updated from wind turbine level to wind farm level when considering these constraints indicating the model will be more complicated but also more practical the topics will be studied in the near future in order to apply theoretical maintenance models into realistic world credit authorship contribution statement mingxin li conceptualization methodology software formal

21502,this paper reports the results of laboratory in water experiments in which artificially marine fouled circular cylinders were freely vibrating in the wake of a similar fixed upstream cylinder cross flow vibrations at gaps of 3 7 diameters were examined the marine fouling was simulated by cnc machining of uniformly distributed single sized pyramids on the surface of the test cylinders depending on the spacing ratio the smooth tandem cylinder demonstrated both vortex induced vibration viv and galloping types of response interestingly only the viv like response was presented by the artificially marine fouled cylinder the maximum amplitude of the oscillations and maximum lift force coefficient of the marine fouled tandem cylinders were respectively around one third and two thirds of those in the corresponding smooth tandem cylinders in the case of tandem circular cylinders the marine fouling showed two contradictory outcomes it eliminated the galloping and suppressed the viv

stationary cylinders was categorised by previous researchers into i extended body regime when no vortex is shed in the gap and the shear layers from the upstream cylinder reattach those shed past the

are greatly magnified païdoussis et al 2010 some researchers studied the flow induced motions of two tandem cylinders which were free to oscillate in one or two degrees of freedom 1 or 2 dof for example kim et al 2009 experimentally studied the fiv characteristics of two tandem cylinders in a closed circuit wind tunnel huang and herfjord 2013 examined two elastically supported circular tandem cylinders at varying spacing more recent experimental and cfd computational fluid dynamics studies include ding et al 2015 kim and bernitsas 2016 ma et al 2017 sun et al 2017 xu et al 2019 sun et al 2019 narváez et al 2020 effective suppressing or at least control of the fiv is an important since these vibrations are have been the cause of many structural failures xu et al 2018 unlike previous efforts to suppress the viv bernitsas et al 2008 successfully utilised this potentially damaging phenomenon for renewable energy harvesting purposes by introducing vivace nevertheless in vivace the energy conversion efficiency of a single cylinder was quite low this stemed from the fact that a smooth circular cylinder presents a viv type of response which is self excited and self restricted dai et al 2016 the maximum viv amplitude remains around 1d and the high amplitude vibration occurs only within a small bandwidth called the lock in region where the vortex shedding frequency is around the structure s natural frequency moreover with a small fluctuation of flow speed the harvested power drastically decreases this limits the vivace performance in real environments with stochastic or varying vibration spectra therefore recently significant research has been devoted to enhance the performance and efficiency of the fiv energy harvesting galloping or wiv commences at values of u beyond the peak viv response amplitude it is not self limited and the response amplitude may exceed 3d bernitsas et al 2008 or 3 5d ding et al 2013 high galloping vibrations have become attractive for vivace converters as they significantly increase the efficiency and power density of the harnessed marine hydrokinetic energy bibo et al 2015 for this reason researchers working on marine renewable energy have recently concentrated on wiv type of response of cylinders in tandem arrangements from which back to back viv and galloping are achieved sun et al 2017 2018 2019 ding et al 2019 xu et al 2019 song et al 2020 on the other hand it is only a matter of time before marine fouling covers the surface of the subsea man made structures marine fouling increases the outer diameter weight and surface roughness thus changes the flow regime around the body and the hydrodynamic force coeficients a number of researchers have addressed the effects of surface roughness on the vortex shedding of isolated cylindrical bodies a brief review of these studies was provided by zeinoddini et al 2016 the effects of the marine fouling on the viv of single circular cylinders were studied by zeinoddini et al 2017 2018 and jadidi et al 2018 studies on the vortex shedding and fiv of rough cylinders in the tandem arrangement are limited okajima 1979 conducted wind tunnel tests to study the in line vibration response of tandem circular cylinders at spacing ratios of s d 3 and 5 the upstream cylinder was rough but the downstream cylinder remained smooth the desired roughness was produced by glueing polystyrene beads on the surface of the test cylinders relative roughness of 0 9 cases of full and partial coverage were considered and the wake structure was analysed using the smoke visualisation method variations of the vibration amplitude the drag force coefficient and strouhal number at different spacing ratios were analysed and reported ding et al 2015 conducted experimental and numerical urans unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes studies on the cross fiv and energy harvesting performance of three tandem cylinders with rough strips the maximum amplitude of the upstream cylinder reached 2 8d the total power increased with increasing flow velocity the peak harvested power was around 85w more recently yang et al 2019 studied the effect of roughness strips on the vibrations and flow field around two staggered circular cylinders despite the aforementioned valuable studies a question still remains does the fouling amplify or suppress the fiv response of cylinders in tandem configuration what are the fouling impacts on the integrity of the structure and on the energy harnessed from the fiv of tandem circular oscillators this paper reports the results of in water fiv experiments on a freely vibrating artificially marine fouled circular cylinder in the wake of another fixed similar cylinder gaps of 3 7 diameters are examined the fouling is simulated by machining uniformly distributed single sized pyramids on the surface of the test cylinders the 1 dof vibrating system has a low mass damping parameter and the reynolds number ranges from around 6 103 to 6 104 the authors are not aware of previously published studies on the fiv of tandem marine fouled cylinders 2 experimental set up 2 1 towing facility and test cylinders the current in water fiv experiments were carried out in the towing tank of marine engineering laboratory sharif university of technology the tank is 25 m long 2 5 m wide and 1 7 m deep the facility is able to deliver a maximum towing speed of 4 m s with an accuracy of 0 001 m s two vertical rigid cylinders of similar size were towed in tandem arrangements the test cylinders were made from as received thick walled aluminium circular tubes top of the upstream cylinder was rigidly fixed through a supporting structure to the carriage the downstream cylinder was free to oscillate transversely in a 1 degree of freedom 1 dof mass spring system two steel leaf springs provided the restoring force with a total stiffness of 210 n m a general view of the towing tank and a schematic representation of the test cylinders in the tandem arrangement are given in fig 1 end effects may bring vortex dislocation oblique shedding or tip flow phenomenon during the tests special cares were taken to avoid span wise shedding inhomogeneity along the cylinder to this end a large diameter circular endplate was attached to the lower end of the upstream test cylinder the diameter and thicknesses of the end plate were chosen as per stansby 1974 and morse et al 2008 recommendations a distance of around 400 mm remained between the end plate and the tank s bottom the plate edges were carefully chamfered to minimise possible interferences with the incoming flow as per morse et al 2008 a gap of approximately 2 mm 0 032d was maintained between the end plate and the downstream cylinder see fig 1b 2 2 marine fouling modelling the fouling deposition is a complicated biological process and is influenced by many factors such as water depth current speed direction wave height drection temperature nutrients light salinity predation and bottom topography amerioun 2015 different fouling organisms are in constant competition for space food and light jusoh and wolfram 1996 hard and soft fouling often cohabit in a marine fouling community the fouling structure varies temporarily and spatially so it is almost impossible to predict its actual future morphology the current laboratory study only considers hard fouling the hard marine fouling was simulated as regular pyramidal protrusions on the surface of the test cylinders fig 1 such a configuration admittedly varies from the actual conditions but despite its simplicity and regular anatomical structure it can be a cornerstone for understanding the effect of marine fouling on fiv of tandem circular cylinders thus the current study should mainly be viewed as the first initiative on the subject for comparison purposes all tests conducted on cylinders with artificial marine fouling were repeated on smooth bare cylinders with the same outer diameters and lengths the smooth test cylinders were machined from aluminium tubes they had a finished outer diameter of d o 65 mm the inner diameter of d i 45 mm immersed length of l i 400 mm and aspect ratio r a of 6 15 the test cylinder with regular pyramidal protrusion is hereafter called the marine fouled cylinder the size of the pyramidal protrusions was close to those used by wolfram and theophanatos 1989 in their experiments on stationary cylinders and by zeinoddini et al 2016 in their viv tests on single circular cylinders each pyramid had a square base of 7 7 mm and was 3 mm tall fig 1 the relative roughness e k d o was equal to 0 048 physical properties for the cylinders and the testing system are summarised in table 1 table 2 lists the tests conducted on smooth and marine fouled cylinders in the isolated or tandem configurations table 1 reports the in air damping ratios that are commonly used to define m ξ parameter williamson and govardhan 2008 the ξ values were obtained from in air free decay tests and expectedly remained almost the same for the smooth cylinder and cylinder with pyramidal surface protrusions jadidi et al 2018 conducted in water decay tests on smooth and marine fouled cylinders they reported that the in water ξ is higher than the corresponding in air ξ due to hydrodynamic damping effects marine fouled cylinders also demonstrate higher in water ξ as compared to in water ξ of the smooth cylinder jadidi et al 2018 2 3 instruments two sets of wheatstone full bridge strain gauge circuits were arranged near the far ends of the two leaf springs in the supporting system in order to record the displacement of the downstream test cylinder the flexible support was designed to remain elastic throughout the viv tests therefore the strains on the leaf springs remained essentially linear in phase and proportional to the cylinder transverse displacements before conducting each test series the strain gauges on the leaf springs were calibrated by applying a range of predefined lateral point displacements at the mid length of the cylinder the calibration tests demonstrated a linear elastic relationship between the strain gauge outputs and the displacement variations with no perceptible hysteresis the ratio between the strain gauge outputs and the displacement of the cylinder was used to convert the strain data to time series of the cylinder transverse displacement a similar approach was considered by some previous researchers in their viv experiments for example assi et al 2006 zeinoddini et al 2013 tamimi et al 2019 2020 jadidi and zeinoddini 2020 the instantaneous fluid forces acting on the downstream cylinder in the cross flow and stream wise directions were recorded using a bi directional fabricated load cell placed on top of the cylinder fig 1 the data provided by the load cell however did not directly reflect the lift force exerted by vortices to the cylinder this stemmed from the fact that the stress data was also affected by the inertia forces generated by the cylinder acceleration therefore the inertia force was subtracted from the load cell data to obtain the lift force the measurement devices used in the test set up were calibrated before each test series the test data was recorded using the tml da 37a dynamic data acquisition system at a frequency of 200 hz the unsolicited noises generated during the experiment were removed from the measured signals using savitzky and golay s 1964 filtering technique the response signals provided by the measurement devices were often non stationary the hilbert transform ht amplitude was thus used to define the amplitude of the oscillations ht treats the response as a rotating vector with an instantaneous phase angle and an instantaneous amplitude the procedure was already used for example by hahn 1996 khalak and williamson 1999 huera huarte and bearman 2011 and zeinoddini et al 2015 to study the viv response of isolated cylinders more descriptions about the method can be found in khalak and williamson 1999 flow visualisation was performed using coloured dye to reveal the vortex patterns behind the oscillating cylinder the dye was forced from a containment reservoir into the fluid flow through a needle at upstream of the oscillating cylinder the images obtained from the flow visualisation were more or less sufficient for qualitative investigations and visual interpretations of the fluid regime 2 4 uncertainties and errors one source of uncertainty in the current experiments was originated from the carriage speed which defined the free stream velocity the carriage travel times over a fixed length were measured in some trial runs the results showed that the mean towing speed remained within 1 2 of the nominal speed forces measured in a finite body of water may differ from those expected in an infinite stream this is referred to as the blockage effect and in the current experiments it can be caused by the limited width of the towing tank if the ratio of the channel width w to the cylinder diameter d o is greater than 10 and re 300 no force correction is necessary zdravkovich 1997b in the current experiments the blockage ratio w d o was 19 5 and re exceeded 6000 based on a formulation provided by ersdal 2004 a waiting time of 10 min was also observed between two consecutive runs the finished dimensions of the cylinders and the pyramids were controlled using a slide calliper at random locations the readings on the diameter of the smooth and the roughened cylinders were within 0 06 and 0 1 mm from the nominal values respectively for each cylinder the mass was estimated using a calibrated digital weight measuring device with an accuracy of 0 2 the moving mass in the spring system was estimated based on nominal dimensions of the moving parts and the density of materials using a functional multivariable approach hughes and hase 2010 and assuming that the uncertainties in participating variables were uncorrelated the uncertainty ranges in the current experimental set up were used to estimate the error propagations for non dimensional response parameters such as a c l f and u the details can be found in zeinoddini et al 2017 2 5 set up validation a series of viv tests were performed on a single vertical smooth cylinder s sm to validate the experimental set up fig 2 a provides the non dimensional amplitude a versus the reduced velocity u of the current isolated smooth model along with the results of low mass damping cylinders in khalak and williamson 1999 and franzini et al 2013 experiments three standard i initial ii upper and iii lower branches which characterise the amplitude response of the smooth low mass damping cylinders can be recognised in the three test results the onset of the oscillations and the maximum amplitude a max in the three studies are in reasonable agreement in addition the initial branches from the three studies almost overlay over the lower branch the amplitude of the oscillations a from the current study remains relatively close to those obtained by khalak and williamson 1999 but both are smaller than those from franzini et al 2013 reasonable agreement can be observed for the width of the lock in region the position of the a max in the course of u and the lock out zones in the current study and those in khalak and williamson 1999 at the upper and lower branches of the response amplitude a data obtained by franzini et al 2013 differs to some degree from the other two studies williamson and govardhan 2008 derived simple relationships to predict a max for a 1 dof wake oscillator model this gives an estimation of a max 0 97 for the smooth cylinder used in the current study which is close to the current test results a max 1 03 fig 2b depicts the non dimensional frequency f versus the u for the single smooth cylinder s sm in the present study the frequency of the cross flow oscillations in khalak and williamson 1999 and franzini et al 2013 studies are also included in the figure over the initial branch of the oscillation amplitude f data points from khalak and williamson 1999 array partly around the f 1 line and partly about the st 0 2 line f data points from the present and franzini et al 2013 study array around the st 0 2 line without jumps to the f 1 line this might be attributed to differences in the test arrangements in these studies the viv tests in franzini et al 2013 and the present studies were carried out in towing tanks on flexibly mounted rigs wherein no hysteresis expectedly occurs under decrementing and incrementing flow speeds khalak and williamson 1999 carried out their tests in a recirculating water channel using air bearing rigs the viv tests included both decrementing and incrementing flow speeds the dispersion of the f data points on the f 1 and st 0 2 lines are likely to portrait the hysteresis effects in the khalak and williamson 1999 tests over the lock in region f runs close but slightly above unity indicating that the forcing and the natural frequencies are close and the system is prone to dynamic amplification a number of fiv tests were also conducted on two smooth tandem circular cylinders with the aim to verify the functionality of the current testing setup in tandem arrangements with this configuration the upstream cylinder remained fixed but the downstream cylinder was free to vibrate in the cross flow direction sample response amplitudes for the downstream smooth cylinders in two tandem arrangements at s d 4 and s d 5 are presented in fig 3 the figure compares the results from the current study with those of low mass damping smooth circular cylinders from assi et al 2006 at s d 4 and hover and triantafyllou 2001 at s d 4 75 in contrast to those in fig 2a all oscillation amplitudes in fig 3 exhibit a sustained increase in terms of u the current setup thus seems capable to capture the galloping type of response in tandem configurations for u 6 however the a results from the current study at s d 4 show relatively good agreement with those from assi et al 2006 for u 6 the a of the current study remains somewhat higher than that reported by assi et al 2006 reasonable agreement can be noticed between the present results on s d 5 and the experimental data from hover and triantafyllou 2001 at s d 4 75 it is noted that in a tandem arrangement the downstream cylinder could experience a beating phenomenon with continuous modulations of the oscillation amplitude park 2012 bakhtiari et al 2020 the beating manifests itself as two major frequencies in the upcoming psd plots see fig 9 the test duration thus had to be long enough to capture these phenomena in the towing tank experiments the number of informative viv and wiv cycles per test was limited by the length of the tank and the towing velocity in the current experiments depending on the towing speed tested at least 20 to 160 displacement cycles occurred in the steady state part of the cylinder responses the tests at high flow velocities were therefore repeated three times under similar conditions to increase the number of workable cycles for the viv and wiv data analysis fig 4 illustrates the displacement time series of the smooth cylinder in a tandem arrangement at s d 4 and u 5 5 and u 8 the horizontal axis in the figure was normalised by the mean period of the transverse oscillations t in summary the results current experimental measuremnts show reasonable agreement with experimental data from previous reaserchers in both isolated and tandem configurations of the smooth cylinder however some small discrepancies was still observed among different experimental results the differences can be attributed to dissimilarities in the experimental parameters e g regarding the mass ratios m the mass damping parameters m ζ the reynolds number ranges testing setups apparatus procedures and post processing of the test data in general it can be inferred that the current experimental arrangement and procedures is capable to provide accurate predictions of the fiv of tandem circular cylinders 3 results and discussion 3 1 general fouling effects on viv of the single cylinder fig 5 illustrates marine fouling effects on the cross flow viv response of the single circular cylinder in this figure s sm and s pp represent the smooth and the artificially marine fouled models the first s letter stands for singlr sm shows that the cylinder surface is smooth and pp shows that the cylinder surface is covered by pyramidal protrusions according to fig 5a the onset of oscillations in s sm and s pp cylinders remains nearly the same however the initial upper lower and the de synchronisation branches in s pp cylinder move noticeably below those in s sm cylinder with the single smooth cylinder s sm a max is 1 03 it reduces to 0 68 for the single marine fouled cylinder s pp a lower branch of around a 0 71 almost 69 of a max is well evident with s sm cylinder the same with s pp cylinder appears around a 0 57 almost 85 of a max with s sm and s pp cylinders a max occurs at u 5 6 and 5 0 respectively a max in the marine fouled cylinder thus shows a slight right hand shift in the course of u relative to that of the smooth cylinder the lock in range with s pp cylinder is slightly shorter in the course of u than that with s sm cylinder furthermore s pp cylinder locks out at smaller u as compared to that with s sm cylinder as an example a of the s pp model is equal to 0 17 at the end of lock in range u 8 which is 54 llower than that in s sm model above observations look analogous to kiu et al 2011 findings in their viv towing tank tests on circular cylinders covered by sandpapers they noticed that the surface roughness reduced the peak cross flow amplitude narrowed the lock in region and lowered the u for the lock out in the current study lock in referes to when the shedding frequency breaks from the st 0 2 line and stays close to the natural frequency of the system it is already known that in low mass damping cylinders the system does not perfectly lock onto one frequency over the lock in region f stays close to f 1 line but continues to increase as u increases klamo et al 2006 synchronisation on the other hand means that the shedding frequency breaks from the st 0 2 line but is matched to a frequency that is not necessarily close to the natural frequency fig 5b compares the frequency responses from s pp and s sm cylinders for u 5 the f data points from both cylinders cluster around the st 0 20 line the f values for the smooth cylinder however move rather above the st 0 20 line with the marine fouled cylinder f values for u 2 5 remain slightly above st 0 20 line but slightly below st 0 20 line for 2 5 u 5 the trend agrees with the bearman and harvey 1993 findings for vortex shedding past stationary cylinders under uniform flows they reported that surface irregularities lower the critical reynolds number whereat flow becomes turbulent relative to that in the corresponding smooth cylinder they also found that the shedding frequency in a cylinder with surface irregularity increases at subcritical reynolds numbers but decreases at higher reynolds numbers in comparison to those for a smooth cylinder for u 5 the non dimensional frequencies in both cylinders gradually curve up from the f 1 line but still move relatively close to it the f values for the marine fouled cylinder stay closer to the f 1 line fig 5c presents the root mean square of the lift force coefficient c lrms in s pp and s sm cylinders versus u for 2 u 4 2 c lrms curves for s pp and s sm cylinders almost coincide both c lrms curves reach their maximum around the far end of the initial branch of the oscillation amplitude then drop steadily to very small values at lock out flow velocity say u 9 the peak c lrms is 2 39 and 1 67 with s sm and s pp models respectively with the marine fouled cylinder the peak the peak c lrms in s pp cylinder occurs at a smaller u as compared to that for s sm cylinder for 4 4 u 9 the c lrms values for s pp cylinder run well below that of the smooth s sm cylinder as aforementioned the cross flow forces were recorded using a bi directional load cell placed immediately below the spring system the load cell data however included both the distributed lift and inertia force components the latter was subtracted from the total force to obtain the lift force component the inertia component was taken as the product of the structural mass hanging below the load cell by the transverse acceleration of the cylinder the acceleration was computed as the second order numerical derivative of the displacement time series due to the high structural rigidity in the tow direction the inline load cell data was considered as the drag force without any amendment for the inertia term in general the results presented in fig 5 indicate that the marine fouling acted to some extent as a viv suppression tool the fouling reduced the lock in range the hydrodynamic force coefficient the shedding frequency and the maximum amplitude of oscillations as compared to those from the corresponding smooth cylinder similar features were reported for the cross flow viv of helically straked circular cylinders zeinoddini et al 2015 the viv suppression caused by the marine fouling stems partly from the fact that the surface irregularities change the wake structure by interrupting the circumferential span wise correlation synchronisation of vortices shed from the marine fouled cylinder fig 6 a and b provide side snapshots of the flow field past s sm and s pp cylinders at the sample reduced velocity of u 3 1 re 1 9 104 the flow field past s pp cylinder shows a narrower band wake of relatively smaller vortices as compared to those behind s sm cylinder similar results were reported by zhou et al 2015 who studied the force and flow characteristics of smooth and rough dimpled stationary cylinders particle image velocimetry piv was used for quantitative measurement of the flow field past the cylinders fig 6c and d presents typical snapshots of the instantaneous flow field plus contours of span wise vorticity at re 9850 for the smooth and the dimpled cylinders according to fig 6c and d the wake narrowed and the vortices grew smaller with the rough cylinder as compared to those behind the smooth cylinder in general for both fixed and oscillating cylinders the size of vortices shed behind the roughened cylinders seemed shorter than that of the smooth cylinder the vortices past the marine fouled cylinder however had more turbulent structures than those past the smooth cylinder fig 6a and c small vortices and more narrow turbulent wakes past a cylinder can lower the total pressure drag thus the amplitude of the flow force acting on the cylinder these factors contribute to lowering the hydrodynamic force coefficients and the amplitude of oscillations in the marine fouled cylinder relative to those in the smooth cylinder 3 2 two smooth circular cylinders in tandem a number of fiv tests were conducted on two smooth circular cylinders at different tandem configurations fig 7 presents a of the smooth cylinder oscillating in the wake of a similar fixed upstream cylinder the results belong to the five spacing ratios tested s d 3 4 5 6 and 7 as well as that for an isolated smooth model s sm the figure shows that for all six cases the oscillations start around u 2 5 and that for u 5 all amplitude curves almost coincide it is noted that u 5 marks the far end of the initial branch for the single circular cylinder see fig 7 for u 5 a values demonstrate two distinct trends depending on the spacing ratio with the first trend a sustained increase in the oscillation amplitude could be noticed at s d 4 and 5 this type of oscillation was termed by previous researchers as galloping wig or wiv with this type of oscillation unsteady wake from the upstream cylinder and the vortices shed behind the downstream cylinder interact to steadily amplify the excitations in the downstream body the maximum a for the galloping type of response and over the u ranges tested is about 1 85d this is around 1 8 times of a max 1 03d in the single cylinder and belongs to the spacing ratio of s d 4 fig 7 the oscillating trend with the spacing ratios of s d 3 6 and 7 denotes the so called viv like xu et al 2019 or vortex resonance bokaian and geoola 1984 type of response in a viv like response a increases by the increase in u towards a peak of a 1 then progressively decreases it is reiterated that in the cross flow vibrations viv and galloping constitute two main sub categories of fiv viv of a cylinder in the cross flow direction occurs when shedding vortices e g the von karman vortex street create pressure differences around the cylinder which is coupled with the restoring force gabbai and benaroya 2005 however galloping is a hydro elastic instability characterised by high cross flow amplitudes and lower frequencies than viv it does not depend on vortex formation and occurs above a critical flow velocity depending on the flow speed the cross section geometry and oscillator properties viv and galloping may overlap separate or coexist in a transition region kinaci et al 2016 typically galloping is more robust and detrimental to the structural integrity than viv however in the galloping region the harvested mechanical power increases with increasing flow velocity and reynolds number as an example armandei and fernandes 2015 reported an almost 100 improvement in the performance of a galloping based hydrokinetic turbine as compared to a viv based turbine the results presented in fig 7 comply with those in assi et al 2006 experiments on the fiv of two smooth circular cylinders one difference is that at s d 3 their oscillating cylinder displayed an asymptotic amplitude behaviour which persisted up to u 35 assi et al 2010 also reported that beyond a critical spacing ratio the unstable shear layers of the upstream cylinder find enough space to effectively spin in the gap and to build up the vortices shed behind the downstream cylinder this critical spacing ratio depends on the re range and free stream turbulence intensity it fell between s d 2 and 3 in their work and falls between s d 3 and 4 in this work with two smooth tandem cylinders at s d 3 the cylinders were in the extended body regime the streamlines from the upstream cylinder reattached on the downstream cylinder in other words vortices were not shed in the gap but were formed past the downstream cylinder as a result the flow induced vibration of the tandem cylinder at this spacing ratio was similar to that for a single cylinder with two smooth tandem cylinders at s d 4 and 5 the gap ratio exceeded the critical spacing ratio wherein the downstream cylinder was excited by both its vortex shedding and vortices arriving from the upstream cylinder this led to a galloping type of oscillation whereby both the lift force coefficient and a stayed higher than their corresponding values in a viv type of response at s d 6 and 7 the system was inclined to a co shedding regime corresponding to a sufficiently large spacing between the two cylinders in this case the fluid forces and cylinder displacements moved once again close to that of the isolated smooth cylinder the frequency responses of downstream smooth cylinders at different tandem gaps are presented in fig 8 the figure also includes the frequency response of the isolated elastically mounted smooth cylinder s sm as it may be noticed for u 4 all f curves almost collapse on the st 0 2 line however at s d 4 5 and 7 the f data points occasionally jump atop the st 0 2 line with u 5 the frequency content of the galloping oscillations t sm 4d and t sm 5d differ from those with viv s sm or viv like t sm 3d and t sm 7d responnses data points for t sm 4d and t sm 5d are arranged more tightly around f 1 line as compared to those in s sm t sm 3d and t sm 7d configurations it means that over the galloping range of flow velocities say u 5 the actual oscillation frequency remained very close to the natural frequency f n of the downstream cylinder this characterises a region of high amplitude oscillations around f n at very low lift force coefficients with the viv s sm and viv like t sm 3d and t sm 7d arrangements the f data points cluster more loosely around the f 1 line this is more pronounced with the s sm cylinder it is noted that in general the frequency response of t sm 7d stays somewhere in between the galloping and viv type of oscillations the u at which f curves up from f 1 line seems to differ in the six specimens fig 8 this difference is also echoed in the amplitude responses fig 7 the corresponding values are u 5 1 5 8 7 2 7 1 6 8 and 6 3 respectively for s sm t sm 3d t sm 4d t sm 5d t sm 6d t sm 7d arrangements it can be noticed that with the galloping types of response t sm 4d and t sm 5d f departs from f 1 at higher reduced velocities the u at f departure is the smallest with viv s sm then with the viv like t sm 3d and t sm 7d types of oscillations besides the u at f departure shows some correlations with the a magnitude at high reduced velocities fig 7 interestingly with tandem arrangements a small local maximum appears in the tandem amplitude responses fig 7 around the u corresponding to f departure from f 1 fig 8 it is noted that the galloping phenomenon is generally characterised by the cross flow oscillations at lower frequencies and larger amplitudes than viv blevins 1990 blevins and coughran 2009 it occurs beyond a critical flow speed wherein the amplitude of the motions monotonically increases with the flow speed bearman et al 1987 fig 7 shows that the frequency and amplitude responses for t sm 5d and t sm 7d cylinders remained very similar for u 6 at higher velocities the oscillation amplitude monotonically increased and decreased for t sm 5d and t sm 7d cylinders respectively for u 6 the frequency response for t sm 5d cylinder stayed closer to f 1 as compared to that for t sm 7d cylinder the responses at s d 5 and 7 thus were categorised as galloping and viv respectively fig 9 provides sample 3d views of the normalised power spectral densities psd for one galloping s d 5 and one viv like s d 7 type of response individual psd s at a certain u are obtained by normalising the corresponding psd by its maximum power value assi et al 2010 this would scale all psds to have at least one dominant peak at psd 1 fig 9 b shows that in the galloping region u 6 frequency corresponding to the peak of the psds was close to f 1 line it is reiterated that for u 5 the frequency response in the galloping type of oscillations stayed closer to the natural frequency of the system as compared to those with the viv type of oscillations fig 9 a the aforementioned differences between the galloping and the viv like frequency responses can also be remarked in fig 9 fig 10 depicts c lrms against u for the downstream smooth cylinders at s d 3 to 7 the figure also includes the c lrms data from the isolated elastically mounted smooth cylinder s sm the maximum c lrms with the isolated smooth cylinder is 2 39 this equals to 1 42 1 71 1 51 1 76 and 1 77 at spacing ratios of s d 3 to 7 respectively therefore the maximum c lrms in the downstream cylinder is mitigated around 32 on average by the wake from the upstream cylinder the reduction varies from 26 to 41 depending on the spacing ratio the c lrms data points from each of the six configurations in fig 10 demonstrate a local peak over the 1 u 2 5 range the local c lrms peak can be ascribed by the lock on in a 2p mode of vortex shedding behind the oscillating cylinder which occurs at this range of u dong and karniadakis 2005 moreover the c lrms data points are widely dispersed most probably due to co occurrence of other shedding modes including c 2s s p and c s p modes in this range of reduced velocities zeinoddini et al 2018 over the 1 u 2 5 range no discernible trend emerges between the c lrms and the s d data over the aforementioned range of flow velocities over the 2 5 u 4 5 range the c lrms curves of different s d ratios run rather close to each other cylinders with a galloping type of response t sm 4d and t sm 5d show comparatively high c lrms values at u 7 in this region the mean c lrms is around 42 and 26 of the corresponding maximum c lrms with t sm 4d and t sm 5d respectively in the models with the viv s sm and viv like t sm 3d and t sm 7d types of oscillation the c lrms data points present quite a different trend as compared to those with a galloping response t sm 4d and t sm 5d with the viv like types of response t sm 3d and t sm 7d c lrms progressively reduces to small values at large u a similar trend can be noticed with the isolated circular cylinder s sm 3 3 two marine fouled circular cylinders in tandem fig 11 presents the amplitude response of a marine fouled cylinder oscillating in the wake of a fixed upstream similar marine fouled cylinder the results for the five gaps tested s d 3 4 5 6 and 7 as well as those for a single elastically mounted marine fouled circular cylinder are presented the amplitude responses in fig 11 are very interestingly different from those reported for the smooth tandem cylinders fig 7 in fact no galloping type of response is observed with the marine fouled tandem cylinders tested regardless of the spacing ratio a viv like response is demonstrated by the downstream marine fouled cylinder whereas a increases by the increase in u towards a peak a max 0 53 to 0 63 then progressively decreases at some tandem arrangements s d 4 and 5 the a max exceeds the a max in the isolated marine fouled cylinder a max 0 57 however in contrast to the smooth tandem cylinders fig 7 a in the marine fouled tandem cylinders remains always bounded the a max in fig 11 is 0 63d say around one third of a max observed with the smooth tandem cylinders 1 8d 0 61 of that of the smooth single cylinder 1 03d but still 11 higher than that of the isolated marine fouled cylinder 0 57d once again the fouling has suppressed the fiv of cylinders in tandem the amplitude responses in the smooth tandem cylinder yet show some spacing wise correlations with those from the marine fouled tandem cylinders for example a max for the marine fouled tandem cylinders with s d 3 4 5 6 and 7 varies by 12 11 5 2 and 7 respectively relative to that of the isolated marine fouled cylinder interestingly the positive values belong to the spacing ratios s d 4 and 5 which presented a galloping type of response and the negative values belong to those with a viv like s d 3 6 and 7 in the smooth tandem arrangements in addition to the sign the values seem also to speak a higher positive ratio 11 in the marine fouled tandem cylinders associates with an s d 4 which demonstrates a stronger galloping response in the smooth tandem arrangements a lower negative ratio 12 in the marine fouled tandem cylinders associates with an s d 3 which demonstrates a lower viv like response with the smooth tandem arrangements with the marine fouled tandem cylinder a max occurs at u 7 4 8 6 8 6 8 3 6 3 and 5 9 for s d 3 4 5 6 7 and the isolated cylinder respectively this shows that in tandem arrangements the u at a max on average increased around 33 relative to that in the isolated marine fouled cylinder the u at a max has its highest values at s d 4 and 5 which showed a galloping type of response in the smooth tandem arrangements the u at a max with s d 3 6 and 7 are closer to that of the isolated marine fouled tandem cylinder these spacing ratios showed a viv like response in the smooth tandem arrangements with the smooth tandem arrangements the amplitude responses of all tandem and single cylinders almost collapse together prior to u 5 fig 7 which nearly marks the end of the initial branch in the single smooth cylinder with the marine fouled tandem cylinder the amplitude responses of the tandem and single cylinders overlay neither before nor after u 5 beyond a max with the marine fouled tandem cylinders a does not fall as rapidly as that in the isolated marine fouled cylinder this is more pronounced with those spacing ratios s d 4 and 5 which demonstrated a galloping type of response under the smooth tandem arrangement fig 11 shows that with all tandem s ds the synchronisation zone is broader than that from the isolated cylinder similar observations were reported by park et al 2014 who worked on cylinders with passive turbulence control ptc beyond a max the a decay rate in the marine fouled tandem cylinders is inversely related to the spacing ratio one exception is the cylinder at s d 3 where its oscillation mechanism seems to differ due to proximity effects fig 12 compares the amplitude responses of the oscillating downstream smooth and marine fouled tandem cylinders at s d 4 and s d 7 it is reiterated that at s d 4 the smooth tandem cylinder exhibits galloping and the marine fouled tandem cylinder a viv like response at s d 7 both the smooth and the marine fouled tandem cylinders demonstrate a viv like response fig 12 exemplifies the extent of suppression provided by the fouling to oscillations of cylinders in the tandem arrangement as it can be seen the marine fouling caused around 65 and 40 reduction in a max at s d 4 and 7 respectively the frequency responses of the downstream marine fouled cylinders at different tandem gaps are presented in fig 13 the figure also includes the frequency response of the isolated elastically mounted marine fouled circular cylinder s pp for comparison the plots include a line for natural frequency of the system f 1 and the st 0 2 line in general the frequency signatures in the marine fouled tandem cylinders t pp 3d to t pp 7d are rather similar to those in the isolated elastically mounted marine fouled s pp circular cylinder fig 13 for u 5 the frequency responses gather around the st 0 2 line however the f data points for the marine fouled cylinders at spacing ratios of s d 4 5 and 7 intermittently jump atop the st 0 2 line similar intermittent jumps were also noticed in the smooth tandem cylinders at the same spacing ratios see fig 8 around u 5 all f curves in the marine fouled tandem cylinders diverge from the st 0 2 line then almost linearly curve up at a slope noticeably lower than st 0 2 line from the f 1 line for u 5 the overall f trends in tandem marine fouled arrangements t pp 3d to t pp 7d remain very similar to that with the s pp cylinder fig 13 and also to those from viv like responses t sm 3d t sm 6d and t sm 7d in the smooth tandem cylinders fig 8 but all differ from the f trend observed with the galloping responses t sm 4d and t sm 5d in the smooth tandem cylinders fig 8 with the latter the f data points for u 5 crowd more closely around f 1 line the f trend in fig 13 mainly stems from the fact that all downstream marine fouled cylinders demonstrate a viv like response regardless of the spacing ratio and no galloping occurs once again the u at which f curves up from f 1 line seems to differ in the six marine fouled cylinders fig 13 the corresponding values are u 4 6 4 9 5 1 5 3 5 5 and 5 2 respectively for s pp t pp 3d t pp 4d t pp 5d t pp 6d t pp 7d arrangements they all are smaller than their corresponding values with the smooth tandem cylinders fig 8 with the marine fouled tandem cylinders however the u at f departure shows a rather increasing trend with the spacing ratio fig 14 provides sample 3d views of the normalised power spectral densities psd at s d 4 and s d 7 psd plots in fig 14 are multiple peaked for u 5 the highest peak typically descends around the st 0 2 line but some also sparsely move up towards the f 1 line beyond u 5 the psd s appear to be single peaked and array on a line at a slope noticeably lower than st 0 2 line no plateau is evident neither in the standard lock in area nor at high reduced velocities in general the psd s in fig 14 resemble the psd plots in fig 9 for the smooth tandem at spacing ratios presenting a viv like response fig 15 provides the lift force coefficient c lrms in the downstream marine fouled cylinder at s d 3 to 7 the figure also includes the c lrms in the isolated elastically mounted marine fouled cylinder for comparison the maximum c lrms with the isolated smooth cylinder is 1 67 and reduces on average to around 1 10 for the tandem cylinders with different spacing ratios 34 mean reduction the maximum c lrms in the marine fouled tandem cylinders relative to the smooth tandem cylinders also shows on average around 33 reduction this means that the maximum lift force coefficient in the marine fouled cylinder is thus mitigated both by the wake from the upstream cylinder and by the fouling the total reduction in maximum c lrms from an isolated smooth cylinder to a marine fouled tandem cylinder is around 54 on average for u 4 the c lrms data in fig 15 are very dispersed which shows a little or no discernible trend at different spacings for 4 u 5 the c lrms values move rather close to each other at high reduced velocities in contrast to the smooth cylinder in tandem fig 10 c lrms values for all marine fouled tandem cylinders progressively decline to around zero with no sign of a residue value this trend can also be noticed with the isolated marine fouled cylinder further comparison between the amplitude responses fig 11 and the c lrms data for the marine fouled tandem cylinders seems to be interesting for example at around u 11 the c lrms from different spacing ratios approaches the zero line see fig 15 but the cylinders still oscillate at relatively high amplitudes see fig 11 for instance at u 11 the c lrms at s d 4 reduces to 18 of the maximum c lrms but the a stays at 83 of the corresponding a max in the absence of a high lift force these oscillations appear to be mostly motivated by the wake flow of the upstream cylinder 4 closing remarks the viv like and wiv responses of smooth cylinders in tandem arrangements have already been investigated by other researchers however the marine fouling effect on the wake induced vibration of tandem circular cylinders has not received attention in the literature in water towing tank laboratory tests were conducted on tandem cylinders with artificial marine fouling a flexibly mounted rigid cylinder was tested downstream a fixed similar cylinder spacing ratios of s d 3 to 7 were examined experiments conducted on isolated marine fouled cylinders indicated that the fouling acted as a viv suppression tool it favourably reduced the lock in range the hydrodynamic forces the shedding frequency and the maximum amplitude of oscillations as compared to those of the isolated smooth cylinder experiments conducted on marine fouled tandem cylinders showed that with all spacing ratios tested the oscillating cylinder demonstrated a viv like response interestingly and in contrast to the smooth tandem cylinders no galloping or wiv type of response was observed with the marine fouled tandem cylinders among different marine fouled tandem configurations tested a max was around 35 of a max with the smooth tandem cylinders and 0 55 of that of the isolated smooth cylinder in the near wake of the upstream cylinder s d 4 and 5 a max was slightly higher than that of the isolated marine fouled cylinder the maximum c lrms in the marine fouled tandem cylinders showed around 33 reduction on average relative to those in smooth tandem configurations and around 34 reduction relative to that in the isolated marine fouled cylinder at high reduced velocities in contrast to the smooth cylinders in tandem c lrms curves for the marine fouled tandem cylinders did not show a residue value and progressively approached the zero line meanwhile the downstream marine fouled tandem cylinder showed relatively high amplitudes in the lack of major lift forces high oscillations were attributed to the wake flow of the upstream cylinder in summary the study showed that the marine fouling provides contradictory practical effects in the case of tandem circular cylinders the fouling eliminates the galloping and suppresses the viv like response in tandem circular cylinders which is most beneficial from structural integrity standpoint however for the same reason the fouling would negatively affect the energy harvested in a marine hydrokinetic energy converter when the cylinders are arranged in tandem to benefit from their large galloping oscillations the fouling in the current study was simulated by uniformly distributed single sized pyramids machined on the surface of the test cylinders in reality the fouling texture is irregular and of non uniform thickness hard and soft fouling cohabit the fouling structure varies temporarily and spatially the fiv in a group of cylinders with soft fouling with irregular and or partial distributions of the fouling and in two degrees of freedom as well as direct measurement and evaluation of the fiv hydrokinetic energy harvesting performance can be considered as parts of future studies credit authorship contribution statement a

21502,this paper reports the results of laboratory in water experiments in which artificially marine fouled circular cylinders were freely vibrating in the wake of a similar fixed upstream cylinder cross flow vibrations at gaps of 3 7 diameters were examined the marine fouling was simulated by cnc machining of uniformly distributed single sized pyramids on the surface of the test cylinders depending on the spacing ratio the smooth tandem cylinder demonstrated both vortex induced vibration viv and galloping types of response interestingly only the viv like response was presented by the artificially marine fouled cylinder the maximum amplitude of the oscillations and maximum lift force coefficient of the marine fouled tandem cylinders were respectively around one third and two thirds of those in the corresponding smooth tandem cylinders in the case of tandem circular cylinders the marine fouling showed two contradictory outcomes it eliminated the galloping and suppressed the viv

towers which include a bundle of several tightly spaced risers or a group of closely spaced cylinders in a vivace vortex induced vibration aquatic clean energy harvesting device previous researchers have provided valuable insights into the flow induced forcing mechanisms and vortex dynamics for a group of stationary cylinders e g igarashi 1981 zdravkovich 1997a lin et al 2002 alam et al 2003 alam 2014 2016 wang et al 2018 more recent reviews on the subject can be found in sumner 2010 zhou and alam 2016 sumner and reitenbach 2019 and derakhshandeh and alam 2019 the flow interference in tandem stationary cylinders was categorised by previous researchers into i extended body regime when no vortex is shed in the gap and the shear layers from the upstream cylinder reattach those shed past the downstream cylinder ii reattachment regime in which two recirculation zones appear in the gap between the cylinders and iii co shedding regime which occurs when a sufficiently large spacing exists between the two cylinders ma et al 2019 flow induced vibration fiv of non stationary tandem circular cylinders however has received comparatively less attention huera huarte and jiménez gonzález 2019 bokaian and geoola 1985 studied two circular cylinders in tandem arrangements they reported that depending on the u the response could be of either viv or galloping type the latter was called wake induced galloping wig phenomena brika and laneville 1997 conducted wind tunnel experiments on two flexible tandem cylinders and noticed hysteresis in the downstream cylinder response hover and triantafyllou 2001 conducted in water experiments on two aluminium tandem cylinders at spacing ratio of s d 4 75 this spacing ratio was supposed to provide large amplitude oscillations zdravkovich 1985 phase shifts between the lift force and the cylinder displacement were noticed and attributed to the change of vortex shedding mode from 2s to 2p the wake induced vibration wiv of a flexible cylinder at the wake of another cylinder with various cross sections and tapers was also studied e g by assi et al 2006 2010 2013 kim et al 2009a 2009b carmo et al 2010 zeinoddini et al 2014 qin et al 2017 and tamimi et al 2017 2018 some of the previous studies categorised the response of tandem cylinders in i viv ii galloping and iii transition from viv to galloping the viv or resonant type of response occurs due to the resonance or lock in where the natural frequency f n coincides with the vortex shedding frequency f v galloping also called wig and wiv was defined as a velocity dependent damping controlled instability that gives rise to the transverse motions of the structure vicente ludlam et al 2015 with this response category as the wind or current speed increases the oscillations are greatly magnified païdoussis et al 2010 some researchers studied the flow induced motions of two tandem cylinders which were free to oscillate in one or two degrees of freedom 1 or 2 dof for example kim et al 2009 experimentally studied the fiv characteristics of two tandem cylinders in a closed circuit wind tunnel huang and herfjord 2013 examined two elastically supported circular tandem cylinders at varying spacing more recent experimental and cfd computational fluid dynamics studies include ding et al 2015 kim and bernitsas 2016 ma et al 2017 sun et al 2017 xu et al 2019 sun et al 2019 narváez et al 2020 effective suppressing or at least control of the fiv is an important since these vibrations are have been the cause of many structural failures xu et al 2018 unlike previous efforts to suppress the viv bernitsas et al 2008 successfully utilised this potentially damaging phenomenon for renewable energy harvesting purposes by introducing vivace nevertheless in vivace the energy conversion efficiency of a single cylinder was quite low this stemed from the fact that a smooth circular cylinder presents a viv type of response which is self excited and self restricted dai et al 2016 the maximum viv amplitude remains around 1d and the high amplitude vibration occurs only within a small bandwidth called the lock in region where the vortex shedding frequency is around the structure s natural frequency moreover with a small fluctuation of flow speed the harvested power drastically decreases this limits the vivace performance in real environments with stochastic or varying vibration spectra therefore recently significant research has been devoted to enhance the performance and efficiency of the fiv energy harvesting galloping or wiv commences at values of u beyond the peak viv response amplitude it is not self limited and the response amplitude may exceed 3d bernitsas et al 2008 or 3 5d ding et al 2013 high galloping vibrations have become attractive for vivace converters as they significantly increase the efficiency and power density of the harnessed marine hydrokinetic energy bibo et al 2015 for this reason researchers working on marine renewable energy have recently concentrated on wiv type of response of cylinders in tandem arrangements from which back to back viv and galloping are achieved sun et al 2017 2018 2019 ding et al 2019 xu et al 2019 song et al 2020 on the other hand it is only a matter of time before marine fouling covers the surface of the subsea man made structures marine fouling increases the outer diameter weight and surface roughness thus changes the flow regime around the body and the hydrodynamic force coeficients a number of researchers have addressed the effects of surface roughness on the vortex shedding of isolated cylindrical bodies a brief review of these studies was provided by zeinoddini et al 2016 the effects of the marine fouling on the viv of single circular cylinders were studied by zeinoddini et al 2017 2018 and jadidi et al 2018 studies on the vortex shedding and fiv of rough cylinders in the tandem arrangement are limited okajima 1979 conducted wind tunnel tests to study the in line vibration response of tandem circular cylinders at spacing ratios of s d 3 and 5 the upstream cylinder was rough but the downstream cylinder remained smooth the desired roughness was produced by glueing polystyrene beads on the surface of the test cylinders relative roughness of 0 9 cases of full and partial coverage were considered and the wake structure was analysed using the smoke visualisation method variations of the vibration amplitude the drag force coefficient and strouhal number at different spacing ratios were analysed and reported ding et al 2015 conducted experimental and numerical urans unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes studies on the cross fiv and energy harvesting performance of three tandem cylinders with rough strips the maximum amplitude of the upstream cylinder reached 2 8d the total power increased with increasing flow velocity the peak harvested power was around 85w more recently yang et al 2019 studied the effect of roughness strips on the vibrations and flow field around two staggered circular cylinders despite the aforementioned valuable studies a question still remains does the fouling amplify or suppress the fiv response of cylinders in tandem configuration what are the fouling impacts on the integrity of the structure and on the energy harnessed from the fiv of tandem circular oscillators this paper reports the results of in water fiv experiments on a freely vibrating artificially marine fouled circular cylinder in the wake of another fixed similar cylinder gaps of 3 7 diameters are examined the fouling is simulated by machining uniformly distributed single sized pyramids on the surface of the test cylinders the 1 dof vibrating system has a low mass damping parameter and the reynolds number ranges from around 6 103 to 6 104 the authors are not aware of previously published studies on the fiv of tandem marine fouled cylinders 2 experimental set up 2 1 towing facility and test cylinders the current in water fiv experiments were carried out in the towing tank of marine engineering laboratory sharif university of technology the tank is 25 m long 2 5 m wide and 1 7 m deep the facility is able to deliver a maximum towing speed of 4 m s with an accuracy of 0 001 m s two vertical rigid cylinders of similar size were towed in tandem arrangements the test cylinders were made from as received thick walled aluminium circular tubes top of the upstream cylinder was rigidly fixed through a supporting structure to the carriage the downstream cylinder was free to oscillate transversely in a 1 degree of freedom 1 dof mass spring system two steel leaf springs provided the restoring force with a total stiffness of 210 n m a general view of the towing tank and a schematic representation of the test cylinders in the tandem arrangement are given in fig 1 end effects may bring vortex dislocation oblique shedding or tip flow phenomenon during the tests special cares were taken to avoid span wise shedding inhomogeneity along the cylinder to this end a large diameter circular endplate was attached to the lower end of the upstream test cylinder the diameter and thicknesses of the end plate were chosen as per stansby 1974 and morse et al 2008 recommendations a distance of around 400 mm remained between the end plate and the tank s bottom the plate edges were carefully chamfered to minimise possible interferences with the incoming flow as per morse et al 2008 a gap of approximately 2 mm 0 032d was maintained between the end plate and the downstream cylinder see fig 1b 2 2 marine fouling modelling the fouling deposition is a complicated biological process and is influenced by many factors such as water depth current speed direction wave height drection temperature nutrients light salinity predation and bottom topography amerioun 2015 different fouling organisms are in constant competition for space food and light jusoh and wolfram 1996 hard and soft fouling often cohabit in a marine fouling community the fouling structure varies temporarily and spatially so it is almost impossible to predict its actual future morphology the current laboratory study only considers hard fouling the hard marine fouling was simulated as regular pyramidal protrusions on the surface of the test cylinders fig 1 such a configuration admittedly varies from the actual conditions but despite its simplicity and regular anatomical structure it can be a cornerstone for understanding the effect of marine fouling on fiv of tandem circular cylinders thus the current study should mainly be viewed as the first initiative on the subject for comparison purposes all tests conducted on cylinders with artificial marine fouling were repeated on smooth bare cylinders with the same outer diameters and lengths the smooth test cylinders were machined from aluminium tubes they had a finished outer diameter of d o 65 mm the inner diameter of d i 45 mm immersed length of l i 400 mm and aspect ratio r a of 6 15 the test cylinder with regular pyramidal protrusion is hereafter called the marine fouled cylinder the size of the pyramidal protrusions was close to those used by wolfram and theophanatos 1989 in their experiments on stationary cylinders and by zeinoddini et al 2016 in their viv tests on single circular cylinders each pyramid had a square base of 7 7 mm and was 3 mm tall fig 1 the relative roughness e k d o was equal to 0 048 physical properties for the cylinders and the testing system are summarised in table 1 table 2 lists the tests conducted on smooth and marine fouled cylinders in the isolated or tandem configurations table 1 reports the in air damping ratios that are commonly used to define m ξ parameter williamson and govardhan 2008 the ξ values were obtained from in air free decay tests and expectedly remained almost the same for the smooth cylinder and cylinder with pyramidal surface protrusions jadidi et al 2018 conducted in water decay tests on smooth and marine fouled cylinders they reported that the in water ξ is higher than the corresponding in air ξ due to hydrodynamic damping effects marine fouled cylinders also demonstrate higher in water ξ as compared to in water ξ of the smooth cylinder jadidi et al 2018 2 3 instruments two sets of wheatstone full bridge strain gauge circuits were arranged near the far ends of the two leaf springs in the supporting system in order to record the displacement of the downstream test cylinder the flexible support was designed to remain elastic throughout the viv tests therefore the strains on the leaf springs remained essentially linear in phase and proportional to the cylinder transverse displacements before conducting each test series the strain gauges on the leaf springs were calibrated by applying a range of predefined lateral point displacements at the mid length of the cylinder the calibration tests demonstrated a linear elastic relationship between the strain gauge outputs and the displacement variations with no perceptible hysteresis the ratio between the strain gauge outputs and the displacement of the cylinder was used to convert the strain data to time series of the cylinder transverse displacement a similar approach was considered by some previous researchers in their viv experiments for example assi et al 2006 zeinoddini et al 2013 tamimi et al 2019 2020 jadidi and zeinoddini 2020 the instantaneous fluid forces acting on the downstream cylinder in the cross flow and stream wise directions were recorded using a bi directional fabricated load cell placed on top of the cylinder fig 1 the data provided by the load cell however did not directly reflect the lift force exerted by vortices to the cylinder this stemmed from the fact that the stress data was also affected by the inertia forces generated by the cylinder acceleration therefore the inertia force was subtracted from the load cell data to obtain the lift force the measurement devices used in the test set up were calibrated before each test series the test data was recorded using the tml da 37a dynamic data acquisition system at a frequency of 200 hz the unsolicited noises generated during the experiment were removed from the measured signals using savitzky and golay s 1964 filtering technique the response signals provided by the measurement devices were often non stationary the hilbert transform ht amplitude was thus used to define the amplitude of the oscillations ht treats the response as a rotating vector with an instantaneous phase angle and an instantaneous amplitude the procedure was already used for example by hahn 1996 khalak and williamson 1999 huera huarte and bearman 2011 and zeinoddini et al 2015 to study the viv response of isolated cylinders more descriptions about the method can be found in khalak and williamson 1999 flow visualisation was performed using coloured dye to reveal the vortex patterns behind the oscillating cylinder the dye was forced from a containment reservoir into the fluid flow through a needle at upstream of the oscillating cylinder the images obtained from the flow visualisation were more or less sufficient for qualitative investigations and visual interpretations of the fluid regime 2 4 uncertainties and errors one source of uncertainty in the current experiments was originated from the carriage speed which defined the free stream velocity the carriage travel times over a fixed length were measured in some trial runs the results showed that the mean towing speed remained within 1 2 of the nominal speed forces measured in a finite body of water may differ from those expected in an infinite stream this is referred to as the blockage effect and in the current experiments it can be caused by the limited width of the towing tank if the ratio of the channel width w to the cylinder diameter d o is greater than 10 and re 300 no force correction is necessary zdravkovich 1997b in the current experiments the blockage ratio w d o was 19 5 and re exceeded 6000 based on a formulation provided by ersdal 2004 a waiting time of 10 min was also observed between two consecutive runs the finished dimensions of the cylinders and the pyramids were controlled using a slide calliper at random locations the readings on the diameter of the smooth and the roughened cylinders were within 0 06 and 0 1 mm from the nominal values respectively for each cylinder the mass was estimated using a calibrated digital weight measuring device with an accuracy of 0 2 the moving mass in the spring system was estimated based on nominal dimensions of the moving parts and the density of materials using a functional multivariable approach hughes and hase 2010 and assuming that the uncertainties in participating variables were uncorrelated the uncertainty ranges in the current experimental set up were used to estimate the error propagations for non dimensional response parameters such as a c l f and u the details can be found in zeinoddini et al 2017 2 5 set up validation a series of viv tests were performed on a single vertical smooth cylinder s sm to validate the experimental set up fig 2 a provides the non dimensional amplitude a versus the reduced velocity u of the current isolated smooth model along with the results of low mass damping cylinders in khalak and williamson 1999 and franzini et al 2013 experiments three standard i initial ii upper and iii lower branches which characterise the amplitude response of the smooth low mass damping cylinders can be recognised in the three test results the onset of the oscillations and the maximum amplitude a max in the three studies are in reasonable agreement in addition the initial branches from the three studies almost overlay over the lower branch the amplitude of the oscillations a from the current study remains relatively close to those obtained by khalak and williamson 1999 but both are smaller than those from franzini et al 2013 reasonable agreement can be observed for the width of the lock in region the position of the a max in the course of u and the lock out zones in the current study and those in khalak and williamson 1999 at the upper and lower branches of the response amplitude a data obtained by franzini et al 2013 differs to some degree from the other two studies williamson and govardhan 2008 derived simple relationships to predict a max for a 1 dof wake oscillator model this gives an estimation of a max 0 97 for the smooth cylinder used in the current study which is close to the current test results a max 1 03 fig 2b depicts the non dimensional frequency f versus the u for the single smooth cylinder s sm in the present study the frequency of the cross flow oscillations in khalak and williamson 1999 and franzini et al 2013 studies are also included in the figure over the initial branch of the oscillation amplitude f data points from khalak and williamson 1999 array partly around the f 1 line and partly about the st 0 2 line f data points from the present and franzini et al 2013 study array around the st 0 2 line without jumps to the f 1 line this might be attributed to differences in the test arrangements in these studies the viv tests in franzini et al 2013 and the present studies were carried out in towing tanks on flexibly mounted rigs wherein no hysteresis expectedly occurs under decrementing and incrementing flow speeds khalak and williamson 1999 carried out their tests in a recirculating water channel using air bearing rigs the viv tests included both decrementing and incrementing flow speeds the dispersion of the f data points on the f 1 and st 0 2 lines are likely to portrait the hysteresis effects in the khalak and williamson 1999 tests over the lock in region f runs close but slightly above unity indicating that the forcing and the natural frequencies are close and the system is prone to dynamic amplification a number of fiv tests were also conducted on two smooth tandem circular cylinders with the aim to verify the functionality of the current testing setup in tandem arrangements with this configuration the upstream cylinder remained fixed but the downstream cylinder was free to vibrate in the cross flow direction sample response amplitudes for the downstream smooth cylinders in two tandem arrangements at s d 4 and s d 5 are presented in fig 3 the figure compares the results from the current study with those of low mass damping smooth circular cylinders from assi et al 2006 at s d 4 and hover and triantafyllou 2001 at s d 4 75 in contrast to those in fig 2a all oscillation amplitudes in fig 3 exhibit a sustained increase in terms of u the current setup thus seems capable to capture the galloping type of response in tandem configurations for u 6 however the a results from the current study at s d 4 show relatively good agreement with those from assi et al 2006 for u 6 the a of the current study remains somewhat higher than that reported by assi et al 2006 reasonable agreement can be noticed between the present results on s d 5 and the experimental data from hover and triantafyllou 2001 at s d 4 75 it is noted that in a tandem arrangement the downstream cylinder could experience a beating phenomenon with continuous modulations of the oscillation amplitude park 2012 bakhtiari et al 2020 the beating manifests itself as two major frequencies in the upcoming psd plots see fig 9 the test duration thus had to be long enough to capture these phenomena in the towing tank experiments the number of informative viv and wiv cycles per test was limited by the length of the tank and the towing velocity in the current experiments depending on the towing speed tested at least 20 to 160 displacement cycles occurred in the steady state part of the cylinder responses the tests at high flow velocities were therefore repeated three times under similar conditions to increase the number of workable cycles for the viv and wiv data analysis fig 4 illustrates the displacement time series of the smooth cylinder in a tandem arrangement at s d 4 and u 5 5 and u 8 the horizontal axis in the figure was normalised by the mean period of the transverse oscillations t in summary the results current experimental measuremnts show reasonable agreement with experimental data from previous reaserchers in both isolated and tandem configurations of the smooth cylinder however some small discrepancies was still observed among different experimental results the differences can be attributed to dissimilarities in the experimental parameters e g regarding the mass ratios m the mass damping parameters m ζ the reynolds number ranges testing setups apparatus procedures and post processing of the test data in general it can be inferred that the current experimental arrangement and procedures is capable to provide accurate predictions of the fiv of tandem circular cylinders 3 results and

pp represent the smooth and the artificially marine fouled models the first s letter stands for singlr sm shows that the cylinder surface is smooth and pp shows that the cylinder surface is covered by pyramidal protrusions according to fig 5a the onset of oscillations in s sm and s pp cylinders remains nearly the same however the initial upper lower and the de synchronisation branches in s pp cylinder move noticeably below those in s sm cylinder with the single smooth cylinder s sm a max is 1 03 it reduces to 0 68 for the single marine fouled cylinder s pp a lower branch of around a 0 71 almost 69 of a max is well evident with s sm cylinder the same with s pp cylinder appears around a 0 57 almost 85 of a max with s sm and s pp cylinders a max occurs at u 5 6 and 5 0 respectively a max in the marine fouled cylinder thus shows a slight right hand shift in the course of u relative to that of the smooth cylinder the lock in range with s pp cylinder is slightly shorter in the course of u than that with s sm cylinder furthermore s pp cylinder locks out at smaller u as compared to that with s sm cylinder as an example a of the s pp model is equal to 0 17 at the end of lock in range u 8 which is 54 llower than that in s sm model above observations look analogous to kiu et al 2011 findings in their viv towing tank tests on circular cylinders covered by sandpapers they noticed that the surface roughness reduced the peak cross flow amplitude narrowed the lock in region and lowered the u for the lock out in the current study lock in referes to when the shedding frequency breaks from the st 0 2 line and stays close to the natural frequency of the system it is already known that in low mass damping cylinders the system does not perfectly lock onto one frequency over the lock in region f stays close to f 1 line but continues to increase as u increases klamo et al 2006 synchronisation on the other hand means that the shedding frequency breaks from the st 0 2 line but is matched to a frequency that is not necessarily close to the natural frequency fig 5b compares the frequency responses from s pp and s sm cylinders for u 5 the f data points from both cylinders cluster around the st 0 20 line the f values for the smooth cylinder however move rather above the st 0 20 line with the marine fouled cylinder f values for u 2 5 remain slightly above st 0 20 line but slightly below st 0 20 line for 2 5 u 5 the trend agrees with the bearman and harvey 1993 findings for vortex shedding past stationary cylinders under uniform flows they reported that surface irregularities lower the critical reynolds number whereat flow becomes turbulent relative to that in the corresponding smooth cylinder they also found that the shedding frequency in a cylinder with surface irregularity increases at subcritical reynolds numbers but decreases at higher reynolds numbers in comparison to those for a smooth cylinder for u 5 the non dimensional frequencies in both cylinders gradually curve up from the f 1 line but still move relatively close to it the f values for the marine fouled cylinder stay closer to the f 1 line fig 5c presents the root mean square of the lift force coefficient c lrms in s pp and s sm cylinders versus u for 2 u 4 2 c lrms curves for s pp and s sm cylinders almost coincide both c lrms curves reach their maximum around the far end of the initial branch of the oscillation amplitude then drop steadily to very small values at lock out flow velocity say u 9 the peak c lrms is 2 39 and 1 67 with s sm and s pp models respectively with the marine fouled cylinder the peak the peak c lrms in s pp cylinder occurs at a smaller u as compared to that for s sm cylinder for 4 4 u 9 the c lrms values for s pp cylinder run well below that of the smooth s sm cylinder as aforementioned the cross flow forces were recorded using a bi directional load cell placed immediately below the spring system the load cell data however included both the distributed lift and inertia force components the latter was subtracted from the total force to obtain the lift force component the inertia component was taken as the product of the structural mass hanging below the load cell by the transverse acceleration of the cylinder the acceleration was computed as the second order numerical derivative of the displacement time series due to the high structural rigidity in the tow direction the inline load cell data was considered as the drag force without any amendment for the inertia term in general the results presented in fig 5 indicate that the marine fouling acted to some extent as a viv suppression tool the fouling reduced the lock in range the hydrodynamic force coefficient the shedding frequency and the maximum amplitude of oscillations as compared to those from the corresponding smooth cylinder similar features were reported for the cross flow viv of helically straked circular cylinders zeinoddini et al 2015 the viv suppression caused by the marine fouling stems partly from the fact that the surface irregularities change the wake structure by interrupting the circumferential span wise correlation synchronisation of vortices shed from the marine fouled cylinder fig 6 a and b provide side snapshots of the flow field past s sm and s pp cylinders at the sample reduced velocity of u 3 1 re 1 9 104 the flow field past s pp cylinder shows a narrower band wake of relatively smaller vortices as compared to those behind s sm cylinder similar results were reported by zhou et al 2015 who studied the force and flow characteristics of smooth and rough dimpled stationary cylinders particle image velocimetry piv was used for quantitative measurement of the flow field past the cylinders fig 6c and d presents typical snapshots of the instantaneous flow field plus contours of span wise vorticity at re 9850 for the smooth and the dimpled cylinders according to fig 6c and d the wake narrowed and the vortices grew smaller with the rough cylinder as compared to those behind the smooth cylinder in general for both fixed and oscillating cylinders the size of vortices shed behind the roughened cylinders seemed shorter than that of the smooth cylinder the vortices past the marine fouled cylinder however had more turbulent structures than those past the smooth cylinder fig 6a and c small vortices and more narrow turbulent wakes past a cylinder can lower the total pressure drag thus the amplitude of the flow force acting on the cylinder these factors contribute to lowering the hydrodynamic force coefficients and the amplitude of oscillations in the marine fouled cylinder relative to those in the smooth cylinder 3 2 two smooth circular cylinders in tandem a number of fiv tests were conducted on two smooth circular cylinders at different tandem configurations fig 7 presents a of the smooth cylinder oscillating in the wake of a similar fixed upstream cylinder the results belong to the five spacing ratios tested s d 3 4 5 6 and 7 as well as that for an isolated smooth model s sm the figure shows that for all six cases the oscillations start around u 2 5 and that for u 5 all amplitude curves almost coincide it is noted that u 5 marks the far end of the initial branch for the single circular cylinder see fig 7 for u 5 a values demonstrate two distinct trends depending on the spacing ratio with the first trend a sustained increase in the oscillation amplitude could be noticed at s d 4 and 5 this type of oscillation was termed by previous researchers as galloping wig or wiv with this type of oscillation unsteady wake from the upstream cylinder and the vortices shed behind the downstream cylinder interact to steadily amplify the excitations in the downstream body the maximum a for the galloping type of response and over the u ranges tested is about 1 85d this is around 1 8 times of a max 1 03d in the single cylinder and belongs to the spacing ratio of s d 4 fig 7 the oscillating trend with the spacing ratios of s d 3 6 and 7 denotes the so called viv like xu et al 2019 or vortex resonance bokaian and geoola 1984 type of response in a viv like response a increases by the increase in u towards a peak of a 1 then progressively decreases it is reiterated that in the cross flow vibrations viv and galloping constitute two main sub categories of fiv viv of a cylinder in the cross flow direction occurs when shedding vortices e g the von karman vortex street create pressure differences around the cylinder which is coupled with the restoring force gabbai and benaroya 2005 however galloping is a hydro elastic instability characterised by high cross flow amplitudes and lower frequencies than viv it does not depend on vortex formation and occurs above a critical flow velocity depending on the flow speed the cross section geometry and oscillator properties viv and galloping may overlap separate or coexist in a transition region kinaci et al 2016 typically galloping is more robust and detrimental to the structural integrity than viv however in the galloping region the harvested mechanical power increases with increasing flow velocity and reynolds number as an example armandei and fernandes 2015 reported an almost 100 improvement in the performance of a galloping based hydrokinetic turbine as compared to a viv based turbine the results presented in fig 7 comply with those in assi et al 2006 experiments on the fiv of two smooth circular cylinders one difference is that at s d 3 their oscillating cylinder displayed an asymptotic amplitude behaviour which persisted up to u 35 assi et al 2010 also reported that beyond a critical spacing ratio the unstable shear layers of the upstream cylinder find enough space to effectively spin in the gap and to build up the vortices shed behind the downstream cylinder this critical spacing ratio depends on the re range and free stream turbulence intensity it fell between s d 2 and 3 in their work and falls between s d 3 and 4 in this work with two smooth tandem cylinders at s d 3 the cylinders were in the extended body regime the streamlines from the upstream cylinder reattached on the downstream cylinder in other words vortices were not shed in the gap but were formed past the downstream cylinder as a result the flow induced vibration of the tandem cylinder at this spacing ratio was similar to that for a single cylinder with two smooth tandem cylinders at s d 4 and 5 the gap ratio exceeded the critical spacing ratio wherein the downstream cylinder was excited by both its vortex shedding and vortices arriving from the upstream cylinder this led to a galloping type of oscillation whereby both the lift force coefficient and a stayed higher than their corresponding values in a viv type of response at s d 6 and 7 the system was inclined to a co shedding regime corresponding to a sufficiently large spacing between the two cylinders in this case the fluid forces and cylinder displacements moved once again close to that of the isolated smooth cylinder the frequency responses of downstream smooth cylinders at different tandem gaps are presented in fig 8 the figure also includes the frequency response of the isolated elastically mounted smooth cylinder s sm as it may be noticed for u 4 all f curves almost collapse on the st 0 2 line however at s d 4 5 and 7 the f data points occasionally jump atop the st 0 2 line with u 5 the frequency content of the galloping oscillations t sm 4d and t sm 5d differ from those with viv s sm or viv like t sm 3d and t sm 7d responnses data points for t sm 4d and t sm 5d are arranged more tightly around f 1 line as compared to those in s sm t sm 3d and t sm 7d configurations it means that over the galloping range of flow velocities say u 5 the actual oscillation frequency remained very close to the natural frequency f n of the downstream cylinder this characterises a region of high amplitude oscillations around f n at very low lift force coefficients with the viv s sm and viv like t sm 3d and t sm 7d arrangements the f data points cluster more loosely around the f 1 line this is more pronounced with the s sm cylinder it is noted that in general the frequency response of t sm 7d stays somewhere in between the galloping and viv type of oscillations the u at which f curves up from f 1 line seems to differ in the six specimens fig 8 this difference is also echoed in the amplitude responses fig 7 the corresponding values are u 5 1 5 8 7 2 7 1 6 8 and 6 3 respectively for s sm t sm 3d t sm 4d t sm 5d t sm 6d t sm 7d arrangements it can be noticed that with the galloping types of response t sm 4d and t sm 5d f departs from f 1 at higher reduced velocities the u at f departure is the smallest with viv s sm then with the viv like t sm 3d and t sm 7d types of oscillations besides the u at f departure shows some correlations with the a magnitude at high reduced velocities fig 7 interestingly with tandem arrangements a small local maximum appears in the tandem amplitude responses fig 7 around the u corresponding to f departure from f 1 fig 8 it is noted that the galloping phenomenon is generally characterised by the cross flow oscillations at lower frequencies and larger amplitudes than viv blevins 1990 blevins and coughran 2009 it occurs beyond a critical flow speed wherein the amplitude of the motions monotonically increases with the flow speed bearman et al 1987 fig 7 shows that the frequency and amplitude responses for t sm 5d and t sm 7d cylinders remained very similar for u 6 at higher velocities the oscillation amplitude monotonically increased and decreased for t sm 5d and t sm 7d cylinders respectively for u 6 the frequency response for t sm 5d cylinder stayed closer to f 1 as compared to that for t sm 7d cylinder the responses at s d 5 and 7 thus were categorised as galloping and viv respectively fig 9 provides sample 3d views of the normalised power spectral densities psd for one galloping s d 5 and one viv like s d 7 type of response individual psd s at a certain u are obtained by normalising the corresponding psd by its maximum power value assi et al 2010 this would scale all psds to have at least one dominant peak at psd 1 fig 9 b shows that in the galloping region u 6 frequency corresponding to the peak of the psds was close to f 1 line it is reiterated that for u 5 the frequency response in the galloping type of oscillations stayed closer to the natural frequency of the system as compared to those with the viv type of oscillations fig 9 a the aforementioned differences between the galloping and the viv like frequency responses can also be remarked in fig 9 fig 10 depicts c lrms against u for the downstream smooth cylinders at s d 3 to 7 the figure also includes the c lrms data from the isolated elastically mounted smooth cylinder s sm the maximum c lrms with the isolated smooth cylinder is 2 39 this equals to 1 42 1 71 1 51 1 76 and 1 77 at spacing ratios of s d 3 to 7 respectively therefore the maximum c lrms in the downstream cylinder is mitigated around 32 on average by the wake from the upstream cylinder the reduction varies from 26 to 41 depending on the spacing ratio the c lrms data points from each of the six configurations in fig 10 demonstrate a local peak over the 1 u 2 5 range the local c lrms peak can be ascribed by the lock on in a 2p mode of vortex shedding behind the oscillating cylinder which occurs at this range of u dong and karniadakis 2005 moreover the c lrms data points are widely dispersed most probably due to co occurrence of other shedding modes including c 2s s p and c s p modes in this range of reduced velocities zeinoddini et al 2018 over the 1 u 2 5 range no discernible trend emerges between the c lrms and the s d data over the aforementioned range of flow velocities over the 2 5 u 4 5 range the c lrms curves of different s d ratios run rather close to each other cylinders with a galloping type of response t sm 4d and t sm 5d show comparatively high c lrms values at u 7 in this region the mean c lrms is around 42 and 26 of the corresponding maximum c lrms with t sm 4d and t sm 5d respectively in the models with the viv s sm and viv like t sm 3d and t sm 7d types of oscillation the c lrms data points present quite a different trend as compared to those with a galloping response t sm 4d and t sm 5d with the viv like types of response t sm 3d and t sm 7d c lrms progressively reduces to small values at large u a similar trend can be noticed with the isolated circular cylinder s sm 3 3 two marine fouled circular cylinders in tandem fig 11 presents the amplitude response of a marine fouled cylinder oscillating in the wake of a fixed upstream similar marine fouled cylinder the results for the five gaps tested s d 3 4 5 6 and 7 as well as those for a single elastically mounted marine fouled circular cylinder are presented the amplitude responses in fig 11 are very interestingly different from those reported for the smooth tandem cylinders fig 7 in fact no galloping type of response is observed with the marine fouled tandem cylinders tested regardless of the spacing ratio a viv like response is demonstrated by the downstream marine fouled cylinder whereas a increases by the increase in u towards a peak a max 0 53 to 0 63 then progressively decreases at some tandem arrangements s d 4 and 5 the a max exceeds the a max in the isolated marine fouled cylinder a max 0 57 however in contrast to the smooth tandem cylinders fig 7 a in the marine fouled tandem cylinders remains always bounded the a max in fig 11 is 0 63d say around one third of a max observed with the smooth tandem cylinders 1 8d 0 61 of that of the smooth single cylinder 1 03d but still 11 higher than that of the isolated marine fouled cylinder 0 57d once again the fouling has suppressed the fiv of cylinders in tandem the amplitude responses in the smooth tandem cylinder yet show some spacing wise correlations with those from the marine fouled tandem cylinders for example a max for the marine fouled tandem cylinders with s d 3 4 5 6 and 7 varies by 12 11 5 2 and 7 respectively relative to that of the isolated marine fouled cylinder interestingly the positive values belong to the spacing ratios s d 4 and 5 which presented a galloping type of response and the negative values belong to those with a viv like s d 3 6 and 7 in the smooth tandem arrangements in addition to the sign the values seem also to speak a higher positive ratio 11 in the marine fouled tandem cylinders associates with an s d 4 which demonstrates a stronger galloping response in the smooth tandem arrangements a lower negative ratio 12 in the marine fouled tandem cylinders associates with an s d 3 which demonstrates a lower viv like response with the smooth tandem arrangements with the marine fouled tandem cylinder a max occurs at u 7 4 8 6 8 6 8 3 6 3 and 5 9 for s d 3 4 5 6 7 and the isolated cylinder respectively this shows that in tandem arrangements the u at a max on average increased around 33 relative to that in the isolated marine fouled cylinder the u at a max has its highest values at s d 4 and 5 which showed a galloping type of response in the smooth tandem arrangements the u at a max with s d 3 6 and 7 are closer to that of the isolated marine fouled tandem cylinder these spacing ratios showed a viv like response in the smooth tandem arrangements with the smooth tandem arrangements the amplitude responses of all tandem and single cylinders almost collapse together prior to u 5 fig 7 which nearly marks the end of the initial branch in the single smooth cylinder with the marine fouled tandem cylinder the amplitude responses of the tandem and single cylinders overlay neither before nor after u 5 beyond a max with the marine fouled tandem cylinders a does not fall as rapidly as that in the isolated marine fouled cylinder this is more pronounced with those spacing ratios s d 4 and 5 which demonstrated a galloping type of response under the smooth tandem arrangement fig 11 shows that with all tandem s ds the synchronisation zone is broader than that from the isolated cylinder similar observations were reported by park et al 2014 who worked on cylinders with passive turbulence control ptc beyond a max the a decay rate in the marine fouled tandem cylinders is inversely related to the spacing ratio one exception is the cylinder at s d 3 where its oscillation mechanism seems to differ due to proximity effects fig 12 compares the amplitude responses of the oscillating downstream smooth and marine fouled tandem cylinders at s d 4 and s d 7 it is reiterated that at s d 4 the smooth tandem cylinder exhibits galloping and the marine fouled tandem cylinder a viv like response at s d 7 both the smooth and the marine fouled tandem cylinders demonstrate a viv like response fig 12 exemplifies the extent of suppression provided by the fouling to oscillations of cylinders in the tandem arrangement as it can be seen the marine fouling caused around 65 and 40 reduction in a max at s d 4 and 7 respectively the frequency responses of the downstream marine fouled cylinders at different tandem gaps are presented in fig 13 the figure also includes the frequency response of the isolated elastically mounted marine fouled circular cylinder s pp for comparison the plots include a line for natural frequency of the system f 1 and the st 0 2 line in general the frequency signatures in the marine fouled tandem cylinders t pp 3d to t pp 7d are rather similar to those in the isolated elastically mounted marine fouled s pp circular cylinder fig 13 for u 5 the frequency responses gather around the st 0 2 line however the f data points for the marine fouled cylinders at spacing ratios of s d 4 5 and 7 intermittently jump atop the st 0 2 line similar intermittent jumps were also noticed in the smooth tandem cylinders at the same spacing ratios see fig 8 around u 5 all f curves in the marine fouled tandem cylinders diverge from the st 0 2 line then almost linearly curve up at a slope noticeably lower than st 0 2 line from the f 1 line for u 5 the overall f trends in tandem marine fouled arrangements t pp 3d to t pp 7d remain very similar to that with the s pp cylinder fig 13 and also to those from viv like responses t sm 3d t sm 6d and t sm 7d in the smooth tandem cylinders fig 8 but all differ from the f trend observed with the galloping responses t sm 4d and t sm 5d in the smooth tandem cylinders fig 8 with the latter the f data points for u 5 crowd more closely around f 1 line the f trend in fig 13 mainly stems from the fact that all downstream marine fouled cylinders demonstrate a viv like response regardless of the spacing ratio and no galloping occurs once again the u at which f curves up from f 1 line seems to differ in the six marine fouled cylinders fig 13 the corresponding values are u 4 6 4 9 5 1 5 3 5 5 and 5 2 respectively for s pp t pp 3d t pp 4d t pp 5d t pp 6d t pp 7d arrangements they all are smaller than their corresponding values with the smooth tandem cylinders fig 8 with the marine fouled tandem cylinders however the u at f departure shows a rather increasing trend with the spacing ratio fig 14 provides sample 3d views of the normalised power spectral densities psd at s d 4 and s d 7 psd plots in fig 14 are multiple peaked for u 5 the highest peak typically descends around the st 0 2 line but some also sparsely move up towards the f 1 line beyond u 5 the psd s appear to be single peaked and array on a line at a slope noticeably lower than st 0 2 line no plateau is evident neither in the standard lock in area nor at high reduced velocities in general the psd s in fig 14 resemble the psd plots in fig 9 for the smooth tandem at spacing ratios presenting a viv like response fig 15 provides the lift force coefficient c lrms in the downstream marine fouled cylinder at s d 3 to 7 the figure also includes the c lrms in the isolated elastically mounted marine fouled cylinder for comparison the maximum c lrms with the isolated smooth cylinder is 1 67 and reduces on average to around 1 10 for the tandem cylinders with different spacing ratios 34 mean reduction the maximum c lrms in the marine fouled tandem cylinders relative to the smooth tandem cylinders also shows on average around 33 reduction this means that the maximum lift force coefficient in the marine fouled cylinder is thus mitigated both by the wake from the upstream cylinder and by the fouling the total reduction in maximum c lrms from an isolated smooth cylinder to a marine fouled tandem cylinder is around 54 on average for u 4 the c lrms data in fig 15 are very dispersed which shows a little or no discernible trend at different spacings for 4 u 5 the c lrms values move rather close to each other at high reduced velocities in contrast to the smooth cylinder in tandem fig 10 c lrms values for all marine fouled tandem cylinders progressively decline to around zero with no sign of a residue value this trend can also be noticed with the isolated marine fouled cylinder further comparison between the amplitude responses fig 11 and the c lrms data for the marine fouled tandem cylinders seems to be interesting for example at around u 11 the c lrms from different spacing ratios approaches the zero line see fig 15 but the cylinders still oscillate at relatively high amplitudes see fig 11 for instance at u 11 the c lrms at s d 4 reduces to 18 of the maximum c lrms but the a stays at 83 of the corresponding a max in the absence of a high lift force these oscillations appear to be mostly motivated by the wake flow of the upstream cylinder 4 closing remarks the viv like and wiv responses of smooth cylinders in tandem arrangements have already been investigated by other researchers however the marine fouling effect on the wake induced vibration of tandem circular cylinders has not received attention in the literature in water towing tank laboratory tests were conducted on tandem cylinders with artificial marine fouling a flexibly mounted rigid cylinder was tested downstream a fixed similar cylinder spacing ratios of s d 3 to 7 were examined experiments conducted on isolated marine fouled cylinders indicated that the fouling acted as a viv suppression tool it favourably reduced the lock in range the hydrodynamic forces the shedding frequency and the maximum amplitude of oscillations as compared to those of the isolated smooth cylinder experiments conducted on marine fouled tandem cylinders showed that with all spacing ratios tested the oscillating cylinder demonstrated a viv like response interestingly and in contrast to the smooth tandem cylinders no galloping or wiv type of response was observed with the marine fouled tandem cylinders among different marine fouled tandem configurations tested a max was around 35 of a max with the smooth tandem cylinders and 0 55 of that of the isolated smooth cylinder in the near wake of the upstream cylinder s d 4 and 5 a max was slightly higher than that of the isolated marine fouled cylinder the maximum c lrms in the marine fouled tandem cylinders showed around 33 reduction on average relative to those in smooth tandem configurations and around 34 reduction relative to that in the isolated marine fouled cylinder at high reduced velocities in contrast to the smooth cylinders in tandem c lrms curves for the marine fouled tandem cylinders did not show a residue value and progressively approached the zero line meanwhile the downstream marine fouled tandem cylinder showed relatively high amplitudes in the lack of major lift forces high oscillations were attributed to the wake flow of the upstream cylinder in summary the study showed that the marine fouling provides contradictory practical effects in the case of tandem circular cylinders the fouling eliminates the galloping and suppresses the viv like response in tandem circular cylinders which is most beneficial from structural integrity standpoint however for the same reason the fouling would negatively affect the energy harvested in a marine hydrokinetic energy converter when the cylinders are arranged in tandem to benefit from their large galloping oscillations the fouling in the current study was simulated by uniformly distributed single sized pyramids machined on the surface of the test cylinders in reality the fouling texture is irregular and of non uniform thickness hard and soft fouling cohabit the fouling structure varies temporarily and spatially the fiv in a group of cylinders with soft fouling with irregular and or partial distributions of the fouling and in two degrees of freedom as well as direct measurement and evaluation of the fiv hydrokinetic energy harvesting performance can be considered as parts of future studies credit authorship contribution statement a

however the dominant factors for the modulation differ over different coastal regions and the relevant generation mechanisms have not been fully addressed in this study a delft3d wave current coupled model is applied to the southwestern bohai bay china which is a shallow water coast with a mild slope to estimate the local wave current interactions during extreme weathers the results indicate that the wave set up is strongly influenced by local bottom slope water depth and radiation stress gradient the mean current velocity is decreased by wave by up to 15 due to enhanced bottom roughness and the impact of momentum transfer from wave to current is non negligible both tidally varying depth and current are able to modulate significant wave height swh and their modulating abilities are increased and decreased onshore respectively furthermore the sensitivity studies suggest that the depth induced swh modulation is primarily due to the shoaling effect which is related to bottom slope the wind speed plays an important role on the depth and current induced swh modulation as it could affect the state of wind wave and wind input energy whereas wind direction change from onshore to offshore only results in remarkable changes of current induced modulation keywords wave current interactions tidal modulation of wind wave extreme weather numerical modelling 1 introduction interactions between wave and current are the vital processes in coastal areas and have been studied extensively since mid twentieth century longuet higgins and stewart 1964 mei 1983 tolman 1991 mellor 2003 in the past the interaction mechanisms were mostly established on the basis of theoretical works and field observations mei 1983 tolman 1990 wolf and prandle 1999 nowadays laboratory experiment rusu and soares 2011 numerical modelling hansen et al 2013 kang and kim 2015 hopkins et al 2016 yu et al 2017 and remote sensing ardhuin et al 2017a were combined to better understand the processes of wave current interactions based on the pioneering works of unna 1941 1942 1947 and barber 1949 longuet higgins and stewart 1960 1961 1962 1964 established the theory for wave current interaction by introducing the concept of radiation stress i e the wave induced excess momentum flux the radiation stress links the energy exchange between wave and current and enables the impact of wave on current motion to be considered subsequently whitham 1965 and bretherton and garrett 1968 further extended this theory and indicated that the wave action density defined as wave energy density divided by wave frequency is conserved in an adiabatic media the introduction of wave action overcomes the non conservation problem of wave energy density while wave propagating over current fields a comprehensive review of wave current interactions theory can be found in mei 1983 in the past two decades scholars dedicated to improve the wave current coupling approach by extending the classic theory to obtain depth dependent three dimensional radiation stress mellor 2003 2008 2015 ji et al 2017 and by developing a relatively new concept called vortex force mcwilliams and restrepo 1999 uchiyama et al 2010 bennis et al 2011 kumar et al 2012 the discussion of these two approaches ardhuin et al 2017b mellor 2016 2017 contributed to further the understanding of wave current interactions with the development of linear wave theory the phase averaged wave models were correspondingly developed and updated based on the wave action energy balance equation these phase averaged ocean wave models are better than the phase resolving ones at large scale wave simulation and multiple processes coupling according to the level of parameterization of the source and sink terms in wave equation the ocean wave model can be classified into three generation the first generation wave models gelci et al 1956 1957 were developed in the 1960s 1970s but the physical processes of wave generation dissipation and wave wave interactions had not been properly represented then the second generation wave models swamp group 1985 swim group 1985 were launched in 1980s in order to remedy the deficiencies by parameterizing physical processes and wave spectrum the formulation of the discrete interaction approximation by hasselmann et al 1985 led to the development of the third generation wave models in which all relevant processes were presented explicitly without a priori restrictions on the evolution of the spectrum booij et al 1999 after the wamdi group for the first time introduced a highly developed third generation wave model the wave modeling wam wamdi group 1988 the ocean wave models are flourishing and followed by the state of the art ocean models such as the wavewathch tolman 1991 wam 4 günther et al 1992 swan booij et al 1999 and mellor donelan oey mdo wave model mellor et al 2008 the wave current interactions during extreme weather conditions e g tropical cyclones and storm surges have drawn great interests in recent years and the numerical modeling is regarded as one of the powerful tools for estimating this issue fan et al 2009 brown et al 2013 hu et al 2015 kang and kim 2015 yu et al 2017 it is concluded that the wave tide interactions mechanism plays an important role in reproducing the sea surface elevation in extreme weather dietrich et al 2011 brown et al 2013 yu et al 2017 for example the wave induced surge can be strongly influenced by tide and varies in tidal cycles brown et al 2013 yu et al 2017 with respect to the impacts on wave both the water depth and current variation due to tide are able to generate tidal modulation i e periodic change for significant wave height swh mostly at a m2 period this phenomenon was investigated by field observations laboratory experiments and modelling works tolman 1990 wolf and prandle 1999 liu and xie 2009 hansen et al 2013 kang and kim 2015 hopkins et al 2016 viitak et al 2016 yu et al 2017 there were two commonly used methods to estimate the dominant factors of the tidal modulation which include 1 establishing the correlation between wave parameters and water depth tidal current wolf and prandle 1999 liu and xie 2009 hansen et al 2013 yu et al 2017 2 discussion on the impacts of individual depth current on wave by numerical simulations moon 2005 kang and iorio 2006 hansen et al 2013 kang and kim 2015 hopkins et al 2016 viitak et al 2016 wang and sheng 2018 interestingly the dominant factors for the tidal modulation of wave come out to be different in different regions which are largely depended on local dynamic conditions one group of researchers attributed this tidal modulation to the water depth oscillation liu and xie 2009 kang and kim 2015 viitak et al 2016 yu et al 2017 and the other group of researchers attributed the modulation to the current variation tolman 1990 hansen et al 2013 hopkins et al 2016 this discrepancy has not been widely recognized and addressed and tolman 1990 once suggested that it might be relevant to the change rate in local water depth and current main documented studies on the tidal modulation of wave are listed in table 1 the bohai bay in the north of china fig 1 is a shallow water bay where the mean water depth is only 13 m our study area lies in the southwestern bohai bay that is a silt muddy coast with a rather mild slope of 1 3000 the tidal form number f h k1 h o1 h m2 h s2 where h is the tidal amplitude in this region is less than 0 5 which indicates this coast is mainly dominated by regular semidiurnal tide i e the m2 tide as the local m2 tidal wave rotates in counter clockwise direction in the bohai bay the tidal current in the study area appears a counterclockwise rotation and has stronger intensity and shorter duration in flood period compared to those in ebb period therefore flood dominated under the influence of the large scale weather systems the study area is known to be vulnerable to the extreme weather event cold front with a spatially uniform unidirectional and long lasting wind field kuang et al 2015 mo et al 2016 feng et al 2018 song et al 2020 wind wave accounts for 79 of the wave in the study area because of the long wind fetch the prevailing strong winds from ene to e feng et al 2008 lv et al 2014 mo et al 2016 could produce considerable wind wave on the silt muddy coast thus resulted in severe sediment siltation in the waterway of local huanghua harbor during windy days zhao 2007 zhang et al 2010 kuang et al 2015 this study focuses on the wave current interactions in southwest of bohai bay during extreme weather conditions and elucidates the related physical mechanisms with special attention to generation mechanisms for depth and current induced swh modulation it is therefore of practical significance to further the understanding of potential causes for local waterway siltation and tidal modulation of wave in other similar regions this study aims to 1 estimate the cross shore variation of wave parameters in wave only situation 2 assess the modulation of wave induced surge and the modification of current velocity due to wave effects 3 investigate the tidal modulation of swh induced by water depth and current variation 4 examine the responses of cross shore pattern of swh modulation to wind speed wind direction bottom slope and current conditions 2 model description 2 1 numerical model delft3d the interactions between wave and current are modeled by the standard delft3d package lesser et al 2004 which has been widely used for modelling physical processes e g hydrodynamics and sediment transport in coasts estuaries and lakes deltares 2013a delft3d flow solves the unsteady shallow water equations using a finite difference scheme under the boussinesq and shallow water assumptions more details about delft3d flow were given in lesser et al 2004 and deltares 2013a delft3d wave is based on the third generation spectral wave model swan booij et al 1999 ris et al 1999 and it performs well in the evolution of random short crested wind generated waves in coastal environments deltares 2013b a detailed

momentum flux from wave to current then hydrostatic pressure gradient is forced to change to balance the wave forcing and results in the wave set up wave induced surge which can be estimated by the following vertically integrated momentum balance equation in 1d cross shore direction longuet higgins and stewart 1962 1964 here the calculation of wave set up η is conducted by delft3d flow while the gradient of radiation stress ds xx dx is transferred from delft3d wave note that here the positive direction of cross shore coordinate x is defined as onshore direction 8 d s x x d x ρ g h d η d x 0

radiation stress in a multi dimensional 2d 3d flow model has been proven to be capable to give a good performance in extreme weather conditions mastenbroek et al 1993 dietrich et al 2012 brown et al 2013 dissanayake et al 2014 liu et al 2018 this method was considered to be computationally efficient and provided a plausible solution in tide surge wave modelling brown et al 2013 the coupling methods between delft3d wave and delft3d flow can be one way or two way coupling which means the interactions i e information transfer between the two models are conducted unidirectionally and bidirectionally respectively in details the one way coupling is to consider one s impact on the other and not consider the feedback while the two way coupling accounts for the feedback and is more close to reality during the two way coupling the flow model firstly stores the information of water level and current velocity in a transfer communication file secondly the wave model takes out these variables and considers their impacts into wave kinematics then passes the results of wave model e g wave height wave direction and mass fluxes back to the communication file here the one way coupling is finished finally these impacts of current affected wave are taken into account in the next round flow computation and thus one round two way interaction is accomplished 3 model setup and validation 3 1 model setup the wave current interactions are simulated based on a nested hydrodynamic model the bathymetric data in year 2012 is used for the nested model the data is obtained by merging measured water depth in southwestern bohai bay with those derived from navigational chart of china with a maximum spatial resolution of 100 m around huanghua harbor the parent flow model covers the bohai sea with a rectangular uniform grid of 1000 m resolution 174840 elements and is forced by tidal levels at dalian and yantai fig 1b the tidal conditions are provided by the national marine data and information service of china which include 11 tidal constituents k1 o1 p1 q1 m2 s2 n2 k2 m4 ms4 mn4 the child flow model is computed on a boundary fitted curvilinear grid of 90 780 m resolution 88232 elements the child model is forced by three open boundaries with tidal levels which are extracted from the parent model fig 1b both the flow models divide the water column into uniform 10 layers in vertical direction the manning coefficient plays a key role in ocean circulation simulations and a constant 0 0145 s m 1 3 is used for the whole domain which is reasonable in the study region kuang et al 2015 the time step of flow model is 60 s and meets the requirement of courant number to improve the efficiency and accuracy of wave simulation at the same time the wave model is established on triple nested grids which cover the bohai sea resolution 2000 m the bohai bay resolution 600 m and the study area resolution 90 780 m the same as child flow model respectively as shown in fig 1b this wave current coupled model has been validated against the wave observation during a storm in 5 9th november 2003 in our another work where the wave model is forced by wind forcing only song et al 2020 the model evaluation suggests that the coupled model performs fairly well in significant wave height period with a correlation coefficient of 0 95 0 89 and a normalized root mean square error of 0 36 0 77 consequently the wave model in the present study is driven by surface wind data only and the offshore wave boundary condition is not considered for example in the model validation here section 3 2 the wave model is driven only by the surface wind data derived from reanalysis atmospheric product era interim of the european centre for medium range weather forecasts the reanalysis wind has a spatial resolution of 0 125 0 125 and a temporal resolution of 6 h which is linearly interpolated to computational grid and time step in accordance with most work of wave modelling rusu and soares 2011 gorrell et al 2011 hansen et al 2013 hopkins et al 2016 our wave model is run in a computationally efficient mode the stationary mode i e n t 0 in eq 6 in which wave propagation is assumed to be instantaneous throughout the model domain gorrell et al 2011 this assumption is reasonable for the wave simulation in small scale coastal region where the time scale of tidal variations is larger than that of wave traveling tolman 1990 gorrell et al 2011 a collins bottom friction coefficient collins 1972 of 0 01 is used in the wave model on the basis of optimum simulation in the bohai sea lv et al 2014 other physical parameters that are not mentioned use the default setting the coupling time interval between wave and current models is set to 60 min the wave current coupled model is initialized from the rest namely the initial conditions are prescribed to zero a 7 day spin up is conducted to achieve hydrodynamic stability prior to the period of interest 3 2 model validation fig 2 indicates that the modeled water level shows great fitness with the observed one with a pearson correlation coefficient r of 0 99 and percent bias pbias of 8 as can be seen the semi diurnal tidal cycles and spring neap tidal processes are well represented by the coupled model the comparison between modeled and observed current velocity fig 3 suggests that the model has a good performance in both magnitudes r 0 76 0 83 and directions r 0 82 0 97 during 15 16th october 2012 notably the current difference in the vertical direction is not significant in the study area since there is small difference between the surface results 0 5 m under the water surface and the bottom results 2 0 m above the sea bottom as shown in fig 4 the model produces reasonable results of swh in the caofeidian north of the bohai bay fig 1c during 5 11th november 2013 the modeled swh is a bit smaller than those of the observation pbias 15 1 possibly due to the underestimated ecmwf wind speed in the bohai sea lv et al 2014 and its limited temporal and spatial resolution as proved by song et al 2020 in comparison the modeled wave direction is generally consistent with the observed one with an acceptable performance in trends r 0 50 and magnitudes pbias 3 8 3 3 model runs based on the validated coupled model 36 model runs table 2 are conducted to estimate the wave current interactions in the southwestern bohai bay with special attention to the dominant factors for the local tidal modulation of swh the coastline in 2003 when the study region has not been strongly influenced by anthropogenic activities is adopted in all the model runs a constant 19 ms 1 easterly wind is designed to represent the high wind during local extreme weather condition according to the wind observation of one typical cold front event in october 2003 feng et al 2008 zhang et al 2012 the impacts of depth and current on wave can be estimated separately by passing the corresponding information from delft3d flow to delft3d wave one wave only model run run1a is conducted to examine the wind wave deformation in onshore direction one current only model run run1b is driven by the tidal and wind forcings with both current motion and tidal elevation firstly the wave only model run is one way coupled to the flow model without considering other forcings run2a therefore obtains the wave induced current and surge then the wave only model run is coupled to the current only model run in the manner of one way run2b and two way run2c coupling to estimate the modification of current velocity and water level due to the wave effects to investigate the dominant factors for swh modulation the impacts of depth run3a current run3b and both of depth and current run3c are respectively applied to the wave only model run based on the model run considering the impact of water depth variation run3a five additional process oriented model runs are conducted to pinpoint the driving mechanisms of depth induced modulation by ignoring the specified wave effects run3a fre run3a nl3 run3a ds w run3a ds b and run3a ds bk represent frequency shifting triads nonlinear wave wave interaction whitecapping bottom friction and breaking respectively furthermore the sensitivity studies with four series experiments are carried to explore the cross shore pattern of swh modulation against different wind speeds run4 wind directions run5 bottom slopes run6 and flow conditions run7 more detailed descriptions of model runs are listed in table 2 4 model results 4 1 wave deformation it is necessary to study the wave deformation along its propagating path since the wave impact is related to the incident wave condition based on the simulation considering wave forcing only run2a the 19 m s 1 easterly wind produces onshore traveling wind waves with a swh of 3 5 m in offshore that decreases gradually towards the coast color map in fig 5 a the isobaths are shown as contour lines in fig 5a the spatial distribution of the significant wave height follows that of the bathymetry due to the depth induced refraction given by the snell s law to obtain a clearer presentation of the wave characteristics variation a 35 0 km long cross shore section x is set in the middle of huanghua harbor and binzhou harbor fig 5a as shown in fig 5b the deformation of wind wave can be simply classified into three phases in phase i the wave is still in the relative deep water and only experiences a minor decrease in swh during this phase the dissipation of wave energy is primarily generated from the effects of whitecapping s ds w and bottom friction s ds b fig 5b as wave traveling towards the coast its swh decreases to 3 0 m and the wave begins to break at 10 0 m depth which is 30 0 km away from coast see red solid line of s ds bk in fig 5b in phase ii the energy dissipations due to bottom friction and breaking play an increasing role towards the coast whereas the dissipation due to whitecapping is decreased towards the coast the total dissipation rate sum of the three attains a maximum at the location of 7 m depth that is 17 km away from the coastline and the wave deformation enters the phase iii in which the energy dissipation due to breaking contributes the most and the swh decreases significantly onshore as a result of wave deformation the radiation stress that is associated with wave group velocity c g and wave energy e see eq 9 shows corresponding changes along the propagating path fig 5c in fact the controlling effect of radiation stress variation is different along the path before entering the surf zone phase i the wave energy is nearly conserved and the radiation stress is dominated by shoaling effect therefore a positive gradient of radiation stress i e radiation stress increases onshore in contrast in the surf zone the radiation stress is turned to be controlled by the dissipation due to wave breaking and thus corresponds to a negative gradient of radiation stress i e radiation stress decreases onshore guza and thornton 1981 brown et al 2013 in addition it is notable that the largest change in radiation stress occurs at the location where the dissipation due to breaking reaches its maximum ascribed to the radiation stress the water level is then forced to change to balance this wave induced force longuet higgins and stewart 1962 1964 consequently there will be a wave set down in offshore area and a wave set up in coast accordingly olabarrieta et al 2011 yu et al 2017 as can be seen in fig 5d the wave induced water level change reaches its lowest value of 0 03 m at the location where wave begins to break then it becomes increasing onshore with a maximum value wave set up of 0 06 m at the coast rim this modeled wave set up value closes to the analytical result of 0 03 m which is calculated by a well validated empirical formula proposed by ji et al 2018 given as η max 0 22 h 0 s 0 629 l 0 0 371 tan β 0 538 h o s is the swh in deep water l 0 is the corresponding wavelength and tanβ is the bottom slope 4 2 impacts of wave on water level and current 4 2 1 water level variation the wave tide interactions were supposed to impact the water level during extreme weather which relates with radiation stress gradient and varies by tidal phases brown et al 2013 yu et al 2017 in the situation of wave current two way coupling fig 6 the water level change induced by wave at high tide is relative small with a wave set up of 0 02 m at coast and a wave set down of 0 04 m in most of the study region fig 6a however the water level change at low tide differs from that at high tide and is more significant as the wave set up is up to 0 16 m and confined along the coast fig 6b it is noted that the wave set up in the eastern coast is smaller than that in the western coast and this spatial discrepancy is attributed to the bottom slope as the steeper slope is to have larger wave set up dietrich et al 2010 ji et al 2018 yu et al 2017 as for the temporal discrepancy the time series of water level at coastal station a location refer to fig 6a under different situations are given in fig 7 a the water levels from current only model run1b wave model one way coupled to current model run2b and wave current two way coupled model run2c experience similar variation pattern the difference between wave current coupled model and current only model represents the wave set up in one way coupling situation run2b the wave set up achieves its minimum at high tide then increases to the maximum at low tide black dashed line in fig 7b it is because in this one way coupling situation that the radiation stress gradient is unchanged the larger smaller water depth at high low tide will result in a smaller larger increase in wave set up according to eq 8 after considering the feedback from flow model in the two way coupling situation run2c the wave set up still obtains its minimum at high tide however its magnitude is decreased at low tide and increased at mid tide reaching a maximum of 0 14 m black dotted line in fig 7b this is because in two way coupling the tidal variation of depth and current modifies the radiation stress gradient i e wave induced mass flux transported onshore which can be represented by the swh difference between offshore area and coast brown et al 2013 it is clear that the tidal variation pattern of wave set up is highly correlated with that of swh difference cf black dotted line with red solid line in fig 7b suggesting here the impact of wave induced mass flux on wave set up modulation is more significant than that of tidal effect 4 2 2 current velocity modification the wave also generates considerable impacts on current motion and thus affects sediment resuspension and transport wang and pinardi 2002 lu et al 2009 liang et al 2018 the depth averaged current velocity field without considering the wave impact is averaged over one tidal cycle 12 4 h and shown in fig 8 a generally the mean current velocity decreases from 0 8 ms 1 in offshore area to 0 4 ms 1 in coastal area and there are two high velocity zones at the head of huanghua jetty and binzhou jetty due to the constraining effect of jetty when the wave impact is taken into account fig 8b the tidally averaged current velocity mainly decreases because of an enhanced bottom stress roughness due to the combined wave and current effect bender and wong 1993 grant and madsen 1979 but the tidally averaged current direction remains nearly unchanged and points to the northwest fig 8a and b according to the velocity difference induced by wave fig 8c it is shown that the tidally averaged current velocity is decreased by 0 10 m s 1 15 in the offshore area where local wind wave breaks severely especially in the front of jetty head of binzhou harbor the reduction of tidally averaged current velocity is generally 0 02 0 06 ms 1 in the coastal area the wave impacts on current velocity can be different from one tidal phase to another because the intensity of wave current interaction is affected by their relative angle grant and madsen 1979 fredsøe 1984 fig 8d f presents the changes of current velocity due to wave at maximum flood high tide and maximum ebb respectively as a result current velocity suffers a decrease of 0 05 0 15 ms 1 at maximum flood a decrease of 0 05 0 10 ms 1 at high tide and an increase of 0 02 0 10 ms 1 at maximum ebb in the offshore area notably there are some obvious changes of current velocity on the east side of huanghua harbor which may not be caused by the enhanced bottom roughness since the variation patterns are inconsistent with those of wave characteristics actually the current velocity is strongly influenced by the considerable momentum transfer from wave to water column i e the wave induced current as depicted in fig 9 the propagating wave breaks greatly in the eastern shallower water hence forms a westward alongshore current which makes a turn towards the sea at huanghua harbor with a speed of up to 0 18 ms 1 consequently the current flow on the east side of huanghua harbor is to be decelerated during flood as the wave induced current plays a negative effect but is to be accelerated during ebb as the wave induced current plays a positive effect 4 3 implications of water depth and current on swh modulation the impacts of water depth and current on wave seem to be more complex as their impacts depend largely on their intensity and spatial gradient see eqs 1 3 as a result the relative importance of depth current to swh modulation is expected to differ in space in particular in the cross shore direction fig 10 depicts the time series of swh along section x under the impacts of depth run 3a and current run 3b and their combined action run 3c the bathymetric variation along section x is shown in the lower left panel in fig 10 the corresponding model results of water level and surface current vector at the middle point of section x are given in the upper panel of fig 10 the depth induced swh modulation fig 10a experiences a phase locked manner with the water level fluctuation namely swh increases decreases as water level rises falls the finding here is consistent with those in other studies kang and iorio 2006 kang and kim 2015 yu et al 2017 and it was suspected to be resulted from the dissipations due to bottom friction liu and xie 2009 and wave breaking kang and kim 2015 moreover our modeled results indicate that the water level fluctuation due to tide is capable of modulating the swh along the whole section the offshore swh varies from 3 06 to 3 24 m and the nearshore swh varies from 0 11 to 0 78 m the current influenced swh fig 10b is not only associated with the spatial distribution of current but also the current direction for example the wave height is found to be increased significantly by the offshore opposing current this interesting feature is attributed to the following two reasons 1 while wave propagating on the opposing current wavelength is decreased and wave height is increased due to wave action conservation wolf and prandle 1999 2 the growth of wind wave is actually determined by the effective wind i e the relative wind effect defined as vectorial difference between wind vector and current vector deltares 2013b therefore when current direction is opposite to wind direction a larger effective wind causes a larger swh ardhuin et al 2012 yu et al 2017 in comparison to those induced by depth the current is able to generate comparable modulation in the offshore area where the swh varies from 2 66 m to 3 18 m fig 10b however the current induced modulation is decreased sharply onshore and its modulating effect is nearly negligible in the region less than 15 km away from the coastline 6 m depth fig 10c presents the combined action of depth and current which seems like to be a superposition of these two impacts to estimate the contributions of depth and current to the swh modulation their correlation coefficient r are calculated and shown as the black lines in fig 10a and b it is noted that the contributions of depth and current are generally in proportion to their respective modulating ability so that the impacts of depth and current on swh modulation are respectively increased and decreased onshore as a result the swh modulation in offshore area is mainly controlled by the current with a high correlation of 0 95 however the dominance of current decreases rapidly towards the coast and water depth becomes the dominant factor for nearshore swh modulation 4 4 sensitivity studies on swh modulation 4 4 1 driving mechanisms for depth induced modulation the previous subsection shows that the water depth has a dominant impact on swh modulation in shallower water region where wind wave could feel the sea bottom wang and sheng 2018 this conclusion is consistent with those drawn in semi closed regions e g bays or estuaries kang and iorio 2006 liu and xie 2009 kang and kim 2015 viitak et al 2016 yu et al 2017 based on model run of depth induced swh modulation run3a a series of process oriented model runs run3a fre run3a nl3 run3a ds w run3a ds b and run3a ds bk are conducted to further investigate the driving mechanisms of how water depth impacts the tidal modulation of swh to qualitatively assess the swh modulation the amplitude of swh modulation i e half of the difference between maximum and minimum swh within one tidal cycle is introduced the amplitudes of depth induced swh modulation along the section x are displayed in fig 11 a and their differences relative to the reference run run3a are shown in fig 11b in general the amplitudes of depth induced modulation firstly increases onshore from 0 10 m in offshore area to a maximum of 0 45 m in nearshore area then becomes decreasing towards the coast the effect of frequency shifting run3a fre known as doppler shift does not contribute to the depth induced modulation because it is only induced by current according to eq 4 thus the amplitude pattern of run3a fre is exactly the same as that of the reference run the effect of triads nonlinear wave wave interaction run3a nl3 is negligible because of the amplitude change is less than 0 02 m fig 11b indicating the nonlinear three wave interactions that transfers energy from lower frequencies to higher frequencies beji and battjes 1993 is not a key mechanism of controlling swh modulation in contrast the wind wave dissipations due to whitecapping run3a ds w bottom friction run3a ds b and breaking run3a ds bk are able to impact the modulating amplitude to some extent fig 11b the effect of whitecapping run3a ds w damps the modulating amplitude along the section with a maximum decrease of 0 18 m in offshore area green line in fig 11b and this damping effect is weakened toward the coast due to the variation of wave steepness hasselmann 1974 the dissipations due to bottom friction run3a ds b and breaking run3a ds bk generate noticeable changes over the breaking zone in 10 24 km from the coastline with opposing contributions to the amplitude cf red line with blue line in fig 11b in details the bottom friction effect generally restrains the swh modulation whereas the wave breaking effect enhances the modulation in the severe breaking zone 10 24 km e g the local amplitude is increased by up to 0 07 m 25 however it seems like that the estimated wave effects might not be the key mechanism of depth induced modulation as their contribution to the amplitude is limited there are still some effects that cannot be estimated separated directly from our wind wave model such as the effects of refraction quadruplet wave wave interactions and shoaling the depth induced refraction is believed to contribute little to the swh modulation as it only produces a maximum modulation of wave direction of 8 in run3a not shown which is insignificant compared to those induced by current in other region reaching up to 35 hopkins et al 2016 as for the quadruplet wave wave interactions it mainly affects the evolution of wave spectrum in deep water booij et al 1999 so it is not responsible for the modulation in the shallow water here as a result the depth induced straining effect i e shoaling effect is expected to play an important role in generating the depth induced modulation in this region as demonstrated in fig 11a c the cross shore pattern of modulating amplitude of group velocity c g indeed corresponds to that of swh cf black line in fig 11c with black line in fig 11a which indirectly proves its dominant impact on the depth induced modulation 4 4 2 responses of modulation to wind bottom slope and flow conditions in this subsection we report a sensitivity study from four series of experiments run4 run7 with a sum of 23 runs to explore the cross shore pattern of swh modulation against different wind speeds run4 wind directions run5 bottom slopes run6 and flow conditions run7 respectively to better compare the results of sensitivity study the modulating amplitudes induced by depth and current are normalized by the corresponding swh in wave only situation fig 12 c which represents the ability of modulating wave for example the normalized amplitude of run3a 3b 7a 7b equals to the amplitude of run3a 3b 7a 7b divided by the swh in run1a as shown in fig 12 the modulating abilities of depth and current are strongly influenced by the wind speed blue lines the depth induced normalized amplitude is decreased from run3a by up to 0 15 0 50 while the current induced one is increased from run3b by up to 0 05 0 15 in the situation of 12 5 ms 1 easterly wind it seems like the smaller wind wave is easier harder to be modulated by the current depth the different responses of their modulating ability to the wind speed might be attributed to the state of wind wave e g wave energy wave period ardhuin et al 2012 hansen et al 2013 wang and sheng 2018 and the wind input energy ardhuin et al 2012 viitak et al 2016 yu et al 2017 from the perspective of the wind input energy the different responses to wind speeds can be partly interpreted as follow the depth induced modulation is weakened by the decreased wind speed because there is less energy transferred from wind to wave via the wind wave interaction i e feedback mechanism miles 1957 krügermeyer et al 1978 which is proportional to the wind speed and the energy of wave itself on the contrary the current induced modulation is intensified by the decreased wind speed since the current plays an increasingly important role in the relative wind effect i e current vector unchanged but wind vector decreased therefore a more pronounced tidal variation in wind input energy interestingly the relationship between depth induced swh modulation and wind speed in this study is just opposite to that of moon 2005 this is considered to be due to the offshore wind implemented in his experiment i e a northwesterly wind in the yangtze river china whereas an onshore wind here suggesting a noticeable impact of wind direction under the impact of constant 19 ms 1 wind from different directions it is noted that the results of northerly wind run5a are mostly identical to those of the easterly wind cf red solid lines with black lines in fig 12 because the northerly wind generates relatively similar wave field in the region in comparison the westerly wind run5b and southerly wind run5c produce smaller wind wave because of the limited wind fetch fig 12c nevertheless the modulating ability of depth under the westerly and southerly winds remain nearly unchanged relative to that of the easterly wind with only a slight decrease in normalized amplitude fig 12a however the corresponding modulating ability of current appears different cross shore pattern compared to that of the easterly wind as the normalized amplitude decreases in offshore and increases in nearshore area fig 12b the reason for these discrepancies between onshore wind easterly northerly and offshore wind westerly southerly is unclear but might be ascribed to a combination of effects from the change in wave direction including the modifications of state of wind wave due to the change in wind fetch relative wind effect and current induced mechanisms e g current induced convergence wavenumber shift and refraction fig 12a shows that the wind speed and direction run4 run5 impact the modulating ability of depth to some extent but its cross shore pattern still presents an onshore increased trend as concluded in section 4 4 1 this pattern is mostly caused by the shoaling effect which is related to the slope of sea bottom to further explore the impact of shoaling the original bathymetry is modified with a gentler bottom run6a and a flat bottom run6b in the region shallower than 6 m depth it is demonstrated that the depth induced normalized amplitude decreases greatly from run3a to about 0 30 0 20 in the coast in the situations of run6a wl run6b wl fig 12a as expectation the corresponding cross shore patterns of the group velocity green lines in fig 11c are similar with those of the modulating ability of depth green lines in fig 12a which further confirms the predominant role of shoaling effect in controlling depth induced swh modulation but the cross shore pattern of current induced modulation is less affected by the changes of bottom slope fig 12b in order to eliminate the impact of spatial gradient of water level on the cross shore pattern induced by depth time varying spatial uniform water level field is implemented in run7a and negligible impact is noticed in this study fig 12a in addition as suggested by tolman 1990 the change rate of depth and current might influence the swh modulation and it has been proven that the tidal range of spring tide can induce approximately two times larger variances of swh than the neap tide one moon 2005 it is also of great interest to assess the impact of current condition on swh modulation for simplicity we just replace the original current field affected by wind and tide with a tidal only one run7b as can be seen in fig 12b the normalized amplitude induced by current is not sensitive to these changes of current field indicating the cross shore pattern is primarily generated by tidal current in the present study this possibly depends on the magnitude of wind induced current relative to that of tidal current or it may be due to a smaller scale domain considered in this study 5 discussion 5 1 effects of wave on sediment transport and storm surge the study region southwestern bohai bay locates in the north of china where the local weather system is affected by large scale weather systems such as the east asian winter monson and siberian high so that it is prone to the high northerly winds in winter october to march mo et al 2016 feng et al 2018 during that time the resulting extreme wind waves are expected to strongly impact local hydrodynamics and sediment morpho dynamics since the water depth is shallow and the fine sediment d 50 0 035 mm composed of silt and mud is easy to be suspended and transported kuang et al 2015 as a result the 33 km long 11 m depth waterway of huanghua harbor location refer to fig 1c had been reported to suffer from severe sediment siltation during the storm events until year 2006 when two regulating jetties were built on its both sides zhao 2007 feng et al 2008 zhang et al 2010 one possible cause for huanghua waterway siltation is that the sediment in offshore region is suspended greatly by local breaking wave and travels across the waterway as demonstrated in fig 5 the strong wind wave gradually deforms towards shore due to the mild slope of sea bottom resulting in a relative broad surf zone in the study region zhao 2007 zhang et al 2010 it follows that large amounts of fine sediment over the surf zone is to be resuspended in particular at the location where wave dissipates most greatly see fig 5b then the suspended sediment is to be transported northwesterly along with local intense mean current fig 8b when the suspended sediment transports across the waterway a sharp decrease of bed shear stress due to the increased water depth is to be encountered and thus causes a sudden sedimentation in the waterway the other possible cause for the waterway siltation is that the high concentration suspended sediment in coast is transported offshore towards the waterway previous observation and modelling works indicate that the concentration of suspended sediment in coast can be up to 2 5 kg m3 at the surface zhao 2007 feng et al 2008 kuang et al 2015 this high concentration suspended sediment on the east of huanghua harbor is supposed to be carried by the alongshore current fig 8b transports offshore along the harbor and finally deposits in the waterway it is worthy noticing that the wind induced current not shown and wave induced current fig 9 both can weaken enhance the onshore offshore tidal current on the east side of huanghua harbor e g fig 8d 8f this will make local tidal asymmetry become more ebb dominant and consequently strengthen the residual tidally averaged sediment transport offshore the bohai bay is frequently threatened by considerable storm surges of about 1 2 m during extreme weather conditions mo et al 2016 feng et al 2018 due to a favorable geometric feature for water piled up mo et al 2016 and shallow water depth where wind stress is more effective at raising a surge pugh 1987 the generation of storm surge is actually relating with wind stress atmospheric pressure and wave forcing wu et al 2018 as a main contributor of storm surge the wind induced surge would complicate the wave tide interaction as it modifies total water depth which will be addressed in another ongoing research nevertheless it can still be inferred that the wave induced surge in our study region with a maximum of about 0 16 m fig 7b would merely play a minor role in the surge which is considered to be attributed to the mild slope see section 4 1 but that is not always the case in other regions e g kim et al 2010 sheng et al 2010 wu et al 2018 where local wave induced surge can contribute up to 15 40 to the total surge in those situations the modulation of wave induced surge by tide and swh modulation the dotted line in fig 7b might be a potential factor for the phenomenon of periodic oscillation of storm surge valle levinson et al 2013 feng et al 2016 which has not yet drawn attention from the previous works 5 2 understanding different dominant factors for wave modulation with regard to the swh tidal modulation the sensitivity studies in section 4 4 have shown that the modulating ability of depth and current can vary with wind speed wind direction and bottom slope these studies help us better understand the different dominant factors for wave modulation in other regions table 1 besides the conclusion of tidal modulation of wave also depends on which wave parameter generally the swh is used to evaluate the modulation as different parameters can respond differently to depth and current moon 2005 nevertheless there are still some common conclusions that can be drawn from the previous works for instance tidal depth oscillation is usually regarded as the controlling effect of nearshore swh modulation during extreme weather conditions kang and iorio 2006 liu and xie 2009 kang and kim 2015 viitak et al 2016 yu et al 2017 based on the depth induced mechanisms discussed in this paper the predominant role of water depth in such situation is probably ascribed to one or several following reasons 1 the study region locates in the relative shallow water such as a bay or estuary so that the shoaling effect has a much stronger impact on the modulation than other wave current interaction mechanisms 2 the extremely strong wind and the resulting large wind wave is supposed to give rise to a severe tidal modulation due to the stronger wind wave interactions i e feedback mechanism 3 the surge wave tide interactions are able to produce a larger water depth change and thus intensify the depth induced modulation with respect to the works attributed wave modulation to the current wolf and prandle 1999 moon 2005 hansen et al 2013 hopkins et al 2016 wang and sheng 2018 most of their analyses are based on the results of station s located in the relative deep water taken the works focusing on the long straight beaches as examples wolf and prandle 1999 hansen et al 2013 hopkins et al 2016 their study regions usually have a much steeper bottom slope than that of the bay or estuary with a narrower shallow region in coast as a result the current induced mechanisms are expected to dominate most of the region while the depth induced mechanisms are only significant in the very shallow region wang and sheng 2018 in addition local alongshore current would produce remarkable current induced impacts on the onshore traveling wave due to a larger relative angle such as the current induced refraction hopkins et al 2016 6 conclusions in this study a wave current coupling model delft3d is applied to investigate the wave current interactions in the southwestern bohai bay china with special attention to the impacts of tidally varying depth and current on swh modulation and the relevant physical mechanisms in wave only situation the wind wave generated by a 19 ms 1 easterly wind propagates towards the coast and deforms along the propagating path as a result of wave deformation the radiation stress is increased onshore before entering the surf zone due to the shoaling effect however the radiation stress becomes decreased onshore in the surf zone due to the wave energy dissipation due to the radiation stress gradient original hydrostatic pressure gradient is disrupted so that the water surface is forced to change to balance the wave induced force resulting in a wave set down of 0 03 m in offshore and a wave set up of 0 06 m in coast under the wave current interactions the wave set up is influenced by the local bottom slope water depth and radiation stress gradient consequently the wave set up reaches a larger value at the location with steeper bottom slope and varies in tidal cycles due to the changes in water depth and radiation stress gradient the wave in turn affects the current motion through enhancing the bottom stress roughness leading to a decrease of mean current velocity by 0 10 ms 1 15 moreover the momentum transfer from wave to current i e the wave induced current also contributes to a non negligible impact on the current in general both the tidal variations of water depth and current are able to modulate the swh however the modulating ability of depth and current seems to have opposite variation trend in the cross shore direction i e the depth one increased onshore while the current one decreased as a result the dominant factor for swh modulation is to shift from the current offshore to the depth in nearshore area based on the model run of depth induced swh modulation five additional process oriented experiments are conducted and the effect of wave breaking is found to be responsible for the swh modulation in the breaking zone but its contribution is limited besides we also discuss the effects that cannot be estimated directly by our model and believe that the shoaling effect should be the main driving mechanism for depth induced modulation we further estimate the responses of depth and current induced modulation to wind speeds wind directions bottom slopes and flow conditions it is shown that the wind speed plays a quite important role in the swh modulation as the modulating ability of depth and current are decreased and increased respectively with the decreasing speed of easterly wind this discrepancy is attributed to the state of wind wave and the wind input energy with respect to the winds from other directions the impacts of northerly wind are generally similar as that of the easterly wind in comparison the modulating ability of current under the offshore winds westerly southerly is different from those of the onshore winds easterly northerly which is probably related to the changes in state of wind wave relative wind effect and current induced mechanisms in addition the depth induced modulation dominated by the shoaling effect largely depends on the bottom slope however the contributions of spatial gradient of water level and wind induced current to the cross shore pattern of swh modulation are negligible although this study is site specific the findings highlight the dominant impact of tidally varying depth and current on swh modulation these are likely to support the phenomena of tidal modulation of wave in other similar coastal regions globally credit authorship contribution statement honglin song methodology writing original draft cuiping

however the dominant factors for the modulation differ over different coastal regions and the relevant generation mechanisms have not been fully addressed in this study a delft3d wave current coupled model is applied to the southwestern bohai bay china which is a shallow water coast with a mild slope to estimate the local wave current interactions during extreme weathers the results indicate that the wave set up is strongly influenced by local bottom slope water depth and radiation stress gradient the mean current velocity is decreased by wave by up to 15 due to enhanced bottom roughness and the impact of momentum transfer from wave to current is non negligible both tidally varying depth and current are able to modulate significant wave height swh and their modulating abilities are increased and decreased onshore respectively furthermore the sensitivity studies suggest that the depth induced swh modulation is primarily due to the shoaling effect which is related to bottom slope the wind speed plays an important role on the depth and current induced swh modulation as it could affect the state of wind wave and wind input energy whereas wind direction change from onshore to offshore only results in remarkable changes of current induced modulation keywords wave current interactions tidal modulation of wind wave extreme weather numerical modelling 1 introduction interactions between wave and current are the vital processes in coastal areas and have been studied extensively since mid twentieth century longuet higgins and stewart 1964 mei 1983 tolman 1991 mellor 2003 in the past the interaction mechanisms were mostly established on the basis of theoretical works and field observations mei 1983 tolman 1990 wolf and prandle 1999 nowadays laboratory experiment rusu and soares 2011 numerical modelling hansen et al 2013 kang and kim 2015 hopkins et al 2016 yu et al 2017 and remote sensing ardhuin et al 2017a were combined to better understand the processes of wave current interactions based on the pioneering works of unna 1941 1942 1947 and barber 1949 longuet higgins and stewart 1960 1961 1962 1964 established the theory for wave current interaction by introducing the concept of radiation stress i e the wave induced excess momentum flux the radiation stress links the energy exchange between wave and current and enables the impact of wave on current motion to be considered subsequently whitham 1965 and bretherton and garrett 1968 further extended this theory and indicated that the wave action density defined as wave energy density divided by wave frequency is conserved in an adiabatic media the introduction of wave action overcomes the non conservation problem of wave energy density while wave propagating over current fields a comprehensive review of wave current interactions theory can be found in mei 1983 in the past two decades scholars dedicated to improve the wave current coupling approach by extending the classic theory to obtain depth dependent three dimensional radiation stress mellor 2003 2008 2015 ji et al 2017 and by developing a relatively new concept called vortex force mcwilliams and restrepo 1999 uchiyama et al 2010 bennis et al 2011 kumar et al 2012 the discussion of these two approaches ardhuin et al 2017b mellor 2016 2017 contributed to further the understanding of wave current interactions with the development of linear wave theory the phase averaged wave models were correspondingly developed and updated based on the wave action energy balance equation these phase averaged ocean wave models are better than the phase resolving ones at large scale wave simulation and multiple processes coupling according to the level of parameterization of the source and sink terms in wave equation the ocean wave model can be classified into three generation the first generation wave models gelci et al 1956 1957 were developed in the 1960s 1970s but the physical processes of wave generation dissipation and wave wave interactions had not been properly represented then the second generation wave models swamp group 1985 swim group 1985 were launched in 1980s in order to remedy the deficiencies by parameterizing physical processes and wave spectrum the formulation of the discrete interaction approximation by hasselmann et al 1985 led to the development of the third generation wave models in which all relevant processes were presented explicitly without a priori restrictions on the evolution of the spectrum booij et al 1999 after the wamdi group for the first time introduced a highly developed third generation wave model the wave modeling wam wamdi group 1988 the ocean wave models are flourishing and followed by the state of the art ocean models such as the wavewathch tolman 1991 wam 4 günther et al 1992 swan booij et al 1999 and mellor donelan oey mdo wave model mellor et al 2008 the wave current interactions during extreme weather conditions e g tropical cyclones and storm surges have drawn great interests in recent years and the numerical modeling is regarded as one of the powerful tools for estimating this issue fan et al 2009 brown et al 2013 hu et al 2015 kang and kim 2015 yu et al 2017 it is concluded that the wave tide interactions mechanism plays an important role in reproducing the sea surface elevation in extreme weather dietrich et al 2011 brown et al 2013 yu et al 2017 for example the wave induced surge can be strongly influenced by tide and varies in tidal cycles brown et al 2013 yu et al 2017 with respect to the impacts on wave both the water depth and current variation due to tide are able to generate tidal modulation i e periodic change for significant wave height swh mostly at a m2 period this phenomenon was investigated by field observations laboratory experiments and modelling works tolman 1990 wolf and prandle 1999 liu and xie 2009 hansen et al 2013 kang and kim 2015 hopkins et al 2016 viitak et al 2016 yu et al 2017 there were two commonly used methods to estimate the dominant factors of the tidal modulation which include 1 establishing the correlation between wave parameters and water depth tidal current wolf and prandle 1999 liu and xie 2009 hansen et al 2013 yu et al 2017 2 discussion on the impacts of individual depth current on wave by numerical simulations moon 2005 kang and iorio 2006 hansen et al 2013 kang and kim 2015 hopkins et al 2016 viitak et al 2016 wang and sheng 2018 interestingly the dominant factors for the tidal modulation of wave come out to be different in different regions which are largely depended on local dynamic conditions one group of researchers attributed this tidal modulation to the water depth oscillation liu and xie 2009 kang and kim 2015 viitak et al 2016 yu et al 2017 and the other group of researchers attributed the modulation to the current variation tolman 1990 hansen et al 2013 hopkins et al 2016 this discrepancy has not been widely recognized and addressed and tolman 1990 once suggested that it might be relevant to the change rate in local water depth and current main documented studies on the tidal modulation of wave are listed in table 1 the bohai bay in the north of china fig 1 is a shallow water bay where the mean water depth is only 13 m our study area lies in the southwestern bohai bay that is a silt muddy coast with a rather mild slope of 1 3000 the tidal form number f h k1 h o1 h m2 h s2 where h is the tidal amplitude in this region is less than 0 5 which indicates this coast is mainly dominated by regular semidiurnal tide i e the m2 tide as the local m2 tidal wave rotates in counter clockwise direction in the bohai bay the tidal current in the study area appears a counterclockwise rotation and has stronger intensity and shorter duration in flood period compared to those in ebb period therefore flood dominated under the influence of the large scale weather systems the study area is known to be vulnerable to the extreme weather event cold front with a spatially uniform unidirectional and long lasting wind field kuang et al 2015 mo et al 2016 feng et al 2018 song et al 2020 wind wave accounts for 79 of the wave in the study area because of the long wind fetch the prevailing strong winds from ene to e feng et al 2008 lv et al 2014 mo et al 2016 could produce considerable wind wave on the silt muddy coast thus resulted in severe sediment siltation in the waterway of local huanghua harbor during windy days zhao 2007 zhang et al 2010 kuang et al 2015 this study focuses on the wave current interactions in southwest of bohai bay during extreme weather conditions and elucidates the related physical mechanisms with special attention to generation mechanisms for depth and current induced swh modulation it is therefore of practical significance to further the understanding of potential causes for local waterway siltation and tidal modulation of wave in other similar regions this study aims to 1 estimate the cross shore variation of wave parameters in wave only situation 2 assess the modulation of wave induced surge and the modification of current velocity due to wave effects 3 investigate the tidal modulation of swh induced by water depth and current variation 4 examine the responses of cross shore pattern of swh modulation to wind speed wind direction bottom slope and current conditions 2 model description 2 1 numerical model delft3d the interactions between wave and current are modeled by the standard delft3d package lesser et al 2004 which has been widely used for modelling physical processes e g hydrodynamics and sediment transport in coasts estuaries and lakes deltares 2013a delft3d flow solves the unsteady shallow water equations using a finite difference scheme under the boussinesq and shallow water assumptions more details about delft3d flow were given in lesser et al 2004 and deltares 2013a delft3d wave is based on the third generation spectral wave model swan booij et al 1999 ris et al 1999 and it performs well in the evolution of random short crested wind generated waves in coastal environments deltares 2013b a detailed description of the delft3d wave is given below 2 1 1 wave kinematics while wave propagates over slowly varying current and water depth the linear theory for quasi uniform surface gravity waves is

momentum flux from wave to current then hydrostatic pressure gradient is forced to change to balance the wave forcing and results in the wave set up wave induced surge which can be estimated by the following vertically integrated momentum balance equation in 1d cross shore direction longuet higgins and stewart 1962 1964 here the calculation of wave set up η is conducted by delft3d flow while the gradient of radiation stress ds xx dx is transferred from delft3d wave note that here the positive direction of cross shore coordinate x is defined as onshore direction 8 d s x x d x ρ g h d η d x 0

radiation stress in a multi dimensional 2d 3d flow model has been proven to be capable to give a good performance in extreme weather conditions mastenbroek et al 1993 dietrich et al 2012 brown et al 2013 dissanayake et al 2014 liu et al 2018 this method was considered to be computationally efficient and provided a plausible solution in tide surge wave modelling brown et al 2013 the coupling methods between delft3d wave and delft3d flow can be one way or two way coupling which means the interactions i e information transfer between the two models are conducted unidirectionally and bidirectionally respectively in details the one way coupling is to consider one s impact on the other and not consider the feedback while the two way coupling accounts for the feedback and is more close to reality during the two way coupling the flow model firstly stores the information of water level and current velocity in a transfer communication file secondly the wave model takes out these variables and considers their impacts into wave kinematics then passes the results of wave model e g wave height wave direction and mass fluxes back to the communication file here the one way coupling is finished finally these impacts of current affected wave are taken into account in the next round flow computation and thus one round two way interaction is accomplished 3 model setup and validation 3 1 model setup the wave current interactions are simulated based on a nested hydrodynamic model the bathymetric data in year 2012 is used for the nested model the data is obtained by merging measured water depth in southwestern bohai bay with those derived from navigational chart of china with a maximum spatial resolution of 100 m around huanghua harbor the parent flow model covers the bohai sea with a rectangular uniform grid of 1000 m resolution 174840 elements and is forced by tidal levels at dalian and yantai fig 1b the tidal conditions are provided by the national marine data and information service of china which include 11 tidal constituents k1 o1 p1 q1 m2 s2 n2 k2 m4 ms4 mn4 the child flow model is computed on a boundary fitted curvilinear grid of 90 780 m resolution 88232 elements the child model is forced by three open boundaries with tidal levels which are extracted from the parent model fig 1b both the flow models divide the water column into uniform 10 layers in vertical direction the manning coefficient plays a key role in ocean circulation simulations and a constant 0 0145 s m 1 3 is used for the whole domain which is reasonable in the study region kuang et al 2015 the time step of flow model is 60 s and meets the requirement of courant number to improve the efficiency and accuracy of wave simulation at the same time the wave model is established on triple nested grids which cover the bohai sea resolution 2000 m the bohai bay resolution 600 m and the study area resolution 90 780 m the same as child flow model respectively as shown in fig 1b this wave current coupled model has been validated against the wave observation during a storm in 5 9th november 2003 in our another work where the wave model is forced by wind forcing only song et al 2020 the model evaluation suggests that the coupled model performs fairly well in significant wave height period with a correlation coefficient of 0 95 0 89 and a normalized root mean square error of 0 36 0 77 consequently the wave model in the present study is driven by surface wind data only and the offshore wave boundary condition is not considered for example in the model validation here section 3 2 the wave model is driven only by the surface wind data derived from reanalysis atmospheric product era interim of the european centre for medium range weather forecasts the reanalysis wind has a spatial resolution of 0 125 0 125 and a temporal resolution of 6 h which is linearly interpolated to computational grid and time step in accordance with most work of wave modelling rusu and soares 2011 gorrell et al 2011 hansen et al 2013 hopkins et al 2016 our wave model is run in a computationally efficient mode the stationary mode i e n t 0 in eq 6 in which wave propagation is assumed to be instantaneous throughout the model domain gorrell et al 2011 this assumption is reasonable for the wave simulation in small scale coastal region where the time scale of tidal variations is larger than that of wave traveling tolman 1990 gorrell et al 2011 a collins bottom friction coefficient collins 1972 of 0 01 is used in the wave model on the basis of optimum simulation in the bohai sea lv et al 2014 other physical parameters that are not mentioned use the default setting the coupling time interval between wave and current models is set to 60 min the wave current coupled model is initialized from the rest namely the initial conditions are prescribed to zero a 7 day spin up is conducted to achieve hydrodynamic stability prior to the period of interest 3 2 model validation fig 2 indicates that the modeled water level shows great fitness with the observed one with a pearson correlation coefficient r of 0 99 and percent bias pbias of 8 as can be seen the semi diurnal tidal cycles and spring neap tidal processes are well represented by the coupled model the comparison between modeled and observed current velocity fig 3 suggests that the model has a good performance in both magnitudes r 0 76 0 83 and directions r 0 82 0 97 during 15 16th october 2012 notably the current difference in the vertical direction is not significant in the study area since there is small difference between the surface results 0 5 m under the water surface and the bottom results 2 0 m above the sea bottom as shown in fig 4 the model produces reasonable results of swh in the caofeidian north of the bohai bay fig 1c during 5 11th november 2013 the modeled swh is a bit smaller than those of the observation pbias 15 1 possibly due to the underestimated ecmwf wind speed in the bohai sea lv et al 2014 and its limited temporal and spatial resolution as proved by song et al 2020 in comparison the modeled wave direction is generally consistent with the observed one with an acceptable performance in trends r 0 50 and magnitudes pbias 3 8 3 3 model runs based on the validated coupled model 36 model runs table 2 are conducted to estimate the wave current interactions in the southwestern bohai bay with special attention to the dominant factors for the local tidal modulation of swh the coastline in 2003 when the study region has not been strongly influenced by anthropogenic activities is adopted in all the model runs a constant 19 ms 1 easterly wind is designed to represent the high wind during local extreme weather condition according to the wind observation of one typical cold front event in october 2003 feng et al 2008 zhang et al 2012 the impacts of depth and current on wave can be estimated separately by passing the corresponding information from delft3d flow to delft3d wave one wave only model run run1a is conducted to examine the wind wave deformation in onshore direction one current only model run run1b is driven by the tidal and wind forcings with both current motion and tidal elevation firstly the wave only model run is one way coupled to the flow model without considering other forcings run2a therefore obtains the wave induced current and surge then the wave only model run is coupled to the current only model run in the manner of one way run2b and two way run2c coupling to estimate the modification of current velocity and water level due to the wave effects to investigate the dominant factors for swh modulation the impacts of depth run3a current run3b and both of depth and current run3c are respectively applied to the wave only model run based on the model run considering the impact of water depth variation run3a five additional process oriented model runs are conducted to pinpoint the driving mechanisms of depth induced modulation by ignoring the specified wave effects run3a fre run3a nl3 run3a ds w run3a ds b and run3a ds bk represent frequency shifting triads nonlinear wave wave interaction whitecapping bottom friction and breaking respectively furthermore the sensitivity studies with four series experiments are carried to explore the cross shore pattern of swh modulation against different wind speeds run4 wind directions run5 bottom slopes run6 and flow conditions run7 more detailed descriptions of model runs are listed in table 2 4 model results 4 1 wave deformation it is necessary to study the wave deformation along its propagating path since the wave impact is related to the incident wave condition based on the simulation considering wave forcing only run2a the 19 m s 1 easterly wind produces onshore traveling wind waves with a swh of 3 5 m in offshore that decreases gradually towards the coast color map in fig 5 a the isobaths are shown as contour lines in fig 5a the spatial distribution of the significant wave height follows that of the bathymetry due to the depth induced refraction given by the snell s law to obtain a clearer presentation of the wave characteristics variation a 35 0 km long cross shore section x is set in the middle of huanghua harbor and binzhou harbor fig 5a as shown in fig 5b the deformation of wind wave can be simply classified into three phases in phase i the wave is still in the relative deep water and only experiences a minor decrease in swh during this phase the dissipation of wave energy is primarily generated from the effects of whitecapping s ds w and bottom friction s ds b fig 5b as wave traveling towards the coast its swh decreases to 3 0 m and the wave begins to break at 10 0 m depth which is 30 0 km away from coast see red solid line of s ds bk in fig 5b in phase ii the energy dissipations due to bottom friction and breaking play an increasing role towards the coast whereas the dissipation due to whitecapping is decreased towards the coast the total dissipation rate sum of the three attains a maximum at the location of 7 m depth that is 17 km away from the coastline and the wave deformation enters the phase iii in which the energy dissipation due to breaking contributes the most and the swh decreases significantly onshore as a result of wave deformation the radiation stress that is associated with wave group velocity c g and wave energy e see eq 9 shows corresponding changes along the propagating path fig 5c in fact the controlling effect of radiation stress variation is different along the path before entering the surf zone phase i the wave energy is nearly conserved and the radiation stress is dominated by shoaling effect therefore a positive gradient of radiation stress i e radiation stress increases onshore in contrast in the surf zone the radiation stress is turned to be controlled by the dissipation due to wave breaking and thus corresponds to a negative gradient of radiation stress i e radiation stress decreases onshore guza and thornton 1981 brown et al 2013 in addition it is notable that the largest change in radiation stress occurs at the location where the dissipation due to breaking reaches its maximum ascribed to the radiation stress the water level is then forced to change to balance this wave induced force longuet higgins and stewart 1962 1964 consequently there will be a wave set down in offshore area and a wave set up in coast accordingly olabarrieta et al 2011 yu et al 2017 as can be seen in fig 5d the wave induced water level change reaches its lowest value of 0 03 m at the location where wave begins to break then it becomes increasing onshore with a maximum value wave set up of 0 06 m at the coast rim this modeled wave set up value closes to the analytical result of 0 03 m which is calculated by a well validated empirical formula proposed by ji et al 2018 given as η max 0 22 h 0 s 0 629 l 0 0 371 tan β 0 538 h o s is the swh in deep water l 0 is the corresponding wavelength and tanβ is the bottom slope 4 2 impacts of wave on water level and current 4 2 1 water level variation the wave tide interactions were supposed to impact the water level during extreme weather which relates with radiation stress gradient and varies by tidal phases brown et al 2013 yu et al 2017 in the situation of wave current two way coupling fig 6 the water level change induced by wave at high tide is relative small with a wave set up of 0 02 m at coast and a wave set down of 0 04 m in most of the study region fig 6a however the water level change at low tide differs from that at high tide and is more significant as the wave set up is up to 0 16 m and confined along the coast fig 6b it is noted that the wave set up in the eastern coast is smaller than that in the western coast and this spatial discrepancy is attributed to the bottom slope as the steeper slope is to have larger wave set up dietrich et al 2010 ji et al 2018 yu et al 2017 as for the temporal discrepancy the time series of water level at coastal station a location refer to fig 6a under different situations are given in fig 7 a the water levels from current only model run1b wave model one way coupled to current model run2b and wave current two way coupled model run2c experience similar variation pattern the difference between wave current coupled model and current only model represents the wave set up in one way coupling situation run2b the wave set up achieves its minimum at high tide then increases to the maximum at low tide black dashed line in fig 7b it is because in this one way coupling situation that the radiation stress gradient is unchanged the larger smaller water depth at high low tide will result in a smaller larger increase in wave set up according to eq 8 after considering the feedback from flow model in the two way coupling situation run2c the wave set up still obtains its minimum at high tide however its magnitude is decreased at low tide and increased at mid tide reaching a maximum of 0 14 m black dotted line in fig 7b this is because in two way coupling the tidal variation of depth and current modifies the radiation stress gradient i e wave induced mass flux transported onshore which can be represented by the swh difference between offshore area and coast brown et al 2013 it is clear that the tidal variation pattern of wave set up is highly correlated with that of swh difference cf black dotted line with red solid line in fig 7b suggesting here the impact of wave induced mass flux on wave set up modulation is more significant than that of tidal effect 4 2 2 current velocity modification the wave also generates considerable impacts on current motion and thus affects sediment resuspension and transport wang and pinardi 2002 lu et al 2009 liang et al 2018 the depth averaged current velocity field without considering the wave impact is averaged over one tidal cycle 12 4 h and shown in fig 8 a generally the mean current velocity decreases from 0 8 ms 1 in offshore area to 0 4 ms 1 in coastal area and there are two high velocity zones at the head of huanghua jetty and binzhou jetty due to the constraining effect of jetty when the wave impact is taken into account fig 8b the tidally averaged current velocity mainly decreases because of an enhanced bottom stress roughness due to the combined wave and current effect bender and wong 1993 grant and madsen 1979 but the tidally averaged current direction remains nearly unchanged and points to the northwest fig 8a and b according to the velocity difference induced by wave fig 8c it is shown that the tidally averaged current velocity is decreased by 0 10 m s 1 15 in the offshore area where local wind wave breaks severely especially in the front of jetty head of binzhou harbor the reduction of tidally averaged current velocity is generally 0 02 0 06 ms 1 in the coastal area the wave impacts on current velocity can be different from one tidal phase to another because the intensity of wave current interaction is affected by their relative angle grant and madsen 1979 fredsøe 1984 fig 8d f presents the changes of current velocity due to wave at maximum flood high tide and maximum ebb respectively as a result current velocity suffers a decrease of 0 05 0 15 ms 1 at maximum flood a decrease of 0 05 0 10 ms 1 at high tide and an increase of 0 02 0 10 ms 1 at maximum ebb in the offshore area notably there are some obvious changes of current velocity on the east side of huanghua harbor which may not be caused by the enhanced bottom roughness since the variation patterns are inconsistent with those of wave characteristics actually the current velocity is strongly influenced by the considerable momentum transfer from wave to water column i e the wave induced current as depicted in fig 9 the propagating wave breaks greatly in the eastern shallower water hence forms a westward alongshore current which makes a turn towards the sea at huanghua harbor with a speed of up to 0 18 ms 1 consequently the current flow on the east side of huanghua harbor is to be decelerated during flood as the wave induced current plays a negative effect but is to be accelerated during ebb as the wave induced current plays a positive effect 4 3 implications of water depth and current on swh modulation the impacts of water depth and current on wave seem to be more complex as their impacts depend largely on their intensity and spatial gradient see eqs 1 3 as a result the relative importance of depth current to swh modulation is expected to differ in space in particular in the cross shore direction fig 10 depicts the time series of swh along section x under the impacts of depth run 3a and current run 3b and their combined action run 3c the bathymetric variation along section x is shown in the lower left panel in fig 10 the corresponding model results of water level and surface current vector at the middle point of section x are given in the upper panel of fig 10 the depth induced swh modulation fig 10a experiences a phase locked manner with the water level fluctuation namely swh increases decreases as water level rises falls the finding here is consistent with those in other studies kang and iorio 2006 kang and kim 2015 yu et al 2017 and it was suspected to be resulted from the dissipations due to bottom friction liu and xie 2009 and wave breaking kang and kim 2015 moreover our modeled results indicate that the water level fluctuation due to tide is capable of modulating the swh along the whole section the offshore swh varies from 3 06 to 3 24 m and the nearshore swh varies from 0 11 to 0 78 m the current influenced swh fig 10b is not only associated with the spatial distribution of current but also the current direction for example the wave height is found to be increased significantly by the offshore opposing current this interesting feature is attributed to the following two reasons 1 while wave propagating on the opposing current wavelength is decreased and wave height is increased due to wave action conservation wolf and prandle 1999 2 the growth of wind wave is actually determined by the effective wind i e the relative wind effect defined as vectorial difference between wind vector and current vector deltares 2013b therefore when current direction is opposite to wind direction a larger effective wind causes a larger swh ardhuin et al 2012 yu et al 2017 in comparison to those induced by depth the current is able to generate comparable modulation in the offshore area where the swh varies from 2 66 m to 3 18 m fig 10b however the current induced modulation is decreased sharply onshore and its modulating effect is nearly negligible in the region less than 15 km away from the coastline 6 m depth fig 10c presents the combined action of depth and current which seems like to be a superposition of these two impacts to estimate the contributions of depth and current to the swh modulation their correlation coefficient r are calculated and shown as the black lines in fig 10a and b it is noted that the contributions of depth and current are generally in proportion to their respective modulating ability so that the impacts of depth and current on swh modulation are respectively increased and decreased onshore as a result the swh modulation in offshore area is mainly controlled by the current with a high correlation of 0 95 however the dominance of current decreases rapidly towards the coast and water depth becomes the dominant factor for nearshore swh modulation 4 4 sensitivity studies on swh modulation 4 4 1 driving mechanisms for depth induced modulation the previous subsection shows that the water depth has a dominant impact on swh modulation in shallower water region where wind wave could feel the sea bottom wang and sheng 2018 this conclusion is consistent with those drawn in semi closed regions e g bays or estuaries kang and iorio 2006 liu and xie 2009 kang and kim 2015 viitak et al 2016 yu et al 2017 based on model run of depth induced swh modulation run3a a series of process oriented model runs run3a fre run3a nl3 run3a ds w run3a ds b and run3a ds bk are conducted to further investigate the driving mechanisms of how water depth impacts the tidal modulation of swh to qualitatively assess the swh modulation the amplitude of swh modulation i e half of the difference between maximum and minimum swh within one tidal cycle is introduced the amplitudes of depth induced swh modulation along the section x are displayed in fig 11 a and their differences relative to the reference run run3a are shown in fig 11b in general the amplitudes of depth induced modulation firstly increases onshore from 0 10 m in offshore area to a maximum of 0 45 m in nearshore area then becomes decreasing towards the coast the effect of frequency shifting run3a fre known as doppler shift does not contribute to the depth induced modulation because it is only induced by current according to eq 4 thus the amplitude pattern of run3a fre is exactly the same as that of the reference run the effect of triads nonlinear wave wave interaction run3a nl3 is negligible because of the amplitude change is less than 0 02 m fig 11b indicating the nonlinear three wave interactions that transfers energy from lower frequencies to higher frequencies beji and battjes 1993 is not a key mechanism of controlling swh modulation in contrast the wind wave dissipations due to whitecapping run3a ds w bottom friction run3a ds b and breaking run3a ds bk are able to impact the modulating amplitude to some extent fig 11b the effect of whitecapping run3a ds w damps the modulating amplitude along the section with a maximum decrease of 0 18 m in offshore area green line in fig 11b and this damping effect is weakened toward the coast due to the variation of wave steepness hasselmann 1974 the dissipations due to bottom friction run3a ds b and breaking run3a ds bk generate noticeable changes over the breaking zone in 10 24 km from the coastline with opposing contributions to the amplitude cf red line with blue line in fig 11b in details the bottom friction effect generally restrains the swh modulation whereas the wave breaking effect enhances the modulation in the severe breaking zone 10 24 km e g the local amplitude is increased by up to 0 07 m 25 however it seems like that the estimated wave effects might not be the key mechanism of depth induced modulation as their contribution to the amplitude is limited there are still some effects that cannot be estimated separated directly from our wind wave model such as the effects of refraction quadruplet wave wave interactions and shoaling the depth induced refraction is believed to contribute little to the swh modulation as it only produces a maximum modulation of wave direction of 8 in run3a not shown which is insignificant compared to those induced by current in other region reaching up to 35 hopkins et al 2016 as for the quadruplet wave wave interactions it mainly affects the evolution of wave spectrum in deep water booij et al 1999 so it is not responsible for the modulation in the shallow water here as a result the depth induced straining effect i e shoaling effect is expected to play an important role in generating the depth induced modulation in this region as demonstrated in fig 11a c the cross shore pattern of modulating amplitude of group velocity c g indeed corresponds to that of swh cf black line in fig 11c with black line in fig 11a which indirectly proves its dominant impact on the depth induced modulation 4 4 2 responses of modulation to wind bottom slope and flow conditions in this subsection we report a sensitivity study from four series of experiments run4 run7 with a sum of 23 runs to explore the cross shore pattern of swh modulation against different wind speeds run4 wind directions run5 bottom slopes run6 and flow conditions run7 respectively to better compare the results of sensitivity study the modulating amplitudes induced by depth and current are normalized by the corresponding swh in wave only situation fig 12 c which represents the ability of modulating wave for example the normalized amplitude of run3a 3b 7a 7b equals to the amplitude of run3a 3b 7a 7b divided by the swh in run1a as shown in fig 12 the modulating abilities of depth and current are strongly influenced by the wind speed blue lines the depth induced normalized amplitude is decreased from run3a by up to 0 15 0 50 while the current induced one is increased from run3b by up to 0 05 0 15 in the situation of 12 5 ms 1 easterly wind it seems like the smaller wind wave is easier harder to be modulated by the current depth the different responses of their modulating ability to the wind speed might be attributed to the state of wind wave e g wave energy wave period ardhuin et al 2012 hansen et al 2013 wang and sheng 2018 and the wind input energy ardhuin et al 2012 viitak et al 2016 yu et al 2017 from the perspective of the wind input energy the different responses to wind speeds can be partly interpreted as follow the depth induced modulation is weakened by the decreased wind speed because there is less energy transferred from wind to wave via the wind wave interaction i e feedback mechanism miles 1957 krügermeyer et al 1978 which is proportional to the wind speed and the energy of wave itself on the contrary the current induced modulation is intensified by the decreased wind speed since the current plays an increasingly important role in the relative wind effect i e current vector unchanged but wind vector decreased therefore a more pronounced tidal variation in wind input energy interestingly the relationship between depth induced swh modulation and wind speed in this study is just opposite to that of moon 2005 this is considered to be due to the offshore wind implemented in his experiment i e a northwesterly wind in the yangtze river china whereas an onshore wind here suggesting a noticeable impact of wind direction under the impact of constant 19 ms 1 wind from different directions it is noted that the results of northerly wind run5a are mostly identical to those of the easterly wind cf red solid lines with black lines in fig 12 because the northerly wind generates relatively similar wave field in the region in comparison the westerly wind run5b and southerly wind run5c produce smaller wind wave because of the limited wind fetch fig 12c nevertheless the modulating ability of depth under the westerly and southerly winds remain nearly unchanged relative to that of the easterly wind with only a slight decrease in normalized amplitude fig 12a however the corresponding modulating ability of current appears different cross shore pattern compared to that of the easterly wind as the normalized amplitude decreases in offshore and increases in nearshore area fig 12b the reason for these discrepancies between onshore wind easterly northerly and offshore wind westerly southerly is unclear but might be ascribed to a combination of effects from the change in wave direction including the modifications of state of wind wave due to the change in wind fetch relative wind effect and current induced mechanisms e g current induced convergence wavenumber shift and refraction fig 12a shows that the wind speed and direction run4 run5 impact the modulating ability of depth to some extent but its cross shore pattern still presents an onshore increased trend as concluded in section 4 4 1 this pattern is mostly caused by the shoaling effect which is related to the slope of sea bottom to further explore the impact of shoaling the original bathymetry is modified with a gentler bottom run6a and a flat bottom run6b in the region shallower than 6 m depth it is demonstrated that the depth induced normalized amplitude decreases greatly from run3a to about 0 30 0 20 in the coast in the situations of run6a wl run6b wl fig 12a as expectation the corresponding cross shore patterns of the group velocity green lines in fig 11c are similar with those of the modulating ability of depth green lines in fig 12a which further confirms the predominant role of shoaling effect in controlling depth induced swh modulation but the cross shore pattern of current induced modulation is less affected by the changes of bottom slope fig 12b in order to eliminate the impact of spatial gradient of water level on the cross shore pattern induced by depth time varying spatial uniform water level field is implemented in run7a and negligible impact is noticed in this study fig 12a in addition as suggested by tolman 1990 the change rate of depth and current might influence the swh modulation and it has been proven that the tidal range of spring tide can induce approximately two times larger variances of swh than the neap tide one moon 2005 it is also of great interest to assess the impact of current condition on swh modulation for simplicity we just replace the original current field affected by wind and tide with a tidal only one run7b as can be seen in fig 12b the normalized amplitude induced by current is not sensitive to these changes of current field indicating the cross shore pattern is primarily generated by tidal current in the present study this possibly depends on the magnitude of wind induced current relative to that of tidal current or it may be due to a smaller scale domain considered in this study 5 discussion 5 1 effects of wave on sediment transport and storm surge the study region southwestern bohai bay locates in the north of china where the local weather system is affected by large scale weather systems such as the east asian winter monson and siberian high so that it is prone to the high northerly winds in winter october to march mo et al 2016 feng et al 2018 during that time the resulting extreme wind waves are expected to strongly impact local hydrodynamics and sediment morpho dynamics since the water depth is shallow and the fine sediment d 50 0 035 mm composed of silt and mud is easy to be suspended and transported kuang et al 2015 as a result the 33 km long 11 m depth waterway of huanghua harbor location refer to fig 1c had been reported to suffer from severe sediment siltation during the storm events until year 2006 when two regulating jetties were built on its both sides zhao 2007 feng et al 2008 zhang et al 2010 one possible cause for huanghua waterway siltation is that the sediment in offshore region is suspended greatly by local breaking wave and travels across the waterway as demonstrated in fig 5 the strong wind wave gradually deforms towards shore due to the mild slope of sea bottom resulting in a relative broad surf zone in the study region zhao 2007 zhang et al 2010 it follows that large amounts of fine sediment over the surf zone is to be resuspended in particular at the location where wave dissipates most greatly see fig 5b then the suspended sediment is to be transported northwesterly along with local intense mean current fig 8b when the suspended sediment transports across the waterway a sharp decrease of bed shear stress due to the increased water depth is to be encountered and thus causes a sudden sedimentation in the waterway the other possible cause for the waterway siltation is that the high concentration suspended sediment in coast is transported offshore towards the waterway previous observation and modelling works indicate that the concentration of suspended sediment in coast can be up to 2 5 kg m3 at the surface zhao 2007 feng et al 2008 kuang et al 2015 this high concentration suspended sediment on the east of huanghua harbor is supposed to be carried by the alongshore current fig 8b transports offshore along the harbor and finally deposits in the waterway it is worthy noticing that the wind induced current not shown and wave induced current fig 9 both can weaken enhance the onshore offshore tidal current on the east side of huanghua harbor e g fig 8d 8f this will make local tidal asymmetry become more ebb dominant and consequently strengthen the residual tidally averaged sediment transport offshore the bohai bay is frequently threatened by considerable storm surges of about 1 2 m during extreme weather conditions mo et al 2016 feng et al 2018 due to a favorable geometric feature for water piled up mo et al 2016 and shallow water depth where wind stress is more effective at raising a surge pugh 1987 the generation of storm surge is actually relating with wind stress atmospheric pressure and wave forcing wu et al 2018 as a main contributor of storm surge the wind induced surge would complicate the wave tide interaction as it modifies total water depth which will be addressed in another ongoing research nevertheless it can still be inferred that the wave induced surge in our study region with a maximum of about 0 16 m fig 7b would merely play a minor role in the surge which is considered to be attributed to the mild slope see section 4 1 but that is not always the case in other regions e g kim et al 2010 sheng et al 2010 wu et al 2018 where local wave induced surge can contribute up to 15 40 to the total surge in those situations the modulation of wave induced surge by tide and swh modulation the dotted line in fig 7b might be a potential factor for the phenomenon of periodic oscillation of storm surge valle levinson et al 2013 feng et al 2016 which has not yet drawn attention from the previous works 5 2 understanding different dominant factors for wave modulation with regard to the swh tidal modulation the sensitivity studies in section 4 4 have shown that the modulating ability of depth and current can vary with wind speed wind direction and bottom slope these studies help us better understand the different dominant factors for wave modulation in other regions table 1 besides the conclusion of tidal modulation of wave also depends on which wave parameter generally the swh is used to evaluate the modulation as different parameters can respond differently to depth and current moon 2005 nevertheless there are still some common conclusions that can be drawn from the previous works for instance tidal depth oscillation is usually regarded as the controlling effect of nearshore swh modulation during extreme weather conditions kang and iorio 2006 liu and xie 2009 kang and kim 2015 viitak et al 2016 yu et al 2017 based on the depth induced mechanisms discussed in this paper the predominant role of water depth in such situation is probably ascribed to one or several following reasons 1 the study region locates in the relative shallow water such as a bay or estuary so that the shoaling effect has a much stronger impact on the modulation than other wave current interaction mechanisms 2 the extremely strong wind and the resulting large wind wave is supposed to give rise to a severe tidal modulation due to the stronger wind wave interactions i e feedback mechanism 3 the surge wave tide interactions are able to produce a larger water depth change and thus intensify the depth induced modulation with respect to the works attributed wave modulation to the current wolf and prandle 1999 moon 2005 hansen et al 2013 hopkins et al 2016 wang and sheng 2018 most of their analyses are based on the results of station s located in the relative deep water taken the works focusing on the long straight beaches as examples wolf and prandle 1999 hansen et al 2013 hopkins et al 2016 their study regions usually have a much steeper bottom slope than that of the bay or estuary with a narrower shallow region in coast as a result the current induced mechanisms are expected to dominate most of the region while the depth induced mechanisms are only significant in the very shallow region wang and sheng 2018 in addition local alongshore current would produce remarkable current induced impacts on the onshore traveling wave due to a larger relative angle such as the current induced refraction hopkins et al 2016 6 conclusions in this study a wave current coupling model delft3d is applied to investigate the wave current interactions in the southwestern bohai bay china with special attention to the impacts of tidally varying depth and current on swh modulation and the relevant physical mechanisms in wave only situation the wind wave generated by a 19 ms 1 easterly wind propagates towards the coast and deforms along the propagating path as a result of wave deformation the radiation stress is increased onshore before entering the surf zone due to the shoaling effect however the radiation stress becomes decreased onshore in the surf zone due to the wave energy dissipation due to the radiation stress gradient original hydrostatic pressure gradient is disrupted so that the water surface is forced to change to balance the wave induced force resulting in a wave set down of 0 03 m in offshore and a wave set up of 0 06 m in coast under the wave current interactions the wave set up is influenced by the local bottom slope water depth and radiation stress gradient consequently the wave set up reaches a larger value at the location with steeper bottom slope and varies in tidal cycles due to the changes in water depth and radiation stress gradient the wave in turn affects the current motion through enhancing the bottom stress roughness leading to a decrease of mean current velocity by 0 10 ms 1 15 moreover the momentum transfer from wave to current i e the wave induced current also contributes to a non negligible impact on the current in general both the tidal variations of water depth and current are able to modulate the swh however the modulating ability of depth and current seems to have opposite variation trend in the cross shore direction i e the depth one increased onshore while the current one decreased as a result the dominant factor for swh modulation is to shift from the current offshore to the depth in nearshore area based on the model run of depth induced swh modulation five additional process oriented experiments are conducted and the effect of wave breaking is found to be responsible for the swh modulation in the breaking zone but its contribution is limited besides we also discuss the effects that cannot be estimated directly by our model and believe that the shoaling effect should be the main driving mechanism for depth induced modulation we further estimate the responses of depth and current induced modulation to wind speeds wind directions bottom slopes and flow conditions it is shown that the wind speed plays a quite important role in the swh modulation as the modulating ability of depth and current are decreased and increased respectively with the decreasing speed of easterly wind this discrepancy is attributed to the state of wind wave and the wind input energy with respect to the winds from other directions the impacts of northerly wind are generally similar as that of the easterly wind in comparison the modulating ability of current under the offshore winds westerly southerly is different from those of the onshore winds easterly northerly which is probably related to the changes in state of wind wave relative wind effect and current induced mechanisms in addition the depth induced modulation dominated by the shoaling effect largely depends on the bottom slope however the contributions of spatial gradient of water level and wind induced current to the cross shore pattern of swh modulation are negligible although this study is site specific the findings highlight the dominant impact of tidally varying depth and current on swh modulation these are likely to support the phenomena of tidal modulation of wave in other similar coastal regions globally credit authorship contribution statement honglin song methodology writing original draft cuiping

performance in cavitating conditions particularly the effect of the tip vortex cavitation on the interaction phenomenon the investigation was focused on the recently generated benchmark test data for the research catamaran the princess royal and its scaled model which was tested for cavitation and noise investigations in the large circulating water channel of cnr inm italy within the scope of the european collaborative project the propeller rudder hull interaction of a 1 3 4 scaled model of this vessel was simulated by using the commercial cfd software star ccm which implemented the schnerr sauer cavitation model for the cavitation effect large eddy simulations les was used for a better resolution of high velocity and pressure gradients to model the tip vortex cavitation a new adaptive meshing technique using a mesh adoption refinement approach for cavitation simulations marcs was applied for more effective modelling of the tip vortex cavitation during the propeller rudder hull

introduction computational modelling of tip vortex cavitation of marine propellers is still challenging for marine cfd community this is particularly true in modelling the tip vortex cavitation tvc from all propeller blades simultaneously and tracing them through a rudder in the propeller slipstream for relatively large rudder propeller clearances the investigation of the effect of tip vortex cavitation tvc on the interaction between the propeller and the rudder in the presence of a non uniform hull wake flow has great importance to the practising and academic naval architects although the numerical modelling of sheet cavitation has been tackled successfully by many investigators extending this model to include the tvc interacting with the rudder and in the presence of the unsteady wake are still under development e g windt bosschers 2015 lloyd et al 2017 viitanen siikonen 2017 yilmaz et al 2019 etc to understand the complex propeller rudder hull interaction the problem is divided into its components hull propeller hull rudder and propeller rudder following the approach proposed by kracht 1995 as a result the mutual interaction effect due to the propeller rudder combination will be investigated in detail as the main interest of this paper including the propeller cavitation and tvc mainly the propeller rudder interaction phenomenon may be investigated in two parts 1 the influence by the rudder on the propeller s pressure distribution where the propeller is operating in the flow in front of the rudder 2 the effect of the propeller flow field on the rudder which sometimes manifests itself in cavitation erosion of the rudder structure carlton 2007 in the past 30 years propeller rudder interaction has been investigated experimentally by many researchers e g molland and turnock 1991 goodrich and molland 1979 kracht 1995 and felli et al 2009 felli and falchi 2011 there have been recent investigations by using cfd methods for better understanding of the cavitation phenomenon including the effect of rudder regarding the sheet cavitation developed on the blades and tvc e g boorsma and whitworth 2011 paik et al 2013 and mascio et al 2015 although there have been pockets of useful efd and numerical studies involving low fidelity and cfd based numerical modelling there is a clear gap in modelling the propeller rudder hull interaction phenomenon in propeller cavitating conditions this paper was motivated by the desire to fill this gap utilizing the state of the art commercial cfd code in comparison with efd results in this paper the recently developed new mesh refinement technique which utilises a mesh adaption refinement approach for cavitation simulations marcs yilmaz et al 2019 was applied to the propeller rudder hull arrangement of the newcastle university research vessel the princess royal the cfd predictions for the scaled model of this vessel were compared with the experimental data which was generated by the cnr inm within the scope of the sonic project felli et al 2014 and the comparative results between the efd and cfd were discussed following the above introduction the paper continues with the review of the efd approach which was used for the experimental investigations of the propeller rudder hull interaction in the presence of the tip vortex cavitation by cnr inm at 2 the cfd investigation of the complex interaction phenomenon is presented at 3 with the detailed description of the computational domain preparation mesh generation and numerical model an overall summary of the new meshing approach for simulating tip vortex cavitation is also given in 3 while the associated results and discussions are included in 4 the paper ends with the conclusions and future works presented in 5 2 experimental investigations efd approach in order to investigate the propeller rudder interaction by including the effect of the hull the natural candidate for the efd data would be the princess royal s data because of the accessibility of the authors to the most of the data available for this vessel through their involvement with the fp7 sonic project the model tests conducted in the large circulation water channel of cnr inm in rome italy could be a good candidate to simulate the propeller rudder hull interaction due to the availability of a range of good visual observations of the cavitation patterns side view especially with the tip vortex cavitation extensions in the propeller s slipstream the efd data from this facility also included the effect of the free surface a review of these model tests including the general descriptions of the cnr inm test facility the model test matrix and arrangements is presented further details of these tests and the data can be found in sonic project report felli et al 2014 2 1 propeller rudder and hull model the princess royal for the model tests one demi hull of the princess royal vessel and its propeller were modelled with a scale factor λ 3 4 by taking advantage of the symmetry feature of the catamaran fig 1 shows the demi hull model which was made from fibreglass and the aft end details of the model more detailed information about the princess royal and its rudder and propeller geometries can be found in atlar et al 2013 2 2 test facilities cnr inm the large circulating water channel of cnr inm italy is a vertical plane free surface variable pressure recirculating channel having a capacity of 4 million of litres test water the test section of the facility has 10 m length 3 6 m width and 2 25 m maximum water depth the facility is driven by two 4 bladed axial flow impellers operating in two separate and parallel trunks and developing power of 435 kw at 1500 rpm the maximum water speed in the test section is 5 2 m s the facility can be depressurized down to 30 mbar by fitting a removable cover to the test section an overall arrangement of the facility is shown in fig 2 2 3 test matrix and setup the original test matrix was prepared using the four most representative and reliable runs of the full scale trials conducted in the sonic project and these corresponded to the engine speeds of 600 900 1200 and 1500 rpm with a reduction gear ratio of 1 1 75 as shown in table 1 in this table u is the cruising speed vm is the model testing velocity defined as u λ 0 5 n is the rotational speed of the propeller j is the advance ratio defined as vm nd where d is the propeller diameter p0 is the static pressure in the test section at the propeller immersion and σn is the cavitation number based on rotational speed the cavitation tests were performed with an oxygen content of 0 25 mg l at a water temperature of about 14 c as described in details in felli et al 2014 the cavitation observations were conducted using a high speed camera located as shown in fig 3 the model was set up according to the ittc procedure 7 5 02 03 03 3 on cavitation induced pressure fluctuation model scale experiments ittc 2014 the model was equipped with a dedicated dynamometer for the measurement of thrust and torque although no records of the thrust and torque were taken during these tests also detailed flow measurements were undertaken to qualify the characteristics of the flow in the propeller region see fig 4 the model tests also included measurement of fluctuating hull pressure at seven locations as shown in fig 5 3 numerical investigations cfd approach amongst the four test conditions given in table 1 condition 3 which presented one of the strongest tip vortex cavitation dynamics scenarios was selected to simulate for the cfd predictions condition 3 was preferred since it displayed the strongest tip vortex cavity dynamics observed during the cavitation tunnel tests at v3 condition more prominent tip vortices of larger diameters were present with some bubble cloud in the trailing vortex sheet cavitation observed to experience breaking up and shedding bubble and vortex structure in the chordwise direction this cavitation phenomenon was ideal for candidates to test the marcs approach for the computations the princess royal model and the test section of the circulating water channel were represented as precise as possible with regards to the dimensions location of the hull and cavitation conditions the latter is the function of the inflow speed propeller shaft speed and tunnel free surface height tunnel reference pressure saturated vapour pressure and fluid temperature etc for the proper validation study between efd and cfd investigations 3 1 computational domain the computational flow domain is shown in fig 6 which presents the position of the hull geometry and the test facility coordinate system with its origin located on the tunnel free surface at a 2 25 m water depth in a static condition in the model tests the hull geometry which represented one demi hull of the catamaran vessel was placed nearer to the right side of the tunnel walls to represent the centreline of the princess royal and to meet the symmetry condition with the breadth of the flow domain being 3 6 m in total the inlet and outlet patches of the flow domain were set at a distance of 2 5 m from the bow of the ship and 2 0 m from the aft of the ship respectively fig 6 the computational flow domain for the simulations included a rotating region which was represented by the sliding and overset mesh and a stationary region to represent the background as shown in fig 7 while the background region covered the hull keel and rudder geometries the rotating region included the propeller geometry only the overset region was prepared to cover the rudder geometry to be able to transfer the data tip vortices from the propeller blades through the rudder 3 2 mesh generation mesh adaption refinement approach for cavitation simulations marcs a new mesh refinement approach marcs yilmaz et al 2019 was used in this paper in order to simulate the tvc marcs mesh adaption refinement for cavitation simulations was validated using the insean e779a standard test propeller the postdam propeller test case pptc and the princess royal propeller as reported in e g yilmaz 2019 and yilmaz et al 2019 in marcs the mesh was refined only in the region where the tip vortex cavitation may occur in the propeller slipstream before the application of this procedure the simulation was run and sheet cavitation was simulated using the coarse mesh arrangement without any refinement at the end of this simulation using the existing solution the q criterion limit was determined by creating a threshold region in the star ccm software as shown in fig 8 this limit was defined by visualising an iso surface of the q criterion which is a vortex identification method calculated using equation 1 1 q 1 2 ω 2 s 2 where ω and s represent the spin rate tensor and strain rate tensor respectively marcs was used for the simulation of the tvc trajectories from the propeller blades through the rudder the details and the total number of cells generated for the sheet and tip vortex cavitation using marcs are shown in table 2 while fig 9 illustrates the mesh generated by using marcs for the tip vortex cavitation simulations see table 3 3 3 numerical model the cfd simulation was conducted by using the commercial cfd software star ccm for marine applications star ccm 2018 in order to simulate the free surface in the testing facility two different type fluids i e water and air and two different flow phases i e liquid and vapour had to be modelled while the free surface was defined between the water and air a multiphase interaction was described between the liquid and vapour phases of the water for modelling cavitation for turbulence modelling in this study large eddy simulation les was preferred for cavitation simulations this is due to the fact that in contrast to the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans model scale resolving simulations are able to solve the large scales of turbulence and model small scale motions for scale resolving simulations the two well known approaches detached eddy simulation des and large eddy simulation les are both available in star ccm les is used more commonly for simulating complex flows such as cavitation especially for the tip vortex type of cavitation as also used in this paper the cavitation was modelled by using the schnerr sauer cavitation model which is based on the rayleigh plesset equation the bubble growth rate in the schnerr sauer model schnerr and sauer 2001 is estimated by using equation 2 2 d r d t 2 2 3 p s a t p ρ l the cavitation number which is based on the rotational speed of the propeller is defined in equation 3 3 σ n p p s a t 0 5 ρ l n d 2 where p is the tunnel pressure psat is the saturation pressure of water ρl is the density of the fluid n is the shaft speed and d is the diameter of the propeller the time step value is selected as 5 10 5s which means 954 198 time steps per revolution i e for a rotational speed of 20 96 rps time per revolution is 0 0477s or angular blade displacement of 0 377 per time step 3 4 grid and time step uncertanities for evaluating the quality of the numerical results an uncertainty analysis was conducted for essential grid and time step sensitivity on the numerical solutions for these cases it was concluded that the most dominant errors were due to discretisation errors instead of iterative errors which were neglected accordingly uncertainty calculations followed the approach of stern et al 2001 this required at least 3 different cases such as computational grids time step values etc and estimated the uncertainty values for the calculations this method had been previously applied for non cavitating and cavitating conditions of the propellers including the princess royal yilmaz et al 2019 and yilmaz 2019 4 results and discussions 4 1 hydrodynamic performance and free surface representation the cfd simulation results of condition 3 are presented and compared with the experimental results regarding the cavitation dynamics hull pressure fluctuations and propeller hydrodynamic performance coefficients table 4 displays the cfd predicted propeller thrust and torque coefficient since the model tests did not measure the thrust and torque data no comparison of these coefficients can be made with the efd although the experimental values of t and q were not available kt and kq values were obtained from the experiments conducted in another cavitation tunnel with the model of the princess royal in a different setup and using wake screen tani et al 2019 the performance coefficients measured in these later tests were used for the comparison with the cfd results as shown in table 5 which present the reasonable correlation between the efd and cfd results regarding propeller performance in the presence of the tvc fig 10 a also demonstrates how the free surface was presented in the cfd model by displaying the volume fraction of air and water on the hull surfaces and b shows the wave pattern 4 2 cavitation pattern including tvc figs 11 and 12 shows a comparison of experiments in cavitation tunnel and cfd results respectively by concentrating on the efd images fig 11 these twelve consecutive images were captured for the respective blade position moving from approximately θ 10 to θ 40 to characterise the cavitation patterns observed in the critical wake shadow region of the propeller s action by following the same capturing process for the corresponding positions as shown in fig 12 similar cavitation patterns can also be observed in general and particularly for the tip vortex cavitation as far as the tvc is concerned despite the tvc was extended up to the rudder thanks to the application of marcs the traces of the tvc could not be fully developed throughout the rudder this lack of precision in the modelling can be explained with the nature of the dynamics of the tvc which can be observed from the experimental images where the tip vortices were also losing their strengths as they approached the rudder which can be observed from fig 11 this causes the disappearance of the tip vortices and hence requires a smaller surface mesh size for the refinement region in the cfd calculations to capture the tvc while they are losing their strength as they approach the leading edge of the rudder as shown in fig 12 it was concluded that the tvc could not be extended clearly up to the rudder due to the interface problem between the sliding mesh and overset mesh regions at some propeller blade positions although a combined system was used to try to eliminate this problem on the other hand the vortex moves upwards because of the presence of the rudder reaching the upper side of the overset mesh as it can be seen in figs 9 and 11 this results in a deteriorated solution especially on the extension of the tip vortices as shown in figs 12 and 13 which requires further investigations as future work the extra cavitating bubbles which were produced at the interface surface between the sliding mesh and the overset regions due to the mesh refinement with the small mesh surfaces on the interface were also observed in fig 12 unfortunately these extra cavitating bubbles do not reflect the reality in order to provide a more focused comparison of the tvc trajectories fig 13 presents a comparison of the efd and cfd images overlaid at one blade position of the propeller in this figure the experimental image is placed in the background and the cfd image is placed on the top as shown in these comparative images in spite of the underpredicted tip vortex cavitation extent by the cfd the correct trajectories of the tip vortex cavitation in the propeller s downstream can be clearly seen by proving the ability of the marcs procedure including the effect of the non uniform hull wake flow based on the cfd simulations fig 14 and fig 15 are also included to show the increase in the volume of cavitation due to the better modelling of the tip and hub vortex cavitation thanks to marcs while fig 14 illustrates the predicted cavitation patterns using the coarse mesh on the left and the marcs on the right respectively fig 15 shows the impact of the increased cavity volume due to the tip vortex and hub vortex cavitation using the marcs the cavity volume fig 15 was integrated using the volume fraction of vapour value in rotating and overset regions while the cavitation volume was generated during the solution time while the cavity volume was periodic before the marcs application this value became unstable initially after the marcs application which caused the change of the mesh suddenly due to the mesh refinement another reason contributing to this instability can be explained by the varying tvc pattern which was changing during the computation due to the non uniformity of the flow associated with the inclined shaft arrangement and varying hull wake this effect could not be seen on the sheet cavitation which did not change dramatically on propeller blades during the simulation 4 3 hull pressure fluctuations figs 16 and 17 present a comparison of the fluctuating hull pressures between measurements and computations at six pressure probe locations as shown in fig 5 while the red line demonstrates the ensemble averaged time signals for the pressure sensors on the model hull surface recorded during the experiments the black line presents the corresponding pressure data based on the cfd simulations as shown in these figures although the cfd simulations generally show a reasonable correlation for the magnitudes with the experimental data for all probe locations in some cases phase shift between the efd and cfd results are noticeable for these comparisons only the sheet cavitation was modelled due to the unstable cavitation dynamics of the tip vortex cavitation with the application of the marcs to predict pressure fluctuations on the hull very high accuracy of the computations is required especially for the prediction of the cavity volume change in solution time which is unstable fig 15 for this case due to the non uniformity hull wake inclined shaft and the presence of the rudder the simulation of tip vortex cavity bursting is also important that has a strong effect on the pressure pulse predictions for such calculations higher accuracy on both time and space and more complicated cavitation models including bubble collapse is also required another reason contributing to the phase difference can be associated with the position of the sensors also the phase shift was experienced with the sensors p2 p3 and p5 which are nearer to the propeller and the propeller s slipstream at that region where the turbulence was higher and cavity volume changed dramatically these factors are required to be investigated within details to improve the prediction of the pressure fluctuations and to eliminate the phase shift between efd results and cfd predictions as to future work 5 conclusions and future works the main objective of the paper is to demonstrate the capability of the state of the art commercial cfd code for an effective investigation of the propeller rudder hull interaction in the presence of the cavitation especially the tvc to achieve the above purpose firstly the cavitation tunnel tests conducted in the depressurized large circulating water channel of cnr inm with the scaled model of the princess royal research vessel were simulated using the commercial code star ccm and results were compared with the experiments for one of the test conditions condition 3 which displayed the strongest tip vortex cavitation in general although the improvements have been achieved for extending the tvc in the propeller slipstream the interaction between the tvc and rudder could not be simulated at the desired accuracy due to the complexity of the full interaction phenomenon amongst the propeller rudder hull in the presence of the hull geometry and its wake the new adaptive mesh refinement technique marcs developed previously in yilmaz et al 2019 and yilmaz 2019 could give unstable results at model scale with the inclined shaft and in non uniform flow conditions this would result in the appearance and disappearance of the tip vortex cavitation in solution time when the generated mesh matched with vortex trajectory and was no longer suitable respectively due to the rotation of the refined mesh region the marcs approach therefore still needs to be further developed applying re meshing methods at each time step to be able to keep the vortices matched with the refined mesh region in the propeller slipstream when the blade position changes in the solution time credit

turbulence and model small scale motions for scale resolving simulations the two well known approaches detached eddy simulation des and large eddy simulation les are both available in star ccm les is used more commonly for simulating complex flows such as cavitation especially for the tip vortex type of cavitation as also used in this paper the cavitation was modelled by using the schnerr sauer cavitation model which is based on the rayleigh plesset equation the bubble growth rate in the schnerr sauer model schnerr and sauer 2001 is estimated by using equation 2 2 d r d t 2 2 3 p s a t p ρ l the cavitation number which is based on the rotational speed of the propeller is defined in equation 3 3 σ n p p s a t 0 5 ρ l n d 2 where p is the tunnel pressure psat is the saturation pressure of water ρl is the density of the fluid n is the shaft speed and d is the diameter of the propeller the time step value is selected as 5 10 5s which means 954 198 time steps per revolution i e for a rotational speed of 20 96 rps time per revolution is 0 0477s or angular blade displacement of 0 377 per time step 3 4 grid and time step uncertanities for evaluating the quality of the numerical results an uncertainty analysis was conducted for essential grid and time step sensitivity on the numerical solutions for these cases it was concluded that the most dominant errors were due to discretisation errors instead of iterative errors which were neglected accordingly uncertainty calculations followed the approach of stern et al 2001 this required at least 3 different cases such as computational grids time step values etc and estimated the uncertainty values for the calculations this method had been previously applied for non cavitating and cavitating conditions of the propellers including the princess royal yilmaz et al 2019 and yilmaz 2019 4 results and discussions 4 1 hydrodynamic performance and free surface representation the cfd simulation results of condition 3 are presented and compared with the experimental results regarding the cavitation dynamics hull pressure fluctuations and propeller hydrodynamic performance coefficients table 4 displays the cfd predicted propeller thrust and torque coefficient since the model tests did not measure the thrust and torque data no comparison of these coefficients can be made with the efd although the experimental values of t and q were not available kt and kq values were obtained from the experiments conducted in another cavitation tunnel with the model of the princess royal in a different setup and using wake screen tani et al 2019 the performance coefficients measured in these later tests were used for the comparison with the cfd results as shown in table 5 which present the reasonable correlation between the efd and cfd results regarding propeller performance in the presence of the tvc fig 10 a also demonstrates how the free surface was presented in the cfd model by displaying the volume fraction of air and water on the hull surfaces and b shows the wave pattern 4 2 cavitation pattern including tvc figs 11 and 12 shows a comparison of experiments in cavitation tunnel and cfd results respectively by concentrating on the efd images fig 11 these twelve consecutive images were captured for the respective blade position moving from approximately θ 10 to θ 40 to characterise the cavitation patterns observed in the critical wake shadow region of the propeller s action by following the same capturing process for the corresponding positions as shown in fig 12 similar cavitation patterns can also be observed in general and particularly for the tip vortex cavitation as far as the tvc is concerned despite the tvc was extended up to the rudder thanks to the application of marcs the traces of the tvc could not be fully developed throughout the rudder this lack of precision in the modelling can be explained with the nature of the dynamics of the tvc which can be observed from the experimental images where the tip vortices were also losing their strengths as they approached the rudder which can be observed from fig 11 this causes the disappearance of the tip vortices and hence requires a smaller surface mesh size for the refinement region in the cfd calculations to capture the tvc while they are losing their strength as they approach the leading edge of the rudder as shown in fig 12 it was concluded that the tvc could not be extended clearly up to the rudder due to the interface problem between the sliding mesh and overset mesh regions at some propeller blade positions although a combined system was used to try to eliminate this problem on the other hand the vortex moves upwards because of the presence of the rudder reaching the upper side of the overset mesh as it can be seen in figs 9 and 11 this results in a deteriorated solution especially on the extension of the tip vortices as shown in figs 12 and 13 which requires further investigations as future work the extra cavitating bubbles which were produced at the interface surface between the sliding mesh and the overset regions due to the mesh refinement with the small mesh surfaces on the interface were also observed in fig 12 unfortunately these extra cavitating bubbles do not reflect the reality in order to provide a more focused comparison of the tvc trajectories fig 13 presents a comparison of the efd and cfd images overlaid at one blade position of the propeller in this figure the experimental image is placed in the background and the cfd image is placed on the top as shown in these comparative images in spite of the underpredicted tip vortex cavitation extent by the cfd the correct trajectories of the tip vortex cavitation in the propeller s downstream can be clearly seen by proving the ability of the marcs procedure including the effect of the non uniform hull wake flow based on the cfd simulations fig 14 and fig 15 are also included to show the increase in the volume of cavitation due to the better modelling of the tip and hub vortex cavitation thanks to marcs while fig 14 illustrates the predicted cavitation patterns using the coarse mesh on the left and the marcs on the right respectively fig 15 shows the impact of the increased cavity volume due to the tip vortex and hub vortex cavitation using the marcs the cavity volume fig 15 was integrated using the volume fraction of vapour value in rotating and overset regions while the cavitation volume was generated during the solution time while the cavity volume was periodic before the marcs application this value became unstable initially after the marcs application which caused the change of the mesh suddenly due to the mesh refinement another reason contributing to this instability can be explained by the varying tvc pattern which was changing during the computation due to the non uniformity of the flow associated with the inclined shaft arrangement and varying hull wake this effect could not be seen on the sheet cavitation which did not change dramatically on propeller blades during the simulation 4 3 hull pressure fluctuations figs 16 and 17 present a comparison of the fluctuating hull pressures between measurements and computations at six pressure probe locations as shown in fig 5 while the red line demonstrates the ensemble averaged time signals for the pressure sensors on the model hull surface recorded during the experiments the black line presents the corresponding pressure data based on the cfd simulations as shown in these figures although the cfd simulations generally show a reasonable correlation for the magnitudes with the experimental data for all probe locations in some cases phase shift between the efd and cfd results are noticeable for these comparisons only the sheet cavitation was modelled due to the unstable cavitation dynamics of the tip vortex cavitation with the application of the marcs to predict pressure fluctuations on the hull very high accuracy of the computations is required especially for the prediction of the cavity volume change in solution time which is unstable fig 15 for this case due to the non uniformity hull wake inclined shaft and the presence of the rudder the simulation of tip vortex cavity bursting is also important that has a strong effect on the pressure pulse predictions for such calculations higher accuracy on both time and space and more complicated cavitation models including bubble collapse is also required another reason contributing to the phase difference can be associated with the position of the sensors also the phase shift was experienced with the sensors p2 p3 and p5 which are nearer to the propeller and the propeller s slipstream at that region where the turbulence was higher and cavity volume changed dramatically these factors are required to be investigated within details to improve the prediction of the pressure fluctuations and to eliminate the phase shift between efd results and cfd predictions as to future work 5 conclusions and future works the main objective of the paper is to demonstrate the capability of the state of the art commercial cfd code for an effective investigation of the propeller rudder hull interaction in the presence of the cavitation especially the tvc to achieve the above purpose firstly the cavitation tunnel tests conducted in the depressurized large circulating water channel of cnr inm with the scaled model of the princess royal research vessel were simulated using the commercial code star ccm and results were compared with the experiments for one of the test conditions condition 3 which displayed the strongest tip vortex cavitation in general although the improvements have been achieved for extending the tvc in the propeller slipstream the interaction between the tvc and rudder could not be simulated at the desired accuracy due to the complexity of the full interaction phenomenon amongst the propeller rudder hull in the presence of the hull geometry and its wake the new adaptive mesh refinement technique marcs developed previously in yilmaz et al 2019 and yilmaz 2019 could give unstable results at model scale with the inclined shaft and in non uniform flow conditions this would result in the appearance and disappearance of the tip vortex cavitation in solution time when the generated mesh matched with vortex trajectory and was no longer suitable respectively due to the rotation of the refined mesh region the marcs approach therefore still needs to be further developed applying re meshing methods at each time step to be able to keep the vortices matched with the refined mesh region in the propeller slipstream when the blade position changes in the solution time credit
