4520,in cold regions freeze thaw cycles play a critical role in many engineering and agricultural applications and cause soil water flow and heat transport studies to be much more complicated due to phase changes involved a fully coupled numerical module for simulating the simultaneous movement of water vapor and heat during freezing thawing periods was developed and incorporated in the hydrus 1d software in this study to avoid numerical instabilities caused by a sudden increase in the apparent heat capacity during a phase change a new approach based on the available energy concept was adopted to adjust soil temperature when the freezing temperature is reached the proposed freezing module s performance was then validated using experimental data collected at three field sites with typical seasonal freezing thawing processes results showed that the model could efficiently obtain a convergent solution and that simulated soil moisture and temperature variations captured the observed data well driven by soil matric potential and temperature gradients both liquid water and water vapor flowed towards the freezing front the isothermal liquid flux was the most significant component of overall flow in most soil depths except in the frozen layer where it decreased by 1 5 orders of magnitude from values before freezing instead the thermal vapor flux was the dominant moisture transfer mechanism in the frozen layer and contributed about 10 to the ice formation these results indicate that the model which considers the coupled movement of water vapor and heat can better describe the physical mechanisms of the hydrological cycle in the vadose zone during the freezing thawing periods keywords freeze thaw process unfrozen water content soil temperature vapor flow hydrus 1d 1 introduction the areas with frozen soil are widely distributed in middle and high latitudes occupying 55 60 of the land surface in the northern hemisphere and approximately 72 of the chinese territory wang et al 2017 zhang et al 2012 freezing thawing cycles in these regions substantially impact many engineering and agricultural applications such as frost heave damage in high speed railway embankments and melting water infiltration kelleners et al 2016 kurylyk and watanabe 2013 zhao et al 2013 meanwhile phase changes during freezing thawing cycles significantly affect soil hydraulic and thermal properties as well as soil water flow and heat transport lundin 1990 watanabe and wake 2009 yi et al 2014 zhang et al 2012 for example due to the blocking effect of the ice present at subfreezing temperatures the isothermal hydraulic conductivity for liquid water is estimated to decrease by approximately 1 and 2 orders of magnitude when about 15 and 20 of soil water is frozen respectively zhao et al 2013 therefore the freezing thawing process causes studies of the coupled movement of soil water and heat to be more complex and crucial for many environmental and engineering problems in cold regions vapor flow has been recognized to contribute to transfers of mass and energy especially in arid areas such as northwestern china deb et al 2011 zeng et al 2009a in these regions soil moisture movement takes place in the form of both liquid water and water vapor flows and the transformation between liquid water and water vapor occurs continuously li et al 2010 sakai et al 2009 scanlon et al 2003 zeng et al 2009b zhao et al 2013 since phase changes between liquid water and water vapor could release or store a substantial amount of latent energy vapor flow has a considerable impact on the soil energy balance cahill and parlange 1998 when soil is frozen vapor flow may play a dominant role in moisture transfer teng et al 2018 also laboratory freezing experiments have shown that vapor flow promotes ice formation and its contribution increases with decreasing water content before freezing yu et al 2018 the theory of the coupled water vapor and heat transport in porous media under non isothermal conditions was pioneered by philip and de vries 1957 since then many researchers have been working during the past several decades on advancing the understanding of these coupled processes cass et al 1984 milly 1984 nassar and horton 1989 saito et al 2006 with increasing computational capacity and improving simulation accuracy underlying mechanisms of coupled water and heat transfers under unfrozen soil conditions have attracted growing interest and are widely reported deb et al 2011 saito et al 2006 sakai et al 2009 zeng et al 2009b multiple numerical models have been developed for simulating the soil water and heat movement during freeze thaw periods and significant progress has been achieved over recent decades in modeling these processes flerchinger and saxton 1989 guymon and luthin 1974 hansson et al 2004 jansson 2012 šimůnek et al 2016 yu et al 2018 2020 due to different original concerns these models differ in the formulations of water flow and heat transport equations and are applied to address specific issues bao et al 2016 kurylyk and watanabe 2013 li et al 2010 however relative contributions of vapor flow and its phase transition to the total water and heat balances are usually considered less significant in frozen soils and neglected li et al 2010 slater et al 1998 this simplification may be practical for moist soils but not for arid areas bao et al 2016 guymon and luthin 1974 by neglecting the role of vapor flow the physical mechanism behind soil water flow and heat transport during the freezing period cannot be fully understood flerchinger and saxton 1989 hansson et al 2004 kurylyk and watanabe 2013 meanwhile existing studies of the coupled water vapor and heat transport during the freeze thaw process contain some shortcomings that need to be overcome most models were calibrated and validated using data from laboratory freezing experiments or literature instead of field experiments he et al 2018 teng et al 2018 2020 usually actual field conditions are more complicated e g time variable atmospheric boundary and multi layered soil profiles resulting in these types of models being unsuitable for practical applications additionally the fixed freezing point approach which converts the entire liquid water content into the ice content at the freezing point e g 0 is adopted in some of these models to estimate the ice content li et al 2010 niu and yang 2006 however since some liquid water always exists in the frozen soil no matter how low the temperature is this approach represents a severe simplification of the soil freezing process sun et al 2012 teng et al 2020 while this approach may avoid numerical instabilities caused by phase changes it results in low precision and unrealistic simulation results this study s main objective is to develop a fully coupled numerical model for simulating the simultaneous movement of water vapor and heat in complicated field situations during freeze thaw cycles that is both physically realistic and computational stable and efficient since the hydrus 1d model šimůnek et al 2008 2016 has been widely shown to perform well in evaluating the coupled movement of water vapor and heat under nonfreezing conditions e g deb et al 2011 saito et al 2006 sakai et al 2009 zeng et al 2009a 2009b the proposed numerical model is incorporated into the hydrus 1d code the previous version of the hydrus 1d freezing module was developed and successfully used to evaluate laboratory column freezing experiments by hansson et al 2004 the model was then also used by zhao et al 2016 to simulate the variations in soil moisture and temperature in a field experiment however the current model becomes significantly less stable and may encounter numerical problems in more complicated situations and neglects the effects of vapor flow thus the specific objectives of this study are i to develop a rigorous and stable numerical freezing module incorporated into the hydrus 1d software for simulating the coupled movement of water vapor and heat under freezing conditions ii to evaluate the model performance using in situ observation data of soil water contents and temperatures and iii to analyze spatial and temporal variations in soil water contents temperatures and water fluxes during the freezing thawing process 2 model development 2 1 mathematical description soil water flow in seasonally frozen soils with both above and below freezing temperatures is described by the following mass conservation equation hansson et al 2004 1 θ l t ρ v ρ l θ v t ρ i ρ l θ i t z q lh q lt q vh q vt s z k lh h z k lh k lt t z k vh h z k vt t z s where θl θv and θi are the volumetric liquid water vapor and ice contents l3 l 3 respectively ρl ρv and ρi are the densities of liquid water water vapor and ice m l 3 respectively t is time t z is the spatial coordinate positive upward l qlh and qlt are the isothermal and thermal liquid water fluxes l t 1 respectively qvh and qvt are the isothermal and thermal vapor fluxes l t 1 respectively klh l t 1 and klt l2 k 1 t 1 are the isothermal and thermal hydraulic conductivities for liquid water respectively kvh l t 1 and kvt l2 k 1 t 1 are the isothermal and thermal hydraulic conductivities for water vapor respectively h is the pressure head l t is the temperature k and s is a sink term t 1 which usually accounts for root water uptake the first three terms on the right hand side of eq 1 represent liquid water flow driven by the pressure head gradient gravity and temperature gradient and the next two terms are vapor flow driven by the pressure head and temperature gradients according to the pore size distribution model of mualem 1976 the isothermal hydraulic conductivity for liquid water can be described using the van genuchten 1980 model as 2 θ l θ r θ s θ r 1 α h n m 3 k lh k s s e l 1 1 s e 1 m m 2 where θr and θs are the residual and saturated water contents l3 l 3 respectively α l 1 n and m are empirical parameters l is a pore connectivity parameter which normally is set to 0 5 mualem 1976 ks is the saturated hydraulic conductivity l t 1 and se is the effective liquid saturation meanwhile the resistance to water flow in soil pores increases significantly due to the presence of ice the blocking effect gradually increases with an increase in the ice content portion of the total water content the isothermal hydraulic conductivity for liquid water flow in freezing soil kflh l t 1 can then be expressed as 4 k flh 10 ψ q k lh where ψ is the impedance factor for liquid water flow due to the ice formation which usually ranges from 0 5 to 6 5 depending on soil properties zhao et al 2016 and q is the mass ratio of the ice content to the total water content the thermal hydraulic conductivity for liquid water flow and isothermal and thermal hydraulic conductivities for vapor flow are defined as follows saito et al 2006 5 k lt k lh h g wt 1 γ 0 d γ dt 6 k vh d ρ w h r ρ sv mg rt 7 k vt d ρ w η h r d ρ sv dt where gwt is the gain factor which corrects the temperature dependence of the soil water retention curve and is defined as 7 for sands sakai et al 2009 γ 0 is the surface tension at 25 c m t 2 71 89 g s 2 γ is the surface tension of soil water m t 2 hr is the relative humidity ρsv is the saturated vapor density m l 3 m is the molecular weight of water m mol 1 0 018 kg mol 1 g is the gravitational acceleration l t 2 r is the universal gas constant j mol 1 k 1 8 315 j mol 1 k 1 η is the enhancement factor and d is the vapor diffusivity in soil l2 t 1 which can be calculated as follows campbell 1985 8 d d a θ a τ where θa is the air filled porosity l3 l 3 da is the vapor diffusivity in the air l2 t 1 and τ is the tortuosity factor detailed descriptions of related parameters are presented in table 1 the governing equation for heat transport in a variably saturated rigid soil is given by the following energy conservation equation nassar and horton 1989 9 c p t t l f ρ i θ i t l w ρ w θ v t z λ t z c w q l t z c v q v t z l 0 q v z c w s t where cp is the volumetric heat capacity of moist soil m l 1 t 2 k 1 which is defined as the sum of the volumetric heat capacities of the solid cn 1 9 mj m 3 k 1 liquid water cw 4 2 mj m 3 k 1 water vapor cv 6 3 kj m 3 k 1 and ice ci 2 1 mj m 3 k 1 phases multiplied by their respective volumetric fractions campbell 1985 l f is the latent heat of freezing l2 t 2 3 34 105 j kg 1 lw is the latent heat of vaporization of liquid water l2 t 2 λ is the apparent thermal conductivity m l t 3 k 1 and ql and qv are liquid and vapor fluxes l t 1 respectively the components of soil heat fluxes on the right hand side of eq 9 include heat flow by conduction convection of sensible heat with liquid water flow convection of sensible heat with vapor flow and convection of latent heat with vapor flow the apparent soil thermal conductivity which combines the thermal conductivity of the porous medium in the absence of flow with the thermal dispersivity can be expressed for unfrozen conditions as follows hansson et al 2004 10 λ λ 0 θ l β l c w q w where βl is longitudinal thermal dispersivity l and λ 0 is the thermal conductivity of the porous medium m l t 3 k 1 which can be expressed according to chung and horton 1987 as 11 λ 0 θ l b 1 b 2 θ l b 3 θ l 0 5 where b 1 b 2 and b 3 are empirical parameters that depend on soil texture m l t 3 k 1 and equal to 0 228 2 406 and 4 909 w m 1 k 1 for sands respectively since ice can also influence heat conduction the thermal conductivity of freezing soils can be calculated as follows 12 λ 0 θ l b 1 b 2 θ l f θ i b 3 θ l f θ i 0 5 where f accounts for the difference between the thermal conductivities of liquid water and in soils and can be defined as suggested by hansson et al 2004 for unfrozen soils the liquid water content is a function of the pressure head it can be estimated from the soil water characteristics curve as a function of only two unknown parameters h and t due to another unknown parameter θi under freezing conditions one additional equation is required to solve this new parameter kurylyk and watanabe 2013 sun et al 2012 based on the thermal dynamic equilibrium theory and the assumption that the ice pressure is equal to zero when soil is frozen the soil matric potential can be estimated for subfreezing temperatures using the generalized clapeyron equation as follows hansson et al 2004 13 h l f g ln t t f where tf is the freezing point of liquid water k which varies with soil texture and the initial water content this indicates that the liquid water content is a function of temperature and can be obtained by the soil water freezing curve when soil is frozen substituting eq 13 into eq 2 leads to the relationship between the liquid water content and temperature the soil freezing characteristics curve as follows 14 θ l θ r θ s θ r 1 α l f g ln t t f n m the mathematical model of the coupled movement of water vapor and energy in soils under freezing thawing conditions described above has surprisingly few additional parameters in addition to those required by the standard water flow and heat transport models i e soil hydraulic retention and conductivity and thermal capacity and conductivity parameters the values of most additional parameters e g latent heat of freezing and vaporization vapor density vapor diffusivity and their temperature dependences are known and can be found in the literature see table 2 the two main additional new parameters are the impedance factor ψ in eq 4 and the f parameter in eq 12 which affect the hydraulic and thermal conductivities respectively in frozen soils thus the coupled model is still sensitive mainly to the soil hydraulic and thermal parameters as in the standard water flow and heat transport models 2 2 calculation procedure a flexible time stepping method is used in the hydrus 1d model for calculating the coupled movement of liquid water water vapor and heat the main computational procedure at each timestep is shown in fig 1 and is described below in detail first the soil water flow equation is solved using the finite difference method for both spatial and temporal discretizations šimůnek et al 2008 the modified richards equation is discretized and assembled into a linear equation system i e the matrix equation after incorporating the boundary conditions the gaussian elimination method is used to solve the matrix equation and to obtain the new pressure head and the corresponding liquid water content at the new time level the picard iteration procedure is used to solve this highly nonlinear equation the iterative process continues until absolute changes in pressure heads and soil water contents in all nodes are less than the prescribed tolerance kelleners 2013 šimůnek et al 2008 next the galerkin finite element and finite difference methods are applied for calculating the spatial and temporal derivatives for the heat transport equation respectively šimůnek et al 2008 nodal values of soil water contents and fluxes calculated by solving the water flow equation are used as known values in the heat transport equation a similar solution strategy is applied for calculating the new soil temperatures until achieving convergency the steps mentioned above are looped twice at each timestep i e iloop 1 2 the main reason for the second loop is to update the solution of the water flow equation using updated values of soil temperatures and ice contents if ice exists these are obtained by the heat transport equation solution which reflects the effects of the freezing process and temperature changes on soil water flow within the current timestep note that there are two unknowns when solving each governing equation the liquid water content θl and the pressure head h in the water flow equation and the ice content θi and the temperature t in the heat transport equation a mass conservative method proposed by celia et al 1990 is used in the time difference scheme to eliminate θl and θi from the two equations as shown below hansson et al 2004 15 θ l t θ l j 1 k 1 θ l j δ t θ l j 1 k 1 θ l j 1 k δ t θ l j 1 k θ l j δ t c j 1 k h j 1 k 1 h j 1 k δ t θ l j 1 k θ l j δ t 16 l f ρ i θ i t l f ρ i θ i j 1 k 1 θ i j δ t l f ρ i θ i j 1 k 1 θ i j 1 k δ t l f ρ i θ i j 1 k θ i j δ t l f 2 ρ i gt c j 1 k t j 1 k 1 t j 1 k δ t l f ρ i θ i j 1 k θ i j δ t where superscripts j 1 and j indicate the current and previous time levels respectively k 1 and k indicate the current and previous iterations for the current time level respectively c is the soil water capacity l 1 which is defined as the derivative of the water content with respect to the pressure head and δt is the time interval between the previous and current time levels 2 3 determination of ice content when estimating the ice content in the iteration procedure large errors often appear in calculations of soil water contents and temperatures and consequently the numerical convergency is challenging to achieve bao et al 2016 li et al 2010 therefore in the proposed model the ice content is determined after calculating the new temperature as shown in fig 1 for subfreezing temperatures liquid water and ice coexist in soil pores based on the principle of mass conservation the total water content θt l3 l 3 can be defined as the sum of the liquid water content and the ice content 17 θ t θ l ρ i ρ l θ i then the liquid water content is updated based on the soil water freezing curve using the newly calculated soil temperature and the existence of ice is determined using the θl θt criterion note that there exists no ice when the soil temperature is in the interval between the freezing temperature and zero temperature tf t 0 as explained below in detail there is no ice for the above zero temperature conditions the liquid water content needs to be updated at the first iteration when the soil temperature turns positive from a negative value compared with the previous version of the freezing module hansson et al 2004 differences in liquid water and ice densities are considered in the updated module the inclusion of density differences was expected to decrease simulation errors kelleners 2013 2 4 model stability the apparent heat capacity ca m l 1 t 2 k 1 which includes the latent heat as an additional term in the heat capacity can be calculated using the generalized clapeyron equation and the soil water capacity as follows 18 c a c p l f ρ i d θ i dt c p l f 2 ρ i gt c in fully saturated soils the apparent heat capacity increases by about 2 and 5 orders of magnitude for silty clay and sand respectively when the freezing point 0 c is reached the freezing point for unsaturated soils is lower than 0 c and can be estimated as follows 19 t f t 0 exp gh l f t 0 where t 0 273 15 c is the absolute temperature when the freezing point is reached the significant difference in the apparent heat capacity for temperatures above and below the freezing point can lead to a considerable underestimation of the soil temperature this may result in oscillations in calculated temperatures between negative and positive values within a timestep hansson et al 2004 wang et al 2017 a method based on available energy for a phase change is adopted in our simulations to overcome this instability caused by a phase change between liquid and solid states of water the new temperature at the first iteration when a soil layer crosses the freezing point is adjusted as follows flerchinger and saxton 1989 20 t r t f e a c a 21 e a c p t f t where tr is the revised temperature ea is available energy for freezing this adjustment method was found to generate more consistent calculation results and avoid undesired numerical oscillations 3 materials and methods 3 1 in situ experiments experimental data were collected at three field sites a the yu lin desert ecosystem research station the yd site b the inner mongolia grassland ecosystem research station the ig site and c the tibetan plateau maqu grassland mg site the first in situ experiment was located at the yu lin desert ecosystem research station the yd site which is a typical area with seasonal freezing in northwestern china 109 41 44 e and 38 21 46 n fig 2 the climate in this region can be characterized as cold and dry cheng et al 2013 zheng et al 2020 observations from the nearby yulin meteorological station indicate that the long term since 1961 average air temperature is approximately 6 4 c and the minimum air temperature reaches 31 4 c the average annual rainfall and potential evaporation are 360 and 2343 mm respectively the soil surface is flat at the study site and vegetation covers less than 5 of it during the freezing period to determine soil physical properties as listed in table 2 soil samples were collected at a 20 cm interval from the surface to the 200 cm depth soil water contents and temperatures were measured at depths of 10 20 50 100 and 200 cm by the hydro probe ii sensors stevens inc usa every 10 min before being installed all sensors were calibrated using the original soil samples the measurement principle of the hydro probe ii sensors is based on the frequency domain method cheng et al 2014 because the permittivity of liquid water 78 is significantly higher than those of the soil matrix 3 5 ice 3 4 and air 1 observed soil water contents could be considered to represent unfrozen water contents when the soil is frozen sun et al 2012 watanabe and wake 2009 micrometeorological variables including air temperature wind speed relative humidity and precipitation were recorded at a 30 min interval as shown in fig 3 the total amounts of rainfall and snow were 20 8 and 13 6 mm in winters of 2017 2018 and 2018 2019 respectively mainly in the form of rains after soil thawing the proposed model was further applied to simulate the coupled movement of water vapor and heat at two grassland sites fig 2 to assess the model applicability the inner mongolia grassland ig site is located at the inner mongolia grassland ecosystem research station 116 42 18 e and 43 37 50 n and this site has a continental climate with cold winter and warm summer zhao et al 2016 on the other hand the maqu grassland mg site is set up on the north eastern fringe of the tibetan plateau 101 38 102 45 e and 33 30 34 15 n with the elevation ranging from 3200 to 4200 m above the sea level yu et al 2018 the climate is characterized as wet and cold with dry winter and rainy summer table 3 lists detailed information about the two sites and field observations 3 2 numerical simulation the dataset collected at the yd site from november 1 2017 to march 31 2018 was used to calibrate the hydrus 1d freezing module soil parameters were initially estimated using the neural network method based on soil physical properties and then optimized using the levenberg marquardt algorithm which is directly implemented into the hydrus code šimůnek et al 2008 2016 zhao et al 2013 the calibrated soil hydraulic parameters are presented in table 2 subsequently the measured soil data from november 1 2018 to march 31 2019 were used for model validation the soil profile was 200 cm deep and a spatial discretization of 1 cm was applied observed soil water content and temperature data on november 1 2017 and november 1 2018 were used as initial conditions for the two periods respectively and values between two measurement depths were obtained using linear interpolation for water flow the atmospheric boundary condition was imposed on the soil surface the free drainage condition was assumed at the bottom boundary because the groundwater table fluctuated deep below the bottom of the soil profile around a depth of 900 cm bittelli et al 2008 kroener et al 2014 for heat transport the calculated surface temperature and observed temperature at the 200 cm depth were used as the upper and lower boundary conditions respectively the effects of root water uptake on both water flow and heat transport were neglected considering no plant uptake in the winter the mean absolute error mae the root mean square error rmse and the coefficient of determination r 2 were computed to evaluate the model performance to further validate the developed model two additional datasets collected at the ig site the inner mongolia grassland site from october 14 2005 to august 31 2006 and at the mg site the tibetan plateau maqu grassland site from december 2 2015 to march 15 2016 were used for simulation purposes value specified initial and boundary conditions were used in the model setup yu et al 2018 zhao et al 2016 4 results the results section is organized as follows first model calibration and validation using measured water contents and temperatures at the three experimental sites yd ig and mg are discussed in the subsequent two sections the more detailed analysis of the modeling results i e diurnal variations in soil water contents temperatures and water fluxes is carried out only for the yd site these sections also include discussions on the relative contributions of different water fluxes i e water vapor thermal and isothermal 4 1 model calibration and validation fig 3 shows the comparison between measured and simulated unfrozen water contents and soil temperatures at the yd site during the analyzed period the major changes in the unfrozen water content at the 10 and 100 cm depths were distinctive due to soil freeze thaw cycles e g varying from 0 074 to 0 009 cm3 cm 3 at the 10 cm depth during the calibration period and the hydrus 1d freezing module well captured these variations deviations between simulated and measured values were lowest in the shallow layer for instance the values of mae and rmse for the calibration period were 0 003 and 0 004 cm3 cm 3 at the 10 cm depth while they were 0 005 and 0 009 cm3 cm 3 at the 100 cm depth respectively compared with the measured data about 0 055 cm3 cm 3 the unfrozen water content at the 100 cm depth was underestimated by the modeling results about 0 041 cm3 cm 3 when the soil was frozen this discrepancy was likely caused by a sudden change in soil hydraulic properties above and below the 80 cm depth due to different soil textures table 2 and the model representation of the physical process involved in the soil freezing process such discrepancy was also reported by yu et al 2020 and zhao et al 2016 during the simulation period small rains mainly occurred after soil thawing and they affected only the topsoil layer simulated soil water contents described well sudden increases due to rainfall events during the analyzed period soil temperatures first decreased between november and january and then increased in february and march simulated temperatures at all depths fitted very well measured data especially during the calibration period correlations between simulated and measured temperatures were better than for unfrozen water contents the average values of mae and rmse were 0 48 and 0 57 respectively these two indices were not calculated for the 200 cm depth because the measured temperature was used as the bottom boundary condition the comparisons between observed and simulated unfrozen water contents and temperatures at the ig and mg sites are shown in fig 4 due to frequent rainfalls and intense evaporation at the ig site deviations between observed and simulated unfrozen water contents at the 5 cm depth were larger than at deeper depths the errors were slightly larger than those calculated at the yd site which may be partly attributed to the variations in measured unfrozen water contents being slightly delayed when the phase change occurred there is a good agreement between measured and simulated values of both unfrozen water contents and temperatures at the mg site for example the average rmse values for unfrozen water contents and temperatures were 0 005 cm3 cm 3 and 0 19 respectively which was the lowest among the three sites fig 5 shows the scatter plots of the observed and simulated unfrozen water contents and soil temperatures at the three experimental sites the average r 2 values which are used to assess the correspondence between the observed and simulated unfrozen water contents and temperatures at the three sites were 0 92 and 0 98 respectively reflecting a high correlation in general the simulated results indicate that the proposed model has good applicability in different cold regions possible reasons for any differences at the three sites are discussed below 4 2 diurnal variations in soil moisture and temperature based on the simulated results at the yd site two typical three day periods the first one for the freezing process from november 30 2017 to december 2 2017 the second one for the thawing process from march 6 2018 to march 8 2018 were selected to discuss in detail variations in soil temperatures and water contents fig 6 shows the hourly observed and simulated unfrozen water contents and temperatures at 10 100 and 200 cm depths during the selected periods the average value of rmse for soil water contents and temperatures are 0 003 cm3 cm 3 and 0 53 respectively which again indicates that simulations fitted the measured data well generally diurnal variations in the soil water content were small while visible diurnal changes appeared at the 10 cm depth during the freezing period this behavior was caused by diurnal soil freeze thaw cycles when the unfrozen water content in the topsoil layer increased during daytime and decreased at night the simulated spatial temporal distributions of the unfrozen water content and temperature during the selected two periods are shown in fig 7 during the selected freezing period the shallow layer s unfrozen water content was significantly lower than in the deep layer indicating that the soil was frozen the freezing front dropped from 19 to 28 cm during this period which can also be indicated by the zero temperature line in the temperature profile below the freezing depth the soil water content was decreasing slowly e g from 0 068 to 0 063 cm3 cm 3 at the 30 cm depth this decreasing trend was mainly attributed to upward flow due to the soil matric potential gradient which caused soil water to flow from deeper layers towards the frozen layer in contrast soil temperature in the shallow layer about 40 cm in fig 7 usually exhibited apparent diurnal variations controlled by solar radiation these diurnal variations resulted in the opposite day night behavior of thermal liquid water and water vapor flow below the 40 cm depth soil temperature showed no distinct fluctuations and mainly increased with depth for example the average temperature at depths of 50 100 150 and 200 cm were 1 9 5 1 7 8 and 10 3 respectively like the matric potential gradient the upward thermal gradient caused soil water flow towards the frozen layer as shown in fig 7 the thawing process as indicated by the zero temperature line occurred both at the top and the bottom of the frozen layer the downward movement of the upper thawing front from 42 to 54 cm was faster than the upward movement of the lower thawing front from 98 to 93 cm during the selected thawing period this phenomenon suggested that a significant increase in air temperature in spring had a remarkable effect on the shallow layer s soil thawing process which was also indicated by cheng et al 2014 driven by the soil matric potential gradient soil water flowed from both above and below towards the frozen layer continuous upward flow during the entire freezing thawing process caused a decreasing trend in the unfrozen water content in the deep soil e g about 0 114 and 0 099 cm3 cm 3 at the 150 cm depth during selected freezing and thawing periods respectively on the other hand intense solar radiation caused a larger downward temperature gradient in the topsoil during the daytime in comparison the soil temperature gradient below the freezing depth was smaller than before fig 8 shows the simulated vertical profiles of unfrozen water content ice content total water content and temperature at different times during the freezing period comparing the results at 0 and 12 h there existed apparent diurnal changes in the topsoil layer for example the unfrozen water content at the 2 cm depth increased from 0 012 to 0 046 cm3 cm 3 during this time interval while the ice content dropped to zero due to the positive temperature below the layer experiencing freeze thaw cycles the ice content gradually increased e g 0 046 0 061 and 0 065 cm3 cm 3 at 0 12 and 72 h at the 15 cm depth respectively apart from decreasing temperature and corresponding freezing of unfrozen water vapor ice desublimation was another reason for the ice accumulation he et al 2018 zhang et al 2016 meanwhile the total water content in the frozen layer became larger during these three days e g 0 066 and 0 075 cm3 cm 3 at 0 and 72 h at the 24 cm depth respectively this data indicated that soil water flowed from the deep soil layers towards the frozen layer and increased the soil water content there as discussed below 4 3 soil water fluxes fig 9 depicts the simulated vertical profiles of soil water fluxes qlh isothermal liquid flux qlt thermal liquid flux qvh isothermal vapor flux qvt thermal vapor flux at 0 12 and 72 h during selected freezing and thawing periods as indicated by fig 9 both liquid and vapor fluxes were directed towards the frozen layer the qlh flux dominated water flow in most depths except in the frozen layer where it became almost negligible in addition to the qlh flux the effects of the upward qlt and qvt fluxes towards the frozen layer were also observable indicating that both thermal fluxes contributed to the ice formation for example the upward qvt fluxes were 6 2e 04 7 9e 04 and 7 1e 04 cm d 1 around the freezing front at 0 12 and 72 h during the freezing process representing about 8 2 9 6 and 11 5 of the total water flux respectively fig 10 shows the diurnal variations of each water flux at different depths during the freezing and thawing periods table 4 then lists contributions of each soil water isothermal and thermal liquid and vapor flux to the total water flux during the two selected periods these ratios were calculated using the hourly data as follow 22 p 1 n q i 1 n q lh q lt q vh q vt where p is the contribution qi represents each soil water flux qlh qlt qvh and qvt and n is the number of hours during a selected time interval 72 h due to the day night air temperature changes there were also noticeable diurnal variations of water fluxes in the shallow layer for example at the 2 cm depth the qlh and qlt fluxes were only noticeable at noon directed upward and downward due to different driving forces respectively although the liquid water flux became smaller than the vapor flux during most of the day the qlh flux still contributed most to the total flux about 64 since it was relatively large with the maximum flux of 0 031 cm d 1 at noon when the soil thawed being less affected by the daily freeze thaw cycles the qvt flux contributed 92 to the total flux at the 10 cm depth during the freezing period and about 78 at the 80 cm depth during the thawing period indicating the important blocking effect of liquid flow in the frozen layer the significant decrease of liquid fluxes about 1 5 orders of magnitude was attributed to ice which significantly reduced the soil hydraulic conductivity to liquid water besides the qvh flux was negligible at most depths except in the shallow frozen layer representing about 3 of the total flux where the matric potential gradients were relatively large below the freezing front the qvt flux was smaller due to a decreasing temperature gradient and usually contributed less than 10 of the total water flux in contrast the qlh flux was the most significant component in most depths followed by the qlt flux note that the qlt flux about 2 4e 03 cm d 1 was larger than the qlh flux about 1 8e 03 cm d 1 at the 100 cm depth during the freezing period accounting for about 50 of the total water flux 5 discussion 5 1 importance of vapor flow it has been increasingly recognized that vapor flow has a significant impact on processes that are important for many agricultural and ecological applications especially in arid areas with large temperature gradients and high air filled soil porosity bittelli et al 2008 zeng et al 2009b although the vapor flux magnitude is relatively low during freezing periods due to relatively small temperature gradients thermally driven vapor flow still plays a crucial role in overall soil water flow when the soil was completely frozen thermal vapor flow dominated the moisture transfer in the frozen layer due to a sharp decrease in the liquid flow e g contributing over 90 of the total moisture flux at the 10 cm depth as indicated by table 4 note that the vapor flux s dominant contribution to the total soil water flux occurred only during relatively short periods for the entire freeze thaw period from november to march the vapor flux contributed only about 7 8 of the total soil water flux at the 10 cm depth despite being larger than the liquid water flux most times when the soil was frozen the overall total liquid flux was still much larger mainly due to the higher flux during the thawing process including diurnal freeze thaw cycles and spring thawing below the freezing front vapor flow can still affect the soil moisture distribution due to its persistence he et al 2018 teng et al 2018 yu et al 2018 zheng et al 2020 for example about 10 of the ice formation in our simulations was due to the upward vapor flux similar results were calculated based on laboratory freezing experiments by zhang et al 2016 on the other hand the isothermal vapor flux which is often neglected when evaluating soil water flow during nonfreezing periods was observable in the shallow frozen layer the maximum isothermal vapor flux represented over 15 of the total flux at the 2 cm depth when the soil was frozen and not experiencing freeze thaw cycles however our simulation results are not consistent with the results reported by yu et al 2018 who assumed that the isothermal vapor flux played a dominant role in the total mass flux in the topsoil layers at the 0 1 cm depth when the soil was frozen this discrepancy may be attributed to different spatial discretizations used in respective numerical models since the soil matric potential gradient varies significantly over small distances in the top 0 1 cm soil layer nevertheless these results indicated that the isothermal vapor flux should be considered in studies of frozen soils therefore in cold and arid regions only the model that considers the coupled movement of water vapor and heat can adequately describe the physical mechanisms of the hydrological cycle in the vadose zone during freezing thawing periods 5 2 influence of soil texture variations in soil water contents temperatures and water fluxes during the freeze thaw periods were analyzed at three experimental sites while sand was the dominant soil texture at the yd site sandy loam was prevalent at the ig and mg sites comparing the simulation results between the yd and ig sites some notable differences due to different soil textures were observed first since the water holding capacity is higher in sandy loam than in sand a decrease in unfrozen water contents due to soil freeze thaw cycles at the ig site was smaller e g about 0 02 cm3 cm 3 at the 20 cm depth on the other hand sandy loam s permeability is lower than that of sand see table 2 resulting in much smaller hydraulic conductivities and liquid fluxes than at the yd site he et al 2020 teng et al 2020 second due to sand s small heat capacity and thermal conductivity soil temperatures fluctuated more during a day at the yd site than at the ig site he et al 2020 for example the mean temperature amplitude at the 10 cm depth during the freezing period was about 5 3 at the yd site while it was less than 3 at the ig site driven by a smaller temperature gradient the vapor flux was smaller at the ig site in addition to soil hydraulic and thermal properties discussed above other numerical models parameters such as the enhancement factor η the gain factor gwt and the impedance factor ψ are closely related to soil textures and could also affect the simulation results for example the importance of considering the enhancement factor when calculating thermal vapor hydraulic conductivities and vapor fluxes has been demonstrated by sakai et al 2009 however there are ongoing discussions about the enhancement factor s uncertainty and rationality because of the absence of direct vapor flow measurements through porous media e g du et al 2017 the impedance factor also played a crucial role in simulating soil water fluxes during freezing periods in our simulations when the soil is frozen liquid water hydraulic conductivity is significantly reduced due to ice crystals impedance this reduction is affected by the initial degree of soil saturation as indicated by soil freezing experiments lundin 1990 zhao et al 2013 as a result the impedance factor depends on the soil type and its accurate estimate is essential to obtain correct values of the hydraulic conductivity of frozen soils 5 3 model evaluation due to the highly nonlinear relationships between soil water content ice content and soil temperature caused by substantial latent heat and phase changes high computational costs and numerical instabilities are common problems in frozen soil modeling bao et al 2016 the earlier version of the hydrus 1d freezing module often encountered numerical problems when simulating complicated conditions in contrast the newly proposed model which combines the coupled movement of water vapor and heat with the soil freezing thawing process is numerically more stable and provides a better agreement with the observed field data it should be emphasized that using hourly rather than daily measured data is preferable the hourly data are temporally continuous resulting in more accurate and stable simulating results especially during the phase transition periods in addition to avoiding numerical instabilities the main advantage of the proposed freezing module is that it can be used for many different applications and situations e g a variety of boundary conditions since the standard hydrus 1d model has been widely applied and well documented for simultaneously simulating water flow and solute and heat transport under nonfreezing conditions e g saito et al 2006 sakai et al 2009 scanlon et al 2003 further improvements to this model will focus on the following aspects first only two approaches are currently available in hydrus 1d to calculate the thermal conductivity campbell 1985 and chung and horton 1987 it would thus be beneficial to incorporate other commonly used formulas e g de vries method and johansen method as summarized by yu et al 2020 and zhao et al 2019 which may provide a better choice for simulating heat transport in various regions with different soils second it would also be beneficial to implement into the freezing module an option to simulate the transport and fate of stable water isotopes that would allow the identification of water sources one could then identify for the cold and arid regions the water source e g groundwater precipitation for vapor flow and or the contribution of vapor flow to the surface vegetation 6 conclusions a fully coupled numerical model for simulating the simultaneous movement of water vapor and heat during the freezing thawing periods was developed in this study the proposed hydrus 1d freezing module avoids numerical instability problems when soil temperatures drop into subfreezing conditions and the phase change occurs the model was evaluated against experimental data collected at the yu lin desert inner mongolia grassland and tibetan plateau maqu grassland sites simulated soil water contents and temperatures corresponded well with the measured data from an in situ observation site results from the yu lin desert site show that both liquid water and water vapor flows driven by soil matric potential and temperature gradients were directed towards the frozen layer increasing the total water content there the isothermal liquid flux was the most significant component in most depths followed by the thermal liquid and vapor fluxes however when the soil was frozen liquid fluxes became about 1 5 orders of magnitude smaller than before freezing instead the thermal vapor flux dominated soil water flow in the completely frozen layer and contributed about 10 of the total water flux to the ice formation around the freezing front besides the often neglected isothermal vapor flux was also observable in the top frozen layer in general the simulation results suggest that it is crucial to consider the effects of vapor flow in evaluating the coupled movement of water vapor and heat during freezing thawing periods similar results as those obtained in this study could be expected from other areas with similar soil and climate conditions the proposed model can be applied in other cold regions as well the new module simulating water flow in soils under freezing thawing conditions has been developed for the widely used hydrus 1d model šimůnek et al 2016 as a result many current hydrus users will be able to operate the new module while using various advanced hydrus 1d software features such as the well designed user friendly gui flexible boundary conditions parameter optimization routines and many other features šimůnek et al 2016 the new freezing module also provides the current and future hydrus users higher numerical stability and computational efficiency than the existing module the developed model represents a comprehensive tool to numerically investigate many important research problems involving processes in the vadose zone the hydrus 1d model has been under continuous development for the past 20 years šimůnek et al 2016 we are currently developing a module to simulate the fate and transport of soil water isotopes that considers evaporation fractionation by coupling this additional isotope module with our freezing model future studies will allow us to numerically investigate many fundamental research problems involving sourcing and timing of soil water such as contributions of liquid water and water vapor to the surface vegetation in cold regions credit

4520,in cold regions freeze thaw cycles play a critical role in many engineering and agricultural applications and cause soil water flow and heat transport studies to be much more complicated due to phase changes involved a fully coupled numerical module for simulating the simultaneous movement of water vapor and heat during freezing thawing periods was developed and incorporated in the hydrus 1d software in this study to avoid numerical instabilities caused by a sudden increase in the apparent heat capacity during a phase change a new approach based on the available energy concept was adopted to adjust soil temperature when the freezing temperature is reached the proposed freezing module s performance was then validated using experimental data collected at three field sites with typical seasonal freezing thawing processes results showed that the model could efficiently obtain a convergent solution and that simulated soil moisture and temperature variations captured the observed data well driven by soil matric potential and temperature gradients both liquid water and water vapor flowed towards the freezing front the isothermal liquid flux was the most significant component of overall flow in most soil depths except in the frozen layer where it decreased by 1 5 orders of magnitude from values before freezing instead the thermal vapor flux was the dominant moisture transfer mechanism in the frozen layer and contributed about 10 to the ice formation these results indicate that the model which considers the coupled movement of water vapor and heat can better describe the physical mechanisms of the hydrological cycle in the vadose zone during the freezing thawing periods keywords freeze thaw process unfrozen water content soil temperature vapor flow hydrus 1d 1 introduction the areas with frozen soil are widely distributed in middle and high latitudes occupying 55 60 of the land surface in the northern hemisphere and approximately 72 of the chinese territory wang et al 2017 zhang et al 2012 freezing thawing cycles in these regions substantially impact many engineering and agricultural applications such as frost heave damage in high speed railway embankments and melting water infiltration kelleners et al 2016 kurylyk and watanabe 2013 zhao et al 2013 meanwhile phase changes during freezing thawing cycles significantly affect soil hydraulic and thermal properties as well as soil water flow and heat transport lundin 1990 watanabe and wake 2009 yi et al 2014 zhang et al 2012 for example due to the blocking effect of the ice present at subfreezing temperatures the isothermal hydraulic conductivity for liquid water is estimated to decrease by approximately 1 and 2 orders of magnitude when about 15 and 20 of soil water is frozen respectively zhao et al 2013 therefore the freezing thawing process causes studies of the coupled movement of soil water and heat to be more complex and crucial for many environmental and engineering problems in cold regions vapor flow has been recognized to contribute to transfers of mass and energy especially in arid areas such as northwestern china deb et al 2011 zeng et al 2009a in these regions soil moisture movement takes place in the form of both liquid water and water vapor flows and the transformation between liquid water and water vapor occurs continuously li et al 2010 sakai et al 2009 scanlon et al 2003 zeng et al 2009b zhao et al 2013 since phase changes between liquid water and water vapor could release or store a substantial amount of latent energy vapor flow has a considerable impact on the soil energy balance cahill and parlange 1998 when soil is frozen vapor flow may play a dominant role in moisture transfer teng et al 2018 also laboratory freezing experiments have shown that vapor flow promotes ice formation and its contribution increases with decreasing water content before freezing yu et al 2018 the theory of the coupled water vapor and heat transport in porous media under non isothermal conditions was pioneered by philip and de vries 1957 since then many researchers have been working during the past several decades on advancing the understanding of these coupled processes cass et al 1984 milly 1984 nassar and horton 1989 saito et al 2006 with increasing computational capacity and improving simulation accuracy underlying mechanisms of coupled water and heat transfers under unfrozen soil conditions have attracted growing interest and are widely reported deb et al 2011 saito et al 2006 sakai et al 2009 zeng et al 2009b multiple numerical models have been developed for simulating the soil water and heat movement during freeze thaw periods and significant progress has been achieved over recent decades in modeling these processes flerchinger and saxton 1989 guymon and luthin 1974 hansson et al 2004 jansson 2012 šimůnek et al 2016 yu et al 2018 2020 due to different original concerns these models differ in the formulations of water flow and heat transport equations and are applied to address specific issues bao et al 2016 kurylyk and watanabe 2013 li et al 2010 however relative contributions of vapor flow and its phase transition to the total water and heat balances are usually considered less significant in frozen soils and neglected li et al 2010 slater et al 1998 this simplification may be practical for moist soils but not for arid areas bao et al 2016 guymon and luthin 1974 by neglecting the role of vapor flow the physical mechanism behind soil water flow and heat transport during the freezing period cannot be fully understood flerchinger and saxton 1989 hansson et al 2004 kurylyk and watanabe 2013 meanwhile existing studies of the coupled water vapor and heat transport during the freeze thaw process contain some shortcomings that need to be overcome most models were calibrated and validated using data from laboratory freezing experiments or literature instead of field experiments he et al 2018 teng et al 2018 2020 usually actual field conditions are more complicated e g time variable atmospheric boundary and multi layered soil profiles resulting in these types of models being unsuitable for practical applications additionally the fixed freezing point approach which converts the entire liquid water content into the ice content at the freezing point e g 0 is adopted in some of these models to estimate the ice content li et al 2010 niu and yang 2006 however since some liquid water always exists in the frozen soil no matter how low the temperature is this approach represents a severe simplification of the soil freezing process sun et al 2012 teng et al 2020 while this approach may avoid numerical instabilities caused by phase changes it results in low precision and unrealistic simulation results this study s main objective is to develop a fully coupled numerical model for simulating the simultaneous movement of water vapor and heat in complicated field situations during freeze thaw cycles that is both physically realistic and computational stable and efficient since the hydrus 1d model šimůnek et al 2008 2016 has been widely shown to perform well in evaluating the coupled movement of water vapor and heat under nonfreezing conditions e g deb et al 2011 saito et al 2006 sakai et al 2009 zeng et al 2009a 2009b the proposed numerical model is incorporated into the hydrus 1d code the previous version of the hydrus 1d freezing module was developed and successfully used to evaluate laboratory column freezing experiments by hansson et al 2004 the model was then also used by zhao et al 2016 to simulate the variations in soil moisture and temperature in a field experiment however the current model becomes significantly less stable and may encounter numerical problems in more complicated situations and neglects the effects of vapor flow thus the specific objectives of this study are i to develop a rigorous and stable numerical freezing module incorporated into the hydrus 1d software for simulating the coupled movement of water vapor and heat under freezing conditions ii to evaluate the model performance using in situ observation data of soil water contents and temperatures and iii to analyze spatial and temporal variations in soil water contents temperatures and water fluxes during the freezing thawing process 2 model development 2 1 mathematical description soil water flow in seasonally frozen soils with both above and below freezing temperatures is described by the following mass conservation equation hansson et al 2004 1 θ l t ρ v ρ l θ v t ρ i ρ l θ i t z q lh q lt q vh q vt s z k lh h z k lh k lt t z k vh h z k vt t z s where θl θv and θi are the volumetric liquid water vapor and ice contents l3 l 3 respectively ρl ρv and ρi are the densities of liquid water water vapor and ice m l 3 respectively t is time t z is the spatial coordinate positive upward l qlh and qlt are the isothermal and thermal liquid water fluxes l t 1 respectively qvh and qvt are the isothermal and thermal vapor fluxes l t 1 respectively klh l t 1 and klt l2 k 1 t 1 are the isothermal and thermal hydraulic conductivities for liquid water respectively kvh l t 1 and kvt l2 k 1 t 1 are the isothermal and thermal hydraulic conductivities for water vapor respectively h is the pressure head l t is the temperature k and s is a sink term t 1 which usually accounts for root water uptake the first three terms on the right hand side of eq 1 represent liquid water flow driven by the pressure head gradient gravity and temperature gradient and the next two terms are vapor flow driven by the pressure head and temperature gradients according to the pore size distribution model of mualem 1976 the isothermal hydraulic conductivity for liquid water can be described using the van genuchten 1980 model as 2 θ l θ r θ s θ r 1 α h n m 3 k lh k s s e l 1 1 s e 1 m m 2 where θr and θs are the residual and saturated water contents l3 l 3 respectively α l 1 n and m are empirical parameters l is a pore connectivity parameter which normally is set to 0 5 mualem 1976 ks is the saturated hydraulic conductivity l t 1 and se is the effective liquid saturation meanwhile the resistance to water flow in soil pores increases significantly due to the presence of ice the blocking effect gradually increases with an increase in the ice content portion of the total water content the isothermal hydraulic conductivity for liquid water flow in freezing soil kflh l t 1 can then be expressed as 4 k flh 10 ψ q k lh where ψ is the impedance factor for liquid water flow due to the ice formation which usually ranges from 0 5 to 6 5 depending on soil properties zhao et al 2016 and q is the mass ratio of the ice content to the total water content the thermal hydraulic conductivity for liquid water flow and isothermal and thermal hydraulic conductivities for vapor flow are defined as follows saito et al 2006 5 k lt k lh h g wt 1 γ 0 d γ dt 6 k vh d ρ w h r ρ sv mg rt 7 k vt d ρ w η h r d ρ sv dt where gwt is the gain factor which corrects the temperature dependence of the soil water retention curve and is defined as 7 for sands sakai et al 2009 γ 0 is the surface tension at 25 c m t 2 71 89 g s 2 γ is the surface tension of soil water m t 2 hr is the relative humidity ρsv is the saturated vapor density m l 3 m is the molecular weight of water m mol 1 0 018 kg mol 1 g is the gravitational acceleration l t 2 r is the universal gas constant j mol 1 k 1 8 315 j mol 1 k 1 η is the enhancement factor and d is the vapor diffusivity in soil l2 t 1 which can be calculated as follows campbell 1985 8 d d a θ a τ where θa is the air filled porosity l3 l 3 da is the vapor diffusivity in the air l2 t 1 and τ is the tortuosity factor detailed descriptions of related parameters are presented in table 1 the governing equation for heat transport in a variably saturated rigid soil is given by the following energy conservation equation nassar and horton 1989 9 c p t t l f ρ i θ i t l w ρ w θ v t z λ t z c w q l t z c v q v t z l 0 q v z c w s t where cp is the volumetric heat capacity of moist soil m l 1 t 2 k

by their respective volumetric fractions campbell 1985 l f is the latent heat of freezing l2 t 2 3 34 105 j kg 1 lw is the latent heat of vaporization of liquid water l2 t 2 λ is the apparent thermal conductivity m l t 3 k 1 and ql and qv are liquid and vapor fluxes l t 1 respectively the components of soil heat fluxes on the right hand side of eq 9 include heat flow by conduction convection of sensible heat with liquid water flow convection of sensible heat with vapor flow and convection of latent heat with vapor flow the apparent soil thermal conductivity which combines the thermal conductivity of the porous medium in the absence of flow with the thermal dispersivity can be expressed for unfrozen conditions as follows hansson et al 2004 10 λ λ 0 θ l β l c w q w where βl is longitudinal thermal dispersivity l and λ 0 is the thermal conductivity of the porous medium m l t 3 k 1 which can be expressed according to chung and horton 1987 as 11 λ 0 θ l b 1 b 2 θ l b 3 θ l 0 5 where b 1 b 2 and b 3 are empirical parameters that depend on soil texture m l t 3 k 1 and equal to 0 228 2 406 and 4 909 w m 1 k 1 for sands respectively since ice can also influence heat conduction the thermal conductivity of freezing soils can be calculated as follows 12 λ 0 θ l b 1 b 2 θ l f θ i b 3 θ l f θ i 0 5 where f accounts for the difference between the thermal conductivities of liquid water and in soils and can be defined as suggested by hansson et al 2004 for unfrozen soils the liquid water content is a function of the pressure head it can be estimated from the soil water characteristics curve as a function of only two unknown parameters h and t due to another unknown parameter θi under freezing conditions one additional equation is required to solve this new parameter kurylyk and watanabe 2013 sun et al 2012 based on the thermal dynamic equilibrium theory and the assumption that the ice pressure is equal to zero when soil is frozen the soil matric potential can be estimated for subfreezing temperatures using the generalized clapeyron equation as follows hansson et al 2004 13 h l f g ln t t f where tf is the freezing point of liquid water k which varies with soil texture and the initial water content this indicates that the liquid water content is a function of temperature and can be obtained by the soil water freezing curve when soil is frozen substituting eq 13 into eq 2 leads to the relationship between the liquid water content and temperature the soil freezing characteristics curve as follows 14 θ l θ r θ s θ r 1 α l f g ln t t f n m the mathematical model of the coupled movement of water vapor and energy in soils under freezing thawing conditions described above has surprisingly few additional parameters in addition to those required by the standard water flow and heat transport models i e soil hydraulic retention and conductivity and thermal capacity and conductivity parameters the values of most additional parameters e g latent heat of freezing and vaporization vapor density vapor diffusivity and their temperature dependences are known and can be found in the literature see table 2 the two main additional new parameters are the impedance factor ψ in eq 4 and the f parameter in eq 12 which affect the hydraulic and thermal conductivities respectively in frozen soils thus the coupled model is still sensitive mainly to the soil hydraulic and thermal parameters as in the standard water flow and heat transport models 2 2 calculation procedure a flexible time stepping method is used in the hydrus 1d model for calculating the coupled movement of liquid water water vapor and heat the main computational procedure at each timestep is shown in fig 1 and is described below in detail first the soil water flow equation is solved using the finite difference method for both spatial and temporal discretizations šimůnek et al 2008 the modified richards equation is discretized and assembled into a linear equation system i e the matrix equation after incorporating the boundary conditions the gaussian elimination method is used to solve the matrix equation and to obtain the new pressure head and the corresponding liquid water content at the new time level the picard iteration procedure is used to solve this highly nonlinear equation the iterative process continues until absolute changes in pressure heads and soil water contents in all nodes are less than the prescribed tolerance kelleners 2013 šimůnek et al 2008 next the galerkin finite element and finite difference methods are applied for calculating the spatial and temporal derivatives for the heat transport equation respectively šimůnek et al 2008 nodal values of soil water contents and fluxes calculated by solving the water flow equation are used as known values in the heat transport equation a similar solution strategy is applied for calculating the new soil temperatures until achieving convergency the steps mentioned above are looped twice at each timestep i e iloop 1 2 the main reason for the second loop is to update the solution of the water flow equation using updated values of soil temperatures and ice contents if ice exists these are obtained by the heat transport equation solution which reflects the effects of the freezing process and temperature changes on soil water flow within the current timestep note that there are two unknowns when solving each governing equation the liquid water content θl and the pressure head h in the water flow equation and the ice content θi and the temperature t in the heat transport equation a mass conservative method proposed by celia et al 1990 is used in the time difference scheme to eliminate θl and θi from the two equations as shown below hansson et al 2004 15 θ l t θ l j 1 k 1 θ l j δ t θ l j 1 k 1 θ l j 1 k δ t θ l j 1 k θ l j δ t c j 1 k h j 1 k 1 h j 1 k δ t θ l j 1 k θ l j δ t 16 l f ρ i θ i t l f ρ i θ i j 1 k 1 θ i j δ t l f ρ i θ i j 1 k 1 θ i j 1 k δ t l f ρ i θ i j 1 k θ i j δ t l f 2 ρ i gt c j 1 k t j 1 k 1 t j 1 k δ t l f ρ i θ i j 1 k θ i j δ t where superscripts j 1 and j indicate the current and previous time levels respectively k 1 and k indicate the current and previous iterations for the current time level respectively c is the soil water capacity l 1 which is defined as the derivative of the water content with respect to the pressure head and δt is the time interval between the previous and current time levels 2 3 determination of ice content when estimating the ice content in the iteration procedure large errors often appear in calculations of soil water contents and temperatures and consequently the numerical convergency is challenging to achieve bao et al 2016 li et al 2010 therefore in the proposed model the ice content is determined after calculating the new temperature as shown in fig 1 for subfreezing temperatures liquid water and ice coexist in soil pores based on the principle of mass conservation the total water content θt l3 l 3 can be defined as the sum of the liquid water content and the ice content 17 θ t θ l ρ i ρ l θ i then the liquid water content is updated based on the soil water freezing curve using the newly calculated soil temperature and the existence of ice is determined using the θl θt criterion note that there exists no ice when the soil temperature is in the interval between the freezing temperature and zero temperature tf t 0 as explained below in detail there is no ice for the above zero temperature conditions the liquid water content needs to be updated at the first iteration when the soil temperature turns positive from a negative value compared with the previous version of the freezing module hansson et al 2004 differences in liquid water and ice densities are considered in the updated module the inclusion of density differences was expected to decrease simulation errors kelleners 2013 2 4 model stability the apparent heat capacity ca m l 1 t 2 k 1 which includes the latent heat as an additional term in the heat capacity can be calculated using the generalized clapeyron equation and the soil water capacity as follows 18 c a c p l f ρ i d θ i dt c p l f 2 ρ i gt c in fully saturated soils the apparent heat capacity increases by about 2 and 5 orders of magnitude for silty clay and sand respectively when the freezing point 0 c is reached the freezing point for unsaturated soils is lower than 0 c and can be estimated as follows 19 t f t 0 exp gh l f t 0 where t 0 273 15 c is the absolute temperature when the freezing point is reached the significant difference in the apparent heat capacity for temperatures above and below the freezing point can lead to a considerable underestimation of the soil temperature this may result in oscillations in calculated temperatures between negative and positive values within a timestep hansson et al 2004 wang et al 2017 a method based on available energy for a phase change is adopted in our simulations to overcome this instability caused by a phase change between liquid and solid states of water the new temperature at the first iteration when a soil layer crosses the freezing point is adjusted as follows flerchinger and saxton 1989 20 t r t f e a c a 21 e a c p t f t where tr is the revised temperature ea is available energy for freezing this adjustment method was found to generate more consistent calculation results and avoid undesired numerical oscillations 3 materials and methods 3 1 in situ experiments experimental data were collected at three field sites a the yu lin desert ecosystem research station the yd site b the inner mongolia grassland ecosystem research station the ig site and c the tibetan plateau maqu grassland mg site the first in situ experiment was located at the yu lin desert ecosystem research station the yd site which is a typical area with seasonal freezing in northwestern china 109 41 44 e and 38 21 46 n fig 2 the climate in this region can be characterized as cold and dry cheng et al 2013 zheng et al 2020 observations from the nearby yulin meteorological station indicate that the long term since 1961 average air temperature is approximately 6 4 c and the minimum air temperature reaches 31 4 c the average annual rainfall and potential evaporation are 360 and 2343 mm respectively the soil surface is flat at the study site and vegetation covers less than 5 of it during the freezing period to determine soil physical properties as listed in table 2 soil samples were collected at a 20 cm interval from the surface to the 200 cm depth soil water contents and temperatures were measured at depths of 10 20 50 100 and 200 cm by the hydro probe ii sensors stevens inc usa every 10 min before being installed all sensors were calibrated using the original soil samples the measurement principle of the hydro probe ii sensors is based on the frequency domain method cheng et al 2014 because the permittivity of liquid water 78 is significantly higher than those of the soil matrix 3 5 ice 3 4 and air 1 observed soil water contents could be considered to represent unfrozen water contents when the soil is frozen sun et al 2012 watanabe and wake 2009 micrometeorological variables including air temperature wind speed relative humidity and precipitation were recorded at a 30 min interval as shown in fig 3 the total amounts of rainfall and snow were 20 8 and 13 6 mm in winters of 2017 2018 and 2018 2019 respectively mainly in the form of rains after soil thawing the proposed model was further applied to simulate the coupled movement of water vapor and heat at two grassland sites fig 2 to assess the model applicability the inner mongolia grassland ig site is located at the inner mongolia grassland ecosystem research station 116 42 18 e and 43 37 50 n and this site has a continental climate with cold winter and warm summer zhao et al 2016 on the other hand the maqu grassland mg site is set up on the north eastern fringe of the tibetan plateau 101 38 102 45 e and 33 30 34 15 n with the elevation ranging from 3200 to 4200 m above the sea level yu et al 2018 the climate is characterized as wet and cold with dry winter and rainy summer table 3 lists detailed information about the two sites and field observations 3 2 numerical simulation the dataset collected at the yd site from november 1 2017 to march 31 2018 was used to calibrate the hydrus 1d freezing module soil parameters were initially estimated using the neural network method based on soil physical properties and then optimized using the levenberg marquardt algorithm which is directly implemented into the hydrus code šimůnek et al 2008 2016 zhao et al 2013 the calibrated soil hydraulic parameters are presented in table 2 subsequently the measured soil data from november 1 2018 to march 31 2019 were used for model validation the soil profile was 200 cm deep and a spatial discretization of 1 cm was applied observed soil water content and temperature data on november 1 2017 and november 1 2018 were used as initial conditions for the two periods respectively and values between two measurement depths were obtained using linear interpolation for water flow the atmospheric boundary condition was imposed on the soil surface the free drainage condition was assumed at the bottom boundary because the groundwater table fluctuated deep below the bottom of the soil profile around a depth of 900 cm bittelli et al 2008 kroener et al 2014 for heat transport the calculated surface temperature and observed temperature at the 200 cm depth were used as the upper and lower boundary conditions respectively the effects of root water uptake on both water flow and heat transport were neglected considering no plant uptake in the winter the mean absolute error mae the root mean square error rmse and the coefficient of determination r 2 were computed to evaluate the model performance to further validate the developed model two additional datasets collected at the ig site the inner mongolia grassland site from october 14 2005 to august 31 2006 and at the mg site the tibetan plateau maqu grassland site from december 2 2015 to march 15 2016 were used for simulation purposes value specified initial and boundary conditions were used in the model setup yu et al 2018 zhao et al 2016 4 results the results section is organized as follows first model calibration and validation using measured water contents and temperatures at the three experimental sites yd ig and mg are discussed in the subsequent two sections the more detailed analysis of the modeling results i e diurnal variations in soil water contents temperatures and water fluxes is carried out only for the yd site these sections also include discussions on the relative contributions of different water fluxes i e water vapor thermal and isothermal 4 1 model calibration and validation fig 3 shows the comparison between measured and simulated unfrozen water contents and soil temperatures at the yd site during the analyzed period the major changes in the unfrozen water content at the 10 and 100 cm depths were distinctive due to soil freeze thaw cycles e g varying from 0 074 to 0 009 cm3 cm 3 at the 10 cm depth during the calibration period and the hydrus 1d freezing module well captured these variations deviations between simulated and measured values were lowest in the shallow layer for instance the values of mae and rmse for the calibration period were 0 003 and 0 004 cm3 cm 3 at the 10 cm depth while they were 0 005 and 0 009 cm3 cm 3 at the 100 cm depth respectively compared with the measured data about 0 055 cm3 cm 3 the unfrozen water content at the 100 cm depth was underestimated by the modeling results about 0 041 cm3 cm 3 when the soil was frozen this discrepancy was likely caused by a sudden change in soil hydraulic properties above and below the 80 cm depth due to different soil textures table 2 and the model representation of the physical process involved in the soil freezing process such discrepancy was also reported by yu et al 2020 and zhao et al 2016 during the simulation period small rains mainly occurred after soil thawing and they affected only the topsoil layer simulated soil water contents described well sudden increases due to rainfall events during the analyzed period soil temperatures first decreased between november and january and then increased in february and march simulated temperatures at all depths fitted very well measured data especially during the calibration period correlations between simulated and measured temperatures were better than for unfrozen water contents the average values of mae and rmse were 0 48 and 0 57 respectively these two indices were not calculated for the 200 cm depth because the measured temperature was used as the bottom boundary condition the comparisons between observed and simulated unfrozen water contents and temperatures at the ig and mg sites are shown in fig 4 due to frequent rainfalls and intense evaporation at the ig site deviations between observed and simulated unfrozen water contents at the 5 cm depth were larger than at deeper depths the errors were slightly larger than those calculated at the yd site which may be partly attributed to the variations in measured unfrozen water contents being slightly delayed when the phase change occurred there is a good agreement between measured and simulated values of both unfrozen water contents and temperatures at the mg site for example the average rmse values for unfrozen water contents and temperatures were 0 005 cm3 cm 3 and 0 19 respectively which was the lowest among the three sites fig 5 shows the scatter plots of the observed and simulated unfrozen water contents and soil temperatures at the three experimental sites the average r 2 values which are used to assess the correspondence between the observed and simulated unfrozen water contents and temperatures at the three sites were 0 92 and 0 98 respectively reflecting a high correlation in general the simulated results indicate that the proposed model has good applicability in different cold regions possible reasons for any differences at the three sites are discussed below 4 2 diurnal variations in soil moisture and temperature based on the simulated results at the yd site two typical three day periods the first one for the freezing process from november 30 2017 to december 2 2017 the second one for the thawing process from march 6 2018 to march 8 2018 were selected to discuss in detail variations in soil temperatures and water contents fig 6 shows the hourly observed and simulated unfrozen water contents and temperatures at 10 100 and 200 cm depths during the selected periods the average value of rmse for soil water contents and temperatures are 0 003 cm3 cm 3 and 0 53 respectively which again indicates that simulations fitted the measured data well generally diurnal variations in the soil water content were small while visible diurnal changes appeared at the 10 cm depth during the freezing period this behavior was caused by diurnal soil freeze thaw cycles when the unfrozen water content in the topsoil layer increased during daytime and decreased at night the simulated spatial temporal distributions of the unfrozen water content and temperature during the selected two periods are shown in fig 7 during the selected freezing period the shallow layer s unfrozen water content was significantly lower than in the deep layer indicating that the soil was frozen the freezing front dropped from 19 to 28 cm during this period which can also be indicated by the zero temperature line in the temperature profile below the freezing depth the soil water content was decreasing slowly e g from 0 068 to 0 063 cm3 cm 3 at the 30 cm depth this decreasing trend was mainly attributed to upward flow due to the soil matric potential gradient which caused soil water to flow from deeper layers towards the frozen layer in contrast soil temperature in the shallow layer about 40 cm in fig 7 usually exhibited apparent diurnal variations controlled by solar radiation these diurnal variations resulted in the opposite day night behavior of thermal liquid water and water vapor flow below the 40 cm depth soil temperature showed no distinct fluctuations and mainly increased with depth for example the average temperature at depths of 50 100 150 and 200 cm were 1 9 5 1 7 8 and 10 3 respectively like the matric potential gradient the upward thermal gradient caused soil water flow towards the frozen layer as shown in fig 7 the thawing process as indicated by the zero temperature line occurred both at the top and the bottom of the frozen layer the downward movement of the upper thawing front from 42 to 54 cm was faster than the upward movement of the lower thawing front from 98 to 93 cm during the selected thawing period this phenomenon suggested that a significant increase in air temperature in spring had a remarkable effect on the shallow layer s soil thawing process which was also indicated by cheng et al 2014 driven by the soil matric potential gradient soil water flowed from both above and below towards the frozen layer continuous upward flow during the entire freezing thawing process caused a decreasing trend in the unfrozen water content in the deep soil e g about 0 114 and 0 099 cm3 cm 3 at the 150 cm depth during selected freezing and thawing periods respectively on the other hand intense solar radiation caused a larger downward temperature gradient in the topsoil during the daytime in comparison the soil temperature gradient below the freezing depth was smaller than before fig 8 shows the simulated vertical profiles of unfrozen water content ice content total water content and temperature at different times during the freezing period comparing the results at 0 and 12 h there existed apparent diurnal changes in the topsoil layer for example the unfrozen water content at the 2 cm depth increased from 0 012 to 0 046 cm3 cm 3 during this time interval while the ice content dropped to zero due to the positive temperature below the layer experiencing freeze thaw cycles the ice content gradually increased e g 0 046 0 061 and 0 065 cm3 cm 3 at 0 12 and 72 h at the 15 cm depth respectively apart from decreasing temperature and corresponding freezing of unfrozen water vapor ice desublimation was another reason for the ice accumulation he et al 2018 zhang et al 2016 meanwhile the total water content in the frozen layer became larger during these three days e g 0 066 and 0 075 cm3 cm 3 at 0 and 72 h at the 24 cm depth respectively this data indicated that soil water flowed from the deep soil layers towards the frozen layer and increased the soil water content there as discussed below 4 3 soil water fluxes fig 9 depicts the simulated vertical profiles of soil water fluxes qlh isothermal liquid flux qlt thermal liquid flux qvh isothermal vapor flux qvt thermal vapor flux at 0 12 and 72 h during selected freezing and thawing periods as indicated by fig 9 both liquid and vapor fluxes were directed towards the frozen layer the qlh flux dominated water flow in most depths except in the frozen layer where it became almost negligible in addition to the qlh flux the effects of the upward qlt and qvt fluxes towards the frozen layer were also observable indicating that both thermal fluxes contributed to the ice formation for example the upward qvt fluxes were 6 2e 04 7 9e 04 and 7 1e 04 cm d 1 around the freezing front at 0 12 and 72 h during the freezing process representing about 8 2 9 6 and 11 5 of the total water flux respectively fig 10 shows the diurnal variations of each water flux at different depths during the freezing and thawing periods table 4 then lists contributions of each soil water isothermal and thermal liquid and vapor flux to the total water flux during the two selected periods these ratios were calculated using the hourly data as follow 22 p 1 n q i 1 n q lh q lt q vh q vt where p is the contribution qi represents each soil water flux qlh qlt qvh and qvt and n is the number of hours during a selected time interval 72 h due to the day night air temperature changes there were also noticeable diurnal variations of water fluxes in the shallow layer for example at the 2 cm depth the qlh and qlt fluxes were only noticeable at noon directed upward and downward due to different driving forces respectively although the liquid water flux became smaller than the vapor flux during most of the day the qlh flux still contributed most to the total flux about 64 since it was relatively large with the maximum flux of 0 031 cm d 1 at noon when the soil thawed being less affected by the daily freeze thaw cycles the qvt flux contributed 92 to the total flux at the 10 cm depth during the freezing period and about 78 at the 80 cm depth during the thawing period indicating the important blocking effect of liquid flow in the frozen layer the significant decrease of liquid fluxes about 1 5 orders of magnitude was attributed to ice which significantly reduced the soil hydraulic conductivity to liquid water besides the qvh flux was negligible at most depths except in the shallow frozen layer representing about 3 of the total flux where the matric potential gradients were relatively large below the freezing front the qvt flux was smaller due to a decreasing temperature gradient and usually contributed less than 10 of the total water flux in contrast the qlh flux was the most significant component in most depths followed by the qlt flux note that the qlt flux about 2 4e 03 cm d 1 was larger than the qlh flux about 1 8e 03 cm d 1 at the 100 cm depth during the freezing period accounting for about 50 of the total water flux 5 discussion 5 1 importance of vapor flow it has been increasingly recognized that vapor flow has a significant impact on processes that are important for many agricultural and ecological applications especially in arid areas with large temperature gradients and high air filled soil porosity bittelli et al 2008 zeng et al 2009b although the vapor flux magnitude is relatively low during freezing periods due to relatively small temperature gradients thermally driven vapor flow still plays a crucial role in overall soil water flow when the soil was completely frozen thermal vapor flow dominated the moisture transfer in the frozen layer due to a sharp decrease in the liquid flow e g contributing over 90 of the total moisture flux at the 10 cm depth as indicated by table 4 note that the vapor flux s dominant contribution to the total soil water flux occurred only during relatively short periods for the entire freeze thaw period from november to march the vapor flux contributed only about 7 8 of the total soil water flux at the 10 cm depth despite being larger than the liquid water flux most times when the soil was frozen the overall total liquid flux was still much larger mainly due to the higher flux during the thawing process including diurnal freeze thaw cycles and spring thawing below the freezing front vapor flow can still affect the soil moisture distribution due to its persistence he et al 2018 teng et al 2018 yu et al 2018 zheng et al 2020 for example about 10 of the ice formation in our simulations was due to the upward vapor flux similar results were calculated based on laboratory freezing experiments by zhang et al 2016 on the other hand the isothermal vapor flux which is often neglected when evaluating soil water flow during nonfreezing periods was observable in the shallow frozen layer the maximum isothermal vapor flux represented over 15 of the total flux at the 2 cm depth when the soil was frozen and not experiencing freeze thaw cycles however our simulation results are not consistent with the results reported by yu et al 2018 who assumed that the isothermal vapor flux played a dominant role in the total mass flux in the topsoil layers at the 0 1 cm depth when the soil was frozen this discrepancy may be attributed to different spatial discretizations used in respective numerical models since the soil matric potential gradient varies significantly over small distances in the top 0 1 cm soil layer nevertheless these results indicated that the isothermal vapor flux should be considered in studies of frozen soils therefore in cold and arid regions only the model that considers the coupled movement of water vapor and heat can adequately describe the physical mechanisms of the hydrological cycle in the vadose zone during freezing thawing periods 5 2 influence of soil texture variations in soil water contents temperatures and water fluxes during the freeze thaw periods were analyzed at three experimental sites while sand was the dominant soil texture at the yd site sandy loam was prevalent at the ig and mg sites comparing the simulation results between the yd and ig sites some notable differences due to different soil textures were observed first since the water holding capacity is higher in sandy loam than in sand a decrease in unfrozen water contents due to soil freeze thaw cycles at the ig site was smaller e g about 0 02 cm3 cm 3 at the 20 cm depth on the other hand sandy loam s permeability is lower than that of sand see table 2 resulting in much smaller hydraulic conductivities and liquid fluxes than at the yd site he et al 2020 teng et al 2020 second due to sand s small heat capacity and thermal conductivity soil temperatures fluctuated more during a day at the yd site than at the ig site he et al 2020 for example the mean temperature amplitude at the 10 cm depth during the freezing period was about 5 3 at the yd site while it was less than 3 at the ig site driven by a smaller temperature gradient the vapor flux was smaller at the ig site in addition to soil hydraulic and thermal properties discussed above other numerical models parameters such as the enhancement factor η the gain factor gwt and the impedance factor ψ are closely related to soil textures and could also affect the simulation results for example the importance of considering the enhancement factor when calculating thermal vapor hydraulic conductivities and vapor fluxes has been demonstrated by sakai et al 2009 however there are ongoing discussions about the enhancement factor s uncertainty and rationality because of the absence of direct vapor flow measurements through porous media e g du et al 2017 the impedance factor also played a crucial role in simulating soil water fluxes during freezing periods in our simulations when the soil is frozen liquid water hydraulic conductivity is significantly reduced due to ice crystals impedance this reduction is affected by the initial degree of soil saturation as indicated by soil freezing experiments lundin 1990 zhao et al 2013 as a result the impedance factor depends on the soil type and its accurate estimate is essential to obtain correct values of the hydraulic conductivity of frozen soils 5 3 model evaluation due to the highly nonlinear relationships between soil water content ice content and soil temperature caused by substantial latent heat and phase changes high computational costs and numerical instabilities are common problems in frozen soil modeling bao et al 2016 the earlier version of the hydrus 1d freezing module often encountered numerical problems when simulating complicated conditions in contrast the newly proposed model which combines the coupled movement of water vapor and heat with the soil freezing thawing process is numerically more stable and provides a better agreement with the observed field data it should be emphasized that using hourly rather than daily measured data is preferable the hourly data are temporally continuous resulting in more accurate and stable simulating results especially during the phase transition periods in addition to avoiding numerical instabilities the main advantage of the proposed freezing module is that it can be used for many different applications and situations e g a variety of boundary conditions since the standard hydrus 1d model has been widely applied and well documented for simultaneously simulating water flow and solute and heat transport under nonfreezing conditions e g saito et al 2006 sakai et al 2009 scanlon et al 2003 further improvements to this model will focus on the following aspects first only two approaches are currently available in hydrus 1d to calculate the thermal conductivity campbell 1985 and chung and horton 1987 it would thus be beneficial to incorporate other commonly used formulas e g de vries method and johansen method as summarized by yu et al 2020 and zhao et al 2019 which may provide a better choice for simulating heat transport in various regions with different soils second it would also be beneficial to implement into the freezing module an option to simulate the transport and fate of stable water isotopes that would allow the identification of water sources one could then identify for the cold and arid regions the water source e g groundwater precipitation for vapor flow and or the contribution of vapor flow to the surface vegetation 6 conclusions a fully coupled numerical model for simulating the simultaneous movement of water vapor and heat during the freezing thawing periods was developed in this study the proposed hydrus 1d freezing module avoids numerical instability problems when soil temperatures drop into subfreezing conditions and the phase change occurs the model was evaluated against experimental data collected at the yu lin desert inner mongolia grassland and tibetan plateau maqu grassland sites simulated soil water contents and temperatures corresponded well with the measured data from an in situ observation site results from the yu lin desert site show that both liquid water and water vapor flows driven by soil matric potential and temperature gradients were directed towards the frozen layer increasing the total water content there the isothermal liquid flux was the most significant component in most depths followed by the thermal liquid and vapor fluxes however when the soil was frozen liquid fluxes became about 1 5 orders of magnitude smaller than before freezing instead the thermal vapor flux dominated soil water flow in the completely frozen layer and contributed about 10 of the total water flux to the ice formation around the freezing front besides the often neglected isothermal vapor flux was also observable in the top frozen layer in general the simulation results suggest that it is crucial to consider the effects of vapor flow in evaluating the coupled movement of water vapor and heat during freezing thawing periods similar results as those obtained in this study could be expected from other areas with similar soil and climate conditions the proposed model can be applied in other cold regions as well the new module simulating water flow in soils under freezing thawing conditions has been developed for the widely used hydrus 1d model šimůnek et al 2016 as a result many current hydrus users will be able to operate the new module while using various advanced hydrus 1d software features such as the well designed user friendly gui flexible boundary conditions parameter optimization routines and many other features šimůnek et al 2016 the new freezing module also provides the current and future hydrus users higher numerical stability and computational efficiency than the existing module the developed model represents a comprehensive tool to numerically investigate many important research problems involving processes in the vadose zone the hydrus 1d model has been under continuous development for the past 20 years šimůnek et al 2016 we are currently developing a module to simulate the fate and transport of soil water isotopes that considers evaporation fractionation by coupling this additional isotope module with our freezing model future studies will allow us to numerically investigate many fundamental research problems involving sourcing and timing of soil water such as contributions of liquid water and water vapor to the surface vegetation in cold regions credit

4521,in the humid temperate delaware river basin drb where water availability is generally reliable summer low flows can cause competition between various human and ecological water uses as temperatures continue to rise population increases and development expands it is critical to understand historical low flow variability to anticipate and plan for future flows using a sample of 325 u s geological survey gages we evaluated spatial patterns in several low flow metrics the biophysical and climatic drivers of these metrics and trends in low flows for two periods 1950 2018 and 1980 2018 we calculated the annual 7 day low flow and date low flow deficit as the departure below a long term daily flow threshold and the number of discrete low flow periods below this threshold we also aggregated several climate metrics to watershed scale and used existing watershed properties quantifying land cover topography soils geology and human activity random forest models were used to assess the hierarchy of variable importance in explaining mean annual low flow variability for each low flow metric using all gages we find muted regional patterns in mean annual low flow and low flow variability likely due to the myriad of anthropogenic landscape and flow modifications that obscure flow regimes from their natural characteristics in contrast individual years show markedly different spatial patterns in low flow magnitude and severity coincident with increases in precipitation 7 day low flows have generally increased and low flow deficits decreased for both 1950 2018 and 1980 2018 periods however 7 day low flows have decreased in the coastal plain physiographic province where water use and impervious area have increased in recent decades highlighting the effects of land and water management on low flows with continued change expected in the drb additional research needs are highlighted to enable estimation of future low flows and to plan for periods of prolonged low flow

conflicts in the early 20th century the delaware river basin commission drbc was created in 1961 to help resolve disputes and in recent years flexible flow management plans have been implemented to modify reservoir releases to address competing objectives including water supply water security during drought flood control cold water fisheries and estuary salinity control u s geological survey 2014 because of the need to maintain low flows for ecological function a decision support system has been developed to test alternate scenarios of flow and temperature regulation for sustaining or restoring aquatic ecosystems maloney et al 2015 based on low flow related stream temperature and habitat suitability estimates cole et al 2014 galbraith et al 2016 low flows occur when streamflow falls below specified thresholds typically defined by flow duration percentiles e g 5th percentile or by determining the annual lowest 7 14 or 30 day averaged flows smakhtin 2001 u s epa 2018 whereas hydrological drought is an event that results from an extended period of lower than normal precipitation resulting in below normal water yield while droughts include low flows a recurring seasonal low flow event is not necessarily a drought world meteorological organization 2008 low flows are an especially important component of the flow regime because of their control on stream temperature sustaining life in aquatic ecosystems and providing water supply during dry periods hodgkins and dudley 2011 in the mid atlantic united states low flows are typically a seasonal phenomenon occurring in summer or early fall months carpenter and hayes 1996 stuckey 2006 and are influenced by evaporative losses and soil aquifer storage depletion as opposed to processes such as precipitation seasonality or freezing that are common in other regions laaha et al 2016 1 2 drivers of low flow previous studies have shown that precipitation is a dominant control on interannual variability of

higher evapotranspiration rates than other land covers which indicates the importance of infiltration and recharge for sustaining low flows price et al 2011 conversely impervious area can decrease low flows because of increased runoff efficiency and decreased infiltration and recharge shuster et al 2005 prior work in the drb indicates that while impervious area is associated with reductions in near surface soil moisture tied to lesser infiltration and recharge these reductions do not necessarily translate into reduced low flows brandes et al 2005 working in urban areas proximal to the drb bhaskar et al 2016 reported that this is due to a complex relationship between the surface and subsurface where flows rise fall or remain constant depending on the combination of natural and anthropogenic factors influencing local scale hydrology in some areas the urban subsurface can be likened to karst garcia fresca and sharp 2005 in a modeling study of historical land cover scenarios in the upper drb from 1600 and 1940 endreny et al 2019 show that reduced forest cover increased agriculture and degraded soils led to reduced summer and fall flows including declines in 7 day low flows though identical climate forcings were used for both scenario periods in the southern drb urbanized area population density and dam storage have been increasing over the past several decades falcone et al 2018 these anthropogenic activities can act to amplify or minimize the effects of climate on streamflow with human activities exerting impacts on hydrologic conditions that are equal to or greater than climate impacts in some basins patterson et al 2013 while surface water reservoirs may retain inflows for longer periods than unaltered stream reaches and thus lead to a smoothed hydrograph with higher low flows than would be expected in the absence of dams magilligan and nislow 2005 water abstractions from surface reservoirs and groundwater have been shown to decrease low flows barlow and leake 2012 de graaf et al 2014 1 3 changes in low flow through time much of the northern conterminous united states has experienced increased precipitation over recent decades with

over a similar time period baseflow and stormflow have increased across much of the northeast united states with trends primarily associated with increases in precipitation ficklin et al 2016 baseflow shows greater rates of change from 1950 to 2006 than 1930 2006 reflecting the need for context on temporal climatic variability when interpreting these trends hodgkins and dudley 2011 in the eastern united states annual minimum 7 day flows have mostly increased in the north and decreased in the south following trends in summer precipitation kam and sheffield 2015 sadri et al 2016 dudley et al 2019 in the chesapeake bay watershed that borders the drb a similar pattern is found with greater rates of low flow increase in the north than the south rice and hirsch 2012 fleming et al 2020 increases in minimum 7 day flows have been similarly observed for long and short periods 1916 2015 1941 2015 and 1966 2015 in the northeast though greater occurrence of significant trends has been observed for watersheds with human induced influences than for reference watersheds dudley et al 2019 in addition to increases in precipitation increases in low flows in the northeast may partially be attributed to increases in surface water reservoir storage dudley et al 2019 urban watersheds including those in the northeast showed both the greatest occurrence of significant decreases in low flows with the greatest occurrence of significant increases in low flows dudley et al 2019 reiterating the complexities of urban development that can increase or decrease low flows depending on the extent

based reconstruction for the periods 490 ce through 2005 ce indicated that the droughts during the gaged record were comparable in duration and severity to most drought events during previous centuries finally an analysis on the relative importance of temperature and precipitation on low flows showed that dry and warm conditions led to the most severe droughts but that most of the variability in drought severity was explained by precipitation alone with the goal of enhancing understanding of low flow patterns drivers and trends at watershed scale in the drb a large and long term sample of u s geological survey usgs gages ii watersheds was used to assess 1 temporal and spatial variability in low flows and 2 drivers of low flow across space and time 2 methods 2 1 site selection and data compilation we selected a sample of 325 usgs gages ii falcone 2011 watersheds based on 1 watershed centroids falling within a 25 mile buffer of the delaware river basin boundary and 2 having 10 or more climate years 4 1 to 3 31 of daily record with each year missing less than 5 daily values the climate year was used in this study because it best brackets the period during which low flows occur as noted by prior studies carpenter and hayes 1996 2017 in this study only usgs gages ii watersheds were considered because of the existing database of watershed characteristics that accompanies this sample this sample contains 50 reference and 275 non reference usgs gages where reference watersheds are intended to be as reflective of the natural flow regime in a given region as possible with minimal impacts from anthropogenic activities a smaller subset of the reference watersheds 20 50 is a part of the hcdn 2009 network lins 2012 which provides the closest approximation of natural flows without human influence it is important to note that the majority of reference gages in the drb are located in the northern portion of the basin with 35 of the total 50 in the appalachian plateau and two or less reference gages in each of the valley and ridge piedmont and new england physiographic provinces the small sample size of reference gages in these regions limits the interpretation of significant differences between reference and non reference gages within regions and between reference and non reference gages basinwide thus in our analyses we do not analyze reference and non reference gages separately most of the sampled watersheds are 1 000 sq km in area and there are 30 watersheds in each of the physiographic regions fenneman and johnson 1946 within the drb though watersheds sampling the appalachian plateaus and piedmont physiographic regions constitute a majority of the sample fig 1 northern areas of the basin are relatively unpopulated forested and higher in elevation with surface water dominated water supplies while southern areas of the basin are densely populated and comparatively gently sloped with a greater fraction of regional water supply sourced from highly productive aquifers fischer et al 2004 we downloaded daily streamflow data from climatic year 1950 beginning april 1 1950 through climatic year 2018 ending march 31 2019 from the usgs national water information system nwis u s geological survey 2019 using the r package dataretrieval hirsch and decicco 2015 r core team 2018 time series of area weighted mean climatic data were extracted from prism monthly 1950 2019 daly 2013 and gridmet daily 1980 2019 abatzoglou 2013 using the intersectr blodgett 2020 and exactextractr baston 2020 r packages mean monthly temperature and total monthly precipitation were extracted from prism while daily precipitation p mean daily temperature tmean daily potential evapotranspiration pet and 10 day palmer drought severity index pdsi were extracted from gridmet climate variables were aggregated to the climate year period as well as seasonal periods april may june spring july august september summer october november december fall january february march winter using totals for precipitation and potential evapotranspiration and means for temperatures and pdsi and long term means for each watershed were calculated additionally we calculated annual p pet where p pet 1 corresponds with precipitation surplus and p pet less than 1 corresponds with precipitation deficit watershed properties including those relating to soils geology and landcover were obtained from gages ii falcone 2011 in addition to examine how human activity relates to low flow trends from 1980 to present water use impervious area and total reservoir storage which causally impact low flows and have each changed substantially in recent decades were assembled for 5 to 10 year periods from 1974 to 2012 from falcone 2018 water use and impervious area are normalized by watershed area while reservoir storage is the cumulative of storage within the watershed watersheds were assigned to physiographic regions based on the region containing the majority of their contributing area 2 2 streamflow metric calculation similar to overall flow regime metrics which reflect the magnitude severity timing and frequency of hydrologic response e g poff et al 1997 we calculated several metrics quantifying different aspects of the annual low flow regime for each climate year of record for each watershed fig 2 prior to metric calculation daily streamflow values were area normalized to units of millimeters per day mm d a running mean of 7 day flows was calculated with the mean value assigned to the center of the 7 day window next the annual 7 day low flow and associated day of the climate year docy on which the 7 day low flow occurred were determined by locating the minimum annual value of the 7 day mean flow series annual low flow deficit was calculated by first determining the 2 long term daily flow threshold for each watershed and then calculating the total departure below this threshold for each year using the 7 day mean flow series the 2 long term daily flow was calculated for each site using the full 10 year record of daily flows and determining the value which was exceeded 98 of the time this one value was used consistently throughout the record of the gage for calculating the metrics described below the 2 long term daily flow threshold was chosen because 2 corresponds to the period of time typically represented by the annual minimum 7 day flow 7 days 365 days 0 02 and has shown utility in prior work fleming et al 2020 in addition the flow objective of 2 000 cfs set by the supreme court decree on the delaware river at trenton nj corresponds to the 2 long term daily flow threshold in wet years when flows do not go below the mean daily 2 threshold the low flow deficit will equal zero whereas in drier than normal years the low flow deficit will exceed the mean annual 7 day low flow value using the 2 long term daily flow threshold the following three metrics were calculated from the 7 day mean flow series total number of days below this threshold per year low flow days the maximum continuous number of days below this threshold max low flow and the number of discrete periods below this threshold low flow periods each continuous departure below the threshold is a unique period these metrics reflect the duration and frequency of low flow occurrence finally the 30 day slope in antecedent flow leading to the 7 day low flow each year for each watershed was calculated as a metric reflecting rate of change once metrics were calculated for each climate year at each site we calculated long term means and departures from these means anomalies for each site a list of all metrics and watershed characteristics included in this study and the median values in physiographic provinces in the drb is shown in table 1 2 3 statistical analyses using mean annual low flow metrics climate metrics and watershed properties we calculated non parametric spearman rank correlations between each explanatory variable and low flow metric to determine the general direction of the relationship between the two spearman rank correlations were chosen because they better capture non linear relationships than parametric pearson correlations correlations were also calculated between each low flow metric to examine which metrics are most strongly related because of high correlations between several low flow variables as well as the higher utility of certain metrics than others to water managers and ecologists subsequent analyses focus on four metrics 7 day low flow 7 day low flow date low flow deficit and low flow periods the non parametric wilcoxon rank sum test was applied to determine whether there were significant differences between low flow climate and watershed properties by region separate random forest models were developed using all gages for each low flow metric to assess the hierarchy and dominance of drivers for each low flow metric in a similar approach to previous studies addor et al 2018 konapala and mishra 2020 random forest analyses for the relative importance of explanatory variables have the following enumerated benefits that are explained in greater detail in addor et al 2018 1 they allow for multiple predictors and non linear relationships which are common in hydrologic processes 2 they are not limited by understanding and assumptions of catchment behavior 3 there is reduced risk of data overfitting through a robust ensemble and randomized approach 4 interpretation of the influence of each variable using the increase in mean standard error is straight forward predictor variables for the random forest analysis were chosen by compiling variables from the aggregated climate extracts above and watershed properties listed in table 1 based on hypothesized importance on controlling low flows and removed predictors that were highly correlated correlation coefficient 0 5 table s1 with similar predictors removed p and pet but included p pet while p is relatively similar across the basin pet is substantially lower in the north and higher in the south of the drb leading to relative precipitation surplus in the north p pet and a balance between p and pet in the coastal plain p pet this ratio of precipitation to potential evapotranspiration has been shown to be a strong driver of regional to continental hydrologic response knoben et al 2018 watershed average depth to bedrock was obtained from hengl et al 2017 while watershed average porosity was obtained from gleeson et al 2014 and storage was calculated by multiplying depth to bedrock by porosity watershed average depth to bedrock is likely less representative in the coastal plain where true bedrock is many hundreds to thousands of feet below the surface to aid in synthesizing random forest results explanatory variables were classified as falling into the following overall categories 1 climate 2 land cover and human activity and 3 topography geology soils the final set of variables used to explain each low flow metric was as follows climate p pet mean temperature land use and human activity cultivated area dam storage impervious area water use topography soils and geology available water capacity depth to bedrock drainage area mean elevation permeability porosity slope soil storage our use of random forests is focused primarily on assessing variable importance in explaining low flow as opposed to developing models with strong predictive capacity for this reason the same random forest constraints were consistently applied developing 500 trees ntrees choosing only 5 variables at a time mtry and maintaining at least 5 watersheds in each terminal node nodesize using the randomforest r package liaw 2018 to evaluate the importance of explanatory variables in explaining each low flow metric the minimal node depth of each explanatory variable as well as the percent increase in mean standard error incmse for each variable in each model were calculated though these modeling analyses explicitly focus on mean annual conditions we also examined annual correlations between low flow metrics and both climatic teleconnections and meteorological drought indices with the goal of informing subsequent predictive studies text s1 to assess how low flow and climate metrics have changed through time three variations of the non parametric mann kendall trend test were used mann 1945 kendall r package mcleod 2011 and paired with the sen s slope estimator theil 1950 sen 1968 zyp r package groemping and matthias 2013 for obtaining trend slopes the variations of the mann kendall test applied here use different assumptions about the time series structure of the data including independence base mann kendall trend test short term persistence inflates the variance computed under an assumption of independence and long term persistence version inflates the variance on the basis of the hurst coefficient to evaluate trend significance hamed and rao 1998 cohn and lins 2005 hamed 2008 this method has been used recently for evaluations of trends in both peak hodgkins et al 2019 and low flow metrics dudley et al 2019 and code to replicate this analysis is available from dudley et al 2018 we evaluated the assumption of independence for the interpretation of the three trend iterations above by identifying sites with significant lag one correlation on annual values and compared these correlations to those expected from a distribution of independent time series trends analyses were run on annual time series of low flow and climate variables for 175 watersheds with less than 10 missing annual values between 1980 and 2018 and for 108 watersheds with less than 10 missing annual values between 1950 and 2018 no systematic pattern of missing early or late years of record was present either for the 1950 or 1980 to 2018 period using data aggregated to usgs watersheds in a previous study falcone 2017 for total reservoir storage years 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 2013 impervious area years 1982 1992 2002 2012 and total water use years 1985 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 which coincide with the latter trend period from 1980 to 2018 simple linear regressions were computed to obtain a slope through time for each metric given the small number of data points through time these slopes are approximations meant to capture the general direction of change and to a lesser degree the rate and magnitude of change finally classification and regression tree cart analysis was used to explain observed significant trends in low flow using trends in precipitation as well as changes in watershed impervious area reservoir storage and water use this decision tree based approach has the advantage of identifying interpretable similarity between gages using multiple variables and has been used similarly in prior studies singh et al 2014 kuentz et al 2017 the rpart therneau and atkinson 2019 and rpart plot milborrow 2019 r packages were used to implement cart for each low flow variable the presence of an increase decrease or no change in precipitation reservoir storage water use and impervious area were used to explain whether a significant low flow trend was observed all data used in the analyses above are available from a usgs data release hammond 2020 3 results 3 1 spatiotemporal low flow patterns in the delaware river basin median precipitation and low flow time series across all watersheds from 1950 to 2018 indicated that the lowest precipitation during this period corresponded with the lowest 7 day low flows and highest low flow deficits during the sustained drought period of the 1960 s fig 3 climate years 1980 and 2002 illustrated low precipitation and low flow periods in more recent years with low precipitation for 1980 corresponding with low 7 day low flows but a low flow deficit that was substantially less than that for the drought of record in 1964 after dry conditions in 2001 2002 low flows decreased to the lowest levels since the drought of record with corresponding low flow deficit increases and increased frequency of low flow periods these examples help to illustrate the intimate connection between low flow and meteorological drought characteristics and emphasize the importance of including antecedent climate when developing predictive models for low flow metrics low flow variables displayed muted spatial patterns across the drb with groupings of lower 7 day low flows and lesser low flow deficits in northern new jersey and the appalachian plateaus of new york figure s1 7 day low flows were positively correlated with low flow deficits suggesting that areas that have higher mean annual low flows can also experience larger low flow deficits during dry periods table s1 while this initially seems counterintuitive note that during normal and wet years low flow deficits are equal to zero and only have positive values during dry years this may suggest that wetter areas of the basin tend to experience greater deficits in years where precipitation in below normal than drier parts of the basin with lower mean annual low flows low flow metrics displayed substantial heterogeneity when compared to nearby gages low flow variable coefficients of variation similarly displayed substantial heterogeneity lacking many readily discernable regional patterns figure s1 spatial variability in 7 day low flow and low flow deficit anomalies annual value minus long term mean for these three flow periods 1964 the drought of record for the basin with the lowest observed annual low flows 1980 a year of lower than average flows and 2002 the most recent period of low flows approaching the spatial prevalence of the drought of record in 1964 are shown in fig 4 in 1964 negative 7 day low flow anomalies were distributed across much of the basin though low flow deficits were most substantial in northern regions of the basin mainly the appalachian plateaus in 1980 7 day low flow anomalies were generally less negative with a greater occurrence of positive anomalies than in 1964 and there were fewer anomalously negative low flow deficits finally in 2002 there were more negative 7 day low flow anomalies observed in the piedmont and new jersey coastal plain of the basin than in the other highlighted periods with negative low flow deficit anomalies also focused further to the south than during 1964 in comparing mean annual low flow metrics and coefficients of variation for these metrics between different physiographic regions the most numerous significant differences were between northern and southern regions table s3 while proximal regions displayed fewer significant differences illustrating this point the appalachian plateaus physiographic region had lower and more variable 7 day low flows as well as lesser low flow deficits than the coastal plain and piedmont regions 3 2 drivers of low flow in the drb random forest models were used to identify the primary drivers of the spatial variability in mean annual low flows for the purpose of synthesis explanatory variables were classified into three categories 1 climatic 2 land use and human alteration 3 topography soils and geology as shown in figs 5 and 6 water use emerged as the primary driver of 7 day low flows in our random forest analysis suggesting that surface water withdrawals and groundwater pumping play a strong role in altering low flow conditions in the basin fig 5 table 2 p pet had the greatest influence on the low flow deficit and number of low flow periods for all watersheds with negative correlations indicating that wetter watersheds had fewer low flow periods and smaller low flow deficits the 7 day low flow date was most strongly controlled by mean elevation and dam storage with later low flows occurring at higher elevations and in watersheds with greater storage later low flows were also associated with less impervious area and lower temperatures further impervious area was consistently in the top 10 predictors for each low flow metric with the strongest relationship with 7 day low flows where positive correlation suggests that increases in imperious cover are associated with higher low flows perhaps due to leaking water supply pipes bhaskar et al 2016 the number of low flow periods was poorly explained by the model with negative incmse model predictions better without including these metrics for 2 of the 14 variables p pet and watershed mean slope had the strongest variable importance for this model though they had weak correlations with the number of low flow periods mean watershed permeability porosity and soil storage all displayed negative correlations with 7 day low flow date indicating that greater subsurface storage and draining tend to be associated with earlier low flows watersheds with high permeability were also associated with greater mean annual low flow deficits higher low flows and more frequent low flow periods of note permeability was somewhat strongly correlated to the baseflow index 0 54 ratio of long term baseflow to total stream flow falcone 2011 for study watersheds there was generally a mix of importance between the three categories of explanatory variables 1 climate 2 land cover and 3 topography soils and geology when looking at the fractional contribution of the top ten predictors in each random forest model fig 6 table 2 though topography soils and geology contributed more than half of the increase in mean standard error in each model climate appeared to contribute the least to the model for 7 day low flows while explaining a quarter of the variability in low flow deficit and low flow period models instead land cover primarily impervious and cultivated areas appeared more important for 7 day low flow and 7 day low flow date models and less important for low flow deficit and low flow period models focusing on metrics that change through time and could explain observed trends in low flows p pet dam storage impervious area and water use regularly appear in the top ten variable importance hierarchy table 2 and are highlighted in the following section after reporting observed trends in low flow while mean temperature was also prominently featured in the random forest variable hierarchy trends in temperature show increases in nearly all watersheds as presented in the next section thus in relating trends in low flows to drivers that have changed through time we omit temperature to focus on changes in precipitation dam storage impervious area and water use 3 3 changes in low flows and drivers through time the number of significant increases in 7 day low flow and decreases in annual low flow deficit for all basins in the study outnumbered decreases in 7 day low flow and increases in low flow deficit for both 1950 2018 and 1980 2018 fig 7 tables s4 s5 s6 decreases in 7 day low flows and increases in low flow deficit were concentrated in the coastal plain physiographic region of new jersey and the delmarva peninsula fig 7 using the mann kendall trend test assuming time series independence 29 3 of watersheds showed significant increases decreases in 7 day low flow and 16 2 showed decreases increases in low flow deficit for the period 1980 2018 46 6 of watersheds showed increases decreases in 7 day low flow and 22 1 showed decreases increases in low flow deficit for the 1950 2018 period incorporating assumptions of short and long term persistence effects on trend significance generally reduced the fraction of gages showing significant trends fig 7 tables s4 s5 the fraction of watersheds with significant p less than 0 05 lag one autocorrelation in detrended 7 day low streamflows was greater than would arise only by chance for the period 1950 2018 with 36 of 108 gages 33 but similar to that expected by chance for 1980 2018 with 14 of 175 gages 8 the average pearson correlation coefficient r for the longer period was 0 37 and 0 23 for the shorter period figure s5 for comparison the upper 95th percentile of the distribution of r for an independent time series is approximately 0 235 for a 69 year series and 0 312 for a 39 year series thus for the period 1950 2018 the assumtion of independence is not met for annual 7 day low flows and significant trends for short and long term persistence should be interpreted whereas for the shorter time period from 1980 to 2018 the assumption of independence cannot be as readily rejected and interpretation of trends using the base mann kendall is justified these results are similar for the other low flow metrics suggesting independence rejection for 1950 2018 but not for 1980 2018 lag 1 autocorrelation was significant for the fewest sites for the 7 day low flow date suggesting that interpretation of the base mann kendall is justified for this metric for both periods regardless of trend sinificance between independence short term and long term variations of the trend analysis regional patterns in low flow trends are similar showing increases in low flow and decreases in low flow deficits in the north and decreases in low flow and increases in low flow deficit in the southern drb primarily the coastal plain physiographic region over the same time periods annual precipitation and temperature significantly increased at a majority of gages figure s3 tables s4 s5 with greater numbers of watersheds showing increases in summer precipitation and temperature than annual precipitation and temperature tables s4 s5 significant increases in pet were focused in northern new jersey while increases in p were widespread through the domain the combination of which yielded significant increases in p pet primarily in the northern extremity of the drb figure s3 impervious area increased in 96 of study watersheds for the more recent trend period with only 4 of watersheds showing no change in impervious area table s6 over the period of record the median rate of increase was 0 015 year for a total increase of 0 47 from 1982 to 2012 table s6 figure s4 though one site usgs 01402600 royce brook tributary near belle mead nj had a total increase of 21 4 over the same period similarly dam storage increased in 57 of watersheds with median rate of 0 005 year for a total median increase of 0 17 from 1980 to 2013 though one site usgs 013621955 birch creek at big indian ny had a total increase of 918 increasing from 22 to 264 acre feet water use increased in 25 and decreased in 74 of study watersheds table s6 figure s4 with a median increase of 1 14 year and total of 29 from 1985 to 2010 and median decrease of 2 17 year and total of 56 4 a cart analysis using 1980 2018 trend occurrence for the 7 day low flow low flow deficit and precipitation combined with estimated rates of change in impervious area dam storage and water use was implemented to determine the commonalities between gages experiencing trends in low flow fig 9 this analysis showed that a greater fraction of sites had statistically significant increases in 7 day low flows when 1 precipitation increased significantly 2 water use decreased and 3 dam storage increased similarly in watersheds with increased precipitation a higher fraction of sites showed decreased low flow deficits and where water use decreased there was a higher fraction of sites with decreasing low flow deficit trends 4 discussion 4 1 spatial and temporal variability in low flows multiple low flow metrics displayed differing spatial and temporal patterns across the delaware river basin depending on geographic location watershed properties and potential degree of human alteration of flows consistent with prior research mccabe and wolock 2020 low flows in the drb were most severe during the 1964 climate year with recent periods of low flow approaching similar 7 day low flow magnitude but without pervasive low flow deficits fig 4 the spatial distribution of low flow magnitude and severity has differed through time likely related to differing antecedent metrological conditions for the years analyzed kauffman and vonck 2011 kam et al 2013 the negative low flow anomalies of 1964 during the drought of record were more spatially extensive than in subsequent years with low flow deficits concentrated in the northern portion of the basin fig 4 in contrast low flow deficits of 2002 were concentrated in the pennsylvania piedmont and new jersey coastal plain where substantial groundwater pumping has occurred over the past century konikow 2013 mean annual low flow values displayed substantial spatial variability with dissimilar values within close proximity while climate and elevation gradually change across the basin factors including human alteration dam storage impervious area power plants in addition to subsurface properties may vary over shorter distances with localized effects on low flow which helps to explain some of the proximal heterogeneity in low flow observed in this study despite this high variability within close proximity several regional patterns emerge the appalachian plateaus physiographic region displays distinct regional behavior in the drb with lower and more variable 7 day low flows and lesser low flow deficits as compared to the coastal plain and piedmont regions table s3 the appalachian plateaus are higher in elevation with lower temperatures and pet than the piedmont and coastal plain physiographic regions also have significantly shorter depth to bedrock lesser permeability and soil storage than the coastal plain table s2 mean annual low flow deficits tended to be higher in watersheds with greater soil storage and permeability potentially indicating that watersheds containing geologies that effectively store and release water are more likely to experience below normal low flows when subsurface storage is depleted during long periods of dry conditions kroll et al 2004 avril and barten 2007 winter 2007 4 2 drivers of low flow change across space and time variables quantifying elements of human alteration of landscape and flows were generally more important in explaining 7 day low flows and 7 day low flow dates while p pet emerged as a primary driver of mean annual low flow deficit and low flow period variability in drb watersheds figs 5 and 6 table 2 water use and impervious area were the two strongest predictors of 7 day low flows across the basin with impervious area also important in the models explaining the other three low flow metrics as explained in the paragraphs following water use increased or decreased depending on location in the drb and while impervious area only showed increases the effects of urbanization on low flows can be mixed the presence of significant dam storage led to later 7 day low flows fig 5 table 2 table s1 and may lead to fewer departures below the 2 mean daily flow threshold this is consistent with dam management for ecological flows total maximum daily loads and other objectives in the basin hansler and goodell 1983 galbraith et al 2016 the dominant importance of aridity in explaining interannual low flow variability is similar to the reported importance of precipitation in determining the duration and severity of low flows in previous studies outside of the drb krakauer and fung 2008 ficklin et al 2016 kormos et al 2016 dierauer et al 2018 ledford et al 2020 as well as mccabe and wolock 2020 who show that precipitation drives much of the variability in low flow severity in the drb watershed properties quantifying topography geology and soils accounted for more than half of the variability explained by all variables in the models emphasizing the importance of including the best available information on watershed structure and subsurface when attempting to model low flows many of these variables change at rates much slower than those associated with climatic land use and water management change additionally though our analyses did not explicitly focus on the prediction of annual low flow metrics we examined correlations with climatic teleconnections and meteorological drought indices the north atlantic oscillation nao showed the strongest correlation with drb averaged 7 day low flows 0 27 of the teleconnections examined table s8 while the standardized precipitation evaporation index spei calculated using 90 day antecedent conditions prior to the occurrence of the 7 day low flow showed strong positive correlations with drb averaged 7 day low flows 0 86 table s9 4 3 observed low flow trends and future low flow possibilities in the delaware river basin significant increases in 7 day low flow and decreases in annual low flow deficit outnumbered decreases in 7 day low flow and increases in low flow deficit for both 1950 2018 and 1980 2018 periods fig 7 tables s4 s5 observed trends in low flows are consistent with those reported regionally from rice and hirsh 2012 and dudley et al 2019 and have occurred simultaneously with increases in precipitation and temperature across the basin and increases in pet focused in northern new jersey figure s3 tables s4 s5 similar to an analysis of low flow and low flow deficit trends in the neighboring chesapeake bay we find increases in low flow volume in northern and upland areas of our study area and notable decreases in the south fleming et al 2020 impervious area increased in nearly all study watersheds especially those in southeastern pennsylvania and new jersey while dam storage showed lesser but positive change and water use showed mixed change with increases in the coastal plain and eastern central pennsylvania and reductions in northern delaware southeastern pennsylvania and northwestern new jersey while water use efficiency has increased in much of the drb barr 2017 increases in total water use and sustained groundwater pumping in the coastal plain and eastern central pennsylvania have also been reported schreffler 1996 konikow 2013 conversely pumping decreases have been reported in southeastern pennsylvania barr 2017 total water use has decreased in some areas of new jersey but importantly irrigation during summer months when low flows typically occur has remained constant njdep 2017 while many decreases in low flow coincide spatially with regional increases in water use for parts of the coastal plain due to increased irrigation water use increases in eastern central pennsylvania are not matched by decreases in low flow potentially because the water use increases are not associated with summer irrigation as in the coastal plain increases in impervious area in new jersey also coincide with watersheds showing decreases in low flow we find that a greater fraction of sites had statistically significant increases in 7 day low flows when 1 precipitation increased significantly 2 water use decreased and 3 dam storage increased fig 8 similarly in watersheds with increased precipitation a higher fraction of sites showed decreased low flow deficits and where water use decreased decreasing low flow deficit trends were most likely in other areas where water abstractions have increased associated decreases in flows have been observed barlow and leake 2012 de graaf et al 2014 and where reservoir storage has increased there is a greater capacity of flow management to elevate low flows magilligan and nislow 2005 it appears as though areas of new jersey where low flows declined tend to overlap with where impervious cover has increased figure s4 though observed increased impervious area was not selected as an important factor in cart decision trees for 7 day low flow and low flow deficit trend occurrence for the model of all drb watersheds perhaps due to the mixed effects of urbanization on low flows brandes et al 2005 bhaskar et al 2016 projections of future streamflow in the drb suggest continued increases in annual flow over the coming decades increased annual flows will likely result from increases in precipitation that outweigh increases in actual evapotranspiration throughout the year williamson et al 2016 while continued watershed urbanization is expected to decrease low flows kauffman and vonck 2011 despite increases in annual flows flash droughts which unfold on weekly to monthly timescales and are distinguished by sudden onset and rapid intensification of drought conditions may present a new challenge for low flow management pendergrass et al 2020 and continuous increases in potential evapotranspiration will likely drive future low flow extremes kam and sheffield 2015 ficklin et al 2016 in addition global climate models suggest an increase in hydrological drought severity at the end of the 21st century prudhomme et al 2014 with drought frequency showing little change but drought onset occurring more rapidly and becoming more intense trenberth et al 2014 these future simulations suggest that climatic effects and more severe warming will outweigh anthropogenic effects on the low flow regime in later decades wanders and wada 2015 synthesizing these projections if the delaware river basin was to depart from recent wetter conditions and return to dry antecedent meteorological conditions similar to the 1960 s drought of record we might expect low flows to be lower and deficits greater where water use and impervious area have increased primarily the coastal plain 4 4 limiting assumptions and future research though the sample of watersheds used in this study was advantageous given the spatial coverage and temporal completeness in the basin several limitations remain first fewer reference gages were present in southern areas of the basin leading to an incomplete understanding of natural flows second the aggregated watershed metrics used in this study may not capture site specific and reach scale influences on low flows finally the random forest models developed here show relatively low predictive power as indicated by pseudo r squared values table s7 these values are similar to us wide random forest prediction of low flow values addor et al 2018 model performance was stronger for 7 day low flow and 7 day low flow date with variability in low flow deficit and the number of low flow periods poorly explained regardless of the predictive strength of the random forest models used in this study the exercise in examining the relative importance of predictor variables provides useful information on which variables control various amounts of response in a dependent variable as reported in previous research carlisle et al 2010 in the absence of detailed groundwater trend work in the area we used five year estimates of water use in this study as an approximation of all water use activity but specific knowledge on how groundwater levels throughout the drb have changed through time would enhance interpretation of study results and also reveal patterns in groundwater surface water interaction estimation of low flow metrics in ungaged areas of the drb or at gaged locations for future periods may benefit from the output of the random forest analysis in this paper that suggests inclusion of p pet and water use in explaining 7 day low flow and low flow deficit further the strong correlations between 7 day low flow and 90 day spei suggest promising predictive power for real time applications finally future simulations of low flows in response to increased temperature and potential evapotranspiration could be used as input to the existing decision support system maloney et al 2015 to evaluate the ability of the existing water management system to meet management objectives in future decades 5 conclusions our results contribute to the growing body of literature using long term empirical streamflow climate and watershed properties to understand hydrologic variability through assessment of drivers of hydrologic response and trends through time in a basin that provides a critical water supply to 5 of the u s population low flows exhibit muted regional patterns with proximal watersheds showing substantially different low flow values at the mean annual scale individual years show markedly different spatial patterns in low flow magnitude and severity illustrating the need for continued distributed monitoring across the basin for two recent periods 1950 2018 and 1980 2018 7 day low flows have generally increased and low flow deficits decreased corresponding to concurrent increases in precipitation however 7 day low flows have decreased in the coastal plain physiographic province of the southern delaware river basin where water use and impervious area have increased in recent decades highlighting the effects of land and water management on low flows as warming and population growth continue and land and water managers plan for future decades additional research would enhance greater confidence in future low flow

4521,in the humid temperate delaware river basin drb where water availability is generally reliable summer low flows can cause competition between various human and ecological water uses as temperatures continue to rise population increases and development expands it is critical to understand historical low flow variability to anticipate and plan for future flows using a sample of 325 u s geological survey gages we evaluated spatial patterns in several low flow metrics the biophysical and climatic drivers of these metrics and trends in low flows for two periods 1950 2018 and 1980 2018 we calculated the annual 7 day low flow and date low flow deficit as the departure below a long term daily flow threshold and the number of discrete low flow periods below this threshold we also aggregated several climate metrics to watershed scale and used existing watershed properties quantifying land cover topography soils geology and human activity random forest models were used to assess the hierarchy of variable importance in explaining mean annual low flow variability for each low flow metric using all gages we find muted regional patterns in mean annual low flow and low flow variability likely due to the myriad of anthropogenic landscape and flow modifications that obscure flow regimes from their natural characteristics in contrast individual years show markedly different spatial patterns in low flow magnitude and severity coincident with increases in precipitation 7 day low flows have generally increased and low flow deficits decreased for both 1950 2018 and 1980 2018 periods however 7 day low flows have decreased in the coastal plain physiographic province where water use and impervious area have increased in recent decades highlighting the effects of land and water management on low flows with continued change expected in the drb additional research needs are highlighted to enable estimation of future low flows and to plan for periods of prolonged low flow keywords low flows drought climate variability delaware river basin trends water use 1 introduction and background 1 1 orientation to the delaware river basin with a focus on low flows the delaware river basin drb supplies water to 5 of the u s population despite only covering 0 4 of its area williamson et al 2016 this is accomplished via several large surface water reservoirs and the largest inter basin water withdrawal east of the mississippi river minimum flow requirements on the delaware river mainstem have been established following 1 the 1954 supreme court decree that specifies a minimum flow requirement at montague new jersey and 2 a subsequent agreement in 1983 which established a minimum flow requirement at trenton new jersey hutson et al 2016 following interstate water conflicts in the early 20th century the delaware river basin commission drbc was created in 1961 to help resolve disputes and in recent years flexible flow management plans have been implemented to modify reservoir releases to address competing objectives including water supply water security during drought flood control cold water fisheries and estuary salinity control u s geological survey 2014 because of the need to maintain low flows for ecological function a decision support system has been developed to test alternate scenarios of flow and temperature regulation for sustaining or restoring aquatic ecosystems maloney et al 2015 based on low flow related stream temperature and habitat suitability estimates cole et al 2014 galbraith et al 2016 low flows occur when streamflow falls below specified thresholds typically defined by flow duration percentiles e g 5th percentile or by determining the annual lowest 7 14 or 30 day averaged flows smakhtin 2001 u s epa 2018 whereas hydrological drought is an event that results from an extended period of lower than normal precipitation resulting in below normal water yield while droughts include low flows a recurring seasonal low flow event is not necessarily a drought world meteorological organization 2008 low flows are an especially important component of the flow regime because of their control on stream temperature sustaining life in aquatic ecosystems and providing water supply during dry periods hodgkins and dudley 2011 in the mid atlantic united states low flows are typically a seasonal phenomenon occurring in summer or early fall months carpenter and hayes 1996 stuckey 2006 and are influenced by evaporative losses and soil aquifer storage depletion as opposed to processes such as precipitation seasonality or freezing that are common in other regions laaha et al 2016 1 2 drivers of low flow previous studies have shown that precipitation is a dominant control on interannual variability of annual runoff as well as the duration and severity of summer low flows krakauer and fung 2008 ficklin et al 2016 kormos et al 2016 dierauer et al 2018 mccabe and wolock 2020 precipitation and flow are similarly correlated during low flow periods in the northeast in both natural and human altered systems tijdeman et al 2018 for regions of pennsylvania new jersey new york and delaware overlapping with the drb low flow regression equations are governed by drainage area basin slope mean watershed elevation annual and or spring and summer precipitation stream density soil permeability soil thickness urban area fraction and percent carbonate rock carpenter and hayes 1996 stuckey 2006 watson and mchugh 2014 randall and freehafer 2017 watershed forest cover can elevate low flows despite higher evapotranspiration rates than other land covers which indicates the importance of infiltration and recharge for sustaining low flows price et al 2011 conversely impervious area can decrease low flows because of increased runoff efficiency and decreased infiltration and recharge shuster et al 2005 prior work in the drb indicates that while impervious area is associated with reductions in near surface soil moisture tied to lesser infiltration and recharge these reductions do not necessarily translate into reduced low flows brandes et al 2005 working in urban areas proximal to the drb bhaskar et al 2016 reported that this is due to a complex relationship between the surface and subsurface where flows rise fall or remain constant depending on the combination of natural and anthropogenic factors influencing local scale hydrology in some areas the urban subsurface can be likened to karst garcia fresca and sharp 2005 in a modeling study of historical land cover scenarios in the upper drb from 1600 and 1940 endreny et al 2019 show that reduced forest cover increased agriculture and degraded soils led to reduced summer and fall flows including declines in 7 day low flows though identical climate forcings were used for both scenario periods in the southern drb urbanized area population density and dam storage have been increasing over the past several decades falcone et al 2018 these anthropogenic activities can act to amplify or minimize the effects of climate on streamflow with human activities exerting impacts on hydrologic conditions that are equal to or greater than climate impacts in some basins patterson et al 2013 while surface water reservoirs may retain inflows for longer periods than unaltered stream reaches and thus lead to a smoothed hydrograph with higher low flows than would be expected in the absence of dams magilligan and nislow 2005 water abstractions from surface reservoirs and groundwater have been shown to decrease low flows barlow and leake 2012 de graaf et al 2014 1 3 changes in low flow through time much of the northern conterminous united states has experienced increased precipitation over recent decades with low flows increasing in many areas despite fewer changes in annual peak flows and streamflow timing lins and slack 1999 2005 douglas et al 2000 huh et al 2005 mccabe and wolock 2014 rice et al 2015 over a similar time period baseflow and stormflow have increased across much of the northeast united states with trends primarily associated with increases in precipitation ficklin et al 2016 baseflow shows greater rates of change from 1950 to 2006 than 1930 2006 reflecting the need for context on temporal climatic variability when interpreting these trends hodgkins and dudley 2011 in the eastern united states annual minimum 7 day flows have mostly increased in the north and decreased in the south following trends in summer precipitation kam and sheffield 2015 sadri et al 2016 dudley et al 2019 in the chesapeake bay watershed that borders the drb a similar pattern is found with greater rates of low flow increase in the north than the south rice and hirsch 2012 fleming et al 2020 increases in minimum 7 day flows have been similarly observed for long and short periods 1916 2015 1941 2015 and 1966 2015 in the northeast though greater occurrence of significant trends has been observed for watersheds with human induced influences than for reference watersheds dudley et al 2019 in addition to increases in precipitation increases in low flows in the northeast may partially be attributed to increases in surface water reservoir storage dudley et al 2019 urban watersheds including those in the northeast showed both the greatest occurrence of significant decreases in low flows with the greatest occurrence of significant increases in low flows dudley et al 2019 reiterating the complexities of urban development that can increase or decrease low flows depending on the extent and type of development bhaskar et al 2016 in the delaware river basin increased intensities of drought occurred during the late 20th century through 2002 and were coincident though not strongly correlated with population growth watershed urbanization and atmospheric warming kauffman and vonck 2011 in an analysis of long term variability and trends in drb drought with the basin considered as one unit mccabe and wolock 2020 reported that the most severe drought of gaged record for the basin occurred in the 1960 s with increased runoff and low flow variability until present a tree ring based reconstruction for the periods 490 ce through 2005 ce indicated that the droughts during the gaged record were comparable in duration and severity to most drought events during previous centuries finally an analysis on the relative importance of temperature and precipitation on low flows showed that dry and warm conditions led to the most severe droughts but that most of the variability in drought severity was explained by precipitation alone with the goal of enhancing understanding of low flow patterns drivers and trends at watershed scale in the drb a large and long term sample of u s geological survey usgs gages ii watersheds was used to assess 1 temporal and spatial variability in low flows and 2 drivers of low flow across space and time 2 methods 2 1 site selection and data compilation we selected a sample of 325 usgs gages ii falcone 2011 watersheds based on 1 watershed centroids falling within a 25 mile buffer of the delaware river basin boundary and 2 having 10 or more climate years 4 1 to 3 31 of daily record with each year missing less than 5 daily values the climate year was used in this study because it best brackets the period during which low flows occur as noted by prior studies carpenter and hayes 1996 2017 in this study only usgs gages ii watersheds were considered because of the existing database of watershed characteristics that accompanies this sample this sample contains 50 reference and 275 non reference usgs gages where reference watersheds are intended to be as reflective of the natural flow regime in a given region as possible with minimal impacts from anthropogenic activities a smaller subset of the reference watersheds 20 50 is a part of the hcdn 2009 network lins 2012 which provides the closest approximation of natural flows without human influence it is important to note that the majority of reference gages in the drb are located in the northern portion of the basin with 35 of the total 50 in the appalachian plateau and two or less reference gages in each of the valley and ridge piedmont and new england physiographic provinces the small sample size of reference gages in these regions limits the interpretation of significant differences between reference and non reference gages within regions and between reference and non reference gages basinwide thus in our analyses we do not analyze reference and non reference gages separately most of the sampled watersheds are 1 000 sq km in area and there are 30 watersheds in each of the physiographic regions fenneman and johnson 1946 within the drb though watersheds sampling the appalachian plateaus and piedmont physiographic regions constitute a majority of the sample fig 1 northern areas of the basin are relatively unpopulated forested and higher in elevation with surface water dominated water supplies while southern areas of the basin are densely populated and comparatively gently sloped with a greater fraction of regional water supply sourced from highly productive aquifers fischer et al 2004 we downloaded daily streamflow data from climatic year 1950 beginning april 1 1950 through climatic year 2018 ending march 31 2019 from the usgs national water information system nwis u s geological survey 2019 using the r package dataretrieval hirsch and decicco 2015 r core team 2018 time series of area weighted mean climatic data were extracted from prism monthly 1950 2019 daly 2013 and gridmet daily 1980 2019 abatzoglou 2013 using the intersectr blodgett 2020 and exactextractr baston 2020 r packages mean monthly temperature and total monthly precipitation were extracted from prism while daily precipitation p mean daily temperature tmean daily potential evapotranspiration pet and 10 day palmer drought severity index pdsi were extracted from gridmet climate variables were aggregated to the climate year period as well as seasonal periods april may june spring july august september summer october november december fall january february march winter using totals for precipitation and potential evapotranspiration and means for temperatures and pdsi and long term means for each watershed were calculated additionally we calculated annual p pet where p pet 1 corresponds with precipitation surplus and p pet less than 1 corresponds with precipitation deficit watershed properties including those relating to soils geology and landcover were obtained from gages ii falcone 2011 in addition to examine how human activity relates to low flow trends from 1980 to present water use impervious area and total reservoir storage which causally impact low flows and have each changed substantially in recent decades were assembled for 5 to 10 year periods from 1974 to 2012 from falcone 2018 water use and impervious area are normalized by watershed area while reservoir storage is the cumulative of storage within the watershed watersheds were assigned to physiographic regions based on the region containing the majority of their contributing area 2 2 streamflow metric calculation similar to overall flow regime metrics which reflect the magnitude severity timing and frequency of hydrologic response e g poff et al 1997 we calculated several metrics quantifying different aspects of the annual low flow regime for each climate year of record for each watershed fig 2 prior to metric calculation daily streamflow values were area normalized to units of millimeters per day mm d a running mean of 7 day flows was calculated with the mean value assigned to the center of the 7 day window next the annual 7 day low flow and associated day of the climate year docy on which the 7 day low flow occurred were determined by locating the minimum annual value of the 7 day mean flow series annual low flow deficit was calculated by first determining the 2 long term daily flow threshold for each watershed and then calculating the total departure below this threshold for each year using the 7 day mean flow series the 2 long term daily flow was calculated for each site using the full 10 year record of daily flows and determining the value which was exceeded 98 of the time this one value was used consistently throughout the record of the gage for calculating the metrics described below the 2 long term daily flow threshold was chosen because 2 corresponds to the period of time typically represented by the annual minimum 7 day flow 7 days 365 days 0 02 and has shown utility in prior work fleming et al 2020 in addition the flow objective of 2 000 cfs set by the supreme court decree on the delaware river at trenton nj corresponds to the 2 long term daily flow threshold in wet years when flows do not go below the mean daily 2 threshold the low flow deficit will equal zero whereas in drier than normal years the low flow deficit will exceed the mean annual 7 day low flow value using the 2 long term daily flow threshold the following three metrics were calculated from the 7 day mean flow series total number of days below this threshold per year low flow days the maximum continuous number of days below this threshold max low flow and the number of discrete periods below this threshold low flow periods each continuous departure below the threshold is a unique period these metrics reflect the duration and frequency of low flow occurrence finally the 30 day slope in antecedent flow leading to the 7 day low flow each year for each watershed was calculated as a metric reflecting rate of change once metrics were calculated for each climate year at each site we calculated long term means and departures from these means anomalies for each site a list of all metrics and watershed characteristics included in this study and the median values in physiographic provinces in the drb is shown in table 1 2 3 statistical analyses using mean annual low flow metrics climate metrics and watershed properties we calculated non parametric spearman rank correlations between each explanatory variable and low flow metric to determine the general direction of the relationship between the two spearman rank correlations were chosen because they better capture non linear relationships than parametric pearson correlations correlations were also calculated between each low flow metric to examine which metrics are most strongly related because of high correlations between several low flow variables as well as the higher utility of certain metrics than others to water managers and ecologists subsequent analyses focus on four metrics 7 day low flow 7 day low flow date low flow deficit and low flow periods the non parametric wilcoxon rank sum test was applied to determine whether there were significant differences between low flow climate and watershed properties by region separate random forest models were developed using all gages for each low flow metric to assess the hierarchy and dominance of drivers for each low flow metric in a similar approach to previous studies addor et al 2018 konapala and mishra 2020 random forest analyses for the relative importance of explanatory variables have the following enumerated benefits that are explained in greater detail in addor et al 2018 1 they allow for multiple predictors and non linear relationships which are common in hydrologic processes 2 they are not limited by understanding and assumptions of catchment behavior 3 there is reduced risk of data overfitting through a robust ensemble and randomized approach 4 interpretation of the influence of each variable using the increase in mean standard error is straight forward predictor variables for the random forest analysis were chosen by compiling variables from the aggregated climate extracts above and watershed properties listed in table 1 based on hypothesized importance on controlling low flows and removed predictors that were highly correlated correlation coefficient 0 5 table s1 with similar predictors removed p and pet but included p pet while p is relatively similar across the basin pet is substantially lower in the north and higher in the south of the drb leading to relative precipitation surplus in the north p pet and a balance between p and pet in the coastal plain p pet this ratio of precipitation to potential evapotranspiration has been shown to be a strong driver of regional to continental hydrologic response knoben et al 2018 watershed average depth to bedrock was obtained from hengl et al 2017 while watershed average porosity was obtained from gleeson et al 2014 and storage was calculated by multiplying depth to bedrock by porosity watershed average depth to bedrock is likely less representative in the coastal plain where true bedrock is many hundreds to thousands of feet below the surface to aid in synthesizing random forest results explanatory variables were classified as falling into the following overall categories 1 climate 2 land cover and human activity and 3 topography geology soils the final set of variables used to explain each low flow metric was as follows climate p pet mean temperature land use and human activity cultivated area dam storage impervious area water use topography soils and geology available water capacity depth to bedrock drainage area mean elevation permeability porosity slope soil storage our use of random forests is focused primarily on assessing variable importance in explaining low flow as opposed to developing models with strong predictive capacity for this reason the same random forest constraints were consistently applied developing 500 trees ntrees choosing only 5 variables at a time mtry and maintaining at least 5 watersheds in each terminal node nodesize using the randomforest r package liaw 2018 to evaluate the importance of explanatory variables in explaining each low flow metric the minimal node depth of each explanatory variable as well as the percent increase in mean standard error incmse for each variable in each model were calculated though these modeling analyses explicitly focus on mean annual conditions we also examined annual correlations between low flow metrics and both climatic teleconnections and meteorological drought indices with the goal of informing subsequent predictive studies text s1 to assess how low flow and climate metrics have changed through time three variations of the non parametric mann kendall trend test were used mann 1945 kendall r package mcleod 2011 and paired with the sen s slope estimator theil 1950 sen 1968 zyp r package groemping and matthias 2013 for obtaining trend slopes the variations of the mann kendall test applied here use different assumptions about the time series structure of the data including independence base mann kendall trend test short term persistence inflates the variance computed under an assumption of independence and long term persistence version inflates the variance on the basis of the hurst coefficient to evaluate trend significance hamed and rao 1998 cohn and lins 2005 hamed 2008 this method has been used recently for evaluations of trends in both peak hodgkins et al 2019 and low flow metrics dudley et al 2019 and code to replicate this analysis is available from dudley et al 2018 we evaluated the assumption of independence for the interpretation of the three trend iterations above by identifying sites with significant lag one correlation on annual values and compared these correlations to those expected from a distribution of independent time series trends analyses were run on annual time series of low flow and climate variables for 175 watersheds with less than 10 missing annual values between 1980 and 2018 and for 108 watersheds with less than 10 missing annual values between 1950 and 2018 no systematic pattern of missing early or late years of record was present either for the 1950 or 1980 to 2018 period using data aggregated to usgs watersheds in a previous study falcone 2017 for total reservoir storage years 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 2013 impervious area years 1982 1992 2002 2012 and total water use years 1985 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 which coincide with the latter trend period from 1980 to 2018 simple linear regressions were computed to obtain a slope through time for each metric given the small number of data points through time these slopes are approximations meant to capture the general direction of change and to a lesser degree the rate and magnitude of change finally classification and regression tree cart analysis was used to explain observed significant trends in low flow using trends in precipitation as well as changes in watershed impervious area reservoir storage and water use this decision tree based approach has the advantage of identifying interpretable similarity between gages using multiple variables and has been used similarly in prior studies singh et al 2014 kuentz et al 2017 the rpart therneau and atkinson 2019 and rpart plot milborrow 2019 r packages were used to implement cart for each low flow variable the presence of an increase decrease or no change in precipitation reservoir storage water use and impervious area were used to explain whether a significant low flow trend was observed all data used in the analyses above are available from a usgs data release hammond 2020 3 results 3 1 spatiotemporal low flow patterns in the delaware river basin median precipitation and low flow time series across all watersheds from 1950 to 2018 indicated that the lowest precipitation during this period corresponded with the lowest 7 day low flows and highest low flow deficits during the sustained drought period of the 1960 s fig 3 climate years 1980 and 2002 illustrated low precipitation and low flow periods in more recent years with low precipitation for 1980 corresponding with low 7 day low flows but a low flow deficit that was substantially less than that for the drought of record in 1964 after dry conditions in 2001 2002 low flows decreased to the lowest levels since the drought of record with corresponding low flow deficit increases and increased frequency of low flow periods these examples help to illustrate the intimate connection between low flow and meteorological drought characteristics and emphasize the importance of including antecedent climate when developing predictive models for low flow metrics low flow variables displayed muted spatial patterns across the drb with groupings of lower 7 day low flows and lesser low flow deficits in northern new jersey and the appalachian plateaus of new york figure s1 7 day low flows were positively correlated with low flow deficits suggesting that areas that have higher mean annual low flows can also experience larger low flow deficits during dry periods table s1 while this initially seems counterintuitive note that during normal and wet years low flow deficits are equal to zero and only have positive values during dry years this may suggest that wetter areas of the basin tend to experience greater deficits in years where precipitation in below normal than drier parts of the basin with lower mean annual low flows low flow metrics displayed substantial heterogeneity when compared to nearby gages low flow variable coefficients of variation similarly displayed substantial heterogeneity lacking many readily discernable regional patterns figure s1 spatial variability in 7 day low flow and low flow deficit anomalies annual value minus long term mean for these three flow periods 1964 the drought of record for the basin with the lowest observed annual low flows 1980 a year of lower than average flows and 2002 the most recent period of low flows approaching the spatial prevalence of the drought of record in 1964 are shown in fig 4 in 1964 negative 7 day low flow anomalies were distributed across much of the basin though low flow deficits were most substantial in northern regions of the basin mainly the appalachian plateaus in 1980 7 day low flow anomalies were generally less negative with a greater occurrence of positive anomalies than in 1964 and there were fewer anomalously negative low flow deficits finally in 2002 there were more negative 7 day low flow anomalies observed in the piedmont and new jersey coastal plain of the basin than in the other highlighted periods with negative low flow deficit anomalies also focused further to the south than during 1964 in comparing mean annual low flow metrics and coefficients of variation for these metrics between different physiographic regions the most numerous significant differences were between northern and southern regions table s3 while proximal regions displayed fewer significant differences illustrating this point the appalachian plateaus physiographic region had lower and more variable 7 day low flows as well as lesser low flow deficits than the coastal plain and piedmont regions 3 2 drivers of low flow in the drb random forest models were used to identify the primary drivers of the spatial variability in mean annual low flows for the purpose of synthesis explanatory variables were classified into three categories 1 climatic 2 land use and human alteration 3 topography soils and geology as shown in figs 5 and 6 water use emerged as the primary driver of 7 day low flows in our random forest analysis suggesting that surface water withdrawals and groundwater pumping play a strong role in altering low flow conditions in the basin fig 5 table 2 p pet had the greatest influence on the low flow deficit and number of low flow periods for all watersheds with negative correlations indicating that wetter watersheds had fewer low flow periods and smaller low flow deficits the 7 day low flow date was most strongly controlled by mean elevation and dam storage with later low flows occurring at higher elevations and in watersheds with greater storage later low flows were also associated with less impervious area and lower temperatures further impervious area was consistently in the top 10 predictors for each low flow metric with the strongest relationship with 7 day low flows where positive correlation suggests that increases in imperious cover are associated with higher low flows perhaps due to leaking water supply pipes bhaskar et al 2016 the number of low flow periods was poorly explained by the model with negative incmse model predictions better without including these metrics for 2 of the 14 variables p pet and watershed mean slope had the strongest variable importance for this model though they had weak correlations with the number of low flow periods mean watershed permeability porosity and soil storage all displayed negative correlations with 7 day low flow date indicating that greater subsurface storage and draining tend to be associated with earlier low flows watersheds with high permeability were also associated with greater mean annual low flow deficits higher low flows and more frequent low flow periods of note permeability was somewhat strongly correlated to the baseflow index 0 54 ratio of long term baseflow to total stream flow falcone 2011 for study watersheds there was generally a mix of importance between the three categories of explanatory variables 1 climate 2 land cover and 3 topography soils and geology when looking at the fractional contribution of the top ten predictors in each random forest model fig 6 table 2 though topography soils and geology contributed more than half of the increase in mean standard error in each model climate appeared to contribute the least to the model for 7 day low flows while explaining a quarter of the variability in low flow deficit and low flow period models instead land cover primarily impervious and cultivated areas appeared more important for 7 day low flow and 7 day low flow date models and less important for low flow deficit and low flow period models focusing on metrics that change through time and could explain observed trends in low flows p pet dam storage impervious area and water use regularly appear in the top ten variable importance hierarchy table 2 and are highlighted in the following section after reporting observed trends in low flow while mean temperature was also prominently featured in the random forest variable hierarchy trends in temperature show increases in nearly all watersheds as presented in the next section thus in relating trends in low flows to drivers that have changed through time we omit temperature to focus on changes in precipitation dam storage impervious area and water use 3 3 changes in low flows and drivers through time the number of significant increases in 7 day low flow and decreases in annual low flow deficit for all basins in the study outnumbered decreases in 7 day low flow and increases in low flow deficit for both 1950 2018 and 1980 2018 fig 7 tables s4 s5 s6 decreases in 7 day low flows and increases in low flow deficit were concentrated in the coastal plain physiographic region of new jersey and the delmarva peninsula fig 7 using the mann kendall trend test assuming time series independence 29 3 of watersheds showed significant increases decreases in 7 day low flow and 16 2 showed decreases increases in low flow deficit for the period 1980 2018 46 6 of watersheds showed increases decreases in 7 day low flow and 22 1 showed decreases increases in low flow deficit for the 1950 2018 period incorporating assumptions of short and long term persistence effects on trend significance generally reduced the fraction of gages showing significant trends fig 7 tables s4 s5 the fraction of watersheds with significant p less than 0 05 lag one autocorrelation in detrended 7 day low streamflows was greater than would arise only by chance for the period 1950 2018 with 36 of 108 gages 33 but similar to that expected by chance for 1980 2018 with 14 of 175 gages 8 the average pearson correlation coefficient r for the longer period was 0 37 and 0 23 for the shorter period figure s5 for comparison the upper 95th percentile of the distribution of r for an independent time series is approximately 0 235 for a 69 year series and 0 312 for a 39 year series thus for the period 1950 2018 the assumtion of independence is not met for annual 7 day low flows and significant trends for short and long term persistence should be interpreted whereas for the shorter time period from 1980 to 2018 the assumption of independence cannot be as readily rejected and interpretation of trends using the base mann kendall is justified these results are similar for the other low flow metrics suggesting independence rejection for 1950 2018 but not for 1980 2018 lag 1 autocorrelation was significant for the fewest sites for the 7 day low flow date suggesting that interpretation of the base mann kendall is justified for this metric for both periods regardless of trend sinificance between independence short term and long term variations of the trend analysis regional patterns in low flow trends are similar showing increases in low flow and decreases in low flow deficits in the north and decreases in low flow and increases in low flow deficit in the southern drb primarily the coastal plain physiographic region over the same time periods annual precipitation and temperature significantly increased at a majority of gages figure s3 tables s4 s5 with greater numbers of watersheds showing increases in summer precipitation and temperature than annual precipitation and temperature tables s4 s5 significant increases in pet were focused in northern new jersey while increases in p were widespread through the domain the combination of which yielded significant increases in p pet primarily in the northern extremity of the drb figure s3 impervious area increased in 96 of study watersheds for the more recent trend period with only 4 of watersheds showing no change in impervious area table s6 over the period of record the median rate of increase was 0 015 year for a total increase of 0 47 from 1982 to 2012 table s6 figure s4 though one site usgs 01402600 royce brook tributary near belle mead nj had a total increase of 21 4 over the same period similarly dam storage increased in 57 of watersheds with median rate of 0 005 year for a total median increase of 0 17 from 1980 to 2013 though one site usgs 013621955 birch creek at big indian ny had a total increase of 918 increasing from 22 to 264 acre feet water use increased in 25 and decreased in 74 of study watersheds table s6 figure s4 with a median increase of 1 14 year and total of 29 from 1985 to 2010 and median decrease of 2 17 year and total of 56 4 a cart analysis using 1980 2018 trend occurrence for the 7 day low flow low flow deficit and precipitation combined with estimated rates of change in impervious area dam storage and water use was implemented to determine the commonalities between gages experiencing trends in low flow fig 9 this analysis showed that a greater fraction of sites had statistically significant increases in 7 day low flows when 1 precipitation increased significantly 2 water use decreased and 3 dam storage increased similarly in watersheds with increased precipitation a higher fraction of sites showed decreased low flow deficits and where water use decreased there was a higher fraction of sites with decreasing low flow deficit trends 4 discussion 4 1 spatial and temporal variability in low flows multiple low flow metrics displayed differing spatial and temporal patterns across the delaware river basin depending on geographic location watershed properties and potential degree of human alteration of flows consistent with prior research mccabe and wolock 2020 low flows in the drb were most severe during the 1964 climate year with recent periods of low flow approaching similar 7 day low flow magnitude but without pervasive low flow deficits fig 4 the spatial distribution of low flow magnitude and severity has differed through time likely related to differing antecedent metrological conditions for the years analyzed kauffman and vonck 2011 kam et al 2013 the negative low flow anomalies of 1964 during the drought of record were more spatially extensive than in subsequent years with low flow deficits concentrated in the northern portion of the basin fig 4 in contrast low flow deficits of 2002 were concentrated in the pennsylvania piedmont and new jersey coastal plain where substantial groundwater pumping has occurred over the past century konikow 2013 mean annual low flow values displayed substantial spatial variability with dissimilar values within close proximity while climate and elevation gradually change across the basin factors including human alteration dam storage impervious area power plants in addition to subsurface properties may vary over shorter distances with localized effects on low flow which helps to explain some of the proximal heterogeneity in low flow observed in this study despite this high variability within close proximity several regional patterns emerge the appalachian plateaus physiographic region displays distinct regional behavior in the drb with lower and more variable 7 day low flows and lesser low flow deficits as compared to the coastal plain and piedmont regions table s3 the appalachian plateaus are higher in elevation with lower temperatures and pet than the piedmont and coastal plain physiographic regions also have significantly shorter depth to bedrock lesser permeability and soil storage than the coastal plain table s2 mean annual low flow deficits tended to be higher in watersheds with greater soil storage and permeability potentially indicating that watersheds containing geologies that effectively store and release water are more likely to experience below normal low flows when subsurface storage is depleted during long periods of dry conditions kroll et al 2004 avril and barten 2007 winter 2007 4 2 drivers of low flow change across space and time variables quantifying elements of human alteration of landscape and flows were generally more important in explaining 7 day low flows and 7 day low flow dates while p pet emerged as a primary driver of mean annual low flow deficit and low flow period variability in drb watersheds figs 5 and 6 table 2 water use and impervious area were the two strongest predictors of 7 day low flows across the basin with impervious area also important in the models explaining the other three low flow metrics as explained in the paragraphs following water use increased or decreased depending on location in the drb and while impervious area only showed increases the effects of urbanization on low flows can be mixed the presence of significant dam storage led to later 7 day low flows fig 5 table 2 table s1 and may lead to fewer departures below the 2 mean daily flow threshold this is consistent with dam management for ecological flows total maximum daily loads and other objectives in the basin hansler and goodell 1983 galbraith et al 2016 the dominant importance of aridity in explaining interannual low flow variability is similar to the reported importance of precipitation in determining the duration and severity of low flows in previous studies outside of the drb krakauer and fung 2008 ficklin et al 2016 kormos et al 2016 dierauer et al 2018 ledford et al 2020 as well as mccabe and wolock 2020 who show that precipitation drives much of the variability in low flow severity in the drb watershed properties quantifying topography geology and soils accounted for more than half of the variability explained by all variables in the models emphasizing the importance of including the best available information on watershed structure and subsurface when attempting to model low flows many of these variables change at rates much slower than those associated with climatic land use and water management change additionally though our analyses did not explicitly focus on the prediction of annual low flow metrics we examined correlations with climatic teleconnections and meteorological drought indices the north atlantic oscillation nao showed the strongest correlation with drb averaged 7 day low flows 0 27 of the teleconnections examined table s8 while the standardized precipitation evaporation index spei calculated using 90 day antecedent conditions prior to the occurrence of the 7 day low flow showed strong positive correlations with drb averaged 7 day low flows 0 86 table s9 4 3 observed low flow trends and future low flow possibilities in the delaware river basin significant increases in 7 day low flow and decreases in annual low flow deficit outnumbered decreases in 7 day low flow and increases in low flow deficit for both 1950 2018 and 1980 2018 periods fig 7 tables s4 s5 observed trends in low flows are consistent with those reported regionally from rice and hirsh 2012 and dudley et al 2019 and have occurred simultaneously with increases in precipitation and temperature across the basin and increases in pet focused in northern new jersey figure s3 tables s4 s5 similar to an analysis of low flow and low flow deficit trends in the neighboring chesapeake bay we find increases in low flow volume in northern and upland areas of our study area and notable decreases in the south fleming et al 2020 impervious area increased in nearly all study watersheds especially those in southeastern pennsylvania and new jersey while dam storage showed lesser but positive change and water use showed mixed change with increases in the coastal plain and eastern central pennsylvania and reductions in northern delaware southeastern pennsylvania and northwestern new jersey while water use efficiency has increased in much of the drb barr 2017 increases in total water use and sustained groundwater pumping in the coastal plain and eastern central pennsylvania have also been reported schreffler 1996 konikow 2013 conversely pumping decreases have been reported in southeastern pennsylvania barr 2017 total water use has decreased in some areas of new jersey but importantly irrigation during summer months when low flows typically occur has remained constant njdep 2017 while many decreases in low flow coincide spatially with regional increases in water use for parts of the coastal plain due to increased irrigation water use increases in eastern central pennsylvania are not matched by decreases in low flow potentially because the water use increases are not associated with summer irrigation as in the coastal plain increases in impervious area in new jersey also coincide with watersheds showing decreases in low flow we find that a greater fraction of sites had statistically significant increases in 7 day low flows when 1 precipitation increased significantly 2 water use decreased and 3 dam storage increased fig 8 similarly in watersheds with increased precipitation a higher fraction of sites showed decreased low flow deficits and where water use decreased decreasing low flow deficit trends were most likely in other areas where water abstractions have increased associated decreases in flows have been observed barlow and leake 2012 de graaf et al 2014 and where reservoir storage has increased there is a greater capacity of flow management to elevate low flows magilligan and nislow 2005 it appears as though areas of new jersey where low flows declined tend to overlap with where impervious cover has increased figure s4 though observed increased impervious area was not selected as an important factor in cart decision trees for 7 day low flow and low flow deficit trend occurrence for the model of all drb watersheds perhaps due to the mixed effects of urbanization on low flows brandes et al 2005 bhaskar et al 2016 projections of future streamflow in the drb suggest continued increases in annual flow over the coming decades increased annual flows will likely result from increases in precipitation that outweigh increases in actual evapotranspiration throughout the year williamson et al 2016 while continued watershed urbanization is expected to decrease low flows kauffman and vonck 2011 despite increases in annual flows flash droughts which unfold on weekly to monthly timescales and are distinguished by sudden onset and rapid intensification of drought conditions may present a new challenge for low flow management pendergrass et al 2020 and continuous increases in potential evapotranspiration will likely drive future low flow extremes kam and sheffield 2015 ficklin et al 2016 in addition global climate models suggest an increase in hydrological drought severity at the end of the 21st century prudhomme et al 2014 with drought frequency showing little change but drought onset occurring more rapidly and becoming more intense trenberth et al 2014 these future simulations suggest that climatic effects and more severe warming will outweigh anthropogenic effects on the low flow regime in later decades wanders and wada 2015 synthesizing these projections if the delaware river basin was to depart from recent wetter conditions and return to dry antecedent meteorological conditions similar to the 1960 s drought of record we might expect low flows to be lower and deficits greater where water use and impervious area have increased primarily the coastal plain 4 4 limiting assumptions and future research though the sample of watersheds used in this study was advantageous given the spatial coverage and temporal completeness in the basin several limitations remain first fewer reference gages were present in southern areas of the basin leading to an incomplete understanding of natural flows second the aggregated watershed metrics used in this study may not capture site specific and reach scale influences on low flows finally the random forest models developed here show relatively low predictive power as indicated by pseudo r squared values table s7 these values are similar to us wide random forest prediction of low flow values addor et al 2018 model performance was stronger for 7 day low flow and 7 day low flow date with variability in low flow deficit and the number of low flow periods poorly explained regardless of the predictive strength of the random forest models used in this study the exercise in examining the relative importance of predictor variables provides useful information on which variables control various amounts of response in a dependent variable as reported in previous research carlisle et al 2010 in the absence of detailed groundwater trend work in the area we used five year estimates of water use in this study as an approximation of all water use activity but specific knowledge on how groundwater levels throughout the drb have changed through time would enhance interpretation of study results and also reveal patterns in groundwater surface water interaction estimation of low flow metrics in ungaged areas of the drb or at gaged locations for future periods may benefit from the output of the random forest analysis in this paper that suggests inclusion of p pet and water use in explaining 7 day low flow and low flow deficit further the strong correlations between 7 day low flow and 90 day spei suggest promising predictive power for real time applications finally future simulations of low flows in response to increased temperature and potential evapotranspiration could be used as input to the existing decision support system maloney et al 2015 to evaluate the ability of the existing water management system to meet management objectives in future decades 5 conclusions our results contribute to the growing body of literature using long term empirical streamflow climate and watershed properties to understand hydrologic variability through assessment of drivers of hydrologic response and trends through time in a basin that provides a critical water supply to 5 of the u s population low flows exhibit muted regional patterns with proximal watersheds showing substantially different low flow values at the mean annual scale individual years show markedly different spatial patterns in low flow magnitude and severity illustrating the need for continued distributed monitoring across the basin for two recent periods 1950 2018 and 1980 2018 7 day low flows have generally increased and low flow deficits decreased corresponding to concurrent increases in precipitation however 7 day low flows have decreased in the coastal plain physiographic province of the southern delaware river basin where water use and impervious area have increased in recent decades highlighting the effects of land and water management on low flows as warming and population growth continue and land and water managers plan for future decades additional research would enhance greater confidence in future low flow

4522,the operating rules especially the hedging rules which are known as useful tools for effective utilization of water from reservoir systems are commonly applied for managing reservoir systems in severe drought periods extracting optimal operation policies for multi reservoir systems is a challenging issue due to their non linear large scale and stochastic nature therefore improving optimization techniques is a worthy effort in developing the operating rules for multi reservoir systems hence this research aimed to develop an efficient optimization method called multi mechanism ensemble interior search algorithm meisa to tackle various problems in the optimal management of reservoir systems the meisa promotes the two main operators of the interior search algorithm isa i e the composition and the mirror operators to enhance the capability of global and local search besides the proposed algorithm employs an enhanced opposition based learning eobl operator to improve the best solution and increase the convergence speed the meisa also uses an adaptive parameter to balance the global and local search in the proposed algorithm the results of several test functions demonstrate that the meisa outperforms other optimizers in terms of the solution accuracy the quality and the convergence rate finally the results of optimizing the hedging rules for two real world single and multi reservoir systems in iran indicate that the meisa is more suitable efficient in ameliorating irreversible impacts of severe drought periods as compared with other optimization methods

1 introduction dams and reservoirs assist in economic progress by ensuring water supply producing power and managing river flows since the effect of the operation on the economy or the society is unavoidable extracting reservoir operation rules is imperative for managing water resource systems during the past decades deriving reservoir operating rules has been a challenging issue for managers of water resources systems ahmadianfar et al 2016 in the case of water supply uses a large number of methodologies in terms of different rules simulations and optimization techniques have been introduced to optimize the operations the two most widely used policies related to the reservoir operation are the standard operation policy sop and the hedging rule guo et al 2012 based on the sop the release is done to the extent that the demand is maximally met stedinger 1984 with respect to this definition the sop retains only the surplus water for the future consumptions ahmadianfar et al 2016 guo et al 2012 shiau 2009 taghian et al 2013 notwithstanding the sop needs to be improved during drought periods shiau 2009 shiau and lee 2005 the extended and severe droughts occur as climatic phenomena and their incidences are unavoidable wilhite 2012 therefore extracting suitable operation rules for managing reservoirs during drought periods are highly essential to reduce the destructive effects caused by the droughts the hedging rule is the most popular policy for reservoir management during droughts which saves the water in the reservoir during the normal periods and uses the water efficiently to reduce the effects of severe droughts ahmadianfar et al 2016 tu et al 2008 shih and revelle shih and revelle 1994 1995 introduced the hedging policy as an operation policy to deal with severe drought periods shih and revelle 1994 1995 shiau and lee shiau and lee 2005 developed a two point hedging rule with two parameters namely the starting water availability swa and the ending water availability ewa to minimize shortage for a reservoir system in taiwan shiau and lee 2005 additionally celeste and billib celeste and billib 2009 presented a two dimensional 2 d hedging rule with two controlling parameters the first parameter hdg determines the start time of the hedging and the second parameter m is applied for the calibration of the release rule celeste and billib 2009 moreover the researchers successfully applied this type of hedging rule to minimize the vulnerability index for a reservoir system in brazil tan et al tan et al 2017 developed a two point hedging rule by embedding the damage depth parameter in the hedging rule tan et al 2017 they applied this policy to decrease the maximum shortage over a long term period for a multi reservoir system in china as mentioned above all types of operating rules have several decision variables to determine the reservoir release these variables need to be determined by an optimization method many researchers have used different types of metaheuristic optimization methods moms to optimize reservoir operating rules bozorg haddad et al bozorg haddad et al 2006 presented honey bee mating optimization hbmo algorithm to optimize a non convex hydropower multi reservoir system in iran bozorg haddad et al 2006 guo et al 2012 employed the particle swarm optimization pso algorithm to optimize the operating rules for a multi reservoir system in china by coupling the parametric rule with the hedging rule to mitigate water deficit during droughts guo et al 2012 ngoc et al 2014 used the genetic algorithm ga to optimize the rule curves of a multi purpose reservoir system in vietnam ngoc et al 2014 bozorg haddad et al 2016 applied the gravity search algorithm gsa to optimally solve a single and multi reservoir system bozorg haddad et al 2016 their results indicated that the gsa can provide promising results for reservoir operation systems xu and mei 2018 presented an enhanced water cycle algorithm wca based on diversity evaluation and chaos theory to improve the performance of the basic wca they used the proposed algorithm to optimization of a multi reservoir system in china xu and mei 2018 ahmadianfar et al 2019 developed an effective differential evolution de algorithm combined with mutation strategy adaptation msa de to extract optimal multiple linear rules for two multi reservoir operation systems in iran ahmadianfar et al 2019 xia et al 2019 improved the particle swarm optimization using a simplex method to promote the local exploration capability of the swarm xia et al 2019 they applied the proposed method to optimize an ecological operation problem in a cascade hydropower reservoir in china zhang et al 2020 used the moth flame optimization mfo algorithm to optimize a multi reservoir system in china their findings indicated that the optimization method has a suitable performance in obtaining solutions with good convergence and strong diversity for optimizing reservoir operation problems zhang et al 2020 ahmadianfar et al 2020 developed an adaptive hybrid differential evolution and particle swarm optimization a depso to optimize multi reservoir systems their results indicated the superior ability of the a depso in optimizing multi reservoir systems ahmadianfar et al 2020a 2020b the multi reservoir problems are the most challenging optimization problems to solve in the field of water resources systems xia et al 2019 typically such problems include nonlinear objective functions with a large number of decision variables and constraints kuriqi et al 2019 2020 suwal et al 2020a 2020b water resources planners and analysts explore to find appropriate optimization methods for reservoir operation systems hence finding efficient and reliable optimization techniques is an essential issue moms are introduced as the most frequently applied techniques for optimizing reservoir systems regarding their proven powerful ability to find global optimum and convergence speed bozorg haddad et al 2015 in recent decades the development and promotion of moms have drawn the interest of many researchers ahmadianfar et al 2019a 2020a 2020b 2019b heidari et al 2019 however these methods still need more enhancements to present robust and effective optimization algorithms for solving complex optimization problems moms have several intrinsic advantages and drawbacks for instance previous attempts have proved that reducing the convergence speed of the performance of evolutionary algorithms depends on how some control parameters are set holland 1975 chen et al 2020 xu et al 2019 xu and chen 2014 zhao et al 2021 occasionally the aforementioned algorithms suffer from trapping in local optima and premature convergence in solving complex problems kumar et al 2017 yu et al 2020 2021 tu et al 2021 shan et al 2020 however the inertia search algorithm isa is applied efficiently in solving complicated optimization problems gandomi 2014 the main operators of this algorithm are the composition and the mirror operators while the former creates a solution using a random walk to yield a better view the latter is the mirror method in which the mirror is in the middle of each solution and the best solution obtained so far is utilized to create a new solution gandomi 2014 in the current research to further develop the isa the operators of the proposed algorithm are modified by some efficient mechanisms including local and global search methods these mechanisms improve the global search to explore the promising regions using some differential random vectors and combining those with the best solution also the proposed meisa uses a robust local search operator to find better solutions and conduct the solutions toward the best global solution an adaptive parameter is used to create a suitable transit from global search to local search the proposed mechanisms and the adaptive parameter assist the proposed algorithm to make a fast convergence rate and escape from local optimal solutions in this study the capabilities of meisa to explore near global optimal solutions in non linear multi modal and non convex multi reservoir operation optimization problems are evaluated deriving optimal operating rules for multi reservoir systems is inevitable because these rules help the managers of water resources systems to better manage the water release from the reservoir in different conditions such as droughts or wet periods therefore the main goal of this study is to create a novel framework for optimal release rule that would provide a guideline to efficiently fulfill the operation of multi reservoir systems the hedging rule is employed for the formulation of the release rule 2 methodology 2 1 modeling a multi reservoir system in the present research an effective hedging rule is developed to determine the release rules for a multi reservoir system generally the hedging policy prevents severe shortage in the future by accepting small shortages in the present period draper and lund 2004 in this study the two dimensional hedging rule introduced by celeste and billib 2009 is used as the operating release rule for a multi reservoir system in iran according to this type of hedging policy the reservoir release is specified based on a nonlinear function that creates a relationship between the reservoir release r t and the three parameters of demand d t reservoir storage v t and inflow to reservoir i t at each time step the most important parameters in the hedging policy are the time and amount of rationing which are determined by the current reservoir storage and reservoir inflow regarding the 2d hedging when the combination of reservoir storage and reservoir inflow v t v min 2 i t 2 is less than the hedging parameter hg l the hedge is started in this case the amount of the released water is determined by a non linear function fig 1 displays the 2 dimensional hedging rule in details the formulation of the 2d hedging policy is described as follows 1 calculating the reservoir release when the hedging occurs 1 r t n d t n v t n v min n 2 i t n 2 hg l n u l n i f v t n v min n 2 i t n 2 hg l n 2 calculating the reservoir release when v t n v min n 2 i t n 2 is bigger than hg l n 2 r t n d t n i f v t n v min n 2 i t n 2 hg l n where hg l n is the setting parameter of the hedging policy for each month l 1 2 12 v min n is the minimum volume of the nth reservoir storage at period t and u l n is the parameter of regression in eq 1 within the range ahmadianfar et al 2016 therefore the main decision variables in the 2d hedging policy are hg l n and u l n the constraints for these parameters are expressed as hg l n 0 3 0 u l n 1 the continuity equation which is used to extract the reservoir release and storage during each period is expressed as 4 v t 1 n v t n i t n r t n e t n s p i l l t n t 1 2 t n 1 2 3 where v t n and v t 1 n are the volumes of nth reservoir storage during periods t and t 1 respectively i t n is the volume of the inflow into nth reservoir at period t e t n is the volume of evaporation for nth reservoir during period t and spill t n is the volume of spill from nth reservoir during period t to calculate spill t n and e t n eqs 5 6 are defined as bozorg haddad et al 2016 2014 5 spill t n v t n i t n r t n e t n v max n i f v t n i t n r t n e t n v max n 0 o t h e r w i s e and 6 e t n h t n area t n where h t n is the height of evaporation from the nth reservoir during period t and area t n is the area of the nth reservoir which is calculated based on the relationship curve between the reservoir area and its reservoir storage to describe the lower and upper bounds of the reservoir storage and release the physical constraints of the multi reservoir system are considered eqs 7 and 8 define such constrains in this study 7 v min n v t n v max n t 1 2 t n 1 2 3 8 0 r t n d t n t 1 2 t n 1 2 3 where v max n and t are the maximum volume of the nth reservoir storage and the total number of periods respectively 2 2 the hedging policy coupled with the optimization method in this research a novel optimization method namely multi mechanism ensemble interior search algorithm meisa is linked to the hedging policy to extract optimal hedging parameters the proposed method is called the 2d hedging meisa the monthly hedging parameters hg l n and u l n are generated by the proposed meisa for the given hedging parameters the reservoir operation model based on the 2d hedging rule simulates the multi reservoir system and allocates water to the different demands after that the results obtained by the reservoir operation model is employed to compute the objective function for the meisa this procedure is performed for each iteration and repeated until the termination criteria of the meisa is met the schematic of the proposed 2d hedging meisa is depicted in fig 2 2 2 1 objective function in the proposed 2d hedging meisa minimizing water shortage can be considered as the objective function for the water supply in the multi reservoir system accordingly an efficient shortage index is needed to specify the water shortage characteristics from a comprehensive view to make the objective function of the proposed model the modified shortage index msi introduced by hsu and cheng hsu and cheng 2002 hsu and cheng 2002 is used as the criterion to find the optimal hedging rules moreover msi is defined as 9 msi 100 t n 1 3 t 1 t r t n d t n d t n 2 this index can be employed for minimizing the total shortage of the various demands as 10 minimizeof w 1 msi ac w 2 msi mf w 3 m s i p where of is the objective function msi ac msi mf and msi p are the agriculture the minimum flow and the public demands respectively in this study the public demands are the municipal and industrial demands w 1 w 2 and w 3 are the weighting coefficients for the msi types these coefficients are used to determine the hierarchy of the msi for different kinds of water demands the values of weighting coefficients are commonly specified by the individual s judgments based on the importance of each objective in the entire system 2 3 simulation optimization steps the main aim of the simulation optimization method is to extract optimal operating rules of the multi reservoir system for different water supply demands in this section the main steps of the simulation optimization model are described step 1 create randomly the decision variables of the proposed hedging rule hg l n and u l n by the meisa algorithm step 2 obtain the water release of the multi reservoir system utilizing the 2d hedging policy for each month t eqs 1 and 2 step 3 calculate the reservoir storage using the continuity equation eq 4 at period t 1 step 4 if the current time period t is less than the total number of operation period t then t t 1 and you need to go to step 2 otherwise go to step 5 step 5 evaluate the objective function of step 6 if the termination condition is satisfied the optimal operating rules are presented otherwise the new decision variables of hedging policy are calculated by the meisa operators and you need to go to step 2 2 4 optimization method an effective method to provide a suitable operating rule is utilizing the optimization simulation model in this study the meisa is used to extract the optimal hedging rule for the multi reservoir system several benchmark test functions introduced as commonly employed in the literature ahmadianfar et al 2020a 2020b 2019ab are used in this research to compare the performance of the meisa with those of the isa the modified interior search algorithm misa kumar et al 2017 the improved whale optimization algorithm iwoa hu et al 2017

optimization aso zhao et al 2019 for this purpose the proposed meisa is firstly introduced in the following sections 2 4 1 interior search algorithm isa the interior search algorithm isa is a meta heuristic optimization method which has a high potential in solving linear and non linear engineering problems gandomi 2014 this algorithm simulates the behavior of an interior designer and decorator gandomi 2014 the main operators of the isa are the composition and the mirror operators the composition is applied to a global search in the feasible space and changes the element solution compositions to achieve better views better objective functions which is utilized for the exploration stage in the mirror operator some mirrors are used to generate more decorative places according to this operator the mirrors are placed close to the most beautiful elements this mechanism can be applied in the optimization process by placing several mirrors near the fittest elements the best solution to obtain other beautiful views the details of the isa are explained in the following steps step 1 the position of each element x i k m is randomly generated using eq 11 and then their values of the objective function f x i k m is calculated as 11 x i k m l u l r a n d 1 i 1 2 n k 1 2 d where l and u are the lower and upper bound respectively rand 1 is a random value within the range ahmadianfar et al 2016 and n and d are the population and the dimension size respectively step 2 the best value of the objective function fittest element x b e s t k m at the mth iteration is determined in the case of a minimization problem the position x b e s t k m has the minimum value step 3 other elements are divided into two parts i e composition and mirror parts using a dynamic parameter α m m where m is the number of iterations and m is the maximum number of iterations if rand α the new element position is generated using the mirror part otherwise the new element is created by the composition part step 4 in the composition part the position of each element can randomly change using the following equation 12 x n e w k m x m i n k m x m a x k m x m i n k m rand 2 where x m i n k m and x m a x k m are the minimum and maximum bounds of the composition part elements in the mth iteration and rand 2 is a random value within the range ahmadianfar et al 2016 step 5 to generate a new element in the mirror part a mirror is randomly located between the current element and the best one best position at each iteration accordingly the position of a mirror can be formulated as follows 13 x m i r r o r k m rand 3 x i k m 1 rand 3 x l b e s t k m where rand 3 is a random value within the range ahmadianfar et al 2016 and x l b e s t k m is the best solution achieved at each iteration the position of the new element is calculated using the position of the mirror as 14 x n e w k m 2 x m i r r o r k m x i k m step 6 for the local search the position of the best solution slightly changes according to the following equation 15 x l b e s t k m x l b e s t k m r a n d n λ where randn is a normally distributed random value and λ is a coefficient which is defined as follows 16 λ 0 01 u l 2 5 multi mechanism ensemble interior search algorithm meisa in this sub section the multi mechanism ensemble interior search algorithm meisa is developed in details the meisa improved the efficiency of the original isa algorithm which has some weaknesses like trapping in local positions low convergence speed and relative imbalance in transition from the exploration to exploitation therefore this research presents some mechanisms to overcome these drawbacks by using two mechanisms 1 enhancing the composition and the mirror operators and 2 assigning an adaptive parameter for smooth transition from global search to local search the main mechanisms of the meisa algorithm are described in detail in the following sections 2 5 1 the proposed composition operator in the isa the composition operator is applied to global search to obtain further improvement of the operators a novel mechanism is considered to create the proposed mechanism four solutions x r 1 x r 2 x r 3 and x r 4 are randomly selected from the members of the population it is noteworthy that x r 1 is extracted from the top 100u members in the population at each iteration and u 0 1 the proposed composition operator uses the two differential vectors x r 1 x r 3 and xp i x r 4 to create the solution u k 17 u k x r 2 f x r 1 x r 3 0 5 f xp i x r 4 where xp i is the best so far solution achieved for the ith member of the population r 2 r 3 and r 4 are the three random integer numbers r 2 r 3 r 4 i which are extracted from the range of 1 n and f is an adaptive parameter which can be defined as 17 1 f 2 r a n d 1 2 e x p m m in the early iterations parameter f has a large value to search the entire solution space whereas small values of f enhance the local search and move toward the best solution in the last iterations 2 5 2 the proposed mirror operator the mirror operator uses a mirror near the best solution to obtain a favorable solution in this study to reach further promotion of the mirror operator three solutions x i k m x l b e s t k m and x b e s t k m are applied the following scheme defines the proposed mirror operator 18 x m i r r o r k m ρ 1 x i k m 1 ρ 1 ρ 2 x l b e s t k m 1 ρ 2 x b e s t k m where ρ 1 and ρ 2 are two random values within the range ahmadianfar et al 2016 the position of solution u i k is achieved using the position of the mirror updated position is expressed as 19 u i k 2 x m i r r o r k m x i k m as mentioned before the new position is generated from the composition operator or the mirror operator to specify that the new solution is created by using the composition or the mirror operator a dynamic parameter α is employed which is expressed in section 2 4 1 2 5 3 the proposed local search in this section a new local search strategy is developed to increase the diversity of the population and the convergence speed as mentioned in the basic isa the local search uses the best solution x l b e s t k m found in each iteration and changes its position to achieve a better solution to reach this goal the new solution is created based on either of the two random solutions selected from between the member of the population x r 2 m and x r 3 m and a weighted difference vector u l λ the solution u i k is calculated as 20 u i k x l b e s t k m r a n d n u l r a n d x r 2 m x r 3 m λ i f r a n d 0 5 x l b e s t k m r a n d n u l λ o t h e r w i s e the proposed local search is calculated based on two mathematical formulations in the first formula it uses the two solutions x r 2 m and x r 3 m and a weighted difference vector wdf based on the lower and upper bounds of the solution space the second formula employs only the wdf these two formulas are applied to create the solution u i k using a constant parameter 0 5 if rand 0 5 the new solution is generated using the first formula otherwise the second formula is used 2 5 4 the crossover operator in this research to boost the diversity of the population the crossover operator is implemented by combining the elements of solutions u i k y k and xp i k in the meisa a new solution based on the crossover operator is generated by the following scheme for k 1 to d if rand cr or k krand if rand 0 5 x new k 0 5 u i k y k else xnew k ui k 21 end else xnew k xpi k end end in which 21 1 y j x r 1 r a n d x r 2 x r 3 0 5 r a n d x i x r 4 ω i f r a n d α x r 2 r a n d x r 1 x r 3 0 5 r a n d x i x r 4 ω o t h e r w i s e where k rand is an integer randomly number in the range of 1 d which allows that at least one element to be employed from the u i k or 0 5 u i k y k and y k is a new vector generated based on the two weighted differential vectors based on eq 21 1 there are two formulations to specify the y k the first formulation uses the x r 1 with the purpose of moving toward a promising region this formula has the highest chance of performing in the final iterations the second formula is applied to perform global search in the early iterations based on the dynamic parameter α ω is a dynamic coefficient which is expressed as an exponential function i e 2 e x p m m c r is used to refer to the crossover rate which is defined as 21 2 c r 0 5 0 1 r a n d n 2 5 5 enhanced opposition based learning eobl operator the opposition based learning obl was first brought up by rahnamayan et al 2008 the obl is implemented to generate an opposite estimation of the current solution to find promising regions in the solution space for solution x i its opposite solution z can be expressed as 22 z k l k u k x i k where l k and u k are the lower and upper bounds of the kth element of the solution x i k in this research the enhanced opposition based learning eobl is implemented to improve the position of the best so far solution at each iteration the scheme of the eobl is presented as if rand a n max round a m 1 for i 1 to n select randomly the solution xr 5 f 2 r a n d 1 2 exp m m if r a n d 0 5 z l u x best x obl x best f r a n d rand z x best 23 else z l u x r 5 x obl x r 5 f r a n d rand z x r 5 24 end if f x obl f x best x best x obl end end end where a a chaotic sine map a s i n π a in mathematical sciences the chaotic maps are regarded as the randomness sources alatas et al 2009 a chaotic map can search all regions in the space with respect to its formulation in a determined range m is a constant number where m n in this study m equals 20 x r 5 is a random member of the population which is selected within the range 1 n the eobl is used when the condition rand a is met this operator is repeated n times at each iteration the parameter n can be changed according to its formula max r o u n d a m 1 to calculate the obl position x obl in this study two strategies are employed in the first strategy an efficient obl is used to calculate the solution x obl based on the best solution x best with a random behavior as expressed in eq 23 in the second strategy the x obl is achieved by using a random solution x r 5 eq 24 finally if the value of the objective function solution x obl f x obl is better than its corresponding value for the solution x best f x best the solution x best is replaced by x obl x best x obl the pseudo code of the meisa algorithm is described in table 1 3 evaluating the meisa performance to verify the performance of the meisa in solving complex problems 14 benchmark test functions are considered the main characteristics of these functions are listed in tables 2 and 3 the test functions f 1 to f 6 are unimodal while the test functions f 7 to f 14 are multimodal the unimodal and multimodal functions are used to evaluate the local and global search capabilities respectively mirjalili and lewis 2016 in addition to verify the performance of the proposed meisa seven other optimization methods i e isa misa woa iwoa hslso cs and aso are selected as the contestant optimization methods the population size and total number of iterations for all the optimization methods are 50 and 500 respectively each benchmark function is optimized over 30 different runs by using five optimization algorithms to obtain enough runs for performing the statistical analyses the values of control parameters for the five methods are listed in table 4 table 4 presents the statistical results obtained by the eight optimization methods over 30 runs for all the test functions according to table 5 the best and worst values of the objective function and its average obtained by the meisa are superior to those obtained by other optimization algorithms for instance the best 0 00e 00 the worst 0 00e 00 the average 0 00e 00 and the standard deviation 0 00e 00 values of the objective function over 30 runs obtained by the meisa for the test function f 1 are better than the other optimizers in addition the standard deviation achieved by the meisa is more suitable than the other methods from table 5 it can be inferred that the meisa can provide highly promising efficiency in exploring the global optima and the obtained optimal results are more reliable than those of other optimization methods as a result the proposed meisa has the high capability to carry out the local and global search this is due to the coupled mechanisms of the exploitation and exploration in the meisa leading the optimization method towards the global optima the friedman test derrac et al 2011 as a well known statistical test is also utilized to further evaluate the outstanding efficiency among all the optimization methods table 6 indicates the individual and average ranks calculated by the meisa and other evolutionary algorithms as given in table 6 results of the friedman test indicate that the meisa has the highest level of efficiency table 7 includes the average ranks the statistics and the p values calculated by the friedman test according to the p values for unimodal and multimodal functions the p value is equal to 2 81e 05 and 5 37e 06 respectively there is a notable difference among the eight optimization methods on the other hand the results indicate that the meisa can outperform all optimizers the high efficiency of the meisa is due to its effective composition and mirror operators as well as its eobl operator which enhance the local and global search capability and promote the convergence rate fig 3 compares the convergence curves calculated by the meisa and the other methods from fig 3 it can be noticed that all the optimization methods start from almost the same value of the objective function for all the test functions as illustrated in fig 3 the meisa has a faster convergence rate and a better precision than the misa woa iwoa hslso cs isa and aso methods this behavior shows that the meisa can provide a favorable balance between the exploration and exploitation therefore it can be concluded that the meisa can be effectively used to solve complex optimization problems with superior results and convincing convergence speed finally a scalability analysis is employed to evaluate the effect of dimension on the results of the proposed meisa algorithm this analysis is performed to reveal the effect of dimensions on the solution qualities for the meisa algorithm to indicate its performance for optimizing not only the low dimensional problems but also the high dimensional tasks in this regard the meisa is employed to deal with all the scalable test functions with 30 100 200 500 and 1000 dimensions these cases are performed by using the meisa misa isa woa iwoa cs hslso and aso algorithms over 30 different runs and 500 iterations after that the friedman test is utilized to evaluate the performance of each optimizer with different dimensions fig 4 illustrates the scalability results for all optimizers as shown in fig 4 the meisa can represent superior results in all dimensions and its efficiency is consistently excellent when it is applied to solve the problems with many variables 4 evaluation of the meisa algorithm on the real world case studies in this section two real world case studies including the balaroud reservoir system and the zohre river system in iran are applied to evaluate the performance of the proposed meisa algorithm and extract optimal operating rules for under study reservoir systems 4 1 case study 1 in this study the first real case study is the balaroud reservoir in iran this case study is a single reservoir system which is used to extract the optimal operating 2 dimensional hedging rules by applying the meisa misa hslso iwoa isa cs aso and woa algorithms the geographic location of the balaruod reservoir is 33 15 n and 48 30 e the main purpose of this case study is to supply the water for the agriculture and minimum flow demands the minimum and maximum volumes of reservoir storage are 0 3 and 91 5 million cubic meters mcm respectively fig 5 depicts the monthly inflow into the reservoir system and the system demands the optimization of the balaroud reservoir is performed over a 25 year simulation period beginning in 1980 4 1 1 results of the first case study for the first real world case study of the balaroud reservoir system the proposed 2d hedging rule with 36 decision variables i e h g l m l a c and m l m f l 1 2 12 are optimized by the under study optimization models the control parameter values regulated for the five optimization algorithms are reported in table 4 the statistical results of under study optimization algorithms i e the best the average the worst and the standard deviation are presented in table 8 according to table 8 the proposed meisa can provide highly promising and competitive results compared with the other optimizers moreover the values of the best 8 25 the average 8 40 the worst 8 68 and the sd 0 10 objective function obtained by the proposed optimization algorithm are better than those acquired by the other optimization methods it is noted that the average efficiency of the meisa 8 40 is smaller better than the best efficiency of the other optimization algorithms additionally it is essential to specify the reliability and sustainability of the meisa over all the runs in this regard the boxplots are employed to indicate a clear statistical visualization of the convergence behavior fig 6 depicts the boxplots for the meisa and the other optimization algorithms these plots are calculated based on the final results produced by the eight optimization techniques over 30 different runs the upper and lower lines of each boxplot indicate respectively the maximum and minimum values of the objective function obtained over 30 runs for each optimizer in addition the line inside each boxplot represents the median value of the objective function over 30 runs from fig 6 we can see that the meisa yields more suitable results in terms of the maximum minimum and median values of objective function this means that these statistical values are very close to each other in comparison with those given by other optimization algorithms this confirms that the meisa is highly accurate and reliable to achieve the best solution compared with the other algorithms over 30 runs from these results it can be concluded that the superior performance of the proposed algorithm is intrinsically due to the powerful operators i e the composition the mirror and the eobl operators provided in the algorithm these operators can balance the exploration and exploitation in addition to this the adaptive parameter f is capable of creating a smooth transition from exploration to exploitation the eobl operator can also assist the proposed meisa in improving the best solution and convergence speed fig 7 displays the convergence curves of all the optimization algorithms in fig 7 it is seen that the meisa converges slowly from initial iterations to middle ones moreover as the number of iterations increase the proposed algorithm converges more quickly to the best solution as compared with the other optimization algorithms this behavior is due to the powerful local and global search capability provided in the meisa which can make a suitable balance between the local search and the global search one of the main goals of this study is to optimize the hedging rules as operating policies in the balaroud reservoir system generally the hedging policies can decrease the effect of severe drought periods in this regard the present study develops a 2 dimensional hedging rule as an operating release rule to mitigate severe shortages for the balaroud reservoir system in iran this policy was coupled with different optimization algorithms after that the proposed policy evaluates the capabilities of optimization algorithms in mitigating severe drought periods fig 8 shows the maximum values of the msi during the failure years it is clearly observed from fig 8 that the meisa can significantly reduce the maximum values of the msi compared with the other optimization algorithms fig 9 demonstrates the variations of the maximum minimum and average volumes of reservoir release and reservoir storage for the balaroud reservoir system corresponding to the best efficiency of the meisa it is inferred from fig 9 that the physical constraints of the balaroud reservoir are satisfied 4 2 case study 2 in this study the zohre river system is considered as a real world case study in the southwest of iran with an area of about 15 460 km2 fig 10 displays the map of selected study area in this paper as depicted in fig 11 the water supply of the zohre river consists of three reservoirs including the kosar reservoir the kheirabad reservoir and the chamshir reservoir k k c multi reservoir system the main purposes of the kosar and kheirabad reservoirs are to supply water for the agricultural uses the minimum flow and the public demands whereas the chief aim of the chamshir reservoir is to supply water for agricultural uses and minimum flow demands the characteristics of under study reservoirs are reported in table 9 fig 12 displays the monthly inflow into the multi reservoir system and the monthly system demands the monthly inflow data recorded over a 52 year period beginning in 1956 is utilized to simulate the operation of the three reservoirs according to fig 12 the system experiences severe drought periods from 1958 to 1966 4 2 1 results of the second case study for the real world case study of the k k c multi reservoir system the proposed 2d hedging rule consisting of 132 decision variables 48 variables for the kosar reservoir i e h g l m l a c m l m f and m l p l 1 2 12 48 variables for the kheirabad reservoir i e h g l m l a c m l m f and m l p l 1 2 12 and 36 variables for the chamshir reservoir i e h g l m l a c m l m f l 1 2 12 are optimized by the meisa misa isa hslso woa iwoa cs and aso it is worth noting that the weighting coefficients w 1 w 2 and w 3 are respectively 1 2 1 3 and 1 6 the control parameter values of all optimization methods are listed in table 3 table 10 indicates the statistical results calculated by the meisa additionally the efficiency of the meisa is compared with other optimizers the best the average the worst and the standard deviation sd efficiencies obtained by all the optimization algorithms for the k k c multi reservoir problem are reported in table 10 it can be inferred from table 10 that the effectiveness of the proposed meisa is superior to the other under study optimization algorithms in addition the meisa has yielded more favorable statistical benchmarks i e the best 4 46 average 4 68 worst 4 89 and sd 0 11 performances in fact the statistical results obtained by the meisa are approximately lower than those obtained by other optimizers it should be noted that the worst performance 4 89 by the proposed algorithm is better than the best performance obtained by hslso 4 99 misa 5 29 iwoa 12 85 isa 7 28 woa 13 87 cs 7 19 and aso 9 19 fig 13 depicts the convergence curves of eight optimization algorithms from fig 13 it can be clearly observed that the meisa converges to the best solution more quickly than the aso cs misa hslso isa iwoa and woa this superior performance is due to the robust local and global search capability implemented in the meisa which can create an appropriate balance between the local search and the global one besides the adaptive parameter can create a suitable and smooth transition from the global search to the local search to show the sustainability of the meisa the boxplots are used as highly convincing statistical visualization metrics fig 14 displays the boxplots for the multi reservoir problem where the final output generated by the meisa and other optimization algorithms are presented in fig 14 it is obviously seen that the meisa provides the best results where the maximum the minimum and the median are much closer to each other in comparison with those given by other optimization algorithms according to fig 14 variation of distribution pattern related to the fitness values over 30 runs indicate that the meisa had the highest level of performance followed by the hslso misa isa cs aso iwoa and woa respectively as mentioned before this study develops a 2 dimensional hedging rule to decrease the impact of severe drought periods for a multi reservoir system in iran the proposed hedging policy was coupled with various optimization algorithms in order to optimize the operation of the k k c multi reservoir system fig 15 illustrates the maximum values of the msi for each year of the simulation period moreover fig 15 indicates that in the failure years the effectiveness of the meisa regarding the maximum values of the msi for each year are obviously better than the other seven optimization algorithms because its shortages in the failure years are significantly on the decline this is due to the superior global optimization capability and the precise solution of the meisa additionally fig 16 shows that the meisa can significantly reduce the maximum values of the msi compared with the other optimizers fig 16 depicts the monthly distributions of water deficits created by under study algorithms for the multi reservoir system over the entire simulation period in fig 16 the darker and whiter cells respectively demonstrate the larger and smaller values of shortages based on fig 16 it can be seen that the maximum values of shortage created by the meisa are smaller than those created by the other optimizers this confirms the superior efficiency of the proposed optimizer in managing multi reservoir systems the suitable efficiency of the meisa is due to the proposed composition mirror and eobl operators in this algorithm that can balance the exploration and exploitation search and avoid local solutions fig 17 shows variation of the maximum minimum and average volumes of reservoir release and storage for under study reservoir systems in terms of the best performance of the meisa algorithm as shown in fig 17 it can be found that the physical constraints of the multi reservoir system were met 5 discussion in the previous sections the meisa algorithm was shown to outperform the other optimizers i e the hslso misa iwoa isa woa cs and woa and its original isa algorithm under three phases 1 14 test functions 2 a single reservoir system and 3 a multi reservoir system the main reason lies in the modification of the isa operators i e composition and mirror operators and two added mechanisms the crossover operator and the eobl to this algorithm where the improved composition and mirror operators can effectively increase the global and local search capability in addition the crossover operator can assist the proposed algorithm to enhance the diversity of the population the eobl is also implemented to better search for the best solution and find more promising solutions the results showed that the proposed meisa can efficiently solve complex mathematical test functions besides the results of single and multi reservoir systems confirmed the high capacity of the meisa in optimizing the parameters of the hedging rule so that it can effectively mitigate the severity of drought periods finally the potential limitations of this study should also be stated firstly implementing the new mechanisms to any optimization algorithm improves the convergence speed and accuracy but increases the cost of computation especially in a complex system with a large number of variables to address this shortcoming a parallel technology with high efficiency in computing can be a good suggestion secondly despite the fact that the proposed algorithm has a very good performance according to the no free lunch nfl theorem wolpert and macready 1997 this optimizer may not solve all complex problems of water resources systems efficiently 6 conclusion in this study a novel metaheuristic optimization algorithm called multi mechanism ensemble interior search algorithm meisa is introduced to resolve problems associated with the mathematical test functions and the optimization of hedging rules for single and multi reservoir systems three main operators i e the proposed composition and mirror operators and the eobl were developed and mathematically formulated in the meisa to implement the global and local search steps the composition operator used the two scaled differential vectors to explore promising regions furthermore an adaptive parameter was applied for transition from global search to local search the mirror operator created a new solution using the combination of the best solution at each iteration and the best solution from among all the iterations to locally search for the solution space the eobl operator was also implemented to improve the best so far solution the efficiency of the meisa was assessed using several unimodal and multimodal test functions the superior performance of the proposed meisa on unimodal test functions indicated its high capability in local search also suitable efficiency of the meisa on the multimodal test function can be associated with the global search utilized in the composition operator which can explore the promising areas in the search space to evaluate the ability of the meisa on the real world optimization problems two single and multi reservoir systems in iran were considered to operate the reservoir systems the 2 dimensional hedging rule was developed and optimized as an operating policy using the meisa misa hslso iwoa isa cs aso and woa algorithms the statistical results reveal that the sustainability and reliability level given by the meisa are more convincing in comparison with those obtained by other optimization algorithms for instance the average performance of the meisa 4 68 is better than the hslso 5 90 misa 6 41 iwoa 17 33 isa 9 48 woa 18 22 cs 12 45 and woa 14 90 in the case of the multi reservoir system the results of case studies demonstrated that the proposed meisa coupled with the 2 dimensional hedging rule was more efficient at mitigating the severe drought periods in comparison with the other optimization methods from the statistical results it was found that the meisa had a high potential of enhancing accuracy level and convergence speed for real world optimization problems with high non linearity and dimensionality compared with other optimization algorithms the meisa provided more robust results for optimizing multi reservoir systems and extracting optimal hedging rules with the aim of reducing severe drought periods for future studies several directions are recommended to extend the applications of the meisa in different fields of engineering for instance various maps on the global and local search of the meisa can be investigated to enhance the performance of the proposed optimizer in optimizing multi reservoir systems also the meisa can be utilized to solve optimization problems in multi objective reservoirs finally the proposed meisa can be used to optimize

4522,the operating rules especially the hedging rules which are known as useful tools for effective utilization of water from reservoir systems are commonly applied for managing reservoir systems in severe drought periods extracting optimal operation policies for multi reservoir systems is a challenging issue due to their non linear large scale and stochastic nature therefore improving optimization techniques is a worthy effort in developing the operating rules for multi reservoir systems hence this research aimed to develop an efficient optimization method called multi mechanism ensemble interior search algorithm meisa to tackle various problems in the optimal management of reservoir systems the meisa promotes the two main operators of the interior search algorithm isa i e the composition and the mirror operators to enhance the capability of global and local search besides the proposed algorithm employs an enhanced opposition based learning eobl operator to improve the best solution and increase the convergence speed the meisa also uses an adaptive parameter to balance the global and local search in the proposed algorithm the results of several test functions demonstrate that the meisa outperforms other optimizers in terms of the solution accuracy the quality and the convergence rate finally the results of optimizing the hedging rules for two real world

1 introduction dams and reservoirs assist in economic progress by ensuring water supply producing power and managing river flows since the effect of the operation on the economy or the society is unavoidable extracting reservoir operation rules is imperative for managing water resource systems during the past decades deriving reservoir operating rules has been a challenging issue for managers of water resources systems ahmadianfar et al 2016 in the case of water supply uses a large number of methodologies in terms of different rules simulations and optimization techniques have been introduced to optimize the operations the two most widely used policies related to the reservoir operation are the standard operation policy sop and the hedging rule guo et al 2012 based on the sop the release is done to the extent that the demand is maximally met stedinger 1984 with respect to this definition the sop retains only the surplus water for the future consumptions ahmadianfar et al 2016 guo et al 2012 shiau 2009 taghian et al 2013 notwithstanding the sop needs to be improved during drought periods shiau 2009 shiau and lee 2005 the extended and severe droughts occur as climatic phenomena and their incidences are unavoidable wilhite 2012 therefore extracting suitable operation rules for managing reservoirs during drought periods are highly essential to reduce the destructive effects caused by the droughts the hedging rule is the most popular policy for reservoir management during droughts which saves the water in the reservoir during the normal periods and uses the water efficiently to reduce the effects of severe droughts ahmadianfar et al 2016 tu et al 2008 shih and revelle shih and revelle 1994 1995 introduced the hedging policy as an operation policy to deal with severe drought periods shih and revelle 1994 1995 shiau and lee shiau and lee 2005 developed a two point hedging rule with two parameters namely the starting water availability swa and the ending water availability ewa to minimize shortage for a reservoir system in taiwan shiau and lee 2005 additionally celeste and billib celeste and billib 2009 presented a two dimensional 2 d hedging rule with two controlling parameters the first parameter hdg determines the start time of the hedging and the second parameter m is applied for the calibration of the release rule celeste and billib 2009 moreover the researchers successfully applied this type of hedging rule to minimize the vulnerability index for a reservoir system in brazil tan et al tan et al 2017 developed a two point hedging rule by embedding the damage depth parameter in the hedging rule tan et al 2017 they applied this policy to decrease the maximum shortage over a long term period for a multi reservoir system in china as

their results indicated the superior ability of the a depso in optimizing multi reservoir systems ahmadianfar et al 2020a 2020b the multi reservoir problems are the most challenging optimization problems to solve in the field of water resources systems xia et al 2019 typically such problems include nonlinear objective functions with a large number of decision variables and constraints kuriqi et al 2019 2020 suwal et al 2020a 2020b water resources planners and analysts explore to find appropriate optimization methods for reservoir operation systems hence finding efficient and reliable optimization techniques is an essential issue moms are introduced as the most frequently applied techniques for optimizing reservoir systems regarding their proven powerful ability to find global

heidari et al 2019 however these methods still need more enhancements to present robust and effective optimization algorithms for solving complex optimization problems moms have several intrinsic advantages and drawbacks for instance previous attempts have proved that reducing the convergence speed of the performance of evolutionary algorithms depends on how some control parameters are set holland 1975 chen et al 2020 xu et al 2019 xu and chen 2014 zhao et al 2021 occasionally the aforementioned algorithms suffer from trapping in local optima and premature convergence in solving complex problems kumar et al 2017 yu et al 2020 2021 tu et al 2021 shan et al 2020 however the inertia search algorithm isa is applied efficiently in solving complicated optimization problems gandomi 2014 the main operators of this algorithm are the composition and the mirror operators while the former creates a solution using a random walk to yield a better view the latter is the mirror method in which the mirror is in the middle of each solution and the best solution obtained so far is utilized to create a new solution gandomi 2014 in the current research to further develop the isa the operators of the proposed algorithm are modified by some efficient mechanisms including local and global search methods these mechanisms improve the global search to explore the promising regions using some differential random vectors and combining those with the best solution also the proposed meisa uses a robust local search operator to find better solutions and conduct the solutions toward the best global solution an adaptive parameter is used to create a suitable transit from global search to local search the proposed mechanisms and the adaptive parameter assist the proposed algorithm to make a fast convergence rate and escape from local optimal solutions in this study the capabilities of meisa to explore near global optimal solutions in non linear multi modal and non convex multi reservoir operation optimization problems are evaluated deriving optimal operating rules for multi reservoir systems is inevitable because these rules help the managers of water resources systems to better manage the water release from the reservoir in different conditions such as droughts or wet periods therefore the main goal of this study is to create a novel framework for optimal release rule that would provide a guideline to efficiently fulfill the operation of multi reservoir systems the hedging rule is employed for the formulation of the release rule 2 methodology 2 1 modeling a multi reservoir system in the present research an effective hedging rule is developed to determine the release rules for a multi reservoir system generally the hedging policy prevents severe shortage in the future by accepting small shortages in the present period draper and lund 2004 in this study the two dimensional hedging rule introduced by celeste and billib 2009 is used as the operating release rule for a multi reservoir system in iran according to this type of hedging policy the reservoir release is specified based on a nonlinear function that creates a relationship between the reservoir release r t and the three parameters of demand d t reservoir storage v t and inflow to reservoir i t at each time step the most important parameters in the hedging policy are the time and amount of rationing which are determined by the current reservoir storage and reservoir inflow regarding the 2d hedging when the combination of reservoir storage and reservoir inflow v t v min 2 i t 2 is less than the hedging parameter hg l the hedge is started in this case the amount of the released water is determined by a non linear function fig 1 displays the 2 dimensional hedging rule in details the formulation of the 2d hedging policy is described as follows 1 calculating the reservoir release when the hedging occurs 1 r t n d t n v t n v min n 2 i t n 2 hg l n u l n i f v t n v min n 2 i t n 2 hg l n 2 calculating the reservoir release when v t n v min n 2 i t n 2 is bigger than hg l n 2 r t n d t n i f v t n v min n 2 i t n 2 hg l n where hg l n is the setting parameter of the hedging policy for each month l 1 2 12 v min n is the minimum volume of the nth reservoir storage at period t and u l n is the parameter of regression in eq 1 within the range ahmadianfar et al 2016 therefore the main decision variables in the 2d hedging policy are hg l n and u l n the constraints for these parameters are expressed as hg l n 0 3 0 u l n 1 the continuity equation which is used to extract the reservoir release and storage during each period is expressed as 4 v t 1 n v t n i t n r t n e t n s p i l l t n t 1 2 t n 1 2 3 where v t n and v t 1 n are the volumes of nth reservoir storage during periods t and t 1 respectively i t n is the volume of the inflow into nth reservoir at period t e t n is the volume of evaporation for nth reservoir during period t and spill t n is the volume of spill from nth reservoir during period t to calculate spill t n and e t n eqs 5 6 are defined as bozorg haddad et al 2016 2014 5 spill t n v t n i t n r t n e t n v max n i f v t n i t n r t n e t

calculated based on the relationship curve between the reservoir area and its reservoir storage to describe the lower and upper bounds of the reservoir storage and release the physical constraints of the multi reservoir system are considered eqs 7 and 8 define such constrains in this study 7 v min n v t n v max n t 1 2 t n 1 2 3 8 0 r t n d t n t 1 2 t n 1 2 3 where v max n and t are the maximum volume of the nth reservoir storage and the total number of periods respectively 2 2 the hedging policy coupled with the optimization method in this research a novel optimization method namely multi mechanism ensemble interior search algorithm meisa is linked to the hedging policy to extract optimal hedging parameters the proposed method is called the 2d hedging meisa the monthly hedging parameters hg l n and u l n are generated by the proposed meisa for the given hedging parameters the reservoir operation model based on the 2d hedging rule simulates the multi reservoir system and allocates water to the different demands after that the results obtained by the reservoir operation model is employed to compute the objective function for the meisa this procedure is performed for each iteration and repeated until the termination criteria of the meisa is met the schematic of the proposed 2d hedging meisa is depicted in fig 2 2 2 1 objective function in the proposed 2d hedging meisa minimizing water shortage can be considered as the objective function for the water supply in the multi reservoir system accordingly an efficient shortage index is needed to specify the water shortage characteristics from a comprehensive view to make the objective function of the proposed model the modified shortage index msi introduced by hsu and cheng hsu and cheng 2002 hsu and cheng 2002 is used as the criterion to find the optimal hedging rules moreover msi is defined as 9 msi 100 t n 1 3 t 1 t r t n d t n d t n 2 this index can be employed for minimizing the total shortage of the various demands as 10 minimizeof w 1 msi ac w 2 msi mf w 3 m s i p where of is the objective function msi ac msi mf and msi p are the agriculture the minimum flow and the public demands respectively in this study the public demands are the municipal and industrial demands w 1 w 2 and w 3 are the weighting coefficients for the msi types these coefficients are used to determine the hierarchy of the msi for different kinds of water demands the values of weighting coefficients are commonly specified by the individual s judgments based on the importance of each objective in the entire system 2 3 simulation optimization steps the main aim of the simulation optimization method is to extract optimal operating rules of the multi reservoir system for different water supply demands in this section the main steps of the simulation optimization model are described step 1 create randomly the decision variables of the proposed hedging rule hg l n and u l n by the meisa algorithm step 2 obtain the water release of the multi reservoir system utilizing the 2d hedging policy for each month t eqs 1 and 2 step 3 calculate the reservoir storage using the continuity equation eq 4 at period t 1 step 4 if the current time period t is less than the total number of operation period t then t t 1 and you need to go to step 2 otherwise go to step 5 step 5 evaluate the objective function of step 6 if the termination condition is satisfied the optimal operating rules are presented otherwise the new decision variables of hedging policy are calculated by the meisa operators and you need to go to step 2 2 4 optimization method an effective method to provide a suitable operating rule is utilizing the optimization simulation model in this study the meisa is used to extract the optimal hedging rule for the multi reservoir system several benchmark test functions introduced as commonly employed in the literature ahmadianfar et al 2020a 2020b 2019ab are used in this research to compare the performance of the meisa with those of the isa the modified interior search algorithm misa kumar et al 2017 the improved whale optimization algorithm iwoa hu et al 2017 the hybridizing sum local search optimizer hslso ghasemi et al 2016 44 the whale optimization algorithm woa mirjalili and lewis 2016 the cukcoo search cs gandomi et al 2013 and the atom search optimization aso zhao et al 2019 for this purpose the proposed meisa is firstly introduced in the following sections 2 4 1 interior search algorithm isa the interior search algorithm isa is a meta heuristic optimization method which has a high potential in solving linear and non linear engineering problems gandomi 2014 this algorithm simulates the behavior of an interior designer and decorator gandomi 2014 the main operators of the isa are the composition and the mirror operators the composition is applied to a global search in the feasible space and changes the element solution compositions to achieve better views better objective functions which is utilized for the exploration stage in the mirror operator some mirrors are used to generate more decorative places according to this operator the mirrors are placed close to the most beautiful elements this mechanism can be applied in the optimization process by placing several mirrors near the fittest elements the best solution to obtain other beautiful views the details of the isa are explained in the following steps step 1 the position of each element x i k m is randomly generated using eq 11 and then their values of the objective function f x i k m is calculated as 11 x i k m l u l r a n d 1 i 1 2 n k 1 2 d where l and u are the lower and upper bound respectively rand 1 is a random value within the range ahmadianfar et al 2016 and n and d are the population and the dimension size respectively step 2 the best value of the objective function fittest element x b e s t k m at the mth iteration is determined in the case of a minimization problem the position x b e s t k m has the minimum value step 3 other elements are divided into two parts i e composition and mirror parts using a dynamic parameter α m m where m is the number of iterations and m is the maximum number of iterations if rand α the new element position is generated using the mirror part otherwise the new element is created by the composition part step 4 in the composition part the position of each element can randomly change using the following equation 12 x n e w k m x m i n k m x m a x k m x m i n k m rand 2 where x m i n k m and x m a x k m are the minimum and maximum bounds of the composition part elements in the mth iteration and rand 2 is a random value within the range ahmadianfar et al 2016 step 5 to generate a new element in the mirror part a mirror is randomly located between the current element and the best one best position at each iteration accordingly the position of a mirror can be formulated as follows 13 x m i r r o r k m rand 3 x i k m 1 rand 3 x l b e s t k m where rand 3 is a random value within the range ahmadianfar et al 2016 and x l b e s t k m is the best solution achieved at each iteration the position of the new element is calculated using the position of the mirror as 14 x n e w k m 2 x m i r r o r k m x i k m step 6 for the local search the position of the best solution slightly changes according to the following equation 15 x l b e s t k m x l b e s t k m r a n d n λ where randn is a normally distributed random value and λ is a coefficient which is defined as follows 16 λ 0 01 u l 2 5 multi mechanism ensemble interior search algorithm meisa in this sub section the multi mechanism ensemble interior search algorithm meisa is developed in details the meisa improved the efficiency of the original isa algorithm which has some weaknesses like trapping in local positions low convergence speed and relative imbalance in transition from the exploration to exploitation therefore this research presents some mechanisms to overcome these drawbacks by using two mechanisms 1 enhancing the composition and the mirror operators and 2 assigning an adaptive parameter for smooth transition from global search to local search the main mechanisms of the meisa algorithm are described in detail in the following sections 2 5 1 the proposed composition operator in the isa the composition operator is applied to global search to obtain further improvement of the operators a novel mechanism is considered to create the proposed mechanism four solutions x r 1 x r 2 x r 3 and x r 4 are randomly selected from the members of the population it is noteworthy that x r 1 is extracted from the top 100u members in the population at each iteration and u 0 1 the proposed composition operator uses the two differential vectors x r 1 x r 3 and xp i x r 4 to create the solution u k 17 u k x r 2 f x r 1 x r 3 0 5 f xp i x r 4 where xp i is the best so far solution achieved for the ith member of the population r 2 r 3 and r 4 are the three random integer numbers r 2 r 3 r 4 i which are extracted from the range of 1 n and f is an adaptive parameter which can be defined as 17 1 f 2 r a n d 1 2 e x p m m in the early iterations parameter f has a large value to search the entire solution space whereas small values of f enhance the local search and move toward the best solution in the last iterations 2 5 2 the proposed mirror operator the mirror operator uses a mirror near the best solution to obtain a favorable solution in this study to reach further promotion of the mirror operator three solutions x i k m x l b e s t k m and x b e s t k m are applied the following scheme defines the proposed mirror operator 18 x m i r r o r k m ρ 1 x i k m 1 ρ 1 ρ 2 x l b e s t k m 1 ρ 2 x b e s t k m where ρ 1 and ρ 2 are two random values within the range ahmadianfar et al 2016 the position of solution u i k is achieved using the position of the mirror updated position is expressed as 19 u i k 2 x m i r r o r k m x i k m as mentioned before the new position is generated from the composition operator or the mirror operator to specify that the new solution is created by using the composition or the mirror operator a dynamic parameter α is employed which is expressed in section 2 4 1 2 5 3 the proposed local search in this section a new local search strategy is developed to increase the diversity of the population and the convergence speed as mentioned in the basic isa the local search uses the best solution x l b e s t k m found in each iteration and changes its position to achieve a better solution to reach this goal the new solution is created based on either of the two random solutions selected from between the member of the population x r 2 m and x r 3 m and a weighted difference vector u l λ the solution u i k is calculated as 20 u i k x l b e s t k m r a n d n u l r a n d x r 2 m x r 3 m λ i f r a n d 0 5 x l b e s t k m r a n d n u l λ o t h e r w i s e the proposed local search is calculated based on two mathematical formulations in the first formula it uses the two solutions x r 2 m and x r 3 m and a weighted difference vector wdf based on the lower and upper bounds of the solution space the second formula employs only the wdf these two formulas are applied to create the solution u i k using a constant parameter 0 5 if rand 0 5 the new solution is generated using the first formula otherwise the second formula is used 2 5 4 the crossover operator in this research to boost the diversity of the population the crossover operator is implemented by combining the elements of solutions u i k y k and xp i k in the meisa a new solution based on the crossover operator is generated by the following scheme for k 1 to d if rand cr or k krand if rand 0 5 x new k 0 5 u i k y k else xnew k ui k 21 end else xnew k xpi k end end in which 21 1 y j x r 1 r a n d x r 2 x r 3 0 5 r a n d x i x r 4 ω i f r a n d α x r 2 r a n d x r 1 x r 3 0 5 r a n d x i x r 4 ω o t h e r w i s e where k rand is an integer randomly number in the range of 1 d which allows that at least one element to be employed from the u i k or 0 5 u i k y k and y k is a new vector generated based on the two weighted differential vectors based on eq 21 1 there are two formulations to specify the y k the first formulation uses the x r 1 with the purpose of moving toward a promising region this formula has the highest chance of performing in the final iterations the second formula is applied to perform global search in the early iterations based on the dynamic parameter α ω is a dynamic coefficient which is expressed as an exponential function i e 2 e x p m m c r is used to refer to the crossover rate which is defined as 21 2 c r 0 5 0 1 r a n d n 2 5 5 enhanced opposition based learning eobl operator the opposition based learning obl was first brought up by rahnamayan et al 2008 the obl is implemented to generate an opposite estimation of the current solution to find promising regions in the solution space for solution x i its opposite solution z can be expressed as 22 z k l k u k x i k where l k and u k are the lower and upper bounds of the kth element of the solution x i k in this research the enhanced opposition based learning eobl is implemented to improve the position of the best so far solution at each iteration the scheme of the eobl is presented as if rand a n max round a m 1 for i 1 to n select randomly the solution xr 5 f 2 r a n d 1 2 exp m m if r a n d 0 5 z l u x best x obl x best f r a n d rand z x best 23 else z l u x r 5 x obl x r 5 f r a n d rand z x r 5 24 end if f x obl f x best x best x obl end end end where a a chaotic sine map a s i n π a in mathematical sciences the chaotic maps are regarded as the randomness sources alatas et al 2009 a chaotic map can search all regions in the space with respect to its formulation in a determined range m is a constant number where m n in this study m equals 20 x r 5 is a random member of the population which is selected within the range 1 n the eobl is used when the condition rand a is met this operator is repeated n times at each iteration the parameter n can be changed according to its formula max r o u n d a m 1 to calculate the obl position x obl in this study two strategies are employed in the first strategy an efficient obl is used to calculate the solution x obl based on the best solution x best with a random behavior as expressed in eq 23 in the second strategy the x obl is achieved by using a random solution x r 5 eq 24 finally if the value of the objective function solution x obl f x obl is better than its corresponding value for the solution x best f x best the solution x best is replaced by x obl x best x obl the pseudo code of the meisa algorithm is described in table 1 3 evaluating the meisa performance to verify the performance of the meisa in solving complex problems 14 benchmark test functions are considered the main characteristics of these functions are listed in tables 2 and 3 the test functions f 1 to f 6 are unimodal while the test functions f 7 to f 14 are multimodal the unimodal and multimodal functions are used to evaluate the local and global search capabilities respectively mirjalili and lewis 2016 in addition to verify the performance of the proposed meisa seven other optimization methods i e isa misa woa iwoa hslso cs and aso are selected as the contestant optimization methods the population size and total number of iterations for all the optimization methods are 50 and 500 respectively each benchmark function is optimized over 30 different runs by using five optimization algorithms to obtain enough runs for performing the statistical analyses the values of control parameters for the five methods are listed in table 4 table 4 presents the statistical results obtained by the eight optimization methods over 30 runs for all the test functions according to table 5 the best and worst values of the objective function and its average obtained by the meisa are superior to those obtained by other optimization algorithms for instance the best 0 00e 00 the worst 0 00e 00 the average 0 00e 00 and the standard deviation 0 00e 00 values of the objective function over 30 runs obtained by the meisa for the test function f 1 are better than the other optimizers in addition the standard deviation achieved by the meisa is more suitable than the other methods from table 5 it can be inferred that the meisa can provide highly promising efficiency in exploring the global optima and the obtained optimal results are more reliable than those of other optimization methods as a result the proposed meisa has the high capability to carry out the local and global search this is due to the coupled mechanisms of the exploitation and exploration in the meisa leading the optimization method towards the global optima the friedman test derrac et al 2011 as a well known statistical test is also utilized to further evaluate the outstanding efficiency among all the optimization methods table 6 indicates the individual and average ranks calculated by the meisa and other evolutionary algorithms as given in table 6 results of the friedman test indicate that the meisa has the highest level of efficiency table 7 includes the average ranks the statistics and the p values calculated by the friedman test according to the p values for unimodal and multimodal functions the p value is equal to 2 81e 05 and 5 37e 06 respectively there is a notable difference among the eight optimization methods on the other hand the results indicate that the meisa can outperform all optimizers the high efficiency of the meisa is due to its effective composition and mirror operators as well as its eobl operator which enhance the local and global search capability and promote the convergence rate fig 3 compares the convergence curves calculated by the meisa and the other methods from fig 3 it can be noticed that all the optimization methods start from almost the same value of the objective function for all the test functions as illustrated in fig 3 the meisa has a faster convergence rate and a better precision than the misa woa iwoa hslso cs isa and aso methods this behavior shows that the meisa can provide a favorable balance between the exploration and exploitation therefore it can be concluded that the meisa can be effectively used to solve complex optimization problems with superior results and convincing convergence speed finally a scalability analysis is employed to evaluate the effect of dimension on the results of the proposed meisa algorithm this analysis is performed to reveal the effect of dimensions on the solution qualities for the meisa algorithm to indicate its performance for optimizing not only the low dimensional problems but also the high dimensional tasks in this regard the meisa is employed to deal with all the scalable test functions with 30 100 200 500 and 1000 dimensions these cases are performed by using the meisa misa isa woa iwoa cs hslso and aso algorithms over 30 different runs and 500 iterations after that the friedman test is utilized to evaluate the performance of each optimizer with different dimensions fig 4 illustrates the scalability results for all optimizers as shown in fig 4 the meisa can represent superior results in all dimensions and its efficiency is consistently excellent when it is applied to solve the problems with many variables 4 evaluation of the meisa algorithm on the real world case studies in this section two real world case studies including the balaroud reservoir system and the zohre river system in iran are applied to evaluate the performance of the proposed meisa algorithm and extract optimal operating rules for under study reservoir systems 4 1 case study 1 in this study the first real case study is the balaroud reservoir in iran this case study is a single reservoir system which is used to extract the optimal operating 2 dimensional hedging rules by applying the meisa misa hslso iwoa isa cs aso and woa algorithms the geographic location of the balaruod reservoir is 33 15 n and 48 30 e the main purpose of this case study is to supply the water for the agriculture and minimum flow demands the minimum and maximum volumes of reservoir storage are 0 3 and 91 5 million cubic meters mcm respectively fig 5 depicts the monthly inflow into the reservoir system and the system demands the optimization of the balaroud reservoir is performed over a 25 year simulation period beginning in 1980 4 1 1 results of the first case study for the first real world case study of the balaroud reservoir system the proposed 2d hedging rule with 36 decision variables i e h g l m l a c and m l m f l 1 2 12 are optimized by the under study optimization models the control parameter values regulated for the five optimization algorithms are reported in table 4 the statistical results of under study optimization algorithms i e the best the average the worst and the standard deviation are presented in table 8 according to table 8 the proposed meisa can provide highly promising and competitive results compared with the other optimizers moreover the values of the best 8 25 the average 8 40 the worst 8 68 and the sd 0 10 objective function obtained by the proposed optimization algorithm are better than those acquired by the other optimization methods it is noted that the average efficiency of the meisa 8 40 is smaller better than the best efficiency of the other optimization algorithms additionally it is essential to specify the reliability and sustainability of the meisa over all the runs in this regard the boxplots are employed to indicate a clear statistical visualization of the convergence behavior fig 6 depicts the boxplots for the meisa and the other optimization algorithms these plots are calculated based on the final results produced by the eight optimization techniques over 30 different runs the upper and lower lines of each boxplot indicate respectively the maximum and minimum values of the objective function obtained over 30 runs for each optimizer in addition the line inside each boxplot represents the median value of the objective function over 30 runs from fig 6 we can see that the meisa yields more suitable results in terms of the maximum minimum and median values of objective function this means that these statistical values are very close to each other in comparison with those given by other optimization algorithms this confirms that the meisa is highly accurate and reliable to achieve the best solution compared with the other algorithms over 30 runs from these results it can be concluded that the superior performance of the proposed algorithm is intrinsically due to the powerful operators i e the composition the mirror and the eobl operators provided in the algorithm these operators can balance the exploration and exploitation in addition to this the adaptive parameter f is capable of creating a smooth transition from exploration to exploitation the eobl operator can also assist the proposed meisa in improving the best solution and convergence speed fig 7 displays the convergence curves of all the optimization algorithms in fig 7 it is seen that the meisa converges slowly from initial iterations to middle ones moreover as the number of iterations increase the proposed algorithm converges more quickly to the best solution as compared with the other optimization algorithms this behavior is due to the powerful local and global search capability provided in the meisa which can make a suitable balance between the local search and the global search one of the main goals of this study is to optimize the hedging rules as operating policies in the balaroud reservoir system generally the hedging policies can decrease the effect of severe drought periods in this regard the present study develops a 2 dimensional hedging rule as an operating release rule to mitigate severe shortages for the balaroud reservoir system in iran this policy was coupled with different optimization algorithms after that the proposed policy evaluates the capabilities of optimization algorithms in mitigating severe drought periods fig 8 shows the maximum values of the msi during the failure years it is clearly observed from fig 8 that the meisa can significantly reduce the maximum values of the msi compared with the other optimization algorithms fig 9 demonstrates the variations of the maximum minimum and average volumes of reservoir release and reservoir storage for the balaroud reservoir system corresponding to the best efficiency of the meisa it is inferred from fig 9 that the physical constraints of the balaroud reservoir are satisfied 4 2 case study 2 in this study the zohre river system is considered as a real world case study in the southwest of iran with an area of about 15 460 km2 fig 10 displays the map of selected study area in this paper as depicted in fig 11 the water supply of the zohre river consists of three reservoirs including the kosar reservoir the kheirabad reservoir and the chamshir reservoir k k c multi reservoir system the main purposes of the kosar and kheirabad reservoirs are to supply water for the agricultural uses the minimum flow and the public demands whereas the chief aim of the chamshir reservoir is to supply water for agricultural uses and minimum flow demands the characteristics of under study reservoirs are reported in table 9 fig 12 displays the monthly inflow into the multi reservoir system and the monthly system demands the monthly inflow data recorded over a 52 year period beginning in 1956 is utilized to simulate the operation of the three reservoirs according to fig 12 the system experiences severe drought periods from 1958 to 1966 4 2 1 results of the second case study for the real world case study of the k k c multi reservoir system the proposed 2d

coefficients w 1 w 2 and w 3 are respectively 1 2 1 3 and 1 6 the control parameter values of all optimization methods are listed in table 3 table 10 indicates the statistical results calculated by the meisa additionally the efficiency of the meisa is compared with other optimizers the best the average the worst and the standard deviation sd efficiencies obtained by all the optimization algorithms for the k k c multi reservoir problem are reported in table 10 it can be inferred from table 10 that the effectiveness of the proposed meisa is superior to the other under study optimization algorithms in addition the meisa has yielded more favorable statistical benchmarks i e the best 4 46 average 4 68 worst 4 89 and sd 0 11 performances in fact the statistical results obtained by the meisa are approximately lower than those obtained by other optimizers it should be noted that the worst performance 4 89 by the proposed algorithm is better than the best performance obtained by hslso 4 99 misa 5 29 iwoa 12 85 isa 7 28 woa 13 87 cs 7 19 and aso 9 19 fig 13 depicts the convergence curves of eight optimization algorithms from fig 13 it can be clearly observed that the meisa converges to the best solution more quickly than the aso cs misa hslso isa iwoa and woa this superior performance is due to the robust local and global search capability implemented in the meisa which can create an appropriate balance between the local search and the global one besides the adaptive parameter can create a suitable and smooth transition from the global search to the local search to show the sustainability of the meisa the boxplots are used as highly convincing statistical visualization metrics fig 14 displays the boxplots for the multi reservoir problem where the final output generated by the meisa and other optimization algorithms are presented in fig 14 it is obviously seen that the meisa provides the best results where the maximum the minimum and the median are much closer to each other in comparison with those given by other optimization algorithms according to fig 14 variation of distribution pattern related to the fitness values over 30 runs indicate that the meisa had the highest level of performance followed by the hslso misa isa cs aso iwoa and woa respectively as mentioned before this study develops a 2 dimensional hedging rule to decrease the impact of severe drought periods for a multi reservoir system in iran the proposed hedging policy was coupled with various optimization algorithms in order to optimize the operation of the k k c multi reservoir system fig 15 illustrates the maximum values of the msi for each year of the simulation period moreover fig 15 indicates that in the failure years the effectiveness of the meisa regarding the maximum values of the msi for each year are obviously better than the other seven optimization algorithms because its shortages in the failure years are significantly on the decline this is due to the superior global optimization capability and the precise solution of the meisa additionally fig 16 shows that the meisa can significantly reduce the maximum values of the msi compared with the other optimizers fig 16 depicts the monthly distributions of water deficits created by under study algorithms for the multi reservoir system over the entire simulation period in fig 16 the darker and whiter cells respectively demonstrate the larger and smaller values of shortages based on fig 16 it can be seen that the maximum values of shortage created by the meisa are smaller than those created by the other optimizers this confirms the superior efficiency of the proposed optimizer in managing multi reservoir systems the suitable efficiency of the meisa is due to the proposed composition mirror and eobl operators in this algorithm that can balance the exploration and exploitation search and avoid local solutions fig 17 shows variation of the maximum minimum and average volumes of reservoir release and storage for under study reservoir systems in terms of the best performance of the meisa algorithm as shown in fig 17 it can be found that the physical constraints of the multi reservoir system were met 5 discussion in the previous sections the meisa algorithm was shown to outperform the other optimizers i e the hslso misa iwoa isa woa cs and woa and its original isa algorithm under three phases 1 14 test functions 2 a single reservoir system and 3 a multi reservoir system the main reason lies in the modification of the isa operators i e composition and mirror operators and two added mechanisms the crossover operator and the eobl to this algorithm where the improved composition and mirror operators can effectively increase the global and local search capability in addition the crossover operator can assist the proposed algorithm to enhance the diversity of the population the eobl is also implemented to better search for the best solution and find more promising solutions the results showed that the proposed meisa can efficiently solve complex mathematical test functions besides the results of single and multi reservoir systems confirmed the high capacity of the meisa in optimizing the parameters of the hedging rule so that it can effectively mitigate the severity of drought periods finally the potential limitations of this study should also be stated firstly implementing the new mechanisms to any optimization algorithm improves the convergence speed and accuracy but increases the cost of computation especially in a complex system with a large number of variables to address this shortcoming a parallel technology with high efficiency in computing can be a good suggestion secondly despite the fact that the proposed algorithm has a very good performance according to the no free lunch nfl theorem wolpert and macready 1997 this optimizer may not solve all complex problems of water resources systems efficiently 6 conclusion in this study a novel metaheuristic optimization algorithm called multi mechanism ensemble interior search algorithm meisa is introduced to resolve problems associated with the mathematical test functions and the optimization of hedging rules for single and multi reservoir systems three main operators i e the proposed composition and mirror operators and the eobl were developed and mathematically formulated in the meisa to implement the global and local search steps the composition operator used the two scaled differential vectors to explore promising regions furthermore an adaptive parameter was applied for transition from global search to local search the mirror operator created a new solution using the combination of the best solution at each iteration and the best solution from among all the iterations to locally search for the solution space the eobl operator was also implemented to improve the best so far solution the efficiency of the meisa was assessed using several unimodal and multimodal test functions the superior performance of the proposed meisa on unimodal test functions indicated its high capability in local search also suitable efficiency of the meisa on the multimodal test function can be associated with the global search utilized in the composition operator which can explore the promising areas in the search space to evaluate the ability of the meisa on the real world optimization problems two single and multi reservoir systems in iran were considered to operate the reservoir systems the 2 dimensional hedging rule was developed and optimized as an operating policy using the meisa misa hslso iwoa isa cs aso and woa algorithms the statistical results reveal that the sustainability and reliability level given by the meisa are more convincing in comparison with those obtained by other optimization algorithms for instance the average performance of the meisa 4 68 is better than the hslso 5 90 misa 6 41 iwoa 17 33 isa 9 48 woa 18 22 cs 12 45 and woa 14 90 in the case of the multi reservoir system the results of case studies demonstrated that the proposed meisa coupled with the 2 dimensional hedging rule was more efficient at mitigating the severe drought periods in comparison with the other optimization methods from the statistical results it was found that the meisa had a high potential of enhancing accuracy level and convergence speed for real world optimization problems with high non linearity and dimensionality compared with other optimization algorithms the meisa provided more robust results for optimizing multi reservoir systems and extracting optimal hedging rules with the aim of reducing severe drought periods for future studies several directions are recommended to extend the applications of the meisa in different fields of engineering for instance various maps on the global and local search of the meisa can be investigated to enhance the performance of the proposed optimizer in optimizing multi reservoir systems also the meisa can be utilized to solve optimization problems in multi objective reservoirs finally the proposed meisa can be used to optimize

4523,drought threatens both social and economic development and it is necessary to develop a comprehensive drought index and a method of predicting future drought occurrence to enable effective associated management and warnings however barring a few current drought indexes are not comprehensive for example they ignore the ability to recover from drought and drought prediction does not consider spatial and temporal characteristics in this study the sustainability index si which considers reliability resilience and vulnerability was used to identify agricultural drought and the cellular automata markov ca markov was used in drought prediction in order to reflect the characteristics of crop water deficit in agricultural drought this paper uses the permanent wilting point pwp as the threshold droughts are defined as soil moisture pwp the results of si from 1951 to 2015 in china showed that the drought was most severe in the western northwest wnw region the drought was mild in the south s southwest sw and tibet regions and the drought was relatively severe in the north n eastern northwest enw and northeast ne regions the mann kendall test was used to characterize si trends over the past 65 years drought in the northern wnw and tibet regions significantly improved whereas that in the southern sw n and eastern ne regions intensified the prediction of drought occurrence for 2016 2020 and 2021 2025 using the ca markov showed that overall drought in china will be alleviated the si and ca markov adopted in this study could be used in the identification and prediction of agricultural drought or other drought categories and could be used in local drought management keywords drought sustainability index ca markov spatio temporal trend 1 introduction drought can be defined as a lower than usual amount of precipitation occurring within an area over a prolonged time period and it is characterized by a sustained water deficit mishra and singh 2010 over the past few decades droughts have caused significant damage globally and reduced crop production hao et al 2018 notable droughts include the california drought from 2012 to 2015 griffin and anchukaitis 2014 kwon and lall 2016 the east african drought from 2010 to 2011 dutra et al 2013 the amazon drought in 2010 lewis et al 2011 and the southwestern china drought in 2012 tang et al 2014 since droughts can have a long duration months to years a high intensity and a wide range of impacts they are the most costly and widespread natural disasters asong et al 2018 in order to strengthen drought management and reduce losses it is important to develop a comprehensive drought index to characterize the features of different droughts to develop a method to predict where droughts may occur and to formulate effective drought management policies and early warning systems drought is generally classified into four categories meteorological hydrological agricultural and socioeconomic american meteorological society 2004 and short respective definitions are as follows meteorological drought is a sustained water scarcity phenomenon caused by insufficient precipitation hydrological drought is determined by inadequate amounts of surface and subsurface water to meet demands agricultural drought is the phenomenon of reduced crop yields caused by inadequate soil moisture and socio economic drought occurs when the water supply is unable to meet the water demand within a social water resource system mishra and singh 2010 to monitor drought and enable associated warnings a number of different indexes and prediction methods have been developed and the indexes of different drought categories are shown in table 1 early drought indexes considered mainly univariate indicators whereas those compiled later consider multivariate indicators for example the spei considers both precipitation and evaporation however most drought indexes essentially reflect a drought in the form of water scarcity below the average level and are unable to fully describe the complex characteristics of drought and its broad impacts thus studies have investigated the use of different drought properties and have proposed indexes that reflect drought characteristics such as duration intensity and severity mishra and singh 2010 hao and singh 2015 for example zhao et al 2020 calculated the drought intensity in northeast china based on the modified nested copula model and spi they obtained the temporal and spatial characteristics of the drought intensity center in the region and provided a method for effectively predicting drought events yang et al 2018 used the sc pdsi self calibrating palmer drought severity index to quantify drought duration and severity in northwest china and used the joint probability of the marginal distributions of drought duration and severity to comprehensively assess drought risk borgomeo et al 2015 proposed a vulnerability based method to test the response of water resource systems to intense and persistent drought conditions and applied the method to the london water supply system to determine when strict water use restrictions will be required the results showed that the vulnerability based approach can benefit water management decision making during a drought mehran et al 2015 considered local resilience and societal capacity to respond or adapt to droughts and established the multivariate standardized reliability and resilience index msrri to evaluate droughts in australia and california which can provide supplementary information for local drought development and recovery maity et al 2013 referred to three indexes reliability vulnerability and resilience which were used to assess the risk of water resource systems and adopted the joint distribution of the three indexes resilience drought management index dmi to characterize droughts and evaluate drought propensity in india chanda et al 2014 and the world chanda and maity 2017 in general while it is insufficient to analyze the drought effect based on a single drought feature reliability vulnerability and resilience can be used together to evaluate drought risk reliability reflects the frequency of drought occurrence vulnerability reflects the destructive effect of drought and resilience reflects the ability of a region to recover from drought the reliability vulnerability and resilience indexes were combined into the sustainability index si sandoval solis et al 2011 to comprehensively identify the characteristics of drought the si has been used in the assessment of basin water resource management de o vieira and sandoval solis 2018 the si summarizes the different indexes can determine the essential and desired sustainable characteristics of a region and can show the adaptive capacity of a region therefore the si was used in this study to reflect the comprehensive characteristics of regional droughts to prevent and manage future drought episodes it is necessary to develop a method that enables the effective prediction of drought the future si can be predicted by methods based on statistical models and common statistical drought prediction methods include autoregressive integrated moving average arima rao and padmanabhan 1984 modarres 2007 artificial neural network ann mishra and desai 2006 morid et al 2007 support vector machine svm ganguli and reddy 2014 and markov chain mc lohani and loganathan 1997 cancelliere et al 2007 most of these methods tend to yield independent prediction results within each study area or hydroclimate record station but they do not convey the spatial correlation of the prediction results within each study area or hydroclimate record station when a station is forecasting a drought the drought status of neighboring stations will not affect the prediction results in this respect statistical methods such as the markov chain model lack knowledge of spatial dependency thus we used the integrated cellular automata markov ca markov for drought prediction for the first time it has previously been applied in land use change prediction rural sustainability development forest management and other fields mondal and southworth 2010 kamusoko et al 2009 xie et al 2020 gao et al 2020 wu et al 2018 markov chain can support the quantitative prediction of drought change without spatial features while a cellular automata ca model can control the spatial dynamics among different drought states based on statistical neighborhoods and transition rules wu et al 2018 therefore the integrated ca markov method was used in this study to predict future spatio temporal variations in drought within china an analysis and summary of the spatio temporal characteristics of past drought episodes can be used to predict possible future drought episodes and enable drought prevention and management china is a drought prone country and agriculture is the worst drought affected sector he et al 2011 thus in this study the si was used to evaluate agricultural drought in this respect soil moisture and the permanent wilting point pwp were used as an analogy for the water supply and water demand within a water resources system respectively as soil moisture below the pwp results in plant wilt which is equivalent to a water deficit in a water resources system the objectives of this study were to 1 develop an index for comprehensively evaluating drought through three dimensions 2 develop a method to predict drought that considers temporal and spatial drought transformation laws and 3 use china as a case study for studying the variability and trends of drought over the past 65 years and predict near future spatio temporal drought characteristics 2 methodology 2 1 computation of reliability resilience vulnerability and sustainability index reliability can be described as the probability of a system being in a satisfactory state hashimoto et al 1982 in other words whether the available water supply meets water demands during periods of simulation the deficit d t i for the ith water user in the tth time period can be described as 1 d t i x target t i x suppled t i 0 if x target t i x suppled t i if x target t i x suppled t i where x target t i represents the soil pwp for the ith location in the tth time period and x suppled t i represents the soil moisture for the ith location in the tth time period for a given time series reliability for the ith location can be computed as 2 rel i lim n 1 n t 1 n z t i where z t i 1 if d t i 0 and z t i 0 if d t i 0 in this respect d t i 0 represents a satisfactory state and d t i 0 represents a failure state furthermore n is the total number of time steps in this study reliability values range from 0 to 1 when reliability is lower the drought frequency is higher if reliability is equal to 0 the region is in a constant state of drought the higher the reliability the lower the drought frequency and when reliability is equal to 1 drought has not occurred in the region resiliency describes how quickly a system is likely to recover or bounce back from failure once failure has occurred hashimoto et al 1982 for a given time series resilience for the ith location is computed as 3 res i lim n t 1 n w t i n lim n t 1 n z t i where w t i indicates a transition from a satisfactory sate to a failure state w t i 1 if d t i 0 and d t 1 i 0 otherwise w t i 0 if for the ith location rel i is 1 then the corresponding res i for the ith location is considered to be 1 resilience values range from 0 to 1 the lower the resilience value the lower the ability of a region to recover from drought therefore it is more prone to continuous drought when a region is continually in drought reliability is 0 and resilience is 0 when resilience is higher the region is better able to recover from drought and is less prone to continuous drought when resilience is equal to 1 there has been no continuous drought in the region or there has been no drought reliability is 1 vulnerability is the likely magnitude of failure if it occurs hashimoto et al 1982 essentially vulnerability expresses the severity of damage caused by a failure event in this study vulnerability is computed as the average failure for a given time series vulnerability for the ith location is computed as 4 vul i lim n t 1 n d t i n lim n t 1 n z t i x target i in this study vulnerability values range from 0 to 1 a higher value indicates that drought is more severe and a vulnerability value equal to 1 indicates that the soil contains almost no water when the vulnerability value is lower the drought is slight and a vulnerability value equal to 0 indicates that no drought has occurred in a region and reliability is 1 a 60 month period 5 year scale is considered to appropriately reflect a long term drought condition please refer to section 5 1 for details the sustainability index si is a summary index that measures the sustainability of water resources systems it incorporates the three performance indicators of reliability resilience and vulnerability and establishes a corresponding index that can be used to assess the sustainability of a water resource system sandoval solis et al 2011 the si generally has two calculation methods an arithmetic average loucks 1997 and a geometric average sandoval solis et al 2011 the arithmetic average has the following advantages 1 its values vary from 0 to 1 which is convenient for comparisons and calculations and 2 if either the reliability or resilience is zero or the vulnerability is one the si is zero in addition to satisfying the above advantages the si values obtained from the geometric average are more practical and intuitive while those from the arithmetic average may be somewhat misleading for example if the reliability resilience and vulnerability of a certain area are all 50 the si calculated using the arithmetic average and geometric average are 13 and 50 respectively therefore this paper uses the geometric average method to calculate the si for a given time series the si for the ith location can be computed as 5 si i rel i res i 1 vul i 1 3 si values range from 0 to 1 a higher value indicates that drought is less severe and it shows that a region has a good drought bearing capacity when the si is equal to 1 reliability resilience and vulnerability are 1 1 and 0 respectively which indicates that no drought has occurred in the region a lower si value indicates that drought is more severe and it shows that the region has a poor drought bearing capacity when the si is equal to 0 either the reliability or resilience are 0 or the vulnerability is 1 which indicates that the region continually experiences drought or that there is almost no water within the soil it is worth noting that based on rrv concept dmi was proposed earlier in 2013 maity et al 2013 although dmi and si are both comprehensive drought indexes based on the rrv concept their construction methods and focus are different dmi uses the copula function to obtain the multivariate distribution of resilience and vulnerability and is a probabilistic drought index it reflects the joint probability distribution between resilience and vulnerability and focusing on describing the statistical characteristics between the two while si represent aggregate indexes of a combination of rrv and is an algebraic drought index as mentioned before it can summarize the performance of rrv through geometric average and for a given si value the range of value for reliability resilience and vulnerability of the area can be determined at the same time the calculation is simple and easy to understand 2 2 computation of permanent wilting point pwp the soil pwp can be estimated based on the harmonized world soil database hwsd according to the regression equations koren et al 2003 the hydraulic soil properties for each usda u s department of agriculture texture class can be computed as campbell 1974 6 θ s 0 00126 f sand 0 489 7 ψ s 7 74 e 0 0302 f sand k p a 8 b 0 159 f clay 2 91 where θ s is saturation moisture content ψ s is saturation matrix potential b is the slope of the campbell s retention curve f sand indicates the percentage of sand and f clay indicates the percentage of clay the values are midpoint values obtained from each textural class cosby et al 1984 using the usda textural triangle wilting point estimates are calculated from campbell s matric water potential function using the parameter values from equations 6 8 as ψ pwp the matric potential at the wilting point is assumed to be 1500 kpa koren et al 2003 the pwp can be computed as 9 θ pwp θ s ψ pwp ψ s 1 b 2 3 ca markov an integrated dynamic ca markov model was applied in this study to predict si state si can be classified into different states according to values changes in the future and the calculation was completed through the idris s ca markov module based on the assumption that drought change is a stochastic process steinemann 2003 the next state of the process p n depends only on its current state p n 1 the general equation of the markov process can be expressed as 10 p n p n 1 p and the markov transition probability matrix can be expressed as 11 p p 11 p 12 p 1 n p 21 p 22 p 2 n p m 1 p m 2 p mn 0 p ij 1 i j 1 2 n j 1 m p ij 1 i 1 2 n where p is the state transition matrix and p ij is the transition probability of si state from j to i for a different si state the ca model is a discontinuous spatiotemporal dynamic simulation model in which time space and state are discrete and complex systems can be generated using simple local rules a ca system usually includes four elements cells cellular space neighborhoods and rules wang et al 2016 and it can be expressed as 12 s t 1 f s t n where s is the finite and discrete state set n is the neighborhood of the cellular space t and t 1 refer to consecutive time steps and f represents the transformation rules of the cellular states in local space in this study based on the existing spatial distribution data of the si and the scale feature of spatial variation a 5 5 neighborhood was adopted 3 data and study area monthly gridded 0 5 l a t 0 5 l o n g soil moisture data in mm from 1951 to 2015 reconstructed by fan and van 2004 were obtained from the climate prediction centre cpc noaa http www esrl noaa gov psd data gridded data cpcsoil html these soil moisture values were estimated using a 1 6 m deep leaky bucket model with an effective water holding capacity of 760 mm and a common porosity of 0 47 the model parameters are assumed to be globally constant van den dool et al 2003 this soil moisture data has also been used in research in india chanda et al 2014 soni and syed 2021 china zeng et al 2019 zhong et al 2019 and the southwestern amazon klarenberg et al 2018 and also in global studies chanda and maity 2017 xin et al 2019 chinese soil properties were obtained from the harmonized world soil database hwsd and the soil type map of china 1 k m 1 k m which is based on data obtained from the office for the second national soil survey of china 1995 and distributed by the institute of soil science in nanjing shi et al 2004 the reference soil depth of all soil units in the hwsd is set at 1000 mm and the physical and chemical characteristics of soil such as the sand fraction clay fraction and usda texture classification can be found in the hwsd as the soil depth in the hwsd differs from that in noaa the pwp and soil moisture were transformed uniformly to the volumetric water content however as the soil type and soil moisture resolutions did not agree the soil type resolution was upscaled to agree with that of soil moisture the predominant soil type within the new resolution grid area of 1 k m 1 k m to 0 5 l a t 0 5 l o n g was considered to be the representative soil type china has 70 different soil types and fig 1 shows only 10 soils that account for nearly 60 of the total soil types in china to conduct a proficient analysis of the results china was divided into seven regions see fig 1 based on soil properties and geographic spatial location 4 results 4 1 pwp in china using the method presented in section 2 and 3 above the ranges of pwp values for the different soil types in china were calculated and a gridded pwp map of china and its distribution is shown in fig 2 the pwp values ranged from 0 04 to 0 29 and nearly 50 of the pwp values ranged from 0 15 to 0 20 over 20 of the pwp values ranged from 0 05 to 0 10 whereas nearly 3 ranged from 0 20 to 0 25 it is evident from fig 2 that locations that are either glaciers water bodies or salt flats do not consider pwp values therefore these locations were excluded from the following computation 4 2 spatio temporal variation in reliability resilience vulnerability within china the study period 1951 2015 was split into 13 five year periods 1951 1955 1956 1960 2011 2015 each five year period comprised 60 months in total as represented by n in section 2 1 the reliability resilience and vulnerability were then calculated for each five year period at each location using eqs 2 3 and 4 respectively fig 3 illustrates the spatio temporal process of drought development based on reliability for 1951 2015 fig 3a b to 3 m are reliability maps for each five year period from 1951 to 1955 until 2011 2015 fig 3n is an average reliability map for the whole term and fig 3o represents the variance in all reliability maps the mann kendall test mann 1945 kendall 1975 and sen s slope sen 1968 were used to characterize reliability resilience vulnerability si trends and quantify the magnitude of such trends over the past 65 years fig 3p shows the mk trend in reliability for 1951 2015 in a similar way fig 4 presents all resilience maps fig 5 presents all vulnerability maps and fig 6 presents all si maps it can be observed from fig 3 that the reliability values in the wnw region were the lowest with an average reliability of 0 06 indicating that most areas of the region were in a constant state of drought the reliability values in the n enw and ne regions were relatively low average 0 5 the reliability values in the s sw and tibet regions were higher average 0 6 among which the reliability values in the s and sw regions were the highest with an average reliability of 0 85 indicating that most areas in these regions rarely suffered from drought it can be seen from fig 3n that the distribution of reliability values in the tibet n and enw regions were relatively uneven as evident from fig 3o reliability shows dramatic fluctuations in the northern wnw tibet ne southern enw and n regions fig 3p and 3q show an increased trend in wnw and tibet over the past 65 years which indicates that drought in these regions is easing and the average sen s slopes in the wnw and tibet regions were 0 002 and 0 003 respectively a decreasing trend in the sw n and ne regions over the past 65 years is evident which indicates that drought in these regions is exacerbating and the average sen s slopes in the sw n and ne regions were 0 003 0 006 and 0 006 respectively it can be observed from fig 4 that the resilience values in the wnw region were the highest with an average reliability of 0 03 indicating that most areas of the region had a low ability to recover from drought and were more prone to continuous drought the resilience values in the n enw and ne regions were relatively low average 0 3 the resilience values in the s sw and tibet regions were higher average 0 5 among which the resilience values in the sw region were the highest with an average resilience of 0 64 indicating that most areas in the region had a greater ability to recover from drought and were less prone to continuous drought it can be seen from fig 4n that except for the wnw region the distribution of resilience values was relatively uneven as evident from fig 4o resilience showed dramatic fluctuations in the tibet sw and s regions while from fig 4p and q resilience showed an increasing trend in the wnw and tibet regions over the past 65 years the average sen s slopes in the wnw and tibet regions were 0 001 and 0 002 respectively there was a decreasing trend in the sw n and ne regions over the past 65 years and the average sen s slopes in the sw n and ne regions were 0 005 0 003 and 0 002 respectively it can be observed from fig 5 that the vulnerability values in the wnw region were the highest with an average vulnerability of 0 7 indicating that most areas in the region suffered severe drought the vulnerability values in the enw region were the second highest with an average vulnerability of 0 35 the average vulnerability values in other regions were all 0 2 among which the vulnerability values in the s and sw regions were the lowest with an average vulnerability of 0 02 indicating that most areas of these regions have suffered a very slight drought it can be seen from fig 5n that the wnw and enw regions had uneven distributions of vulnerability while the distributions of vulnerability in other regions were relatively even as evident from fig 5o vulnerability showed dramatic fluctuations in northern tibet while from fig 5p and 5q a decreasing trend in the wnw and tibet regions over the past 65 years is evident the average sen s slopes in the wnw and tibet regions were 0 005 and 0 001 respectively an increasing trend in the sw n and ne regions over the past 65 years was evident and the average sen s slopes of the sw n and ne regions were 0 001 0 003 and 0 002 respectively 4 3 spatio temporal variations in si and associated trend within china it can be observed from fig 6 that the si values in the wnw region were the lowest with an average si of 0 05 indicating that most areas of the region had a poor drought bearing capacity the si values in the n enw and ne regions were relatively low average 0 5 the si in the s sw and tibet regions were higher average 0 6 among which the si values in the sw region were the highest with an average si of 0 78 indicating that most areas of the regions rarely suffered from drought it can be seen from fig 6n that the distribution of si values in the tibet n and enw regions were relatively uneven fig 6p and 6q shows the mk trend of the si during 1951 2015 it can be seen that in the n ne and sw regions the si showed a significant decreasing trend which means that agricultural drought in these regions is intensifying and in the northern wnw and tibet regions the si shows a significant increasing trend which indicates that agricultural drought in this region is being mitigated according to yu et al 2014 s research the annual precipitation from 1951 to 2010 presented significant downward trend in east of china n ne and sw regions and presented significant upward trend in western china northern wnw and tibet regions therefore the change of precipitation is an important reason for the intensify or alleviation of drought in these regions in the n and ne regions which correspond to the north china plain and the northeast china plain groundwater is the main source for industry and agriculture in order to maintain rapid social and economic development these regions rely on over exploiting groundwater since the 1970s shen 2015 and the long term over exploitation of groundwater will aggravate the drought qin et al 2015 furthermore enso el nino southern oscillation events can weaken the intensity of the walker circulation which would also cause frequent drought in northern china wang et al 2020 in the northern wnw and tibet regions in addition to the increase in precipitation the increase in temperature also played a role in alleviating drought in northern wnw region the melting of glaciers and snow will increase local runoff cao et al 2021 and in tibet region permafrost degradation caused by climate warming will increase soil moisture wu et al 2021 however it should be noted that the drought mitigation brought about by climate warming mentioned above is not sustainable the drought identification based on the si is consistent with results of other studies that analyzed the spatio temporal trend of drought in all or part of china using the meteorological drought index agricultural drought index or other originality indexes zhang et al 2015 discovered a wetting tendency in northern xinjiang northern wnw region through using reof rotated empirical orthogonal functions and the mk test based on meteorological station data obtained from 1961 to 2008 in xinjiang province yang et al 2018 identified wet conditions in north xinjiang northern wnw region and on the qiangtang plateau northern tibet region using the northwest china monthly average sc pdsi self calibrating palmer drought severity index in addition yu et al 2014 analyzed the spei from 1951 to 2010 in china and found that persistent multi year severe droughts appeared more frequently in north china and northeast china n and ne region chen and sun 2015 also analyzed the spei from 1961 to 2012 in china and found the occurrence of increasingly severe and more frequent drought in northern china furthermore xu et al 2015 analyzed the drought frequency in southwestern china sw region from 1961 to 2012 by constructing a regional drought frequency analysis model and they found that the worst drought in recent decades had occurred in 2009 2010 liu et al 2017 studied the drought trend in southwestern china based on sc pdsi from 1959 to 2013 and found that drought had become more widespread over the past decades sun et al 2016 calculated the spei in southwest china from 1971 to 2012 and found that the spatial extent duration and intensity of droughts during the 2000s were generally stronger than those in the 1980s and 1990s as the si presents similar results to those presented in the above studies it can thus be used to reflect the drought situation in china the si incorporates reliability resilience and vulnerability and is thus better able to characterize drought characteristics than when using a single metric many different locations may have similar values of reliability or resilience but the different si values can represent significantly different droughts for example fig 7 a illustrates the change in si with different resilience and vulnerability values during 2011 2015 whereas reliability ranged only from 0 4 to 0 5 it can be seen that even different points with similar values of reliability may reflect different drought situations and the si can better evaluate the characteristics of vulnerability and resilience corresponding to this region fig 7b illustrates the various si values corresponding to different reliability resilience and vulnerability values during 2011 2015 it is observed that as the si increases the reliability increases in a logarithmic tendency resilience increases in an exponential tendency and vulnerability decreases in a logarithmic tendency a higher si guarantees that a region has a higher capacity to deal with drought even in a drought a region can recover from a drought quickly with minimal damage conversely for low si regions it is important to focus on strengthening drought guarantee because droughts are more destructive and the region is more prone to continuous drought after the drought occurs in other words if a drought occurs the damage to a low si area may be more serious 4 4 prediction of si to enable the si to be more easily predicted its values within china were classified into 12 classes 0 00 0 00 0 10 0 10 0 20 0 20 0 30 0 30 0 40 0 40 0 50 0 50 0 60 0 60 0 70 0 70 0 80 0 80 0 90 0 90 1 00 and 1 00 respectively where for example 0 20 belongs in the 0 10 0 20 class 0 21 belongs in the 0 20 0 30 class and 0 00 and 1 00 are both individual classes according to the ca markov the past behavior of si can be used to estimate the near future drought propensity of a region kappa coefficients congalton 1991 were calculated to compare the accuracy between predicted and actual si values and when the kappa coefficients were between 0 00 and 0 40 0 41 0 60 0 61 0 80 and 0 81 1 00 the performance was poor to fair moderate substantial and excellent respectively in order to test whether ca markov can accurately predict si starting from the prediction of si values for 1961 1965 using the si values from 1951 to 1955 and 1956 1960 to 2011 2015 predicted si values were compared with actual si values and the kappa coefficients were calculated as shown in fig 8 a the average kappa coefficient was 0 678 which indicates substantial consistency between the predicted and actual si values therefore the ca markov with one step ahead prediction can accurately predict the future liu et al 2009 found that the prediction performance of markov chain models is related to forecasting steps small steps result in good performance therefore the prediction performances of one step ahead predictions for example using 2001 2005 and 2006 2010 to predict 2011 2015 two step ahead predictions for example using 1996 2000 and 2001 2005 to predict 2011 2015 three step ahead predictions for example using 1991 1995 and 1996 2000 to predict 2011 2015 and four step ahead predictions for example using 1986 1990 and 1991 1995 to predict 2011 2015 were compared predicted si values were compared with actual si values and the results are shown in fig 8b as the step increased the accuracy of the prediction decreased the average kappa coefficients of one and two step ahead predictions were higher than 0 6 indicating substantial consistency between the predicted and actual si values conversely the kappa coefficients of the three and four step ahead predictions were lower than 0 6 indicating moderate prediction performance therefore the si values for 2016 2020 one step ahead prediction and 2021 2025 two step ahead prediction were predicted using ca markov fig 9 illustrates the predicted si values for 2016 2020 a and 2021 2025 b the overall si for 2016 2020 and 2021 2025 increased compared with the si for 2011 2015 additionally the si for 2021 2025 increased compared with that for 2016 2020 indicating that china s drought will be alleviated in the future there were differences in the changes in si among the different regions the si in the wnw n enw and ne regions were projected to increase in the future indicating that the drought will be alleviated the si in the s region was projected to decrease in the future indicating that the drought will intensify and there were no projected changes in si in the sw and tibet regions indicating that the drought will maintain the status quo during 2021 2025 the sw region was projected to have a high drought bearing capacity with a regional average si of 0 8 while the wnw region was projected to have the worst drought but the regional average si value was projected to increase to 0 15 5 discussion 5 1 sensitive analysis to assess the sensitivity of different lengths of time as represented by n in section 2 1 to si we conducted 200 calculations since there are a total of 4083 grids in china and the characteristics of the si differ among regions we randomly selected 408 grids for each calculation which is 10 of the total number of grids we calculated the si of each grid under different lengths of time 0 5 and 1 to 9 yr in order to obtain the appropriate length of time under which the si is stable and with a suitable time resolution we calculated the coefficient of variation cv defined as the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean of the si to reflect the degree of si fluctuation under different lengths of time the average cv of the si of each calculation grey line and the average cv of the si across all 200 calculations red line are shown in fig 10 the results show that with an increase in the length of time the average cv of the si follows a clear downward trend the cv change ratio was used to reflect the change in cv with increasing length of time for location a the cv change ratio under length of time t is cr cv t c v 0 5 c v t c v 0 5 c v 9 where cr cv t is the cv change ratio under t and cv t is the average cv of the si under t therefore the cv change ratio represents the change in cv under t relative to the change in cv under all lengths of time the cv change ratio is shown in fig 10 blue dotted line and the average cv of the si and cv change ratio under different lengths of time is shown in table 2 when the length of time was 5 yr the cv change ratio was 89 3 therefore the average cv of the si can be considered stable when the length of time is 5 yr therefore this paper uses 5 yr as the length of time for calculations this is also consistent with the length of time for calculations used by maity et al 2013 in calculating the drought management index dmi they found that 5 yr was the minimum length of time under which a relatively stable dmi could be determined 5 2 uncertain analysis agricultural drought has been classified as insufficient precipitation in an area within a particular time scale resulting in a soil moisture deficit that limits water supply to crops which in turn reduces crop yields sepulcre canto et al 2012 the agricultural drought indexes listed in table 1 except for the vci kogan 1995 are related to soil moisture this study used the pwp and soil moisture to evaluate whether or not an agricultural drought had occurred in a region for simplicity only two drought states were considered whether or not soil moisture was below the pwp compared with other indexes such as smai bergman et al 1988 and csm huang et al 1996 which only use soil moisture the incorporation of pwp in this study more directly reflects crop water deficit in agricultural drought however crop water uptake is reduced well before the pwp is reached martínez fernández et al 2015 which means the si cannot reflect a drought in which soil water moisture is only slightly greater than pwp therefore agricultural drought will be underestimated to a certain extent conversely a reliable agricultural drought index requires proper consideration of crop types crop growth root development soil characteristics and antecedent soil moisture conditions zeng et al 1998 narasimhan and srinivasan 2005 yang et al 2017 however because it is difficult to obtain the above data for large scale and long term series this paper only uses the pwp based on soil properties as a criterion for drought identification if the information above could be considered then the accuracy of the si in reflecting agricultural drought could be improved it should be noted that there are still uncertainties with drought predictions based on ca markov mainly in two aspects long term prediction and changing environment according to the results of this paper when ca markov is used for predictions as the forecasting time increases such as from a one step ahead to a four step ahead prediction the accuracy of the prediction becomes lower in order to ensure the accuracy of the prediction this paper only uses one step ahead and two step ahead predictions for analysis this is similar to other studies and is because of the inherent chaotic nature of the atmosphere lavers et al 2009 yuan et al 2011 and the fact that drought is affected by precipitation temperature sea surface temperature sst el nino southern oscillation enso and other factors núñez et al 2014 asadi zarch et al 2015 trenberth and fasullo 2012 piechota and dracup 1996 jaranilla sanchez et al 2011 making long term prediction of drought difficult with climate change such as global warming and human activities such as emissions of greenhouse gases land use change etc meteorological variables such as humidity temperature evaporation and the water cycle process will be changed huntington 2006 milly et al 2008 for example the increase in temperature will increase the water holding capacity and evaporation into the atmosphere resulting in extreme precipitation changes prudhomme et al 2014 thus the changing environment brings challenges to the prediction of future droughts ca markov is based on statistical methods for drought prediction and statistical methods rely on the relationship between predictors in historical records which are generally assumed to be stationary hao et al 2018 therefore if historical records cannot reflect nonstationary features the prediction results may be biased schepen et al 2012 smith et al 2012 further work needs to be done to strengthen predictions such as improve existing statistical methods to incorporate nonstationary features for drought prediction 6 conclusion in this paper the si based on reliability resilience vulnerability indicators was used to analyze the spatio temporal variation of drought and the ca markov was used to predict drought in the near future from the results presented in this study the following conclusions can be made 1 the si is shown to be advantageous for use in analyzing china agricultural drought characteristics it evaluates drought through the three dimensions of reliability vulnerability and resilience and it not only reflects the frequency destructive effect and the ability of a region to recover from drought but it can also distinguish the difference in drought between different regions that have similar values of reliability or resilience therefore it provides results that are significant for use in local drought management 2 the spatio temporal variation and trends in si in china are quite different and the distribution of si values in the tibet n and enw regions were relatively uneven the si values were lowest in the wnw region with an average si of 0 05 but they were quite high in the s sw and tibet regions with an average si of 0 78 the si values in the n enw and ne regions were relatively low and the average si in these regions were all 0 5 the si in the northern wnw and tibet regions showed a significant increasing trend but a significant decreasing trend was evident in the southern sw n and eastern ne regions 3 a comparison with the actual results shows that the prediction using the ca markov provides a good fit using the markov chain model the spatial features of cellular automata enable an improved spatial drought prediction to be made combined with the practicability of the si its use provides considerable benefits in enabling future drought warning and prevention the prediction of si during 2016 2020 and 2021 2025 shows that the overall si value in china will increase compared to the values during 2011 2015 which means that drought will improve

4523,drought threatens both social and economic development and it is necessary to develop a comprehensive drought index and a method of predicting future drought occurrence to enable effective associated management and warnings however barring a few current drought indexes are not comprehensive for example they ignore the ability to recover from drought and drought prediction does not consider spatial and temporal characteristics in this study the sustainability index si which considers reliability resilience and vulnerability was used to identify agricultural drought and the cellular automata markov ca markov was used in drought prediction in order to reflect the characteristics of crop water deficit in agricultural drought this paper uses the permanent wilting point pwp as the threshold droughts are defined as soil moisture pwp the results of si from 1951 to 2015 in china showed that the drought was most severe in the western northwest wnw region the drought was mild in the south s southwest sw and tibet regions and the drought was relatively severe in the north n eastern northwest enw and northeast ne regions the mann kendall test was used to characterize si trends over the past 65 years drought in the northern wnw and tibet regions significantly improved whereas that in the southern sw n and eastern ne regions intensified the prediction of drought occurrence for 2016 2020 and 2021 2025 using the ca markov showed that overall drought in china will be alleviated the si and ca markov adopted in this study could be used in the identification and prediction of agricultural drought or other drought categories and could be used in local drought management keywords drought sustainability index ca markov spatio temporal trend 1 introduction drought can be defined as a lower than usual amount of precipitation occurring within an area over a prolonged time period and it is characterized by a sustained water deficit mishra and singh 2010 over the past few decades droughts have caused significant damage globally and reduced crop production hao et al 2018 notable droughts include the california drought from 2012 to 2015 griffin and anchukaitis 2014 kwon and lall 2016 the east african drought from 2010 to 2011 dutra et al 2013 the amazon drought in 2010 lewis et al 2011 and the southwestern china drought in 2012 tang et al 2014 since droughts can have a long duration months to years a high intensity and a wide range of impacts they are the most costly and widespread natural disasters asong et al 2018 in order to strengthen drought management and reduce losses it is important to develop a comprehensive drought index to characterize the features of different droughts to develop a method to predict where droughts may occur and to formulate effective drought management policies and early warning systems drought is generally classified into four categories meteorological hydrological agricultural and socioeconomic american meteorological society 2004 and short respective definitions are as follows meteorological drought is a sustained water scarcity phenomenon caused by insufficient precipitation hydrological drought is determined by inadequate amounts of surface and subsurface water to meet demands agricultural drought is the phenomenon of reduced crop yields caused by inadequate soil moisture and socio economic drought occurs when the water supply is unable to meet the water demand within a social water resource system mishra and singh 2010 to monitor drought and enable associated warnings a number of different indexes and prediction methods have been developed and the indexes of different drought categories are shown in table 1 early drought indexes considered mainly univariate indicators whereas those compiled later consider multivariate indicators for example the spei considers both precipitation and evaporation however most drought indexes essentially reflect a drought in the form of water scarcity below the average level and are unable to fully describe the complex characteristics of drought and its broad impacts thus studies have investigated the use of different drought properties and have proposed indexes that reflect drought characteristics such as duration intensity and severity mishra and singh 2010 hao and singh 2015 for example zhao et al 2020 calculated the drought intensity in northeast china based on the modified nested copula model and spi they obtained the temporal and spatial characteristics of the drought intensity center in the region and provided a method for effectively predicting drought events yang et al 2018 used the sc pdsi self calibrating palmer drought severity index to quantify drought duration and severity in northwest china and used the joint probability of the marginal distributions of drought duration and severity to comprehensively assess drought risk borgomeo et al 2015 proposed a vulnerability based method to test the response of water resource systems to intense and persistent drought conditions and applied the method to the london water supply system to determine when strict water use restrictions will be required the results showed that the vulnerability based approach can benefit water management decision making during a drought mehran et al 2015 considered local resilience and societal capacity to respond or adapt to droughts and established the multivariate standardized reliability and resilience index msrri to evaluate droughts in australia and california which can provide supplementary information for local drought development and recovery maity et al 2013 referred to three indexes reliability vulnerability and resilience which were used to assess the risk of water resource systems and adopted the joint distribution of the three indexes resilience drought management index dmi to characterize droughts and evaluate drought propensity in india chanda et al 2014 and the world chanda and maity 2017 in general while it is insufficient to analyze the drought effect based on a single drought feature reliability vulnerability and resilience can be used together to evaluate drought risk reliability reflects the frequency of drought occurrence vulnerability reflects the destructive effect of drought and resilience reflects the ability of a region to recover from drought the reliability vulnerability and resilience indexes were combined into the sustainability index si sandoval solis et al 2011 to comprehensively identify the characteristics of drought the si has been used in the assessment of basin water resource management de o vieira and sandoval solis 2018 the si summarizes the different indexes can determine the essential and desired sustainable characteristics of a region and can show the adaptive capacity of a region therefore the si was used in this study to reflect the comprehensive characteristics of regional droughts to prevent and manage future drought episodes it is necessary to develop a method that enables the effective prediction of drought the future si can be predicted by methods based on statistical models and common statistical drought prediction methods include autoregressive integrated moving average arima rao and padmanabhan 1984 modarres 2007 artificial neural network ann mishra and desai 2006 morid et al 2007 support vector machine svm ganguli and reddy 2014 and markov chain mc lohani and loganathan 1997 cancelliere et al 2007 most of these methods tend to yield independent prediction results within each study area or hydroclimate record station but they do not convey the spatial correlation of the prediction results within each study area or hydroclimate record station when a station is forecasting a drought the drought status of neighboring stations will not affect the prediction results in this respect statistical methods such as the markov chain model lack knowledge of spatial dependency thus we used the integrated cellular automata markov ca markov for drought prediction for the first time it has previously been applied in land use change prediction rural sustainability development forest management and other fields mondal and southworth 2010 kamusoko et al 2009 xie et al 2020 gao et al 2020 wu et al 2018 markov chain can support the quantitative prediction of drought change without spatial features while a cellular automata ca model can control the spatial dynamics among different drought states based on statistical neighborhoods and transition rules wu et al 2018 therefore the integrated ca markov method was used in this study to predict future spatio temporal variations in drought within china an analysis and summary of the spatio temporal characteristics of past drought episodes can be used to predict possible future drought episodes and enable drought prevention and management china is a drought prone country and agriculture is the worst drought affected sector he et al 2011 thus in this study the si was used to evaluate agricultural drought in this respect soil moisture and the permanent wilting point pwp were used as an analogy for the water supply and water demand within a water resources system respectively as soil moisture below the pwp results in plant wilt which is equivalent to a water deficit in a water resources system the objectives of this study were to 1 develop an index for comprehensively evaluating drought through three dimensions 2 develop a method to predict drought that considers temporal and spatial drought transformation laws and 3 use china as a case study for studying the variability and trends of drought over the past 65 years and predict near future spatio temporal drought characteristics 2 methodology 2 1 computation of reliability resilience vulnerability and sustainability index reliability can be described as the probability of a system being in a satisfactory state hashimoto et al 1982 in other words whether the available water supply meets water demands during periods of simulation the deficit d t i for the ith water user in the tth time period can be described as 1 d t i x target t i x suppled t i 0 if x target t i x suppled t i if x target t i x suppled t i where x target t i represents the soil pwp for the ith location in the tth time period and x suppled t i represents the soil moisture for the ith location in the tth time period for a given time series reliability for the ith location can be computed as 2 rel i lim n 1 n t 1 n z t i where z t i 1 if d t i 0 and z t i 0 if d t i 0 in this respect d t i 0 represents a satisfactory state and d t i 0 represents a failure state furthermore n is the total number of time steps in this study reliability values range from 0 to 1 when reliability is lower the drought frequency is higher if reliability is equal to 0 the region is in a constant state of drought the higher the reliability the lower the drought frequency and when reliability is equal to 1 drought has not occurred in the region resiliency describes how quickly a system is likely to recover or bounce back from failure once failure has occurred hashimoto et al 1982 for a given time series resilience for the ith location is computed as 3 res i lim n t 1 n w t i n lim n t 1 n z t i where w t i indicates a transition from a satisfactory sate to a failure state w t i 1 if d t i 0 and d t 1 i 0 otherwise w t i 0 if for the ith location rel i is 1 then the corresponding res i for the ith location is considered to be 1 resilience values range from 0 to 1 the lower the resilience value the lower the ability of a region to recover from drought therefore it is more prone to continuous drought when a region is continually in drought reliability is 0 and resilience is 0 when resilience is higher the region is better able to recover from drought and is less prone to continuous drought when resilience is equal to 1 there has been no continuous drought in the region or there has been no drought reliability is 1 vulnerability is the likely magnitude of failure if it occurs hashimoto et al 1982 essentially vulnerability expresses the severity of damage caused by a failure event in this study vulnerability is computed as the average failure for a given time series vulnerability for the ith location is computed as 4 vul i lim n t 1 n d t i n lim n t 1 n z t i x target i in this study vulnerability values range from 0 to 1 a higher value indicates that drought is more severe and a vulnerability value equal to 1 indicates that the soil contains almost no water when the vulnerability value is lower the drought is slight and a vulnerability value equal to 0 indicates that no drought has occurred in a region and reliability is 1 a 60 month period 5 year scale is considered to appropriately reflect a long term drought condition please refer to section 5 1 for details the sustainability index si is a summary index that measures the sustainability of water resources systems it incorporates the three performance indicators of reliability resilience and vulnerability and establishes a corresponding index that can be used to assess the sustainability of a water resource system sandoval solis et al 2011 the si generally has two calculation methods an arithmetic average loucks 1997 and a geometric average sandoval solis et al 2011 the arithmetic average has the following advantages 1 its values vary from 0 to 1 which is convenient for comparisons and calculations and 2 if either the reliability or resilience is zero or the vulnerability is one the si is zero in addition to satisfying the above advantages the si values obtained from the geometric average are more practical and intuitive while those from the arithmetic average may be somewhat misleading for example if the reliability resilience and vulnerability of a certain area are all 50 the si calculated using the arithmetic average and geometric average are 13 and 50 respectively therefore this paper uses the geometric average method to calculate the si for a given time series the si for the ith location can be computed as 5 si i rel i res i 1 vul i 1 3 si values range from 0 to 1 a higher value indicates that drought is less severe and it shows that a region has a good drought bearing capacity when the si is equal to 1 reliability resilience and vulnerability are 1 1 and 0 respectively which indicates that no drought has occurred in the region a lower si value indicates that drought is more severe and it shows that the region has a poor drought bearing capacity when the si is equal to 0 either the reliability or resilience are 0 or the vulnerability is 1 which indicates that the region continually experiences drought or that there is almost no water within the soil it is worth noting that based on rrv concept dmi was proposed earlier in 2013 maity et al 2013 although dmi and si are both comprehensive drought indexes based on the rrv concept their construction methods and focus are different dmi uses the copula function to obtain the multivariate distribution of resilience and vulnerability and is a probabilistic drought index it reflects the joint probability distribution between resilience and vulnerability and focusing on describing the statistical characteristics between the two while si represent aggregate indexes of a combination of rrv and is an algebraic drought index as mentioned before it can summarize the performance of rrv through geometric average and for a given si value the range of value for reliability resilience and vulnerability of the area can be determined at the same time the calculation is simple and easy to understand 2 2 computation of permanent wilting point pwp the soil pwp can be estimated based on the harmonized world soil database hwsd according to the regression equations koren et al 2003 the hydraulic soil properties for each usda u s department of agriculture texture class can be computed as campbell 1974 6 θ s 0 00126 f sand 0 489 7 ψ s 7 74 e 0 0302 f sand k p a 8 b 0 159 f clay 2 91 where θ s is saturation moisture content ψ s is saturation matrix potential b is the slope of the campbell s retention curve f sand indicates the percentage of sand and f clay indicates the percentage of clay the values are midpoint values obtained from each textural class cosby et al 1984 using the usda textural triangle wilting point estimates are calculated from campbell s matric water potential function using the parameter values from equations 6 8 as ψ pwp the matric potential at the wilting point is assumed to be 1500 kpa koren et al 2003 the pwp can be computed as 9 θ pwp θ s ψ pwp ψ s 1 b 2 3 ca markov an integrated dynamic ca markov model was applied in this study to predict si state si can be classified into different states according to values changes in the future and the calculation was completed through the idris s ca markov module based on the assumption that drought change is a stochastic process steinemann 2003 the next state of the process p n depends only on its current state p n 1 the general equation of the markov process can be expressed as 10 p n p n 1 p and the markov transition probability matrix can be expressed as 11 p p 11 p 12 p 1 n p 21 p 22 p 2 n p m 1 p m 2 p mn 0 p ij 1 i j 1 2 n j 1 m p ij 1 i 1 2 n where p is the state transition matrix and p ij is the transition probability of si state from j to i for a different si state the ca model is a discontinuous spatiotemporal dynamic simulation model in which time space and state are discrete and complex systems can be generated using simple local rules a ca system usually includes four elements cells cellular space neighborhoods and rules wang et al 2016 and it can be expressed as 12 s t 1 f s t n where s is the finite and discrete state set n is the neighborhood of the cellular space t and t 1 refer to consecutive time steps and f represents the transformation rules of the cellular states in local space in this study based on the existing spatial distribution data of the si and the scale feature of spatial variation a 5 5 neighborhood was adopted 3 data and study area monthly gridded 0 5 l a t 0 5 l o n g soil moisture data in mm from 1951 to 2015 reconstructed by fan and van 2004 were obtained from the climate prediction centre cpc noaa http www esrl noaa gov psd data gridded data cpcsoil html these soil moisture values were estimated using a 1 6 m deep leaky bucket model with an effective water holding capacity of 760 mm and a common porosity of 0 47 the model parameters are assumed to be globally constant van den dool et al 2003 this soil moisture data has also been used in research in india chanda et al 2014 soni and syed 2021 china zeng et al 2019 zhong et al 2019 and the southwestern amazon klarenberg et al 2018 and also in global studies chanda and maity 2017 xin et al 2019 chinese soil properties were obtained from the harmonized world soil database hwsd and the soil type map of china 1 k m 1 k m which is based on data obtained from the office for the second national soil survey of china 1995 and distributed by the institute of soil science in nanjing shi et al 2004 the reference soil depth of all soil units in the hwsd is set at 1000 mm and the physical and chemical characteristics of soil such as the sand fraction clay fraction and usda texture classification can be found in the hwsd as the soil depth in the hwsd differs from that in noaa the pwp and soil moisture were transformed uniformly to the volumetric water content however as the soil type and soil moisture resolutions did not agree the soil type resolution was upscaled to agree with that of soil moisture the predominant soil type within the new resolution grid area of 1 k m 1 k m to 0 5 l a t 0 5 l o n g was considered to be the representative soil type china has 70 different soil types and fig 1 shows only 10 soils that account for nearly 60 of the total soil types in china to conduct a proficient analysis of the results china was divided into seven regions see fig 1 based on soil properties and geographic spatial location 4 results 4 1 pwp in china using the method presented in section 2 and 3 above the ranges of pwp values for the different soil types in china were calculated and a gridded pwp map of china and its distribution is shown in fig 2 the pwp values ranged from 0 04 to 0 29 and nearly 50 of the pwp values ranged from 0 15 to 0 20 over 20 of the pwp values ranged from 0 05 to 0 10 whereas nearly 3 ranged from 0 20 to 0 25 it is evident from fig 2 that locations that are either glaciers water bodies or salt flats do not consider pwp values therefore these locations were excluded from the following computation 4 2 spatio temporal variation in reliability resilience vulnerability within china the study period 1951 2015 was split into 13 five year periods 1951 1955 1956 1960 2011 2015 each five year period comprised 60 months in total as represented by n in section 2 1 the reliability resilience and vulnerability were then calculated for each five year period at each location using eqs 2 3 and 4 respectively fig 3 illustrates the spatio temporal process of drought development based on reliability for 1951 2015 fig 3a b to 3 m are reliability maps for each five year period from 1951 to 1955 until 2011 2015 fig 3n is an average reliability map for the whole term and fig 3o represents the variance in all reliability maps the mann kendall test mann 1945 kendall 1975 and sen s slope sen 1968 were used to characterize reliability resilience vulnerability si trends and quantify the magnitude of such trends over the past 65 years fig 3p shows the mk trend in reliability for 1951 2015 in a similar way fig 4 presents all resilience maps fig 5 presents all vulnerability maps and fig 6 presents all si maps it can be observed from fig 3 that the reliability values in the wnw region were the lowest with an average reliability of 0 06 indicating that most areas of the region were in a constant state of drought the reliability values in the n enw and ne regions were relatively low average 0 5 the reliability values in the s sw and tibet regions were higher average 0 6 among which the reliability values in the s and sw regions were the highest with an average reliability of 0 85 indicating that most areas in these regions rarely suffered from drought it can be seen from fig 3n that the distribution of reliability values in the tibet n and enw regions were relatively uneven as evident from fig 3o reliability shows dramatic fluctuations in the northern wnw tibet ne southern enw and n regions fig 3p and 3q show an increased trend in wnw and tibet over the past 65 years which indicates that drought in these regions is easing and the average sen s slopes in the wnw and tibet regions were 0 002 and 0 003 respectively a decreasing trend in the sw n and ne regions over the past 65 years is evident which indicates that drought in these regions is exacerbating and the average sen s slopes in the sw n and ne regions were 0 003 0 006 and 0 006 respectively it can be observed from fig 4 that the resilience values in the wnw region were the highest with an average reliability of 0 03 indicating that most areas of the region had a low ability to recover from drought and were more prone to continuous drought the resilience values in the n enw and ne regions were relatively low average 0 3 the resilience values in the s sw and tibet regions were higher average 0 5 among which the resilience values in the sw region were the highest with an average resilience of 0 64 indicating that most areas in the region had a greater ability to recover from drought and were less prone to continuous drought it can be seen from fig 4n that except for the wnw region the distribution of resilience values was relatively uneven as evident from fig 4o resilience showed dramatic fluctuations in the tibet sw and s regions while from fig 4p and q resilience showed an increasing trend in the wnw and tibet regions over the past 65 years the average sen s slopes in the wnw and tibet regions were 0 001 and 0 002 respectively there was a decreasing trend in the sw n and ne regions over the past 65 years and the average sen s slopes in the sw n and ne regions were 0 005 0 003 and 0 002 respectively it can be observed from fig 5 that the vulnerability values in the wnw region were the highest with an average vulnerability of 0 7 indicating that most areas in the region suffered severe drought the vulnerability values in the enw region were the second highest with an average vulnerability of 0 35 the average vulnerability values in other regions were all 0 2 among which the vulnerability values in the s and sw regions were the lowest with an average vulnerability of 0 02 indicating that most areas of these regions have suffered a very slight drought it can be seen from fig 5n that the wnw and enw regions had uneven distributions of vulnerability while the distributions of vulnerability in other regions were relatively even as evident from fig 5o vulnerability showed dramatic fluctuations in northern tibet while from fig 5p and 5q a decreasing trend in the wnw and tibet regions over the past 65 years is evident the average sen s slopes in the wnw and tibet regions were 0 005 and 0 001 respectively an increasing trend in the sw n and ne regions over the past 65 years was evident and the average sen s slopes of the sw n and ne regions were 0 001 0 003 and 0 002 respectively 4 3 spatio temporal variations in si and associated trend within china it can be observed from fig 6 that the si values in the wnw region were the lowest with an average si of 0 05 indicating that most areas of the region had a poor drought bearing capacity the si values in the n enw and ne regions were relatively low average 0 5 the si in the s sw and tibet regions were higher average 0 6 among which the si values in the sw region were the highest with an average si of 0 78 indicating that most areas of the regions rarely suffered from drought it can be seen from fig 6n that the distribution of si values in the tibet n and enw regions were relatively uneven fig 6p and 6q shows the mk trend of the si during 1951 2015 it can be seen that in the n ne and sw regions the si showed a significant decreasing trend which means that agricultural drought in these regions is intensifying and in the northern wnw and tibet regions the si shows a significant increasing trend which indicates that agricultural drought in this region is being mitigated according to yu et al 2014 s research the annual precipitation from 1951 to 2010 presented significant downward trend in east of china n ne and sw regions and presented significant upward trend in western china northern wnw and tibet regions therefore the change of precipitation is an important reason for the intensify or alleviation of drought in these regions in the n and ne regions which correspond to the north china plain and the northeast china plain groundwater is the main source for industry and agriculture in order to maintain rapid social and economic development these regions rely on over exploiting groundwater since the 1970s shen 2015 and the long term over exploitation of groundwater will aggravate the drought qin et al 2015 furthermore enso el nino southern oscillation events can weaken the intensity of the walker circulation which would also cause frequent drought in northern china wang et al 2020 in the northern wnw and tibet regions in addition to the increase in precipitation the increase in temperature also played a role in alleviating drought in northern wnw region the melting of glaciers and snow will increase local runoff cao et al 2021 and in tibet region permafrost degradation caused by climate warming will increase soil moisture wu et al 2021 however it should be noted that the drought mitigation brought about by climate warming mentioned above is not sustainable the drought identification based on the si is consistent with results of other studies that analyzed the spatio temporal trend of drought in all or part of china using the meteorological drought index agricultural drought index or other originality indexes zhang et al 2015 discovered a wetting tendency in northern xinjiang northern wnw region through using reof rotated empirical orthogonal functions and the mk test based on meteorological station data obtained from 1961 to 2008 in xinjiang province yang et al 2018 identified wet conditions in north xinjiang northern wnw region and on the qiangtang plateau northern tibet region using the northwest china monthly average sc pdsi self calibrating palmer drought severity index in addition yu et al 2014 analyzed the spei from 1951 to 2010 in china and found that persistent multi year severe droughts appeared more frequently in north china and northeast china n and ne region chen and sun 2015 also analyzed the spei from 1961 to 2012 in china and found the occurrence of increasingly severe and more frequent drought in northern china furthermore xu et al 2015 analyzed the drought frequency in southwestern china sw region from 1961 to 2012 by constructing a regional drought frequency analysis model and they found that the worst drought in recent decades had occurred in 2009 2010 liu et al 2017 studied the drought trend in southwestern china based on sc pdsi from 1959 to 2013 and found that drought had become more widespread over the past decades sun et al 2016 calculated the spei in southwest china from 1971 to 2012 and found that the spatial extent duration and intensity of droughts during the 2000s were generally stronger than those in the 1980s and 1990s as the si presents similar results to those presented in the above studies it can thus be used to reflect the drought situation in china the si incorporates reliability resilience and vulnerability and is thus better able to characterize drought characteristics than when using a single metric many different locations may have similar values of reliability or resilience but the different si values can represent significantly different droughts for example fig 7 a illustrates the change in si with different resilience and vulnerability values during 2011 2015 whereas reliability ranged only from 0 4 to 0 5 it can be seen that even different points with similar values of reliability may reflect different drought situations and the si can better evaluate the characteristics of vulnerability and resilience corresponding to this region fig 7b illustrates the various si values corresponding to different reliability resilience and vulnerability values during 2011 2015 it is observed that as the si increases the reliability increases in a logarithmic tendency resilience increases in an exponential tendency and vulnerability decreases in a logarithmic tendency a higher si guarantees that a region has a higher capacity to deal with drought even in a drought a region can recover from a drought quickly with minimal damage conversely for low si regions it is important to focus on strengthening drought guarantee because droughts are more destructive and the region is more prone to continuous drought after the drought occurs in other words if a drought occurs the damage to a low si area may be more serious 4 4 prediction of si to enable the si to be more easily predicted its values within china were classified into 12 classes 0 00 0 00 0 10 0 10 0 20 0 20 0 30 0 30 0 40 0 40 0 50 0 50 0 60 0 60 0 70 0 70 0 80 0 80 0 90 0 90 1 00 and 1 00 respectively where for example 0 20 belongs in the 0 10 0 20 class 0 21 belongs in the 0 20 0 30 class and 0 00 and 1 00 are both individual classes according to the ca markov the past behavior of si can be used to estimate the near future drought propensity of a region kappa coefficients congalton 1991 were calculated to compare the accuracy between predicted and actual si values and when the kappa coefficients were between 0 00 and 0 40 0 41 0 60 0 61 0 80 and 0 81 1 00 the performance was poor to fair moderate substantial and excellent respectively in order to test whether ca markov can accurately predict si starting from the prediction of si values for 1961 1965 using the si values from 1951 to 1955 and 1956 1960 to 2011 2015 predicted si values were compared with actual si values and the kappa coefficients were calculated as shown in fig 8 a the average kappa coefficient was 0 678 which indicates substantial consistency between the predicted and actual si values therefore the ca markov with one step ahead prediction can accurately predict the future liu et al 2009 found that the prediction performance of markov chain models is related to forecasting steps small steps result in good performance therefore the prediction performances of one step ahead predictions for example using 2001 2005 and 2006 2010 to predict 2011 2015 two step ahead predictions for example using 1996 2000 and 2001 2005 to predict 2011 2015 three step ahead predictions for example using 1991 1995 and 1996 2000 to predict 2011 2015 and four step ahead predictions for example using 1986 1990 and 1991 1995 to predict 2011 2015 were compared predicted si values were compared with actual si values and the results are shown in fig 8b as the step increased the accuracy of the prediction decreased the average kappa coefficients of one and two step ahead predictions were higher than 0 6 indicating substantial consistency between the predicted and actual si values conversely the kappa coefficients of the three and four step ahead predictions were lower than 0 6 indicating moderate prediction performance therefore the si values for 2016 2020 one step ahead prediction and 2021 2025 two step ahead prediction were predicted using ca markov fig 9 illustrates the predicted si values for 2016 2020 a and 2021 2025 b the overall si for 2016 2020 and 2021 2025 increased compared with the si for 2011 2015 additionally the si for 2021 2025 increased compared with that for 2016 2020 indicating that china s drought will be alleviated in the future there were differences in the changes in si among the different regions the si in the wnw n enw and ne regions were projected to increase in the future indicating that the drought will be alleviated the si in the s region was projected to decrease in the future indicating that the drought will intensify and there were no projected changes in si in the sw and tibet regions indicating that the drought will maintain the status quo during 2021 2025 the sw region was projected to have a high drought bearing capacity with a regional average si of 0 8 while the wnw region was projected to have the worst drought but the regional average si value was projected to increase to 0 15 5 discussion 5 1 sensitive analysis to assess the sensitivity of different lengths of time as represented by n in section 2 1 to si we conducted 200 calculations since there are a total of 4083 grids in china and the characteristics of the si differ among regions we randomly selected 408 grids for each calculation which is 10 of the total number of grids we calculated the si of each grid under different lengths of time 0 5 and 1 to 9 yr in order to obtain the appropriate length of time under which the si is stable and with a suitable time resolution we calculated the coefficient of variation cv defined as the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean of the si to reflect the degree of si fluctuation under different lengths of time the average cv of the si of each calculation grey line and the average cv of the si across all 200 calculations red line are shown in fig 10 the results show that with an increase in the length of time the average cv of the si follows a clear downward trend the cv change ratio was used to reflect the change in cv with increasing length of time for location a the cv change ratio under length of time t is cr cv t c v 0 5 c v t c v 0 5 c v 9 where cr cv t is the cv change ratio under t and cv t is the average cv of the si under t therefore the cv change ratio represents the change in cv under t relative to the change in cv under all lengths of time the cv change ratio is shown in fig 10 blue dotted line and the average cv of the si and cv change ratio under different lengths of time is shown in table 2 when the length of time was 5 yr the cv change ratio was 89 3 therefore the average cv of the si can be considered stable when the length of time is 5 yr therefore this paper uses 5 yr as the length of time for calculations this is also consistent with the length of time for calculations used by maity et al 2013 in calculating the drought management index dmi they found that 5 yr was the minimum length of time under which a relatively stable dmi could be determined 5 2 uncertain analysis agricultural drought has been classified as insufficient precipitation in an area within a particular time scale resulting in a soil moisture deficit that limits water supply to crops which in turn reduces crop yields sepulcre canto et al 2012 the agricultural drought indexes listed in table 1 except for the vci kogan 1995 are related to soil moisture this study used the pwp and soil moisture to evaluate whether or not an agricultural drought had occurred in a region for simplicity only two drought states were considered whether or not soil moisture was below the pwp compared with other indexes such as smai bergman et al 1988 and csm huang et al 1996 which only use soil moisture the incorporation of pwp in this study more directly reflects crop water deficit in agricultural drought however crop water uptake is reduced well before the pwp is reached martínez fernández et al 2015 which means the si cannot reflect a drought in which soil water moisture is only slightly greater than pwp therefore agricultural drought will be underestimated to a certain extent conversely a reliable agricultural drought index requires proper consideration of crop types crop growth root development soil characteristics and antecedent soil moisture conditions zeng et al 1998 narasimhan and srinivasan 2005 yang et al 2017 however because it is difficult to obtain the above data for large scale and long term series this paper only uses the pwp based on soil properties as a criterion for drought identification if the information above could be considered then the accuracy of the si in reflecting agricultural drought could be improved it should be noted that there are still uncertainties with drought predictions based on ca markov mainly in two aspects long term prediction and changing environment according to the results of this paper when ca markov is used for predictions as the forecasting time increases such as from a one step ahead to a four step ahead prediction the accuracy of the prediction becomes lower in order to ensure the accuracy of the prediction this paper only uses one step ahead and two step ahead predictions for analysis this is similar to other studies and is because of the inherent chaotic nature of the atmosphere lavers et al 2009 yuan et al 2011 and the fact that drought is affected by precipitation temperature sea surface temperature sst el nino southern oscillation enso and other factors núñez et al 2014 asadi zarch et al 2015 trenberth and fasullo 2012 piechota and dracup 1996 jaranilla sanchez et al 2011 making long term prediction of drought difficult with climate change such as global warming and human activities such as emissions of greenhouse gases land use change etc meteorological variables such as humidity temperature evaporation and the water cycle process will be changed huntington 2006 milly et al 2008 for example the increase in temperature will increase the water holding capacity and evaporation into the atmosphere resulting in extreme precipitation changes prudhomme et al 2014 thus the changing environment brings challenges to the prediction of future droughts ca markov is based on statistical methods for drought prediction and statistical methods rely on the relationship between predictors in historical records which are generally assumed to be stationary hao et al 2018 therefore if historical records cannot reflect nonstationary features the prediction results may be biased schepen et al 2012 smith et al 2012 further work needs to be done to strengthen predictions such as improve existing statistical methods to incorporate nonstationary features for drought prediction 6 conclusion in this paper the si based on reliability resilience vulnerability indicators was used to analyze the spatio temporal variation of drought and the ca markov was used to predict drought in the near future from the results presented in this study the following conclusions can be made 1 the si is shown to be advantageous for use in analyzing china agricultural drought characteristics it evaluates drought through the three dimensions of reliability vulnerability and resilience and it not only reflects the frequency destructive effect and the ability of a region to recover from drought but it can also distinguish the difference in drought between different regions that have similar values of reliability or resilience therefore it provides results that are significant for use in local drought management 2 the spatio temporal variation and trends in si in china are quite different and the distribution of si values in the tibet n and enw regions were relatively uneven the si values were lowest in the wnw region with an average si of 0 05 but they were quite high in the s sw and tibet regions with an average si of 0 78 the si values in the n enw and ne regions were relatively low and the average si in these regions were all 0 5 the si in the northern wnw and tibet regions showed a significant increasing trend but a significant decreasing trend was evident in the southern sw n and eastern ne regions 3 a comparison with the actual results shows that the prediction using the ca markov provides a good fit using the markov chain model the spatial features of cellular automata enable an improved spatial drought prediction to be made combined with the practicability of the si its use provides considerable benefits in enabling future drought warning and prevention the prediction of si during 2016 2020 and 2021 2025 shows that the overall si value in china will increase compared to the values during 2011 2015 which means that drought will improve

4524,springs and hot spas have been used worldwide since ancient times as sources of potable medicinal and bathing water as well as for industrial purposes they also sustain spring dependent ecosystems and provide water flow to downstream ecosystems we investigated the major element hydrogeochemistry of traditional springs co2 rich waters and hot spas in south korea and their relationships with features of bedrock geology and structural settings at the national scale to classify water types and identify the major factors controlling the occurrence of each water type three criteria mineral content co2 aq and water temperature defined six major water types alkaline mineral water in carbonate rocks and sedimentary rocks result from readily weatherable lithology the majority of mineralized waters are co2 rich or thermal waters with a wide range of mineral contents their occurrence was found to be mainly concentrated near faults and boundaries between early to middle jurassic granitic rocks and other rocks of much older ages and this pattern was quantitatively identified through proximity analysis this finding indicates that younger granitic rocks provide sources of heat and deep seated co2 and faults link these deep sources to groundwater flow hydrolysis of primary silicate minerals including feldspar and biotite is likely to supply major and minor solutes including mg2 f and fe to co2 rich and thermal waters f concentration appears to be regulated by the saturation states of calcite and fluorite and mg2 concentration in alkaline thermal water is driven by the formation of mg bearing secondary silicates we demonstrated that natural mineral water in tectonically stable regions has diverse thermal and hydrogeochemical properties that are mainly controlled by their lithological and structural settings at the regional scale these results may help elucidate the generation processes of natural mineral waters with high cultural and ecological values leading to their sustainable use and protection keywords natural mineralization co2 rich water thermal water granitic rocks faults multivariate statistical analysis 1 introduction springs and hot spas have traditionally been regarded as having special value in terms of cultural heritage as well as various beneficial and therapeutic effects numerous mineral springs and hot spas have long been known to local populations and used for drinking water therapy and thermal baths worldwide fricke 1993 back et al 1995 lund 1996 many mineral water sites in europe have traditionally been used for therapeutic purposes either through drinking or recreational bathing and some systematic studies have been conducted on historic mineral water sites and natural mineral water sources used by the bottled water industry birke et al 2010 eurogeosurveys 2016 in asian countries including china and japan springs and hot spas have also been used in traditional cultural practices for bathing and health purposes schafer 1956 cooper and cooper 2009 recently interest in natural mineral water has increased worldwide due to increasing concerns about tap water quality the health effects of mineral water and changes in lifestyle the global sales and consumption volume of bottled water have increased rapidly and are predicted to be about usd 350 billion in 2021 coniglio et al 2020 from an ecological perspective springs also play important roles in sustaining distinct ecosystems harboring diverse fauna and flora that are dependent on groundwater flow to the surface environment and in providing water flow to wetland and riparian ecosystems in arid or surface water deficient areas springer and stevens 2009 kløve et al 2011 recently menció et al 2016 reported that a spring rich in fe and co2 controlled the growth of diatoms and algae in the aquatic system as well as the formation of precipitates natural springs are commonly located in contact areas between the water table and the external land surface formed by topographic and hydrogeological discontinuities where they are discharged from groundwater aquifers kresic and stevanovic 2010 tallini et al 2013 although they exhibit complex differences according to site specific characteristics tectonic setting and geomorphological factors including lithology the occurrence and flow characteristics of natural mineral springs at the regional scale are largely driven by faults and folds hancock et al 1999 keppel et al 2020 in a complex natural mineral water system fractures and lithology act as the main pathways for upwelling of deep co2 and mineral springs to the land surface maréchal et al 2014 in karst aquifers springs mainly appear in contact areas between a carbonate rock and a low permeability layer and can occur in the form of intermittent springs after heavy storm events bonacci 2001 nerantzaki et al 2020 in this regard understanding the effects of topographic lithological and tectonic settings on the occurrence and physico chemical properties of natural mineral water emerging into the surface environment as springs is essential to their sustainable use and appropriate conservation mineralized waters including co2 rich and geothermal waters have been studied in terms of geological processes such as tectonic seismological and geothermal activities as well as hydrogeological features greber 1994 aires barros et al 1998 moeck 2014 the origin and circulation of geothermal water within fractured crystalline bedrocks were simulated by numerical modeling in a tectonically active area pepin et al 2015 co2 rich waters have been particularly well investigated to clarify the origin and transport of co2 through faults and magmatism related to neotectonic activities in both non geothermal mayo and muller 1997 crossey et al 2009 and geothermal areas cerón et al 2000 lambrakis and kallergis 2005 mineralized waters in karst sedimentary and volcanic aquifers have also been investigated in terms of the hydrogeological and geochemical processes controlling their occurrence banner et al 1994 hartmann et al 2014 at regional or national scales natural mineral waters have been investigated using bottled water to assess the hydrogeochemical characteristics of dissolved inorganic constituents and identify major factors controlling their distribution such as lithology and aquifer type frengstad et al 2010 dinelli et al 2010 because geological properties are closely related to characteristics of natural springs including discharge chemical composition and temperature quantitative spatial analysis between the occurrence of natural mineral water and geological factors can be useful however in previous studies the origin of and processes affecting natural mineral waters have been mentioned only briefly or qualitatively interpreted in relation to their structural and tectonic settings furthermore few studies have investigated the occurrence of natural mineral water at the regional scale with various lithological and structural features being considered interest in natural mineral water has increased recently in south korea resulting in a marked increase in bottled water consumption from mid 1990s koh and ko 2018 various types of springs including hot spas and mineral waters have been reported in areas of the korean peninsula with crystalline bedrock characteristics and complex geological structures hann 1996 lee 2007 reported the correlation between granitic rocks and water quality characteristics for traditional hot spring waters in south korea and hann 1996 investigated the potential use of mineral hot spring water hosted in granite for the treatment of skin disease and arthritis studies on the formation origin and hydrogeochemical properties of thermal co2 rich water koh et al 2008 and the correlation of the spatial distribution of thermal co2 rich water with faults and granitic rock boundaries have been published jeong et al 2005 in korea natural mineral water has been studied at the local scale including a few sites and no systematic study was conducted at the national scale in this study we investigated the major element hydrogeochemical behavior of well known traditional natural mineral waters with diverse lithological and structural settings these waters have long been used for drinking traditional medicine and bathing purposes in south korea it is needed to understand hydrological and geochemical processes constraining the natural mineral water sources for proper evaluation of their values in both geological and cultural aspects the aims of this study were to classify water types based on their hydrogeochemical and geothermal features to identify the factors controlling mineral and thermal waters using spatial variables focused on lithological tectonic and structural settings and to evaluate the hydrogeological and geochemical processes related to each water type and selected constituents using multivariate statistics and spatial analysis we tested the hypothesis that lithological and structural settings are closely related to the occurrence of natural mineral water with distinct physical and chemical features at the regional scale using synoptic hydrogeochemical measurements for traditional springs and hot spas this study provides a unique opportunity to assess the hydrogeochemical features of natural mineral waters and identify major factors controlling its occurrence as the korean peninsula has diverse lithological and structural settings 2 methods 2 1 study

basement consisting of high grade metamorphic rocks metasedimentary and sedimentary rocks although granitic rocks and volcanic rocks are also found which represent long term basin formation and crustal deformation processes including erosion folding and faulting from the precambrian to cenozoic fig 1 chough et al 2000 the tectonic provinces of the southern korean peninsula are comprised of the imjingang belt the gyeonggi massif the okcheon belt the yeongnam massif and the gyeongsang basin from north to south during the mesozoic era major orogenic events occurred at the regional scale with intense metamorphism deformation and widespread igneous activity mesozoic granitic plutons intruded at this time which are widely distributed in the southern korean peninsula sagong et al 2005

as reported in various types of literature including scientific articles e g kim and choi 1998 yoon and kim 2000 reports ksef 2002 and books kim 2007 such water sources have been historically regarded as valuable and used for drinking bathing and medicinal purposes a total of 173 water samples were collected from 132 springs and 41 wells from august 2017 to march 2020 figs 1 and s1 table s1 the hot spa sites are also known historically as thermal springs although increased water usage in modern times has caused drawdown of groundwater levels leading to the development of wells with total depths ranging from 165 to 929 m for the hot spa wells lithologic logs and screened interval depths were mostly unavailable the discharge rate of these springs ranged from 0 02 to 15 008 l min with a median of 0 97 l min n 73 most of the springs have discharge rates less than 10 l min and those with higher discharge more than 100 l min were found only in the areas with carbonate rocks median 1 389 l min n 5 and basaltic rocks median 335 l min n 4 the elevation of sampling sites ranged from 5 to 1446 m asl with a median of 197 m asl tables s1 and s2 water temperature ph electrical conductivity ec and dissolved oxygen do were measured in the field using a multi parameter portable meter multi 3620 ids model wtw and water samples were collected after the field parameters had stabilized water samples for chemical analysis were filtered using a 0 45 µm membrane filter and stored in high density polyethylene hdpe bottles without headspace and aliquots for cation analysis were preserved by adding concentrated nitric acid to reach ph 2 in the field major and minor elements including ca2 k na mg2 sio2 aq fetot mn and sr2 were measured using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry icp aes optima 7300dv perkin elmer and major anions of cl so4 2 no3 f and br were measured using ion chromatography ics 1500 dionex field blanks prepared during sampling showed no contamination above detection limits occurred for all analytes analytical uncertainties determined by duplicate samples and certified standards were less than 5 as relative percent difference alkalinity was quantified using an automatic titrator t50a mettler toledo with a fixed endpoint of ph 4 5 and via gran titration for samples with low alkalinity and the results were used for calculation of hco3 concentrations charge balance errors for major cations and anions were within 5 except for some low mineral water samples ec 100 µs cm total dissolved solids tds content was calculated from measured concentrations of major dissolved constituents concentrations of dissolved co2 were determined from carbonate equilibria using field measured ph and alkalinity levels which were reported in either co2 aq mg l or log pco2 atm 2 3 multivariate statistical analysis principal component analysis pca was used to identify geochemical processes affecting groundwater chemistry major elements and dissolved co2 and pca results can also help to classify groundwater characteristics koh et al 2009 using pca we integrated information on hydrochemical variables of the groundwater sample into a single number which can be used to identify the factors influencing groundwater chemistry such as lithology tectonic setting and human activities when combined with spatial distribution valdes et al 2007 although the interpretation of groundwater chemistry can be simplified using pca some assumptions for the dataset are required including sufficient volume of the dataset and no significant missing values and outliers wold et al 1987 in this study 18 variables including ph temperature do ca2 mg2 na k hco3 cl so4 2 no3 f fe mn sr2 sio2 aq tds and dissolved co2 were analyzed in 169 groundwater samples using the pca method with xlstat statistical software addinsoft version 2020 the two saline water samples obtained in coastal areas which were affected by seawater intrusion and two acidic sulfate waters affected by sulfide oxidation were excluded as these processes are not directly related to the hydrological and geochemical factors considered in this study concentrations of dissolved constituents that were below the detection limit dl were assumed to be half of the dl value for that element alley 1993 the parameters and proportions of samples measuring below detection level bdl were mg2 8 hco3 4 no3 25 and f 10 fe and mn were below the detection limit in most samples about 80 data for pca were logarithmically transformed as most of the measured hydrogeochemical parameters were highly skewed except for ph and log pco2 atm principal components pc were extracted using the kaiser criterion to select pcs with eigenvalues 1 and rotated with the varimax method which maximizes the sum of the variances of the loadings to discriminate the pc loadings into a few large values many of which were close to zero simplifying their interpretation horel 1981 2 4 classification and spatial analysis of natural mineral water we classified natural mineral water samples based on dissolved mineral content or total dissolved solids tds dissolved co2 concentration and water temperature the tds threshold for mineral water in south korea was identified as 185 mg l which corresponds to the 90th percentile hinsby et al 2008 of 60 bottled water samples derived from pristine crystalline bedrock aquifers nationwide lee et al 2019a the threshold for co2 rich water was set to 10 1 2 atm of pco2 which can be regarded as the upper limit in the soil zone yoshimura et al 2001 macpherson 2009 groundwater temperature was estimated as 24 1 c at the average depth of hot spa wells of 400 m based on an average surface temperature of 14 1 c and the geothermal gradient of the korean peninsula 25 1 c km kim and lee 2007 considering the background temperature thermal water was defined as groundwater with a temperature higher than 25 c we compiled fault data from a geological map of korea at a scale of 1 1 000 000 to analyze how major faults control groundwater flow and affect various types of natural mineral water the diverse lithologic types of south korea were simplified into seven lithologic types of granitic rocks metamorphic rocks metasedimentary rocks andesitic and rhyolitic rocks basaltic rocks sedimentary rocks and carbonate rocks to identify the effects of lithology on the occurrence of natural mineral water fig 1 carbonate rocks were identified as a separate lithologic group from the non carbonate sedimentary rocks because springs in carbonate rocks karst aquifers had distinct characteristics in flow and hydrogeochemistry from those in non carbonate sedimentary rocks granitic rocks and metamorphic rocks are evenly distributed over the majority of the korean peninsula while sedimentary rocks are located in the eastern and southeastern regions carbonate rocks are found only in the central eastern region and small scale carbonate deposits are present in metasedimentary and sedimentary rocks andesitic and rhyolitic rocks are mainly located in the southern region basaltic rocks are found in the northern and southeastern regions of south korea as well as on jeju island fig 1 proximity analysis an analytical tool in arcgis is used to estimate the spatial distribution relationship between geometric elements such as points polylines and polygons this type of spatial analysis has been applied to the occurrence of groundwater with higher levels of geogenic contaminants such as uranium and radon and spatial distribution characteristics of groundwater based on private well data in maine usa were analyzed yang et al 2014 as were fluoride concentrations and their probability distribution in groundwater at the global scale amini et al 2008 gis based geospatial statistics were also analyzed to find geological conditions related to co2 rich spring discharge roberts et al 2019 geothermal potential and well siting noorollahi et al 2008 the fault systems can act as barriers or conduits in the groundwater flow depending on fault types distribution of fractured zones and their permeability structure evans et al 1997 however these features were not considered in this study including the cross sectional structure of each specific site because relevant data on the faults are not available with sufficient resolution and reliability we performed spatial analysis of the locations of sampling sites with respect to major faults and boundaries of selected lithological units to evaluate how these geological factors affect the occurrence of thermal mineral waters for proximity analysis distances from the lithologic boundaries of granitic rocks and from fault lines to each sampling point were estimated as a straight line through spatial analysis using the arcgis program esri ver 10 5 1 here each sampling site was defined as a point the fault is a line and the granitic rock boundary as a polygon or a polyline buffer one of arcgis geoprocessing tools was applied to estimate the distance buffer areas were assigned up to 3 km at a 0 5 km interval for lithologic boundaries as polygon features and major faults as line features and the sampling points within the buffer areas were counted to interpret the effects of distance from the sampling point to geologic factors on the occurrence of thermal and mineral rich water 3 results 3 1 major element hydrochemistry of natural mineral water a summary of the major hydrochemical characteristics of the mineral water samples is provided in table 1 the range of ph and tds of mineral waters were wide with ranges from 2 7 to 9 7 mean 7 1 and 8 to 3 991 mg l mean 314 respectively ca2 and na were the major cations detected while hco3 and cl were the major anions table 1 and sio2 aq concentrations were relatively high the coefficient of variation cv representing the degree of scattering showed a wide range among ions with values for na 237 cl 502 fe 291 mn 251 so4 2 234 and co2 aq 219 over 200 table 1 these results indicate that the geochemistry of mineral waters in south korea is controlled by hydrolysis of sodium and or calcium silicate minerals considering the reaction time in silicate minerals the higher tds can be interpreted to longer groundwater residence time and flow distance the influx of geogenic co2 and temperature also affect the kinetics of silicate weathering reaction because the degree of silicate hydrolysis depends on the source of h i e co2 for natural mineral water in this study considering hydrogeochemical characteristics based on the three criteria of tds pco2 and water temperature we identified six water types figs 2 and s2 alkaline mineral water n 14 low mineral co2 rich water n 6 low mineral thermal water n 4 high mineral co2 rich water n 31 thermomineral water n 26 and baseline water n 88 in addition acidic sulfate water n 2 and saline water n 2 were also identified the acidic sulfate water including ms085 and ms115 table s2 is affected by oxidation of fe bearing sulfide minerals because the springs are located in the sedimentary rock region and have extremely high concentrations of so4 2 and fetot with low ph 3 figs 1d and s3 hs13 1 and hs13 2 were designated as the saline water which is located in the coastal area indicating the na cl type affected by typical seawater intrusion fig 1d and s3 table s2 among the mineral water types some water samples had nitrate concentrations greater than 3 mg l as no3 n indicating considerable impacts from anthropogenic contamination in the surface environment medison and brunett 1985 and such samples were excluded from mineral water and regarded as baseline water co2 rich water mineral rich water and thermal water comprised 22 42 and 18 of all samples respectively with overlap between the three types while baseline water comprised 52 of samples fig 1d the ranges of the three parameters for each water type are given in table 2 based on median values tds decreases in the order of high mineral co2 rich water 753 mg l thermomineral water 284 mg l alkaline mineral water 228 mg l low mineral thermal water 141 mg l low mineral co2 rich water 130 mg l and baseline water 80 mg l while co2 aq decreases in the order of high mineral co2 rich water 2174 5 mg l low mineral co2 rich water 1202 6 mg l alkaline mineral water 9 0 mg l thermomineral water 1 2 mg l low mineral thermal water 0 1 mg l and baseline water 3 6 mg l water temperature decreases in the order of thermomineral water 46 9 c low mineral thermal water 42 2 c low mineral co2 rich water 15 2 c baseline water 14 4 c high mineral co2 rich water 13 4 c and alkaline mineral water 13 5 c 3 2 hydrogeochemical processes controlling each water type co2 rich water had higher tds than the alkaline mineral water and thermal water types fig 3 notably the ca2 concentrations mean 4 9 mg l in low mineral thermal water 25 8 mg l in thermomineral water of thermal water samples were low while their f concentrations were high mean 7 7 mg l in low mineral thermal water 3 2 mg l in thermomineral water co2 rich water maintained a low ph mean 4 88 in low mineral co2 rich water 5 86 in high mineral co2 rich water while the other water types covered a wide ph range in particular the ph of thermal water types mean 8 93 in low mineral thermal water 8 21 in thermomineral water was relatively high in accordance with tds results the concentrations of ca2 na sio2 aq and hco3 ions increased with tds indicating that these ions led to the increase in tds geochemical reactions involving plagioclase presented as 1 and 2 were the main reactions increasing the levels of dissolved ions in silicate bedrock areas 1 caal2si2o8 2 co2 aq 3 h2o al2si2o5 oh 4 ca2 2 hco3 2 naalsi3o8 co2 aq 11 2 h2o 1 2 al2si2o5 oh 4 na 2 h4sio4 hco3 these reactions can account for higher concentration of major solutes in the majority of co2 rich water in this study notably hco3 concentrations were low in thermomineral water which was likely due to enhanced silicate mineral hydrolysis in the absence of co2 fig 3 differences in the geological distributions of thermomineral water and high mineral co2 rich water are discussed in section 4 the saturation index si of water for a given mineral represents the degree of saturation state with respect to the mineral as undersaturated si 0 supersaturated si 0 and at equilibrium si 0 appelo and postma 2004 the degree of si is defined as the following equation 3 3 s i log iap k eq where iap is the ion activity product and keq is the constant for solubility equilibrium of the mineral the si of chalcedony can be used as a measure of the degree of reaction between silicate minerals and groundwater it was greater than zero for 130 samples which is 75 of total samples and increased with increasing total cation concentrations na k ca2 mg2 except in samples hs13 1 and hs13 2 fig 4 a indicating that silicate hydrolysis is the major process increasing cation concentrations high and low mineral co2 rich waters showed distinctly different trends from other waters in ph and si of calcite diagrams fig s4 this is likely to be mainly controlled by ca2 concentration derived from dissolution of ca silicate minerals fig 4b and s4 the si of fluorite approaches saturation when the f concentration is greater than 2 mg l fig 4c implying that the upper limit of f concentration is controlled by the saturation of fluorite thus in a sample near fluorite saturation f might be reduced due to precipitation of fluorite when ca2 is supplied although the si of gypsum increased with the increase in so4 2 concentration this trend is not related to gypsum dissolution see the small figure in fig 4d the high so4 2 concentration in the sedimentary rock region is likely to originate from pyrite oxidation fig 4d and s3 water types classified based on the three criteria of temperature tds and log pco2 atm were clearly distinguished on a piper diagram in particular separation was good for samples of thermal water na hco3 and na cl types and high mineral co2 rich water ca hco3 type as well as acidic sulfate water and saline water fig 5 ca2 ions were dominant in the baseline water alkaline mineral rich water and co2 rich water types while na ions were dominant in the thermal water types except for high cl or so4 2 levels in some samples of thermomineral water the ratio of hco3 ion was highest among the anions high mineral co2 rich water was mainly of the ca mg hco3 type with some samples of the na hco3 type from the northeastern area containing granitic rocks saline water the na cl type corresponds to thermomineral waters obtained in the southeastern region which are affected by seawater intrusion sulfate is predominant in acidic sulfate waters and some thermomineral waters from the southern area saline water and some thermomineral waters collected in the southeastern coastal area had na cl molar ratios close to the seawater dilution line indicating that they were affected by seawater intrusion fig 6 a the elevated na concentrations of such samples may have been affected by cation exchange of ca2 or mg2 so4 2 concentrations were distinctively higher in sedimentary and andesitic rocks and showed no clear trend with hco3 concentrations this finding indicates that elevated sulfate concentrations in mineralized water are strongly controlled by lithology rather than the degree of mineralization fig 6b thermal water and high mineral co2 rich water had higher sio2 aq concentrations regardless of the degree of mineralization while alkaline mineral water had much lower sio2 aq concentrations especially in areas of carbonate rocks than even most baseline water samples fig 6c this result clearly shows that silicate weathering dominates the chemistry of most natural mineral waters in this study except for alkaline mineral waters hosted in carbonate rocks which had much higher ca2 na molar ratios due to carbonate mineral dissolution fig 6d mg2 ca2 molar ratios were relatively high in waters from dolomitic areas but were consistently less than 0 5 indicating that calcite dissolution is favored over dolomite dissolution fig 6e thermal water groups had elevated f concentrations and relatively low ca2 concentrations fig 6f indicating the possibility of the removal of ca2 through precipitation of caco3 or ion exchange of ca2 reactions involving ca2 and f are analyzed in more detail in the discussion section four principal components pcs were extracted from hydrogeochemical measurements of natural mineral water samples excluding acidic sulfate and saline waters which explained about 84 of the total variance fig 7 table s3 since a component loading in pca results represent correlation between variable and component the loading value can be either positive or negative pc1 accounted for 27 of the variance and had strong positive loadings for ca2 hco3 sio2 aq mg2 fe and co2 which are indicators of interactions between co2 charged water and easily weatherable rocks this finding corroborated the high pc1 scores for high mineral co2 rich water and alkaline mineral water pc2 explained 26 of total variance and had strong positive loadings for na cl f and k this component was highly correlated with thermomineral water representing mineralization in geothermal areas pc3 19 of variance had a highly positive loading for co2 and highly negative loading for ph but minimal loadings for other hydrochemical parameters aside from mg2 and fe the low mineral co2 rich water samples such as kn01 kn04 and ms110 were fairly well represented by this component table s2 pc4 13 of variance had a strong negative loading for no3 and was closely related to baseline water with less impact from nitrate contamination 3 3 effect of geological setting on the occurrence of mineral and thermal waters we analyzed the relationships between lithology and selected hydrochemical parameters for the thermal and mineral water types fig 8 most thermal waters including thermomineral water and low mineral thermal water were distributed in granitic rocks and a small proportion of samples was from sedimentary and andesitic rocks in thermal waters dic levels were higher in granitic rocks than in sedimentary and andesitic rocks although tds were much higher in sedimentary and andesitic rocks this finding implies that mineralization of groundwater in granitic rocks is driven by co2 rich water while that in sedimentary and andesitic rocks is not the median ca2 na molar ratio was about 0 2 indicating na rich mineral water fig 8a table s2 which resulted from the increase in na concentrations associated with the dissolution of albite eq 2 in section 3 2 elevated so4 2 concentrations median 141 4 mg l were found mainly in thermal waters located in sedimentary rocks in the southeastern part of the korean peninsula while samples of thermal water located in granitic rocks had the highest f concentrations median 3 3 mg l most mineral water samples were located in granitic rocks and metamorphic rocks prior to collection fig 8b while alkaline mineral waters were found in sedimentary rocks and carbonate rocks the dic levels of mineral waters in granitic rocks and metamorphic rocks were high indicating mantle and magmatic co2 in contrast the dic levels of mineral water in carbonate rocks were much lower than those in other lithologies implying little influence of mantle and magmatic co2 the most extensive carbonate rocks are located in the northeastern part of south korea which are a siliciclastic carbonate succession from cambrian to ordovician in age and underwent strong deformation and weak to moderate metamorphism choi and chough 2005 these lithological characteristics lead to lower reactivity of the carbonate rocks most of alkaline mineral water in carbonate rocks has similar or lower co2 aq concentration compared to that of baseline water indicating closed systems are dominant fig 2 these features could account for the lower dic in mineral water in the carbonate rocks previous studies have shown that faults and granitic rocks play a major role in determining the occurrence of co2 rich water and geothermal water in south korea jeong et al 2005 analyzed the hydrochemical and geological properties of 61 co2 rich springs on the korean peninsula and reported that most co2 rich waters were located in mesozoic granitic rocks and surrounding areas and were mainly related to those geologic structures lee et al 2014 analyzed the physical and chemical features of 281 non volcanic geothermal waters and estimated the spatial relationship between hot spas and geological faults they found that the length of the main fault may be key parameters determining the occurrence of geothermal water in this study mineral and thermal waters other than baseline waters were located primarily at granitic rock boundaries fig 9 which is consistent with previous works meanwhile alkaline mineral water had little association with granitic rock boundaries and faults and its occurrence instead appeared to be controlled mainly by the presence of carbonate and sedimentary rocks which are more readily weatherable than granitic and metamorphic rocks alkaline mineral water had high concentrations of ca2 mg2 and hco3 in carbonate rocks and high so4 2 concentrations in sedimentary rocks carbonate and sedimentary rock regions are located in the mountainous eastern part of the korean peninsula where groundwater can circulate deeply which may have led to a greater degree of mineralization which is strongly related to bedrock characteristics smedley 2010 pacheco 2015 the distance from lithologic boundaries of granitic rocks and fault lines to each sampling location was estimated through spatial analysis to identify geological settings that affect co2 rich water discharge and geothermal potential the occurrence of co2 rich water and thermal water reflected the distance of granitic rock boundaries and faults fig 10 however the relationship between distance from a fault and the number of co2 rich water and thermal water samples was unclear and thermal water was generally found within 1 km of a fault the number of such samples showed a slight rebound at distances of more than 3 km from fault lines as the distance from a granitic rock boundary increased further the decreasing tendencies of the numbers of samples containing co2 rich and thermal waters strengthened thermal water was not observed at greater than 2 km from the granitic rock boundary 3 4 occurrence of health related solutes in natural mineral waters among major dissolved constituents mg2 f and no3 were selected as solutes related to human health chen et al 2017 the drinking water limit dwl for f is 1 5 mg l who 1994 fluoride in drinking water has a narrow optimal concentration range in relation to human health if the concentration of f in drinking water is low 0 7 1 2 mg l it has the effect of preventing dental erosion but concentrations ranging from 1 5 to 5 0 mg l and exceeding 5 0 mg l cause dental fluorosis and skeletal fluorosis respectively heller et al 1997 ayoob and gupta 2006 chae et al 2007 reported that the median f concentrations of deep groundwaters according to aquifer lithology were 7 1 5 6 and 1 6 in metamorphic rocks granitic rocks and sedimentary rocks respectively in this study the higher f concentrations were observed mainly in groundwater samples collected at or near granitic rock boundaries fig 11 a f rich groundwater is also found in some sedimentary and volcanic rocks in the southeastern part of the korean peninsula which could be due to the presence of f rich granite in deep layers kim and jeong 2005 in this study the f concentrations of natural mineral waters ranged from 0 01 to 10 5 median 0 11 mg l higher f concentrations were observed in thermal water median 3 3 mg l and co2 rich water median 0 42 mg l in the granitic rock region while the lowest f concentration was found in carbonate rocks median 0 05 mg l fig 8 this difference clearly shows that lithology strongly affects f concentrations in mineral and thermal waters except for deep wells at hot spas most samples were from springs implying that faults extending to the surface may be another factor controlling the occurrence of high f groundwater kim and jeong 2005 reported that high f concentrations were observed in groundwaters near a fault zone and particularly in granitic areas magnesium and calcium are major minerals needed for body composition and health and mg is a cofactor for more than 300 enzymes that play key roles in the human body and metabolism gröber et al 2015 statistically significant benefits to human health were reported when water with mg2 concentrations over 10 mg l was used as drinking water who 2009 mg2 also helps to prevent coronary heart disease and low mg2 is associated with a high incidence of acute myocardial infarction ami kousa et al 2008 in this study co2 rich water had elevated mg2 concentrations min max 1 4 84 2 mg l median value 15 6 mg l compared to other water types alkaline mineral water also had high mg2 concentrations min max 2 7 39 mg l median value 14 0 mg l in particular the levels in samples from dolomitic carbonate rocks were up to 28 mg l in contrast the median mg2 concentrations were 1 9 0 1 and 0 1 mg l for baseline water low mineral thermal water and thermomineral water respectively fig 11b table 2 nitrate is the main source of groundwater contamination and is related mainly to anthropogenic factors such as manure and chemical fertilizers in rural areas although the risk level of no3 n for human health varies depending on the water uses risk factors and country the drinking water standard for no3 n is 10 mg l in south korea and who and the no3 n levels higher than the guideline value can cause methemoglobinemia who 1996 a threshold value of 3 mg l as no3 n has been suggested as an indicator of anthropogenic contamination medison and brunett 1985 the majority of natural mineral water sources in this study are located in mountainous areas where significant levels of nitrate contamination are not expected measured nitrate concentrations were in the range of 0 1 to 103 mg l 0 01 to 23 3 mg l as no3 n with a median of 2 0 mg l 0 5 mg l as no3 n about 10 of samples exceeded the threshold for anthropogenic contamination and one sample ms048 exceeded the drinking water standard regionally exceedances of the anthropogenic nitrate threshold were 13 2 and 4 1 of samples in the western and eastern areas respectively except for jeju and ulleung islands fig 11c high nitrate concentration was most common in baseline water from the western areas where agricultural land uses are prevalent in combination with a higher human population density this finding implies that the establishment of adequate management and effective remedial measures is needed to protect and improve the water quality of natural mineral waters that receive sizable human impacts including excessive contaminant loadings and development pressures which could improve the health of both impacted people and ecosystems 4 discussion 4 1 role of geological setting in the mineralization of natural mineral waters in this study we confirmed that traditionally used natural mineral waters in south korea could be classified into baseline mineral and thermal waters based on the three criteria of tds co2 and temperature the mineral and thermal waters were further subdivided into several types of water these results imply that the main drivers of the mineralization of mineral and thermal waters in crystalline bedrock dominated regions such as south korea are co2 supply geothermal conditions and lithology more specifically the types of water were closely related to their geological settings such as boundaries of granitic rocks and faults as well as lithological factors such as the presence of carbonate rocks which readily react with water among the mineral rich water types alkaline mineral water high mineral co2 rich water and thermomineral water the average tds was highest in high mineral co2 rich water this result indicates that continuous supply of co2 is the most important factor for natural mineralization as has been suggested in previous studies of co2 rich water in korea kim et al 2008 koh et al 2008 and other areas aires barros et al 1998 marques et al 2000 regarding this classification it is noteworthy that subjectivity based on expert knowledge in the configuration process of environmental sciences including the hydrogeological modeling approach can have considerable influence on the results melsen et al 2019 the characteristics of the study area were reflected in selection of the classification criteria and determination of their threshold values which can be variable depending on data sets and methods of data analysis for similar studies the criteria and factors constraining specific water types need to be identified and their threshold values determined considering regional patterns of hydrogeochemical hydrogeological and geological characteristics of the study area tectonic settings have a fundamental impact on thermal state of the crust and geothermal activities which were classified into convection and conduction dominated systems moeck 2014 the convection dominated systems mainly appear in active plate margins with volcanism and plutonism and have high thermal energy even at a relatively shallow depth whereas the conduction dominated systems are found in passive tectonic plate settings with sedimentary basins or crystalline bedrocks which are consisted of intracratonic basin type orogenic belt type and basement type in this study it is assumed that thermal water is associated with the basement type of conduction dominated systems kim 2004 the heat source is likely to be supplied from the remnant of granitic host rocks considering spatial correlations between occurrence of thermal water and granitic rock boundaries fig 10 the source of co2 gas in natural mineral waters is commonly magmatic processes associated with the formation of granitic rocks and the gas is supplied to groundwater through permeable structures mayo and muller 1997 previous studies have shown that co2 rich water had no geothermal signature in south korea where recent magmatism and significant tectonic activity are not known except on jeju and ulleung volcanic islands kim et al 2008 thus the co2 dissolved in mineral water originates from co2 trapped inside granitic rocks when magma cooled schofield and jankiwski 2004 the majority of igneous rocks on the korean peninsula are composed of daebo granite and bulguksa granite from the jurassic and cretaceous eras chough et al 2000 previous studies have shown that mesozoic granitoids are closely related to the distribution of co2 rich waters jeong et al 2005 in this study the correlation between the period of magmatic intrusion for granite and the distribution of co2 rich water was analyzed for granitic rocks throughout south korea fig 12 most co2 rich water was located around early and middle jurassic granitic rocks which are the youngest among the granitic rocks in south korea aside from the cretaceous and paleogene granites in the southeastern region fig 12 this result shows that the supply of co2 from deep sources remains active around the most recently intruded granitic rocks some co2 rich waters were collected in sedimentary rocks in the southeastern part of south korea which were located at the boundary between sedimentary and granitic rocks fig 1 however these water samples were likely associated with granitic rocks as they had hydrogeochemical features similar to those obtained from granitic rocks the co2 rich water analyzed in this study was highly mineralized with elevated levels of mg2 f fe and mn in most samples excluding low mineral co2 rich water sources located near the center of the korean peninsula which were characterized by low ph and low tds based on proximity analysis the occurrence of thermomineral water and co2 rich water was concentrated near granitic rock boundaries or faults and decreased about 1 km away from both features fig 10 regions of high heat flow in the korean peninsula are the jurassic and cretaceous granite regions of the mesozoic era kim 2004 which are closely associated with young fault zones and lineament density sass et al 1997 faults also act as flow paths for deep hot springs geothermal groundwater and co2 gas cerón et al 2000 and mesozoic granites contain co2 gas that may be derived from deep seated sources of magma or the mantle jeong et al 2005 these findings imply that the thermomineral and co2 rich waters in this study formed around granitic rocks and were transported to the surface environment through faults co2 rich and thermal waters were not found in the southeastern part of the korean peninsula which is more tectonically active with multiple recent earthquakes of ml 5 0 lee et al 2019b such waters were also scarce in cretaceous granitic rocks except for a few thermal water sites fig 12 this result indicates that magmatic activities during the jurassic era and more recently have different characteristics in terms of deep co2 and thermal history which requires further study the limitation of this approach is that considerable uncertainties exist in their exact location depth and extents since the faults and boundaries between lithology were compiled from the regional geological maps in this respect it is needed to evaluate the hydrogeological and geochemical processes of mineral water through detailed field surveys for proper assessment of specific springs or spring groups in the further study 4 2 geochemical reactions constraining mg and f concentrations in natural mineral waters one plausible reaction supplying magnesium and fluoride to mineral waters is the dissolution of biotite as it is common in granitic rocks of south korea and is readily weatherable in the minerals comprising granitic rocks chae et al 2006 bray et al 2015 incongruent dissolution of biotite in anoxic groundwater can be expressed using the representative biotite stoichiometry of granitic rocks in eastern canada shabani et al 2003 k0 94 mg0 95feii 1 24mn0 04feiii 0 20al0 30 ti0 12 al1 26si2 73 o10 oh1 8f0 2 5 72 co2 aq 5 86 h2o 4 0 78 al2si2o5 oh 4 0 94 k 0 95

of co2 charged water with granitic rocks which is consistent with the locations of thermomineral water and high mineral co2 rich water observed in this study notably mg2 concentrations were below 0 2 mg l in all low mineral thermal waters and the majority of thermomineral waters which also had strongly alkaline ph levels of 7 7 9 6 n 19 mean 8 6 and high temperatures of 36 81 c n 18 mean 52 c excluding one sample at 28 c these levels were much lower than the average and median mg2 concentrations in water obtained from granitic rocks of 7 6 and 2 2 mg l the mg deficiency of alkaline thermal water might be attributed to the formation of chlorite which consumes mg2 from the water nordstrom et al 1989 or alteration of biotite to chlorite while retaining mg in the solid phase clow et al 1997 for mineralized water in granitic rocks the fact that lower mg2 concentrations were found only in thermal waters indicates that these reactions are less significant under non thermal conditions as thermodynamic solubility control of secondary silicates is unlikely at low temperatures nordstrom et al 1989 as described in sections 3 2 and 3 4 f concentrations were controlled by dissolution of f bearing minerals and fluorite saturation the concentrations of f and ca2 increase along the fluorite dissolution line fig 13 a when fluorite dissolves from bedrock rich in fluorite most samples analyzed in this study fell to the right side of the fluorite dissolution line indicating that their ca2 originated from minerals e g equation 4 other than fluorite in other words the sources of ca2 and f were different on the other hand f concentrations can be reduced through the common ion effect when ca2 concentrations increase due to dissolution of minerals such as ca silicate and calcite fig 13a conversely if insufficient ca2 is supplied high f concentrations can be maintained therefore the samples with high f had lower ca2 contents than that associated with fluorite saturation implying that ca2 ions are removed from groundwater through calcite precipitation or ion exchange rather than fluorite precipitation fig 13a chae et al 2007 the relationship between the si of calcite and f concentrations shows that water with a high f content is near saturation of calcite fig 13b indicating that the high f content of mineralized water in this study was maintained by the removal of ca2 through precipitation of calcite 4 3 impacts of groundwater use on spring discharge spring discharge can be affected by groundwater pumping due to the connectivity between groundwater and surface water and changes in groundwater flow system at the various spatial scales sophocleous 2002 chu et al 2017 condon and maxwell 2019 in this study most of mineral springs are located in the mountainous northeastern region with negligible farmlands and urban areas figs 1 and 11c thus those mineral springs in the mountainous region are less likely to be affected by groundwater uses as well as anthropogenic contamination by contrast springs near populated areas and extensive agricultural lands in the plane western region are more likely to be under human impacts which was corroborated by elevated nitrate levels in that region fig 11c these environmental conditions suggest that spring discharge can be also significantly affected by intensive groundwater abstraction in the areas with higher development pressure actually considerable drawdown in groundwater level and even drying out have been reported in some spring sites due to overexploitation of groundwater onyang spa hs08 was a naturally flowing hot spring before 1910 however the artesian pressure was broken and shallow cold groundwater was introduced by intensive pumping of deep groundwater up to about 1 3 million m3 year 1 kim et al 2005 in bugok spa area hs15 exploitation of geothermal water rapidly increased since early 1970 s resulting in severe drawdown in depth to water level from near surface to as low as 400 m in late 1990 s yun et al 1998 spring discharge in chojeong mineral water ms039 was decreased due to excessive pumping at a nearby bottled water company ham 2013 it was also been reported that the spring discharge of osaek mineral water ms014 was affected by groundwater use at the nearby hotels lee et al 2004 these cases of severe deterioration in spring discharge clearly show that impacts of human activities on natural mineral water sources need to be evaluated for variation of spring discharge and water quality parameters at present quantification and trend analysis of changes in the spring discharge for majority of the natural mineral water sources in this study are not feasible because of lack of long term monitoring data in order to protect traditionally well known mineral waters and use them sustainably mineral water sources need to be monitored for temporal variations of physical parameters including spring discharge and temperature and water quality and hydrochemical parameters on a continuous or at least periodical basis 5 conclusions traditionally used mineral waters in south korea including springs and hot spas were classified using three criteria of tds content dissolved co2 and water temperature resulting in six major water types the dominant type was baseline water which had low tds low co2 and an ambient temperature typical of shallow groundwater along with short flow paths from topographically driven local flow systems in crystalline bedrocks alkaline mineral water occurred in carbonate rocks and to a lesser extent in sedimentary rocks and clearly showed that bedrock lithology was the main determinant of its hydrogeochemical features in contrast the occurrence of co2 rich water and thermal water was strongly controlled by geological factors and these water types were distributed mainly near faults and the boundaries of granitic rocks specifically the early to middle jurassic granitic rocks which are among the youngest plutonic rocks in south korea the boundaries between granitic rocks and surrounding rock types are likely to play a key role in the supply of heat and mantle and magmatic co2 with faults acting as flow paths linking deep sources with groundwater flow systems allowing discharge into the surface environment which was clearly revealed by proximity analysis co2 rich water and thermal water were further classified into low mineral and high mineral subtypes based on their tds contents with high mineral types dominant in both water types two minor water types were acidic sulfate water found in sedimentary rocks of inland areas in the southeastern region and saline water near the coast silicate hydrolysis was the major reaction determining the hydrogeochemical features of all major water types except for alkaline mineral water which had much lower sio2 aq concentrations higher ca2 na levels and lower mg2 ca2 contents in carbonate rocks and higher so4 2 concentrations in sedimentary rocks dissolution reactions of feldspar provide major solutes while biotite may supply minor ones including mg2 f and fe which are greatly enhanced by the input of mantle and magmatic co2 and geothermal heat between these co2 inclusion contributes more to natural mineralization sinks of mg and f which were considered health related solutes in this study were also considered a considerable portion of natural mineral waters are saturated or slightly oversaturated with respect to calcite and fluorite which implies the major processes controlling f concentration the negligible mg2 concentration in alkaline thermal water was attributed to the formation of mg bearing secondary silicates such as chlorite nitrate contamination was not significant in most natural mineral water samples due to the scarcity of contamination sources near the mountainous sites compared to domestic groundwater sources however some waters in the western plain area had considerably higher nitrate concentration indicating that water quality was degraded by anthropogenic impacts the various types of natural mineral water analyzed in this study are known for their distinct physical and chemical properties they have traditionally been used for drinking medical and bathing purposes for a long time and are commonly thought to provide health benefits apart from human usage they are also unique natural resources with cultural and ecological values we classified natural mineral waters in diverse geological settings at the national scale by establishing the criteria based on the hydrogeochemical and thermal characteristics and identified the major factors controlling the occurrence of each water type related to faults and lithologic boundaries considerable decreases in discharge and storage of the water sources due to the influence of excessive groundwater abstraction were previously reported for some of the springs in this study which suggests that further studies need to be focused on long term monitoring of physical and water quality parameters of natural mineral waters to facilitate protection and sustainable use of the water sources this study may provide insights into the origin and transport mechanisms of natural mineral waters in other areas with similar geological settings and may also contribute to the sustainable use of natural mineral waters as a natural resource through improved understanding of the

4524,springs and hot spas have been used worldwide since ancient times as sources of potable medicinal and bathing water as well as for industrial purposes they also sustain spring dependent ecosystems and provide water flow to downstream ecosystems we investigated the major element hydrogeochemistry of traditional springs co2 rich waters and hot spas in south korea and their relationships with features of bedrock geology and structural settings at the national scale to classify water types and identify the major factors controlling the occurrence of each water type three criteria mineral content co2 aq and water temperature defined six major water types alkaline mineral water in carbonate rocks and sedimentary rocks result from readily weatherable lithology the majority of mineralized waters are co2 rich or thermal waters with a wide range of mineral contents their occurrence was found to be mainly concentrated near faults and boundaries between early to middle jurassic granitic rocks and other rocks of much older ages and this pattern was quantitatively identified through proximity analysis this finding indicates that younger granitic rocks provide sources of heat and deep seated co2 and faults link these deep sources to groundwater flow hydrolysis of primary silicate minerals including feldspar and biotite is likely to supply major and minor solutes including mg2 f and fe to co2 rich and thermal waters f concentration appears to be regulated by the saturation states of calcite and fluorite and mg2 concentration in alkaline thermal water is driven by the formation of mg bearing secondary silicates we demonstrated that natural mineral water in tectonically stable regions has diverse thermal and hydrogeochemical properties that are mainly controlled by their lithological and structural settings at the regional scale these results may help elucidate the generation processes of natural mineral waters with high cultural and ecological values leading to their sustainable use and protection keywords natural mineralization co2 rich water thermal water granitic rocks faults multivariate statistical analysis 1 introduction springs and hot spas have traditionally been regarded as having special value in terms of cultural heritage as well as various beneficial and therapeutic effects numerous mineral springs and hot spas have long been known to local populations and used for drinking water therapy and thermal baths worldwide fricke 1993 back et al 1995 lund 1996 many mineral water sites in europe have traditionally been used for therapeutic purposes either through drinking or recreational bathing and some systematic studies have been conducted on historic mineral water sites and natural mineral water sources used by the bottled water industry birke et al 2010 eurogeosurveys 2016 in asian countries including china and japan springs and hot spas have also been used in traditional cultural practices for bathing and health purposes schafer 1956 cooper and cooper 2009 recently interest in natural mineral water has increased worldwide due to increasing concerns about tap water quality the health effects of mineral water and changes in lifestyle the global sales and consumption volume of bottled water have increased rapidly and are predicted to be about usd 350 billion in 2021 coniglio et al 2020 from an ecological perspective springs also play important roles in sustaining distinct ecosystems harboring diverse fauna and flora that are dependent on groundwater flow to the surface environment and in providing water flow to wetland and riparian ecosystems in arid or surface water deficient areas springer and stevens 2009 kløve et al 2011 recently menció et al 2016 reported that a spring rich in fe and co2 controlled the growth of diatoms and algae in the aquatic system as well as the formation of precipitates natural springs are commonly located in contact areas between the water table and the external land surface formed by topographic and hydrogeological discontinuities where they are discharged from groundwater aquifers kresic and stevanovic 2010 tallini et al 2013 although they exhibit complex differences according to site specific characteristics tectonic setting and geomorphological factors including lithology the occurrence and flow characteristics of natural mineral springs at the regional scale are largely driven by faults and folds hancock et al 1999 keppel et al 2020 in a complex natural mineral water system fractures and lithology act as the main pathways for upwelling of deep co2 and mineral springs to the land surface maréchal et al 2014 in karst aquifers springs mainly appear in contact areas between a carbonate rock and a low permeability layer and can occur in the form of intermittent springs after heavy storm events bonacci 2001 nerantzaki et al 2020 in this regard understanding the effects of topographic lithological and tectonic settings on the occurrence and physico chemical properties of natural mineral water emerging into the surface environment as springs is essential to their sustainable use and appropriate conservation mineralized waters including co2 rich and geothermal waters have been studied in terms of geological processes such as tectonic seismological and geothermal activities as well as hydrogeological features greber 1994 aires barros et al 1998 moeck 2014 the origin and circulation of geothermal water within fractured crystalline bedrocks were simulated by numerical modeling in a tectonically active area pepin et al 2015 co2 rich waters have been particularly well investigated to clarify the origin and transport of co2 through faults and magmatism related to neotectonic activities in both non geothermal mayo and muller 1997 crossey et al 2009 and geothermal areas cerón et al 2000 lambrakis and kallergis 2005 mineralized waters in karst sedimentary and volcanic aquifers have also been investigated in terms of the hydrogeological and geochemical processes controlling their occurrence banner et al 1994 hartmann et al 2014 at regional or national scales natural mineral waters have been investigated using bottled water to assess the hydrogeochemical characteristics of dissolved inorganic constituents and identify major factors controlling their distribution such as lithology and aquifer type frengstad et al 2010 dinelli et al 2010 because geological properties are closely related to characteristics of natural springs including discharge chemical composition and temperature quantitative spatial analysis between the occurrence of natural mineral water and geological factors can be useful however in previous studies the origin of and processes affecting natural mineral waters have been mentioned only briefly or qualitatively interpreted in relation to their structural and tectonic settings furthermore few studies have investigated the occurrence of natural mineral water at the regional scale with various lithological and structural features being considered interest in natural mineral water has increased recently in south korea resulting in a marked increase in bottled water consumption from mid 1990s koh and ko 2018 various types of springs including hot spas and mineral waters have been reported in areas of the korean peninsula with crystalline bedrock characteristics and complex geological structures hann 1996 lee 2007 reported the correlation between granitic rocks and water quality characteristics for traditional hot spring waters in south korea and hann 1996 investigated the potential use of mineral hot spring water hosted in granite for the treatment of skin disease and arthritis studies on the formation origin and hydrogeochemical properties of thermal co2 rich water koh et al 2008 and the correlation of the spatial distribution of thermal co2 rich water with faults and granitic rock boundaries have been published jeong et al 2005 in korea natural mineral water has been studied at the local scale including a few sites and no systematic study was conducted at the national scale in this study we investigated the major element hydrogeochemical behavior of well known traditional natural mineral waters with diverse lithological and structural settings these waters have long been used for drinking traditional medicine and bathing purposes in south korea it is needed to understand hydrological and geochemical processes constraining the natural mineral water sources for proper evaluation of their values in both geological and cultural aspects the aims of this study were to classify water types based on their hydrogeochemical and geothermal features to identify the factors controlling mineral and thermal waters using spatial variables focused on lithological tectonic and structural settings and to evaluate the hydrogeological and geochemical processes related to each water type and selected constituents using multivariate statistics and spatial analysis we tested the hypothesis that lithological and structural settings are closely related to the occurrence of natural mineral water with distinct physical and chemical features at the regional scale using synoptic hydrogeochemical measurements for traditional springs and hot spas this study provides a unique opportunity to assess the hydrogeochemical features of natural mineral waters and identify major factors controlling its occurrence as the korean peninsula has diverse lithological and structural settings 2 methods 2 1 study area the total area of south korea is about 100 000 km2 70 of which consists of mountainous terrain ngii 2016 in particular the eastern region is generally mountainous while the western and southeastern regions contain hilly terrains plains and river basins the volcanic islands of jeju and ulleung are located on the south and east coasts of the korean peninsula respectively at distances of 100 km and 130 km from the coast the mean annual air temperature in south korea over the period 1981 2010 is 12 5 c with the highest monthly average in august 23 26 c and lowest in january 6 3 c the annual precipitation in south korea ranges from 1 000 mm to 1 800 mm in the southern region and from 1 200 mm to 1 500 mm in the northern region with more than 60 of annual precipitation falling during the hot and humid summer season and less than 10 during the cold and dry winter season kma http www weather go kr the korean peninsula is a tectonically stable region with a precambrian basement consisting of high grade metamorphic rocks metasedimentary and sedimentary rocks although granitic rocks and volcanic rocks are also found which represent long term basin formation and crustal deformation processes including erosion folding and faulting from the precambrian to cenozoic fig 1 chough et al 2000 the tectonic provinces of the southern korean peninsula are comprised of the imjingang belt the gyeonggi massif the okcheon belt the yeongnam massif and the gyeongsang basin from north to south during the mesozoic era major orogenic events occurred at the regional scale with intense metamorphism deformation and widespread igneous activity mesozoic granitic plutons intruded at this time which are widely distributed in the southern korean peninsula sagong et al 2005 kee et al 2010 the mesozoic granitic rocks can be divided into three groups triassic 248 210 ma jurassic 197 158 ma and late cretaceous paleogene 110 50 ma sagong et al 2005 the triassic granitic rocks are deep seated stocks and the jurassic granitic rocks form extensive deep seated batholiths and generally exhibit various petrographic variations the cretaceous granitic rocks form volcano plutonic complexes and are comprised of biotite granites and granite porphyry jwa 2004 the gyeongsang basin located in the southeastern part of south korea is a region of exclusively large non marine sedimentary rocks and contains a thick succession of siliciclastic rocks and volcanic deposits chough and sohn 2010 the presence of a karst aquifer has a large impact on groundwater quality due to the rapid water rock interactions hartmann et al 2014 carbonate rocks on the korean peninsula are mainly distributed in the central chungbuk and northeastern gangwon regions figs 1a and s1 and constitute a significant part of the joseon supergroup deposits between the cambrian and ordovician periods choi et al 2004 the korean peninsula is a tectonically inactive region and based on the local stress field most fault systems are distributed in the form of strike slip and thrust faults soh et al 2018 the southeastern korean peninsula is a region with active faults and since the ml 5 8 gyeongju earthquake in 2016 there has been strong interest in potential seismic hazards due to unidentified faults hong et al 2016 in addition in the southeastern area with active faulting fault related springs releasing mantle derived co2 have been reported based on measurements of co2 gas and 3he 4he ratios lee et al 2019b in fractured aquifers with a crystalline basement faults and fault zones usually act as the main flow paths for groundwater movement lópez and smith 1995 2 2 field investigation and chemical analysis we selected sampling sites with traditional natural mineral water sources as reported in various types of literature including scientific articles e g kim and choi 1998 yoon and kim 2000 reports ksef 2002 and books kim 2007 such water sources have been historically regarded as valuable and used for drinking bathing and medicinal purposes a total of 173 water samples were collected from 132 springs and 41 wells from august 2017 to march 2020 figs 1 and s1 table s1 the hot spa sites are also known historically as thermal springs although increased water usage in modern times has caused drawdown of groundwater levels leading to the development of wells with total depths ranging from 165 to 929 m for the hot spa wells lithologic logs and screened interval depths were mostly unavailable the discharge rate of these springs ranged from 0 02 to 15 008 l min with a median of 0 97 l min n 73 most of the springs have discharge rates less than 10 l min and those with higher discharge more than 100 l min were found only in the areas with carbonate rocks median 1 389 l min n 5 and basaltic rocks median 335 l min n 4 the elevation of sampling sites ranged from 5 to 1446 m asl with a median of 197 m asl tables s1 and s2 water temperature ph electrical conductivity ec and dissolved oxygen do were measured in the field using a multi parameter portable meter multi 3620 ids model wtw and water samples were collected after the field parameters had stabilized water samples for chemical analysis were filtered using a 0 45 µm membrane filter and stored in high density polyethylene hdpe bottles without headspace and aliquots for cation analysis were preserved by adding concentrated nitric acid to reach ph 2 in the field major and minor elements including ca2 k na mg2 sio2 aq fetot mn and sr2 were measured using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry icp aes optima 7300dv perkin elmer and major anions of cl so4 2 no3 f and br were measured using ion chromatography ics 1500 dionex field blanks prepared during sampling showed no contamination above detection limits occurred for all analytes analytical uncertainties determined by duplicate samples and certified standards were less than 5 as relative percent difference alkalinity was quantified using an automatic titrator t50a mettler toledo with a fixed endpoint of ph 4 5 and via gran titration for samples with low alkalinity and the results were used for calculation of hco3 concentrations charge balance errors for major cations and anions were within 5 except for some low mineral water samples ec 100 µs cm total dissolved solids tds content was calculated from measured concentrations of major dissolved constituents concentrations of dissolved co2 were determined from carbonate equilibria using field measured ph and alkalinity levels which were reported in either co2 aq mg l or log pco2 atm 2 3 multivariate statistical analysis principal component analysis pca was used to identify geochemical processes affecting groundwater chemistry major elements and dissolved co2 and pca results can also help to classify groundwater characteristics koh et al 2009 using pca we integrated information on hydrochemical variables of the groundwater sample into a single number which can be used to identify the factors influencing groundwater chemistry such as lithology tectonic setting and human activities when combined with spatial distribution valdes et al 2007 although the interpretation of groundwater chemistry can be simplified using pca some assumptions for the dataset are required including sufficient volume of the dataset and no significant missing values and outliers wold et al 1987 in this study 18 variables including ph temperature do ca2 mg2 na k hco3 cl so4 2 no3 f fe mn sr2 sio2 aq tds and dissolved co2 were analyzed in 169 groundwater samples using the pca method with xlstat statistical software addinsoft version 2020 the two saline water samples obtained in coastal areas which were affected by seawater intrusion and two acidic sulfate waters affected by sulfide oxidation were excluded as these processes are not directly related to the hydrological and geochemical factors considered in this study concentrations of dissolved constituents that were below the detection limit dl were assumed to be half of the dl value for that element alley 1993 the parameters and proportions of samples measuring below detection level bdl were mg2 8 hco3 4 no3 25 and f 10 fe and mn were below the detection limit in most samples about 80 data for pca were logarithmically transformed as most of the measured hydrogeochemical parameters were highly skewed except for ph and log pco2 atm principal components pc were extracted using the kaiser criterion to select pcs with eigenvalues 1 and rotated with the varimax method which maximizes the sum of the variances of the loadings to discriminate the pc loadings into a few large values many of which were close to zero simplifying their interpretation horel 1981 2 4 classification and spatial analysis of natural mineral water we classified natural mineral water samples based on dissolved mineral content or total dissolved solids tds dissolved co2 concentration and water temperature the tds threshold for mineral water in south korea was identified as 185 mg l which corresponds to the 90th percentile hinsby et al 2008 of 60 bottled water samples derived from pristine crystalline bedrock aquifers nationwide lee et al 2019a the threshold for co2 rich water was set to 10 1 2 atm of pco2 which can be regarded as the upper limit in the soil zone yoshimura et al 2001 macpherson 2009 groundwater temperature was estimated as 24 1 c at the average depth of hot spa wells of 400 m based on an average surface temperature of 14 1 c and the geothermal gradient of the korean peninsula 25 1 c km kim and lee 2007 considering the background temperature thermal water was defined as groundwater with a temperature higher than 25 c we compiled fault data from a geological map of korea at a scale of 1 1 000 000 to analyze how major faults control groundwater flow and affect various types of natural mineral water the diverse lithologic types of south korea were simplified into seven lithologic types of granitic rocks metamorphic rocks metasedimentary rocks andesitic and rhyolitic rocks basaltic rocks sedimentary rocks and carbonate rocks to identify the effects of lithology on the occurrence of natural mineral water fig 1 carbonate rocks were identified as a separate lithologic group from the non carbonate sedimentary rocks because springs in carbonate rocks karst aquifers had distinct characteristics in flow and hydrogeochemistry from those in non carbonate sedimentary rocks granitic rocks and metamorphic rocks are evenly distributed over the majority of the korean peninsula while sedimentary rocks are located in the eastern and southeastern regions carbonate rocks are found only in the central eastern region and small scale carbonate deposits are present in metasedimentary and sedimentary rocks andesitic and rhyolitic rocks are mainly located in the southern region basaltic rocks are found in the northern and southeastern regions of south korea as well as on jeju island fig 1 proximity analysis an analytical tool in arcgis is used to estimate the spatial distribution relationship between geometric elements such as points polylines and polygons this type of spatial analysis has been applied to the occurrence of groundwater with higher levels of geogenic contaminants such as uranium and radon and spatial distribution characteristics of groundwater based on private well data in maine usa were analyzed yang et al 2014 as were fluoride concentrations and their probability distribution in groundwater at the global scale amini et al 2008 gis based geospatial statistics were also analyzed to find geological conditions related to co2 rich spring discharge roberts et al 2019 geothermal potential and well siting noorollahi et al 2008 the fault systems can act as barriers or conduits in the groundwater flow depending on fault types distribution of fractured zones and their permeability structure evans et al 1997 however these features were not considered in this study including the cross sectional structure of each specific site because relevant data on the faults are not available with sufficient resolution and reliability we performed spatial analysis of the locations of sampling sites with respect to major faults and boundaries of selected lithological units to evaluate how these geological factors affect the occurrence of thermal mineral waters for proximity analysis distances from the lithologic boundaries of granitic rocks and from fault lines to each sampling point were estimated as a straight line through spatial analysis using the arcgis program esri ver 10 5 1 here each sampling site was defined as a point the fault is a line and the granitic rock boundary as a polygon or a polyline buffer one of arcgis geoprocessing tools was applied to estimate the distance buffer areas were assigned up to 3 km at a 0 5 km interval for lithologic boundaries as polygon features and major faults as line features and the sampling points within the buffer areas were counted to interpret the effects of distance from the sampling point to geologic factors on the occurrence of thermal and mineral rich water 3 results 3 1 major element hydrochemistry of natural mineral water a summary of the major hydrochemical characteristics of the mineral water samples is provided in table 1 the range of ph and tds of mineral waters were wide with ranges from 2 7 to 9 7 mean 7 1 and 8 to 3 991 mg l mean 314 respectively ca2 and na were the major cations detected while hco3 and cl were the major anions table 1 and sio2 aq concentrations were relatively high the coefficient of variation cv representing the degree of scattering showed a wide range among ions with values for na 237 cl 502 fe 291 mn 251 so4 2 234 and co2 aq 219 over 200 table 1 these results indicate that the geochemistry of mineral waters in south korea is controlled by hydrolysis of sodium and or calcium silicate minerals considering the reaction time in silicate minerals the higher tds can be interpreted to longer groundwater residence time and flow distance the influx of geogenic co2 and temperature also affect the kinetics of silicate weathering reaction because the degree of silicate hydrolysis depends on the source of h i e co2 for natural mineral water in this study considering hydrogeochemical characteristics based on the three criteria of tds pco2 and water temperature we identified six water types figs 2 and s2 alkaline mineral water n 14 low mineral co2 rich water n 6 low mineral thermal water n 4 high mineral co2 rich water n 31 thermomineral water n 26 and baseline water n 88 in addition acidic sulfate water n 2 and saline water n 2 were also identified the acidic sulfate water including ms085 and ms115 table s2 is affected by oxidation of fe bearing sulfide minerals because the springs are located in the sedimentary rock region and have extremely high concentrations of so4 2 and fetot with low ph 3 figs 1d and s3 hs13 1 and hs13 2 were designated as the saline water which is located in the coastal area indicating the na cl type affected by typical seawater intrusion fig 1d and s3 table s2 among the mineral water types some water samples had nitrate concentrations greater than 3 mg l as no3 n indicating considerable impacts from anthropogenic contamination in the surface environment medison and brunett 1985 and such samples were excluded from mineral water and regarded as baseline water co2 rich water mineral rich water and thermal water comprised 22 42 and 18 of all samples respectively with overlap between the three types while baseline water comprised 52 of samples fig 1d the ranges of the three parameters for each water type are given in table 2 based on median values tds decreases in the order of high mineral co2 rich water 753 mg l thermomineral water 284 mg l alkaline mineral water 228 mg l low mineral thermal water 141 mg l low mineral co2 rich water 130 mg l and baseline water 80 mg l while co2 aq decreases in the order of high mineral co2 rich water 2174 5 mg l low mineral co2 rich water 1202 6 mg l alkaline mineral water 9 0 mg l thermomineral water 1 2 mg l low mineral thermal water 0 1 mg l and baseline water 3 6 mg l water temperature decreases in the order of thermomineral water 46 9 c low mineral thermal water 42 2 c low mineral co2 rich water 15 2 c baseline water 14 4 c high mineral co2 rich water 13 4 c and alkaline mineral water 13 5 c 3 2 hydrogeochemical processes controlling each water type co2 rich water had higher tds than the alkaline mineral water and thermal water types fig 3 notably the ca2 concentrations mean 4 9 mg l in low mineral thermal water 25 8 mg l in thermomineral water of thermal water samples were low while their f concentrations were high mean 7 7 mg l in low mineral thermal water 3 2 mg l in thermomineral water co2 rich water maintained a low ph mean 4 88 in low mineral co2 rich water 5 86 in high mineral co2 rich water while the other water types covered a wide ph range in particular the ph of thermal water types mean 8 93 in low mineral thermal water 8 21 in thermomineral water was relatively high in accordance with tds results the concentrations of ca2 na sio2 aq and hco3 ions increased with tds indicating that these ions led to the increase in tds geochemical reactions involving plagioclase presented as 1 and 2 were the main reactions increasing the levels of dissolved ions in silicate bedrock areas 1 caal2si2o8 2 co2 aq 3 h2o al2si2o5 oh 4 ca2 2 hco3 2 naalsi3o8 co2 aq 11 2 h2o 1 2 al2si2o5 oh 4 na 2 h4sio4 hco3 these reactions can account for higher concentration of major solutes in the majority of co2 rich water in this study notably hco3 concentrations were low in thermomineral water which was likely due to enhanced silicate mineral hydrolysis in the absence of co2 fig 3 differences in the geological distributions of thermomineral water and high mineral co2 rich water are discussed in section 4 the saturation index si of water for a given mineral represents the degree of saturation state with respect to the mineral as undersaturated si 0 supersaturated si 0 and at equilibrium si 0 appelo and postma 2004 the degree of si is defined as the following equation 3 3 s i log iap k eq where iap is the ion activity product and keq is the constant for solubility equilibrium of the mineral the si of chalcedony can be used as a measure of the degree of reaction between silicate minerals and groundwater it was greater than zero for 130 samples which is 75 of total samples and increased with increasing total cation concentrations na k ca2 mg2 except in samples hs13 1 and hs13 2 fig 4 a indicating that silicate hydrolysis is the major process increasing cation concentrations high and low mineral co2 rich waters showed distinctly different trends from other waters in ph and si of calcite diagrams fig s4 this is likely to be mainly controlled by ca2 concentration derived from dissolution of ca silicate minerals fig 4b and s4 the si of fluorite approaches saturation when the f concentration is greater than 2 mg l fig 4c implying that the upper limit of f concentration is controlled by the saturation of fluorite thus in a sample near fluorite saturation f might be reduced due to precipitation of fluorite when ca2 is supplied although the si of gypsum increased with the increase in so4 2 concentration this trend is not related to gypsum dissolution see the small figure in fig 4d the high so4 2 concentration in the sedimentary rock region is likely to originate from pyrite oxidation fig 4d and s3 water types classified based on the three criteria of temperature tds and log pco2 atm were clearly distinguished on a piper diagram in particular separation was good for samples of thermal water na hco3 and na cl types and high mineral co2 rich water ca hco3 type as well as acidic sulfate water and saline water fig 5 ca2 ions were dominant in the baseline water alkaline mineral rich water and co2 rich water types while na ions were dominant in the thermal water types except for high cl or so4 2 levels in some samples of thermomineral water the ratio of hco3 ion was highest among the anions high mineral co2 rich water was mainly of the ca mg hco3 type with some samples of the na hco3 type from the northeastern area containing granitic rocks saline water the na cl type corresponds to thermomineral waters obtained in the southeastern region which are affected by seawater intrusion sulfate is predominant in acidic sulfate waters and some thermomineral waters from the southern area saline water and some thermomineral waters collected in the southeastern coastal area had na cl molar ratios close to the seawater dilution line indicating that they were affected by seawater intrusion fig 6 a the elevated na concentrations of such samples may have been affected by cation exchange of ca2 or mg2 so4 2 concentrations were distinctively higher in sedimentary and andesitic rocks and showed no clear trend with hco3 concentrations this finding indicates that elevated sulfate concentrations in mineralized water are strongly controlled by lithology rather than the degree of mineralization fig 6b thermal water and high mineral co2 rich water had higher sio2 aq concentrations regardless of the degree of mineralization while alkaline mineral water had much lower sio2 aq concentrations especially in areas of carbonate rocks than even most baseline water samples fig 6c this result clearly shows that silicate weathering dominates the chemistry of most natural mineral waters in this study except for alkaline mineral waters hosted in carbonate rocks which had much higher ca2 na molar ratios due to carbonate mineral dissolution fig 6d mg2 ca2 molar ratios were relatively high in waters from dolomitic areas but were consistently less than 0 5 indicating that calcite dissolution is favored over dolomite dissolution fig 6e thermal water groups had elevated f concentrations and relatively low ca2 concentrations fig 6f indicating the possibility of the removal of ca2 through precipitation of caco3 or ion exchange of ca2 reactions involving ca2 and f are analyzed in more detail in the discussion section four principal components pcs were extracted from hydrogeochemical measurements of natural mineral water samples excluding acidic sulfate and saline waters which explained about 84 of the total variance fig 7 table s3 since a component loading in pca results represent correlation between variable and component the loading value can be either positive or negative pc1 accounted for 27 of the variance and had strong positive loadings for ca2 hco3 sio2 aq mg2 fe and co2 which are indicators of interactions between co2 charged water and easily weatherable rocks this finding corroborated the high pc1 scores for high mineral co2 rich water and alkaline mineral water pc2 explained 26 of total variance and had strong positive loadings for na cl f and k this component was highly correlated with thermomineral water representing mineralization in geothermal areas pc3 19 of variance had a highly positive loading for co2 and highly negative loading for ph but minimal loadings for other hydrochemical parameters aside from mg2 and fe the low mineral co2 rich water samples such as kn01 kn04 and ms110 were fairly well represented by this component table s2 pc4 13 of variance had a strong negative loading for no3 and was closely related to baseline water with less impact from nitrate contamination 3 3 effect of geological setting on the occurrence of mineral and thermal waters we analyzed the relationships between lithology and selected hydrochemical parameters for the thermal and mineral water types fig 8 most thermal waters including thermomineral water and low mineral thermal water were distributed in granitic rocks and a small proportion of samples was from sedimentary and andesitic rocks in thermal waters dic levels were higher in granitic rocks than in sedimentary and andesitic rocks although tds were much higher in sedimentary and andesitic rocks this finding implies that mineralization of groundwater in granitic rocks is driven by co2 rich water while that in sedimentary and andesitic rocks is not the median ca2 na molar ratio was about 0 2 indicating na rich mineral water fig 8a table s2 which resulted from the increase in na concentrations associated with the dissolution of albite eq 2 in section 3 2 elevated so4 2 concentrations median 141 4 mg l were found mainly in thermal waters located in sedimentary rocks in the southeastern part of the korean peninsula while samples of thermal water located in granitic rocks had the highest f concentrations median 3 3 mg l most mineral water samples were located in granitic rocks and metamorphic rocks prior to collection fig 8b while alkaline mineral waters were found in sedimentary rocks and carbonate rocks the dic levels of mineral waters in granitic rocks and metamorphic rocks were high indicating mantle and magmatic co2 in contrast the dic levels of mineral water in carbonate rocks were much lower than those in other lithologies implying little influence of mantle and magmatic co2 the most extensive carbonate rocks are located in the northeastern part of south korea which are a siliciclastic carbonate succession from cambrian to ordovician in age and underwent strong deformation and weak to moderate metamorphism choi and chough 2005 these lithological characteristics lead to lower reactivity of the carbonate rocks most of alkaline mineral water in carbonate rocks has similar or lower co2 aq concentration compared to that of baseline water indicating closed systems are dominant fig 2 these features could account for the lower dic in mineral water in the carbonate rocks previous studies have shown that faults and granitic rocks play a major role in determining the occurrence of co2 rich water and geothermal water in south korea jeong et al 2005 analyzed the hydrochemical and geological properties of 61 co2 rich springs on the korean peninsula and reported that most co2 rich waters were located in mesozoic granitic rocks and surrounding areas and were mainly related to those geologic structures lee et al 2014 analyzed the physical and chemical features of 281 non volcanic geothermal waters and estimated the spatial relationship between hot spas and geological faults they found that the length of the main fault may be key parameters determining the occurrence of geothermal water in this study mineral and thermal waters other than baseline waters were located primarily at granitic rock boundaries fig 9 which is consistent with previous works meanwhile alkaline mineral water had little association with granitic rock boundaries and faults and its occurrence instead appeared to be controlled mainly by the presence of carbonate and sedimentary rocks which are more readily weatherable than granitic and metamorphic rocks alkaline mineral water had high concentrations of ca2 mg2 and hco3 in carbonate rocks and high so4 2 concentrations in sedimentary rocks carbonate and sedimentary rock regions are located in the mountainous eastern part of the korean peninsula where groundwater can circulate deeply which may have led to a greater degree of mineralization which is strongly related to bedrock characteristics smedley 2010 pacheco 2015 the distance from lithologic boundaries of granitic rocks and fault lines to each sampling location was estimated through spatial analysis to identify geological settings that affect co2 rich water discharge and geothermal potential the occurrence of co2 rich water and thermal water reflected the distance of granitic rock boundaries and faults fig 10 however the relationship between distance from a fault and the number of co2 rich water and thermal water samples was unclear and thermal water was generally found within 1 km of a fault the number of such samples showed a slight rebound at distances of more than 3 km from fault lines as the distance from a granitic rock boundary increased further the decreasing tendencies of the numbers of samples containing co2 rich and thermal waters strengthened thermal water was not observed at greater than 2 km from the granitic rock boundary 3 4 occurrence of health related solutes in natural mineral waters among major dissolved constituents mg2 f and no3 were selected as solutes related to human health chen et al 2017 the drinking water limit dwl for f is 1 5 mg l who 1994 fluoride in drinking water has a narrow optimal concentration range in relation to human health if the concentration of f in drinking water is low 0 7 1 2 mg l it has the effect of preventing dental erosion but concentrations ranging from 1 5 to 5 0 mg l and exceeding 5 0 mg l cause dental fluorosis and skeletal fluorosis respectively heller et al 1997 ayoob and gupta 2006 chae et al 2007 reported that the median f concentrations of deep groundwaters according to aquifer lithology were 7 1 5 6 and 1 6 in metamorphic rocks granitic rocks and sedimentary rocks respectively in this study the higher f concentrations were observed mainly in groundwater samples collected at or near granitic rock boundaries fig 11 a f rich groundwater is also found in some sedimentary and volcanic rocks in the southeastern part of the korean peninsula which could be due to the presence of f rich granite in deep layers kim and jeong 2005 in this study the f concentrations of natural mineral waters ranged from 0 01 to 10 5 median 0 11 mg l higher f concentrations were observed in thermal water median 3 3 mg l and co2 rich water median 0 42 mg l in the granitic rock region while the lowest f concentration was found in carbonate rocks median 0 05 mg l fig 8 this difference clearly shows that lithology strongly affects f concentrations in mineral and thermal waters except for deep wells at hot spas most samples were from springs implying that faults extending to the surface may be another factor controlling the occurrence of high f groundwater kim and jeong 2005 reported that high f concentrations were observed in groundwaters near a fault zone and particularly in granitic areas magnesium and calcium are major minerals needed for body composition and health and mg is a cofactor for more than 300 enzymes that play key roles in the human body and metabolism gröber et al 2015 statistically significant benefits to human health were reported when water with mg2 concentrations over 10 mg l was used as drinking water who 2009 mg2 also helps to prevent coronary heart disease and low mg2 is associated with a high incidence of acute myocardial infarction ami kousa et al 2008 in this study co2 rich water had elevated mg2 concentrations min max 1 4 84 2 mg l median value 15 6 mg l compared to other water types alkaline mineral water also had high mg2 concentrations min max 2 7 39 mg l median value 14 0 mg l in particular the levels in samples from dolomitic carbonate rocks were up to 28 mg l in contrast the median mg2 concentrations were 1 9 0 1 and 0 1 mg l for baseline water low mineral thermal water and thermomineral water respectively fig 11b table 2 nitrate is the main source of groundwater contamination and is related mainly to anthropogenic factors such as manure and chemical fertilizers in rural areas although the risk level of no3 n for human health varies depending on the water uses risk factors and country the drinking water standard for no3 n is 10 mg l in south korea and who and the no3 n levels higher than the guideline value can cause methemoglobinemia who 1996 a threshold value of 3 mg l as no3 n has been suggested as an indicator of anthropogenic contamination medison and brunett 1985 the majority of natural mineral water sources in this study are located in mountainous areas where significant levels of nitrate contamination are not expected measured nitrate concentrations were in the range of 0 1 to 103 mg l 0 01 to 23 3 mg l as no3 n with a median of 2 0 mg l 0 5 mg l as no3 n about 10 of samples exceeded the threshold for anthropogenic contamination and one sample ms048 exceeded the drinking water standard regionally exceedances of the anthropogenic nitrate threshold were 13 2 and 4 1 of samples in the western and eastern areas respectively except for jeju and ulleung islands fig 11c high nitrate concentration was most common in baseline water from the western areas where agricultural land uses are prevalent in combination with a higher human population density this finding implies that the establishment of adequate management and effective remedial measures is needed to protect and improve the water quality of natural mineral waters that receive sizable human impacts including excessive contaminant loadings and development pressures which could improve the health of both impacted people and ecosystems 4 discussion 4 1 role of geological setting in the mineralization of natural mineral waters in this study we confirmed that traditionally used natural mineral waters in south korea could be classified into baseline mineral and thermal waters based on the three criteria of tds co2 and temperature the mineral and thermal waters were further subdivided into several types of water these results imply that the main drivers of the mineralization of mineral and thermal waters in crystalline bedrock dominated regions such as south korea are co2 supply geothermal conditions and lithology more specifically the types of water were closely related to their geological settings such as boundaries of granitic rocks and faults as well as lithological factors such as the presence of carbonate rocks which readily react with water among the mineral rich water types alkaline mineral water high mineral co2 rich water and thermomineral water the average tds was highest in high mineral co2 rich water this result indicates that continuous supply of co2 is the most important factor for natural mineralization as has been suggested in previous studies of co2 rich water in korea kim et al 2008 koh et al 2008 and other areas aires barros et al 1998 marques et al 2000 regarding this classification it is noteworthy that subjectivity based on expert knowledge in the configuration process of environmental sciences including the hydrogeological modeling approach can have considerable influence on the results melsen et al 2019 the characteristics of the study area were reflected in selection of the classification criteria and determination of their threshold values which can be variable depending on data sets and methods of data analysis for similar studies the criteria and factors constraining specific water types need to be identified and their threshold values determined considering regional patterns of hydrogeochemical hydrogeological and geological characteristics of the study area tectonic settings have a fundamental impact on thermal state of the crust and geothermal activities which were classified into convection and conduction dominated systems moeck 2014 the convection dominated systems mainly appear in active plate margins with volcanism and plutonism and have high thermal energy even at a relatively shallow depth whereas the conduction dominated systems are found in passive tectonic plate settings with sedimentary basins or crystalline bedrocks which are consisted of intracratonic basin type orogenic belt type and basement type in this study it is assumed that thermal water is associated with the basement type of conduction dominated systems kim 2004 the heat source is likely to be supplied from the remnant of granitic host rocks considering spatial correlations between occurrence of thermal water and granitic rock boundaries fig 10 the source of co2 gas in natural mineral waters is commonly magmatic processes associated with the formation of granitic rocks and the gas is supplied to groundwater through permeable structures mayo and muller 1997 previous studies have shown that co2 rich water had no geothermal signature in south korea where recent magmatism and significant tectonic activity are not known except on jeju and ulleung volcanic islands kim et al 2008 thus the co2 dissolved in mineral water originates from co2 trapped inside granitic rocks when magma cooled schofield and jankiwski 2004 the majority of igneous rocks on the korean peninsula are composed of daebo granite and bulguksa granite from the jurassic and cretaceous eras chough et al 2000 previous studies have shown that mesozoic granitoids are closely related to the distribution of co2 rich waters jeong et al 2005 in this study the correlation between the period of magmatic intrusion for granite and the distribution of co2 rich water was analyzed for granitic rocks throughout south korea fig 12 most co2 rich water was located around early and middle jurassic granitic rocks which are the youngest among the granitic rocks in south korea aside from the cretaceous and paleogene granites in the southeastern region fig 12 this result shows that the supply of co2 from deep sources remains active around the most recently intruded granitic rocks some co2 rich waters were collected in sedimentary rocks in the southeastern part of south korea which were located at the boundary between sedimentary and granitic rocks fig 1 however these water samples were likely associated with granitic rocks as they had hydrogeochemical features similar to those obtained from granitic rocks the co2 rich water analyzed in this study was highly mineralized with elevated levels of mg2 f fe and mn in most samples excluding low mineral co2 rich water sources located near the center of the korean peninsula which were characterized by low ph and low tds based on proximity analysis the occurrence of thermomineral water and co2 rich water was concentrated near granitic rock boundaries or faults and decreased about 1 km away from both features fig 10 regions of high heat flow in the korean peninsula are the jurassic and cretaceous granite regions of the mesozoic era kim 2004 which are closely associated with young fault zones and lineament density sass et al 1997 faults also act as flow paths for deep hot springs geothermal groundwater and co2 gas cerón et al 2000 and mesozoic granites contain co2 gas that may be derived from deep seated sources of magma or the mantle jeong et al 2005 these findings imply that the thermomineral and co2 rich waters in this study formed around granitic rocks and were transported to the surface environment through faults co2 rich and thermal waters were not found in the southeastern part of the korean peninsula which is more tectonically active with multiple recent earthquakes of ml 5 0 lee et al 2019b such waters were also scarce in cretaceous granitic rocks except for a few thermal water sites fig 12 this result indicates that magmatic activities during the jurassic era and more recently have different characteristics in terms of deep co2 and thermal history which requires further study the limitation of this approach is that considerable uncertainties exist in their exact location depth and extents since the faults and boundaries between lithology were compiled from the regional geological maps in this respect it is needed to evaluate the hydrogeological and geochemical processes of mineral water through detailed field surveys for proper assessment of specific springs or spring groups in the further study 4 2 geochemical reactions constraining mg and f concentrations in natural mineral waters one plausible reaction supplying magnesium and fluoride to mineral waters is the dissolution of biotite as it is common in granitic rocks of south korea and is readily weatherable in the minerals comprising granitic rocks chae et al 2006 bray et al 2015 incongruent dissolution of biotite in anoxic groundwater can be expressed using the representative biotite stoichiometry of granitic rocks in eastern canada shabani et al 2003 k0 94 mg0 95feii 1 24mn0 04feiii 0 20al0 30 ti0 12 al1 26si2 73 o10 oh1 8f0 2 5 72 co2 aq 5 86 h2o 4 0 78 al2si2o5 oh 4 0 94 k 0 95 mg2 1 17 h4sio4 1 24 fe2 0 20 fe3 0 04 mn2 0 2f 0 12 tio2 5 72 hco3 this reaction indicates that considerable fluoride and magnesium as well as iron and manganese could be derived from the interaction of co2 charged water with granitic rocks which is consistent with the locations of thermomineral water and high mineral co2 rich water observed in this study notably mg2 concentrations were below 0 2 mg l in all low mineral thermal waters and the majority of thermomineral waters which also had strongly alkaline ph levels of 7 7 9 6 n 19 mean 8 6 and high temperatures of 36 81 c n 18 mean 52 c excluding one sample at 28 c these levels were much lower than the average and median mg2 concentrations in water obtained from granitic rocks of 7 6 and 2 2 mg l the mg deficiency of alkaline thermal water might be attributed to the formation of chlorite which consumes mg2 from the water nordstrom et al 1989 or alteration of biotite to chlorite while retaining mg in the solid phase clow et al 1997 for mineralized water in granitic rocks the fact that lower mg2 concentrations were found only in thermal waters indicates that these reactions are less significant under non thermal conditions as thermodynamic solubility control of secondary silicates is unlikely at low temperatures nordstrom et al 1989 as described in sections 3 2 and 3 4 f concentrations were controlled by dissolution of f bearing minerals and fluorite saturation the concentrations of f and ca2 increase along the fluorite dissolution line fig 13 a when fluorite dissolves from bedrock rich in fluorite most samples analyzed in this study fell to the right side of the fluorite dissolution line indicating that their ca2 originated from minerals e g equation 4 other than fluorite in other words the sources of ca2 and f were different on the other hand f concentrations can be reduced through the common ion effect when ca2 concentrations increase due to dissolution of minerals such as ca silicate and calcite fig 13a conversely if insufficient ca2 is supplied high f concentrations can be maintained therefore the samples with high f had lower ca2 contents than that associated with fluorite saturation implying that ca2 ions are removed from groundwater through calcite precipitation or ion exchange rather than fluorite precipitation fig 13a chae et al 2007 the relationship between the si of calcite and f concentrations shows that water with a high f content is near saturation of calcite fig 13b indicating that the high f content of mineralized water in this study was maintained by the removal of ca2 through precipitation of calcite 4 3 impacts of groundwater use on spring discharge spring discharge can be affected by groundwater pumping due to the connectivity between groundwater and surface water and changes in groundwater flow system at the various spatial scales sophocleous 2002 chu et al 2017 condon and maxwell 2019 in this study most of mineral springs are located in the mountainous northeastern region with negligible farmlands and urban areas figs 1 and 11c thus those mineral springs in the mountainous region are less likely to be affected by groundwater uses as well as anthropogenic contamination by contrast springs near populated areas and extensive agricultural lands in the plane western region are more likely to be under human impacts which was corroborated by elevated nitrate levels in that region fig 11c these environmental conditions suggest that spring discharge can be also significantly affected by intensive groundwater abstraction in the areas with higher development pressure actually considerable drawdown in groundwater level and even drying out have been reported in some spring sites due to overexploitation of groundwater onyang spa hs08 was a naturally flowing hot spring before 1910 however the artesian pressure was broken and shallow cold groundwater was introduced by intensive pumping of deep groundwater up to about 1 3 million m3 year 1 kim et al 2005 in bugok spa area hs15 exploitation of geothermal water rapidly increased since early 1970 s resulting in severe drawdown in depth to water level from near surface to as low as 400 m in late 1990 s yun et al 1998 spring discharge in chojeong mineral water ms039 was decreased due to excessive pumping at a nearby bottled water company ham 2013 it was also been reported that the spring discharge of osaek mineral water ms014 was affected by groundwater use at the nearby hotels lee et al 2004 these cases of severe deterioration in spring discharge clearly show that impacts of human activities on natural mineral water sources need to be evaluated for variation of spring discharge and water quality parameters at present quantification and trend analysis of changes in the spring discharge for majority of the natural mineral water sources in this study are not feasible because of lack of long term monitoring data in order to protect traditionally well known mineral waters and use them sustainably mineral water sources need to be monitored for temporal variations of physical parameters including spring discharge and temperature and water quality and hydrochemical parameters on a continuous or at least periodical basis 5 conclusions traditionally used mineral waters in south korea including springs and hot spas were classified using three criteria of tds content dissolved co2 and water temperature resulting in six major water types the dominant type was baseline water which had low tds low co2 and an ambient temperature typical of shallow groundwater along with short flow paths from topographically driven local flow systems in crystalline bedrocks alkaline mineral water occurred in carbonate rocks and to a lesser extent in sedimentary rocks and clearly showed that bedrock lithology was the main determinant of its hydrogeochemical features in contrast the occurrence of co2 rich water and thermal water was strongly controlled by geological factors and these water types were distributed mainly near faults and the boundaries of granitic rocks specifically the early to middle jurassic granitic rocks which are among the youngest plutonic rocks in south korea the boundaries between granitic rocks and surrounding rock types are likely to play a key role in the supply of heat and mantle and magmatic co2 with faults acting as flow paths linking deep sources with groundwater flow systems allowing discharge into the surface environment which was clearly revealed by proximity analysis co2 rich water and thermal water were further classified into low mineral and high mineral subtypes based on their tds contents with high mineral types dominant in both water types two minor water types were acidic sulfate water found in sedimentary rocks of inland areas in the southeastern region and saline water near the coast silicate hydrolysis was the major reaction determining the hydrogeochemical features of all major water types except for alkaline mineral water which had much lower sio2 aq concentrations higher ca2 na levels and lower mg2 ca2 contents in carbonate rocks and higher so4 2 concentrations in sedimentary rocks dissolution reactions of feldspar provide major solutes while biotite may supply minor ones including mg2 f and fe which are greatly enhanced by the input of mantle and magmatic co2 and geothermal heat between these co2 inclusion contributes more to natural mineralization sinks of mg and f which were considered health related solutes in this study were also considered a considerable portion of natural mineral waters are saturated or slightly oversaturated with respect to calcite and fluorite which implies the major processes controlling f concentration the negligible mg2 concentration in alkaline thermal water was attributed to the formation of mg bearing secondary silicates such as chlorite nitrate contamination was not significant in most natural mineral water samples due to the scarcity of contamination sources near the mountainous sites compared to domestic groundwater sources however some waters in the western plain area had considerably higher nitrate concentration indicating that water quality was degraded by anthropogenic impacts the various types of natural mineral water analyzed in this study are known for their distinct physical and chemical properties they have traditionally been used for drinking medical and bathing purposes for a long time and are commonly thought to provide health benefits apart from human usage they are also unique natural resources with cultural and ecological values we classified natural mineral waters in diverse geological settings at the national scale by establishing the criteria based on the hydrogeochemical and thermal characteristics and identified the major factors controlling the occurrence of each water type related to faults and lithologic boundaries considerable decreases in discharge and storage of the water sources due to the influence of excessive groundwater abstraction were previously reported for some of the springs in this study which suggests that further studies need to be focused on long term monitoring of physical and water quality parameters of natural mineral waters to facilitate protection and sustainable use of the water sources this study may provide insights into the origin and transport mechanisms of natural mineral waters in other areas with similar geological settings and may also contribute to the sustainable use of natural mineral waters as a natural resource through improved understanding of the
