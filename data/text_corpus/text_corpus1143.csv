5715,ground penetrating radar gpr is a convenient tool for volumetric soil water content vswc estimation in hydrological and agricultural studies although case studies have been widely carried out little attention has been paid to subsoil moisture estimates in this research we investigated three dimensional soil moisture variation down to a depth of 1 m and the effect of rainfall events on spatial soil moisture dynamics gpr surveying lines were conducted both before and after a heavy rainfall event to map the vswc soil sampling and time domain reflectometry tdr probe data at different depths 20 40 60 80 and 100 cm were acquired our results demonstrated that there was a significant correlation between the dielectric constants and vswcs at all depths the established relationships for the different depth ranges had a low vswc discrepancy when the dielectric constants ranged from 10 to 15 the effective range of each variogram was larger than 20 m except for that of the 0 100 cm vswc map after rainfall in addition the validation diagrams using corrected tdr values demonstrated relatively reliable vswc maps approximately 89 of the variation in vswc could be explained by the dielectric constants in the depth range of 0 40 cm and vswc predictions at this soil depth outperformed those at other depth ranges with an overall rmse of 0 027 m3 m 3 and r2 of 0 725 furthermore we also monitored the effect of precipitation on the accuracy of the vswc prediction on shallow surfaces our study shows that three dimensional soil moisture dynamics can be accurately estimated at the field scale by integrating gpr interpretation and spatial extrapolation methods keywords ground wave method soil water content subsoil geostatistics red soil 1 introduction soil water content is a vital indicator to characterize earth s critical zone and is an essential parameter in climatology hydrology agriculture and meteorology studies lin 2010 kirkby 2016 vereecken et al 2016 however characterizing midscale soil water dynamics has remained a challenge because of the considerable spatial heterogeneity of soil horizons soil texture and agricultural management practices klenk et al 2015 there are many methods for measuring soil moisture at the point scale including the gravimetric method the neutron method the γ ray method and time domain reflectometry tdr robinson et al 2008 these methods are relatively time consuming laborious and destructive to the soil the satellite remote sensing method which is easily affected by vegetation cover can obtain the topsoil water content distribution at the regional scale starks et al 2006 wang and qu 2009 because of their inappropriate investigation scopes depth and resolution these two types of methods cannot adequately capture detailed soil hydrodynamic behavior at the midscale i e field or catchment over the last twenty years electromagnetic geophysical methods including electric resistivity tomography and ground penetrating radar gpr have been used to bridge that gap binley et al 2002 deiana et al 2008 brunet et al 2010 wijewardana and galagedara 2010 garré et al 2012 shamir et al 2016 in particular gpr offers the advantages of nondestructive high precision measurements and a large depth of detection and it is suitable for a variety of geological conditions the application of different gpr techniques is increasing weihermüller et al 2007 cross borehole gpr has been successfully employed for finding preferential flow paths klotzsche et al 2012 zhang et al 2014 and estimating soil moisture content and hydraulic properties based on coupled inversion models kowalsky et al 2004 haarder et al 2012 gueting et al 2017 in recent years the vertical radar profile technique has been shown to be more convenient than cross borehole radar due to the presence of a single borehole but this method must avoid emerging direct waves that interfere critically with refracted waves strobach et al 2014 tronicke and hamann 2014 lambot and andre 2014 developed an off ground i e air launched gpr technique to calculate the shallow subsurface soil hydraulic properties in near field conditions but off ground radar is restricted to surface roughness in addition traditional on ground gpr has been widely used to measure the volumetric soil water content vswc pan et al 2012 found that the spatiotemporal variations in soil moisture in typical farmland were related to vegetation growth steelman and endres 2011 conducted complete field research on three soil textures using the high frequency direct ground wave method a number of studies have reported that the gpr ground wave technique is a common way to monitor shallow vswc compared to the results of the tdr and gravimetric methods galagedara et al 2005 klenk et al 2011 steelman et al 2012 the more suitable the empirical formula between the dielectric constant and the vswc is the higher the detection accuracy of gpr empirical equations based on indoor simulated tests topp et al 1980 roth et al 1992 volumetric mixing formulas dobson et al 1985 herkelrath et al 1991 and effective medium rough evaluations in view of soil models sen 1984 endres and bertrand 2006 have been attempted to convert the dielectric constant into vswc however many of these relationships have not yet been calibrated in the field using gpr technology therefore it is necessary to collect gpr measurements in situ and obtain actual calibrated petrophysical relationships for the estimation of vswc the sampling depths and time zero calibration in complicated soil types are also a concern for the gpr ground wave method steelman and endres 2011 demonstrated that the gpr sampling depth was affected by the antenna frequency and soil texture meanwhile surface roughness tillage management and bedrock distribution may be potential factors affecting gpr measurements jonard et al 2012 ardekani 2013 jonard et al 2013 many studies could retrieve vswc at only a single depth due to the limited experimental time and verification techniques grote et al 2003 steelman and endres 2010 consequently it is necessary to develop proper empirical models for ground wave methods for various soil depth ranges in this study the application of the gpr ground wave technique was investigated to quantify field scale vswc dynamics the petrophysical empirical relationships of different depth ranges were quantified to enhance the measurement accuracy in which the gpr sampling depth and time zero calibration were achieved under the common midpoint cmp survey mode the effects of land use and precipitation on the spatial pattern of vswc were determined 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area 3 2 ha is an agricultural field located in the sunjia watershed in the southern part of yingtan city jiangxi province china fig 1 which has been established as the red soil critical zone observatory tahir et al 2016 wu et al 2019 this area is characterized by a subtropical monsoon climate with a mean annual precipitation of 1795 mm a mean annual temperature of 17 8 c and a frost free period of 258 days gao et al 2016 the slope of the watershed is approximately 6 and the altitude is between 53 4 and 61 1 m quaternary red clay and red sandstone are the parent materials upland and citrus orchards are common land use types in the study area accounting for 79 and 19 respectively gao et al 2016 tahir et al 2016 2 2 soil analysis the soils in the sunjia watershed were dominated by ultisol based on usda soil taxonomy soil survey staff 2010 six soil profiles were excavated to help determine the soil properties fig 1 mixed and undisturbed soil samples were collected from the uplands and orchards with a 100 cm3 cutting ring with three replicates each at 0 20 20 40 40 60 60 80 and 80 100 cm depths in january 2018 the mixed soil was used to determine the particle size distribution clay 2 μm silt 2 50 μm and sand 50 2000 μm using a laser grain size analyzer beckman coulter ls230 usa after pretreatment including air drying grinding and passing through a 2 mm sieve the cutting ring soil samples were used to obtain the soil bulk density detailed information regarding the soil properties is presented in table 1 2 3 vswc data collection in the sampling area custom built polyvinyl chloride pipes diameter 0 05 m length 2 m were installed at 32 sites fig 1 we measured the vswc at depths of 0 20 20 40 40 60 60 80 and 80 100 cm using a matched portable bluetooth probe imko tdr ettlingen germany the success or failure of the representation of the vswc by tdr depends on the accuracy of the invoked calibration because our tdr accuracy was 2 the mass soil water contents of the soil samples at the same depth were calculated by weight loss at 105 3 c after oven drying for at least 24 h the tdr calibration y 0 94x 0 0176 was obtained from the gravimetric method data and the coefficient of determination r2 value was 0 88 the average vswcs of the 0 20 0 40 0 60 0 80 and 0 100 cm depths were used for the gpr sampling depth analysis the tdr and gpr measurements were carried out simultaneously due to the limited soil profiles we analyzed the correlations between vswcs and soil properties at different depths together fig 2 a significant negative correlation was found between vswc and sand content p 0 05 fig 2a whereas vswc was positively correlated with silt content p 0 05 fig 2b which was consistent with recent studies fang et al 2016 lai et al 2018 wang et al 2019 in theory when the soil water contents of the 0 20 and 20 40 cm depths are known the soil water content of the 0 40 cm depth can be calculated using an average function the vswc from the surface soil to a depth could be computed by weighing the vswc at fixed depth increments e g 20 cm as specified in eq 1 1 θ 0 d 20 d i 1 d 20 θ 20 i 1 20 i d 40 60 80 100 where d is the soil depth cm and θ0 d is the vswc at a depth of 0 d cm furthermore the vswcs at soil depth ranges of 20 40 40 60 60 80 and 80 100 cm could be iteratively derived by eq 2 2 θ d d 20 θ 0 d 20 d 20 1 θ 0 d d 20 d 20 40 60 80 where θd d 20 is the vswc at a depth of d d 20 cm 2 4 gpr system and ground wave method 2 4 1 ground wave method in this study a geological radar akula 9000c sweden was used that had two 60 mhz bowtie transmitting t and receiving r antennas the ground wave method includes two measuring modes cmp and fixed offset fo the effective detection depth is inversely proportional to the antenna frequency of the radar the lower the antenna frequency is the deeper the detection depth in general the effective detection depth of the 60 mhz antenna is greater than 8 m which fully meets the depth requirements of this study correlation analysis between dielectric constants and observed vswcs at different soil depths was performed to verify whether the vswc could be significantly detected and which depth range was the most accurate when passing through a complicated soil medium electromagnetic waves are emitted by the transmitting antenna then the air ground reflected and refracted waves are distinguished by the receiving antennas fig 3 the radar signal at each measurement point was recorded with a time window of 400 ns by stacking 24 scans and discretizing 600 samples a dewow 1d filter and static correction were used to obtain the critical information the automatic gain control agc gain was applied to each radar trace to strengthen the signals in deep soil then we used the finite impulse response method to retain the ricker type electromagnetic pulse with a 25 130 mhz frequency bandwidth the cmp measurements were carried out to estimate the gpr sampling depth of the vswc calibrate the time zero t0 of the ground wave and fit a suitable petrophysical relationship the transmitting and receiving antennas shifted in opposite directions fig 3c in which the total length of one surveyed line was 5 m and the moving step length of each antenna was 0 05 m when zero antenna offset occurs the air wave and ground wave will not be received simultaneously due to the radar configuration huisman et al 2001 steelman and endres 2010 the propagation velocity of the electromagnetic wave v could be inferred by the slope of the ground wave from the radargram fig 4 a the dielectric constant ε is calculated using the following equation 3 ε c v 2 where v is the speed of the ground wave and c is the propagation velocity of the electromagnetic wave in a vacuum 0 3 m ns 1 since the ground wave is transmitted from the transmitting antenna to the receiving antenna through the surface soil the effective inversion depth of the ground wave method starts at 0 cm single trace analysis was commonly used to obtain the electromagnetic wave velocity from on ground radar signals in fo mode huisman et al 2001 galagedara et al 2003 fig 3d in which the transmitting and receiving antennas moved in the same directions fig 3d the arrival time of the air wave taw and ground wave tgw at 1 0 m antenna separation can be captured to calculate the velocity of electromagnetic waves v through the surface soil fig 4b 4 v x x c t gw t 0 t aw where x is the antenna spacing 1 0 m and t 0 is time zero 2 4 2 gpr data collection in the current study area the top 1 m of soil uniform red clay was characterized by homogeneous granular aggregates that could be considered to be clay loam wu et al 2019 and the soil texture was generally invariable along the soil profiles table 1 gao et al 2016 it could be inferred that the magnetic properties of the top 1 m of soil were similar or even the same as they had very similar color hu et al 2014 subsurface structure wu et al 2019 and clay minerals tang et al 2008 thus it was assumed that the dielectric constants were the same in the top 1 m of soil data collection was divided into two experiments cmp measurement and fo measurement one cmp surveying line could derive only one dielectric constant while one fo line could derive many dielectric constant values the cmp method was accurate but time consuming while the fo method was convenient fast and suitable for large scale measurement notably there was little difference between the dielectric constants obtained by the cmp method and those obtained by the fo method huisman et al 2003 thus gpr data from the cmp method were adopted as the baseline for calibrating the time zero and the fit of the empirical function between vswcs and dielectric constants these empirical functions were utilized to calculate vswc data based on the dielectric constants derived from the fo method and the new vswc data were then used to predict the spatiotemporal variations in vswc for both experiments we considered different land use types and spatiotemporal variability the cmp experiment was conducted during three time periods 14 16 january 15 17 march and 17 18 july 2018 and vswc data were recorded simultaneously the midpoint of the cmp line was very near one tdr site approximately 10 20 cm rather than directly passing through the tdr site fig 1 as buried pipes will affect the propagation of electromagnetic waves a total of 32 cmp soundings were conducted and thus 32 dielectric constant values were obtained which can correspond to each tdr value the mean time zero t0 was calculated from the wavelet fig 4a the propagation velocity of radar waves was estimated by the velocity stack in a constant velocity earth travassos and menezes 2004 forte and pipan 2017 and the dielectric constant was further derived by eq 3 fo measurements are the key to achieving regional soil water content observations all two dimensional gpr fo surveying lines were conducted with 1 0 m antenna separation on 21 and 25 july 2018 fig 1c we adopted duplicated measurements to control the survey quality the electromagnetic wave information was recorded per 1 m in the field the dielectric constant was calculated from these electromagnetic waves every 3 m in which adjacent waves were not used for the calculation but for data quality control for example 10 dielectric constants can be generated from a 30 m fo line in addition if one measurement point was very near the tdr location electromagnetic waves at this point were recorded three times and the average value was taken as the final result finally a total of 324 paired sample points were obtained from 12 radar lines fig 1c before and after rainfall events we did not show the spatial distribution of these points as the interval of adjacent points was 3 m and the high sampling density would crowd fig 1 the propagation velocity of the ground wave can be calculated by incorporating the parameters of arrival time i e taw and tgw fig 4b into eq 4 2 5 statistical and geostatistical analyses one way analysis of variance anova was adopted to test if the vswc was significantly different at five soil depths p 0 05 the normality of the dependent variable should be evaluated before spatial prediction in this study the derived vswc values were normally distributed through the analysis of quantile quantile qq plots and histograms all vswc data at different soil depths exhibited a square trend when performing the trend analysis the vswc values derived by the fo method were interpolated by ordinary kriging ok ok is a widely used geostatistical model that uses a series of statistical tools to predict the soil properties vswc in this study at unsampled locations a semivariogram is a continuous function for describing the spatial variability of soil properties positive definite models exponential functions and automated fitting procedures were used to approximate the variograms spatial interpolations were evaluated by tdr values in terms of the correlation coefficient r r2 and root mean square error rmse the spatial heterogeneity of vswcs was quantified by statistical indices such as the maximum minimum average values standard deviation std and coefficient of variation cv gpr data were processed in reflexw 8 5 software the statistical analysis mapping and map visualization were performed using sas 9 2 software r 3 3 1 with packages gstat and raster and arcgis 10 3 software respectively the formula between the dielectric constants and vswcs was fitted with origin 8 6 software 3 results 3 1 effective sampling depth of the gpr ground wave method as described in section 2 4 1 the effective sampling depth was verified in accordance with the correlation coefficient r table 2 which was obtained from linear regression analysis of the in situ calibrated vswcs of tdr and the soil dielectric constants ε obtained from 32 cmp soundings the r values were greater than 0 53 in all depth ranges and were greater than 0 74 when the depth of the bottom layer was 60 cm it was suggested that there was a strong correlation between the dielectric constant of the ground wave and the vswc in different layers this result was different from that of steelman and endres 2011 which might be ascribed to the low frequency of radar antennas and the small difference in the soil water content in the homogeneous laterite layer 3 2 the suitable petrophysical relationship the vswcs in the depth ranges of 0 20 0 40 0 60 0 80 and 0 100 cm were computed according to eq 1 five empirical nonlinear formulas between the dielectric constants and vswcs at these five depths were established which were referred to as f0 20 f0 40 f0 60 f0 80 and f0 100 5 f 0 20 θ 0 20 2 68 10 1 8 67 10 2 ε 4 8 10 3 ε 2 9 1 10 5 ε 3 r 2 0 66 6 f 0 40 θ 0 40 2 23 10 1 7 67 10 2 ε 4 17 10 3 ε 2 8 31 10 5 ε 3 r 2 0 89 7 f 0 60 θ 0 60 1 48 10 1 1 26 10 4 ε 8 8 10 4 ε 2 2 29 10 5 ε 3 r 2 0 67 8 f 0 80 θ 0 80 3 81 10 1 5 12 10 2 ε 4 45 10 3 ε 2 1 01 10 4 ε 3 r 2 0 47 9 f 0 100 θ 0 100 2 74 10 1 3 61 10 2 ε 3 86 10 3 ε 2 9 58 10 5 ε 3 r 2 0 58 where ε denotes the dielectric constant of the top 1 m of soil and θ 0 20 θ 0 40 θ 0 60 θ 0 80 and θ 0 100 denote the vswcs at soil depths of 0 20 0 40 0 60 0 80 and 0 100 cm respectively the fitting results of these five models showed that at least 47 of the vswc could be accounted for interestingly the r2 was 0 89 for the f0 40 model and declined to 0 66 for the f0 20 model the surface roughness of the 0 20 cm soil was frequently affected by agricultural tillage which may change the propagation path of the electromagnetic wave and thus lead to poor fitting the r2 of the f0 60 model was 0 67 but the r2 of the f0 80 model was only 0 47 this difference may be due to the existence of a compacted layer with more soil moisture between 60 and 80 cm which makes electromagnetic waves more easily attenuated when the electromagnetic waves passed through the compacted layer the r2 of the f0 100 model moderately increased to 0 58 these models are presented in fig 5 for visual comparison in which the soil dielectric constant ranges from 5 to 25 the petrophysical relationships optimized by data from the five depths eqs 5 9 had small differences when the dielectric constant was between 10 and 15 in other ranges the difference was large 3 3 in situ vswc before and after rainfall the impact of rainfall events on the vswc was investigated based on the vswc of tdr n 32 on 21 and 25 july 2018 fig 6 fig 6a shows the calibrated average vswcs and the standard errors for five layers with the same depth increments the average vswc for the 0 20 20 40 and 60 80 cm depths increased to a certain extent fig 6a the vswc for the 20 40 cm depth showed an approximately 21 increase due to this rainfall event however the soil water content in the 40 60 and 80 100 cm depth ranges decreased slightly there were no significant differences between most treatments before and after rainfall 3 4 spatiotemporal variations in the vswc derived from the ground wave fo method an exponential model and a 3 m lag distance were used to compute the variograms fig 7 the effective range of the variograms was larger than 20 m except for the variogram of 0 100 cm after rainfall regarding the f0 20 model the after rainfall variogram was characterized by a higher nugget sill ratio 54 3 and a larger range 27 4 m which suggested that the spatial variability among the samples was due to random factors conversely the nugget sill ratio and range were smaller before rainfall 36 0 and 21 8 m respectively indicating strong spatial dependence in addition the f0 40 f0 60 and f0 80 models showed results similar to the f0 20 model the kriging results for these models after rainfall had a long range 26 6 26 6 and 35 8 m respectively and a high nugget sill ratio 48 2 49 1 and 57 8 respectively however a smaller nugget sill ratio 1 5 was found in the after rainfall f0 100 model the lower the nugget sill ratio is the stronger the spatial dependence structure lado et al 2008 fig 8 shows the ok mapping results for the vswc on 21 and 25 july in which the same color scale is used the nine vswc maps on 21 july showed a similar spatial pattern in which high vswc values were found at the highest and lowest elevations the upland in the middle of a slope appeared drier than its upper and lower portions the field average vswc was equivalent to 0 255 m3 m 3 for the 0 20 cm soil layer with a cv of 4 7 table 3 when the depth ranged from 0 20 to 0 100 cm the average vswc increased from 0 255 to 0 276 m3 m 3 and the cv increased from 4 7 to 9 2 regarding the 20 40 40 60 60 80 and 80 100 cm depths the mean vswc was approximately equal to 0 28 m3 m 3 and the cvs were 10 1 9 6 11 8 and 11 2 respectively the vswc maps derived from the 0 40 0 60 0 80 and 0 100 cm relationships on 25 july showed high vswc values in almost all of the field areas the average vswc was 0 272 m3 m 3 in the 0 20 cm layer after rainfall low soil moisture levels were found on both sides of the road and near drainage ditches the vswc distribution pattern of the 20 40 cm layer was different from those of the 40 60 60 80 and 80 100 cm layers and had a high soil water content near the zone boundary fig 8 meanwhile the vswc differences before and after rainfall were further compared in space fig 9 after rainfall the water content of all the soil layers increased over a large area mainly in the depth range of 20 40 cm the proportions of vswcs that decreased that is the vswcs with differences 0 as computed by arcgis 10 3 software were found to be 12 4 8 7 33 6 43 1 and 50 2 respectively for the 0 20 20 40 40 60 60 80 and 80 100 cm soil masses the soil water content decreased in some places such as ridges and field paths land use type had a noticeable influence on the soil water content changes the upland area had a greater water content increase than the orchard in the 0 20 20 40 40 60 and 80 100 cm depths with mean vswc differences of 0 019 0 048 0 034 and 0 023 m3 m 3 respectively 3 5 accuracy evaluation to objectively assess the estimation accuracy the vswc values of the 0 20 0 40 0 60 0 80 and 0 100 cm depths in fig 8 were compared with the calibrated tdr values fig 10 and table 4 and the subsoil vswc maps at 20 cm intervals e g 20 40 and 80 100 cm were not validated the overall validation in terms of r2 suggested an acceptable estimation table 4 fig 10a shows the validation diagram of the f0 20 model for both datasets together with an overall rmse of 0 046 m3 m 3 and r2 of 0 501 the f0 40 model yielded the best result with an overall rmse of 0 027 m3 m 3 and r2 of 0 725 the f0 60 model was in good agreement with the f0 40 model except for having a smaller fitting curve slope for which the overall rmse and r2 were 0 028 m3 m 3 and 0 578 respectively in contrast the f0 80 and f0 100 model validation graphs had greater rmse values of 0 032 m3 m 3 and 0 031 m3 m 3 and smaller r2 values of 0 395 and 0 335 respectively 4 discussion 4 1 gpr sampling depth and petrophysical relationship due to the different measurement locations the ground truth values of vswc measured by the tdr and gpr ground wave methods were not always parallel before and after rainfall gpr could represent the average vswc between two antennas whereas the tdr measurement was restricted to a small area near the probe whalley 2010 a number of studies have shown that the field gpr antenna configuration and signal wavelength have an effect on the sampling depth of the ground wave method vanovermeeren et al 1997 huisman et al 2003 for example the sampling depth of the 450 mhz surface gpr can be within the 0 20 cm depth range grote et al 2003 furthermore under different antenna frequencies and soil texture conditions the gpr sampling depth analysis can be based on the highest r2 value steelman and endres 2011 which was equivalent to r in our study table 2 our results showed that the vswc value derived ground wave method had a very good correlation with the tdr results of different depth ranges table 2 and five depth models had good prediction accuracy table 4 this result may be because the 0 1 m soil mass in the red soil area was a homogeneous laterite layer with the same soil properties and less change in the soil water content this depth range could be regarded as the root zone of plants and crops which is conducive to the growth and production of crops gao et al 2013 tahir et al 2016 in this study all cmp lines were conducted near tdr locations therefore a correlation analysis between dielectric constants derived from cmp lines and the vswcs observed at different soil depths was performed it was difficult to verify the effective depth of each cmp sounding however notably this area was characterized by a similar soil texture in the horizon tang et al 2008 gao et al 2015 gao et al 2016 table 1 we believed that the correlation analysis based on all cmp lines table 2 was credible enough for this study to acquire the empirical model between the vswc and the dielectric constant in a special study site both gpr measurements were collected on undisturbed farmlands and validated with the corrected tdr method nevertheless seasonal soil conditions and soil properties were also related to the gpr measurement steelman and endres 2011 the fitted petrophysical relationships may be limited to our study area or other similar areas and thus further study is needed to obtain a more appropriate empirical formula 4 2 land use type and rainfall effect on the surface vswc to map and evaluate the impact of land use type on soil water content change one traditional direct method was collecting soil drilling samples and conducting water content analysis at multiple locations nevertheless the collection of high resolution vswc data using drilling was expensive and time consuming our study presented a convenient approach through monitoring the location at fo survey lines using the gpr ground wave method in addition through the transformation function eq 2 vswc difference maps of 20 40 40 60 60 80 and 80 100 cm could be obtained as shown in fig 8 the mean vswc of the entire 0 40 cm solum can be expected to be considerably lower at altitudes of 56 58 m than at high and low altitude areas with low vegetation coverage the differences in the mean vswc values in the orchard were less than those in the upland region at the depth ranges of 0 20 and 20 40 cm table 5 these differences could be attributed to the effects of vegetation on rainfall redistribution processes such as canopy interception and water uptake by roots starks et al 2006 nippert et al 2012 fang et al 2016 wang et al 2019 citrus roots are densely distributed and have a wide water absorption range which is consistent with the findings of lu et al 2017 who observed a high average soil water content in the depth range of 0 42 cm meanwhile soil moisture is also affected by the crown canopy which can effectively reduce evaporation in agricultural fields rainfall is intercepted and redistributed by the crop canopy as it moves toward the ground in recent years many studies have found that the rate of canopy interception ranges from 11 4 to 34 3 in different vegetation types murakami and toba 2013 sun and wang 2014 the vswc difference in the 20 40 cm depth was characterized by high mean values in the upland region 0 048 m3 m 3 and orchard 0 041 m3 m 3 table 5 this result suggests that the rainwater mainly concentrated in this layer and gradually infiltrated the subsoil due to increasing soil compaction table 1 regarding the spatial distribution which tahir et al 2016 mentioned we generally can anticipate a high vswc and suitable growing environment for plants at the bottom of a slope rainfall events greatly affected the vertical variations in soil water content table 3 the cvs of the vswc before rainfall increased from 4 7 to 9 2 for depths ranging from 0 20 to 0 100 cm table 3 it seems plausible that the vswcs in deep soil varied substantially more than those in topsoil however the vswcs at 20 cm intervals below the surface soil exhibited similar variations with cvs varying from 9 6 to 11 2 the great cvs of the 0 80 and 0 100 cm layers could be jointly ascribed to the relatively poor fitting between the dielectric constant and vswc eqs 8 and 9 and slightly high stds of vswcs at depths of 60 80 and 80 100 cm table 3 the cvs of the vswc after rainfall generally decreased as the depths ranged from 0 20 to 0 100 cm or declined per 20 cm table 3 the changes in the cv along the soil profile could be partly attributed to the maximal soil water content in the 20 40 cm layer in this area the most intense evapotranspiration was found in july tahir et al 2016 which acted as the main hydrological process before rainfall and could consume more water from topsoil gao et al 2015 and deep soil water frequently interacted with groundwater of which the level was approximately 2 3 5 m gao et al 2015 therefore the vswcs observed before rainfall events were slightly greater in deep soil than in topsoil there were exceptions for the vswc changes after rainfall events such as the slight declines in the 40 60 and 80 100 cm depth ranges fig 6a this result might be comprehensively explained by the spatiotemporal variability of the vswc gao et al 2016 the high soil water content at depths of 20 40 cm after rainfall table 3 and the increasing soil compaction in deep soil that prohibited rapid infiltration even so the overall vswc along the soil profiles increased after a rainfall event fig 6b which was consistent with the general understanding of the significant impact of precipitation on soil moisture variations in humid or semihumid areas gao et al 2015 fang et al 2016 wang et al 2019 4 3 gpr derived vswc validations the high accuracy of the ground wave method for the estimation of the surface vswc was determined from an exact and suitable empirical relationship to improve the vswc estimation accuracy we proposed an empirical function for each depth range in this way the overall performance was obviously improved notably the inversion results of the 0 40 cm depth yielded the best performance r2 0 725 the r2 of our fitted models was over 0 47 eqs 5 9 and the overall accuracy of the vswc maps was acceptable fig 10 which were better than or comparable to those in related studies reza and ardekani 2013 barker et al 2017 even so there were still some limitations as discussed in section 4 1 appropriate empirical models may require more data at the regional scale furthermore even if we calibrated the empirical models with field gpr data the vswc inversion errors were as high as 0 10 m3 m 3 sambuelli 2009 steelman and endres 2011 measurement accuracy may be affected by the soil sampling methods of the ground truth vswc value huisman et al 2001 demonstrated that the rmse between gpr and tdr was 0 03 m3 m 3 and lunt et al 2005 found that the vswc variability of 0 018 m3 m 3 was measured by the neutron method with gpr using the ground wave method in the current study the real vswc could be best represented by tdr which was calibrated by the gravimetric method the overall rmse could be considered to be the sum of gpr measurement uncertainty before and after rainfall from the visualization of the predicted results greater rmse values were obtained on 25 july than on 21 july table 4 the greater the vswc was the greater the rmse and the worse the inversion effect the general trend was consistent with the findings of giroux and chouteau 2010 who showed that highly conductive soil conditions may result in a poor result regarding gpr inversion in addition precipitation may have an impact on the reflection of radar waves due to high soil water contents 5 conclusions in this research petrophysical relationships down to soil depths of 1 m were quantified based on 32 cmp soundings and tdr measurements furthermore vswc maps of a 3 2 ha agricultural field before and after rainfall were generated based on gpr data from the ground wave method validation indices showed that the vswc prediction based on geostatistical methods appeared to be precise and consistent with the tdr values both before and after rainfall the topography and land use types had an obvious impact on the vswc spatial distribution by assessing the sources of errors in vswc mapping we found that precipitation increased the vswc which greatly changed the propagation path of the electromagnetic wave and further intensified the uncertainty of the ground wave method the enhanced ground wave technique for vswc monitoring and predictive mapping shows promising potential at the field scale and compensates for the shortcomings of traditional sampling methods and remote sensing methods in particular this technique may contribute to managing water resources effectively increasing crop yields and promoting

5715,ground penetrating radar gpr is a convenient tool for volumetric soil water content vswc estimation in hydrological and agricultural studies although case studies have been widely carried out little attention has been paid to subsoil moisture estimates in this research we investigated three dimensional soil moisture variation down to a depth of 1 m and the effect of rainfall events on spatial soil moisture dynamics gpr surveying lines were conducted both before and after a heavy rainfall event to map the vswc soil sampling and time domain reflectometry tdr probe data at different depths 20 40 60 80 and 100 cm were acquired our results demonstrated that there was a significant correlation between the dielectric constants and vswcs at all depths the established relationships for the different depth ranges had a low vswc discrepancy when the dielectric constants ranged from 10 to 15 the effective range of each variogram was larger than 20 m except for that of the 0 100 cm vswc map after rainfall in addition the validation diagrams using corrected tdr values demonstrated relatively reliable vswc maps approximately 89 of the variation in vswc could be explained by the dielectric constants in the depth range of 0 40 cm and vswc predictions at this soil depth outperformed those at other depth ranges with an overall rmse of 0 027 m3 m 3 and r2 of 0 725 furthermore we also monitored the effect of precipitation on the accuracy of the vswc prediction on shallow surfaces our study shows that three dimensional soil moisture dynamics can be accurately estimated at the field scale by integrating gpr interpretation and spatial extrapolation methods keywords ground wave method soil water content subsoil geostatistics red soil 1 introduction soil water content is a vital indicator to characterize earth s critical zone and is an essential parameter in climatology hydrology agriculture and meteorology studies lin 2010 kirkby 2016 vereecken et al 2016 however characterizing midscale soil water dynamics has remained a challenge because of the considerable spatial heterogeneity of soil horizons soil texture and agricultural management practices klenk et al 2015 there are many methods for measuring soil moisture at the point scale including the gravimetric method the neutron method the γ ray method and time domain reflectometry tdr robinson et al 2008 these methods are relatively time consuming laborious and destructive to the soil the satellite remote sensing method which is easily affected by vegetation cover can obtain the topsoil water content distribution at the regional scale starks et al 2006 wang and qu 2009 because of their inappropriate investigation scopes depth and resolution these two types of methods cannot adequately capture detailed soil hydrodynamic behavior at the midscale i e field or catchment over the last twenty years electromagnetic geophysical methods including electric resistivity tomography and ground penetrating radar gpr have been used to bridge that gap binley et al 2002 deiana et al 2008 brunet et al 2010 wijewardana and galagedara 2010 garré et al 2012 shamir et al 2016 in particular gpr offers the advantages of nondestructive high precision measurements and a large depth of detection and it is suitable for a variety of geological conditions the application of different gpr techniques is increasing weihermüller et al 2007 cross borehole gpr has been successfully employed for finding preferential flow paths klotzsche et al 2012 zhang et al 2014 and estimating soil moisture content and hydraulic properties based on coupled inversion models kowalsky et al 2004 haarder et al 2012 gueting et al 2017 in recent years the vertical radar profile technique has been shown to be more convenient than cross borehole radar due to the presence of a single borehole but this method must avoid emerging direct waves that interfere critically with refracted waves strobach et al 2014 tronicke and hamann 2014 lambot and andre 2014 developed an off ground i e air launched gpr technique to calculate the shallow subsurface soil hydraulic properties in near field conditions but off ground radar is restricted to surface roughness in addition traditional on ground gpr has been widely used to measure the volumetric soil water content vswc pan et al 2012 found that the spatiotemporal variations in soil moisture in typical farmland were related to vegetation growth steelman and endres 2011 conducted complete field research on three soil textures using the high frequency direct ground wave method a number of studies have reported that the gpr ground wave technique is a common way to monitor shallow vswc compared to the results of the tdr and gravimetric methods galagedara et al 2005 klenk et al 2011 steelman et al 2012 the more suitable the empirical formula between the dielectric constant and the vswc is the higher the detection accuracy of gpr empirical equations based on indoor simulated tests topp et al 1980 roth et al 1992 volumetric mixing formulas dobson et al 1985 herkelrath et al 1991 and effective medium rough evaluations in view of soil models sen 1984 endres and bertrand 2006 have been attempted to convert the dielectric constant into vswc however many of these relationships have not yet been calibrated in the field using gpr technology therefore it is necessary to collect gpr measurements in situ and obtain actual calibrated petrophysical relationships for the estimation of vswc the sampling depths and time zero calibration in complicated soil types are also a concern for the gpr ground wave method steelman and endres 2011 demonstrated that the gpr sampling depth was affected by the antenna frequency and soil texture meanwhile surface roughness tillage management and bedrock distribution may be potential factors affecting gpr measurements jonard et al 2012 ardekani 2013 jonard et al 2013 many studies could retrieve vswc at only a single depth due to the limited experimental time and verification techniques grote et al 2003 steelman and endres 2010 consequently it is necessary to develop proper empirical models for ground wave methods for various soil depth ranges in this study the application of the gpr ground wave technique was investigated to quantify field scale vswc dynamics the petrophysical empirical relationships of different depth ranges were quantified to enhance the measurement accuracy in which the gpr sampling depth and time zero calibration were achieved under the common midpoint cmp survey mode the effects of land use and precipitation on the spatial pattern of vswc were determined 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area 3 2 ha is an agricultural field located in the sunjia watershed in the southern part of yingtan city jiangxi province china fig 1 which has been established as the red soil critical zone observatory tahir et al 2016 wu et al 2019 this area is characterized by a subtropical monsoon climate with a mean annual precipitation of 1795 mm a mean annual temperature of 17 8 c and a frost free period of 258 days gao et al 2016 the slope of the watershed is approximately 6 and the altitude is between 53 4 and 61 1 m quaternary red clay and red sandstone are the parent materials upland and citrus orchards are common land use types in the study area accounting for 79 and 19 respectively gao et al 2016 tahir et al 2016 2 2 soil analysis the soils in the sunjia watershed were dominated by ultisol based on usda soil taxonomy soil survey staff 2010 six soil profiles were excavated to help determine the soil properties fig 1 mixed and undisturbed soil samples were collected from the uplands and orchards with a 100 cm3 cutting ring with three replicates each at 0 20 20 40 40 60 60 80 and 80 100 cm depths in january 2018 the mixed soil was used to determine the particle size distribution clay 2 μm silt 2 50 μm and sand 50 2000 μm using a laser grain size analyzer beckman coulter ls230 usa after pretreatment including air drying grinding and passing through a 2 mm sieve the cutting ring soil samples were used to obtain the soil bulk density detailed information regarding the soil properties is presented in table 1 2 3 vswc data collection in the sampling area custom built polyvinyl chloride pipes diameter 0 05 m length 2 m were installed at 32 sites fig 1 we measured the vswc at depths of 0 20 20 40 40 60 60 80 and 80 100 cm using a matched portable bluetooth probe imko tdr ettlingen germany the success or failure of the representation of the vswc by tdr depends on the accuracy of the invoked calibration because our tdr accuracy was 2 the mass soil water contents of the soil samples at the same depth were calculated by weight loss at 105 3 c after oven drying for at least 24 h the tdr calibration y 0 94x 0 0176 was obtained from the gravimetric method data and the coefficient of determination r2 value was 0 88 the average vswcs of the 0 20 0 40 0 60 0 80 and 0 100 cm depths were used for the gpr sampling depth analysis the tdr and gpr measurements were carried out simultaneously due to the limited soil profiles we analyzed the correlations between vswcs and soil properties at different depths together fig 2 a significant negative correlation was found between vswc and sand content p 0 05 fig 2a whereas vswc was positively correlated with silt content p 0 05 fig 2b which was consistent with recent studies fang et al 2016 lai et al 2018 wang et al 2019 in theory when the soil water contents of the 0 20 and 20 40 cm depths are known the soil water content of the 0 40 cm depth can be calculated using an average function the vswc from the surface soil to a depth could be computed by weighing the vswc at fixed depth increments e g 20 cm as specified in eq 1 1 θ 0 d 20 d i 1 d 20 θ 20 i 1 20 i d 40 60 80 100 where d is the soil depth cm and θ0 d is the vswc at a depth of 0 d cm furthermore the vswcs at soil depth ranges of 20 40 40 60 60 80 and 80 100 cm could be iteratively derived by eq 2 2 θ d d 20 θ 0 d 20 d 20 1 θ 0 d d 20 d 20 40 60 80 where θd d 20 is the vswc at a depth of d d 20 cm 2 4 gpr system and ground wave method 2 4 1 ground wave method in this study a geological radar akula 9000c sweden was used that had two 60 mhz bowtie transmitting t and receiving r antennas the ground wave method includes two measuring modes cmp and fixed offset fo the effective detection depth is inversely proportional to the antenna frequency of the radar the lower the antenna frequency is the deeper the detection depth in general the effective detection depth of the 60 mhz antenna is greater than 8 m which fully meets the depth requirements of this study correlation analysis between dielectric constants and observed vswcs at different soil depths was performed to verify whether the vswc could be significantly detected and which depth range was the most accurate when passing through a complicated soil medium electromagnetic waves are emitted by the transmitting antenna then the air ground reflected and refracted waves are distinguished by the receiving antennas fig 3 the radar signal at each measurement point was recorded with a time window of 400 ns by stacking 24 scans and discretizing 600 samples a dewow 1d filter and static correction were used to obtain the critical information the automatic gain control agc gain was applied to each radar trace to strengthen the signals in deep soil then we used the finite impulse response method to retain the ricker type electromagnetic pulse with a 25 130 mhz frequency bandwidth the cmp measurements were carried out to estimate the gpr sampling depth of the vswc calibrate the time zero t0 of the ground wave and fit a suitable petrophysical relationship the transmitting and receiving antennas shifted in opposite directions fig 3c in which the total length of one surveyed line was 5 m and the moving step length of each antenna was 0 05 m when zero antenna offset occurs the air wave and ground wave will not be received simultaneously due to the radar configuration huisman et al 2001 steelman and endres 2010 the propagation velocity of the electromagnetic wave v could be inferred by the slope of the ground wave from the radargram fig 4 a the dielectric constant ε is calculated using the following equation 3 ε c v 2 where v is the speed of the ground wave and c is the propagation velocity of the electromagnetic wave in a vacuum 0 3 m ns 1 since the ground wave is transmitted from the transmitting antenna to the receiving antenna through the surface soil the effective inversion depth of the ground wave method starts at 0 cm single trace analysis was commonly used to obtain the electromagnetic wave velocity from on ground radar signals in fo mode huisman et al 2001 galagedara et al 2003 fig 3d in which the transmitting and receiving antennas moved in the same directions fig 3d the arrival time of the air wave taw and ground wave tgw at 1 0 m antenna separation can be captured to calculate the velocity of electromagnetic waves v through the surface soil fig 4b 4 v x x c t gw t 0 t aw where x is the antenna spacing 1 0 m and t 0 is time zero 2 4 2 gpr data collection in the current study area the top 1 m of soil uniform red clay was characterized by homogeneous granular aggregates that could be considered to be clay loam wu et al 2019 and the soil texture was generally invariable along the soil profiles table 1 gao et al 2016 it could be inferred that the magnetic properties of the top 1 m of soil were similar or even the same as they had very similar color hu et al 2014 subsurface structure wu et al 2019 and clay minerals tang et al 2008 thus it was assumed that the dielectric constants were the same in the top 1 m of soil data collection was divided into two experiments cmp measurement and fo measurement one cmp surveying line could derive only one dielectric constant while one fo line could derive many dielectric constant values the cmp method was accurate but time consuming while the fo method was convenient fast and suitable for large scale measurement notably there was little difference between the dielectric constants obtained by the cmp method and those obtained by the fo method huisman et al 2003 thus gpr data from the cmp method were adopted as the baseline for calibrating the time zero and the fit of the empirical function between vswcs and dielectric constants these empirical functions were utilized to calculate vswc data based on the dielectric constants derived from the fo method and the new vswc data were then used to predict the spatiotemporal variations in vswc for both experiments we considered different land use types and spatiotemporal variability the cmp experiment was conducted during three time periods 14 16 january 15 17 march and 17 18 july 2018 and vswc data were recorded simultaneously the midpoint of the cmp line was very near one tdr site approximately 10 20 cm rather than directly passing through the tdr site fig 1 as buried pipes will affect the propagation of electromagnetic waves a total of 32 cmp soundings were conducted and thus 32 dielectric constant values were obtained which can correspond to each tdr value the mean time zero t0 was calculated from the wavelet fig 4a the propagation velocity of radar waves was estimated by the velocity stack in a constant velocity earth travassos and menezes 2004 forte and pipan 2017 and the dielectric constant was further derived by eq 3 fo measurements are the key to achieving regional soil water content observations all two dimensional gpr fo surveying lines were conducted with 1 0 m antenna separation on 21 and 25 july 2018 fig 1c we adopted duplicated measurements to control the survey quality the electromagnetic wave information was recorded per 1 m in the field the dielectric constant was calculated from these electromagnetic waves every 3 m in which adjacent waves were not used for the calculation but for data quality control for example 10 dielectric constants can be generated from a 30 m fo line in addition if one measurement point was very near the tdr location electromagnetic waves at this point were recorded three times and the average value was taken as the final result finally a total of 324 paired sample points were obtained from 12 radar lines fig 1c before and after rainfall events we did not show the spatial distribution of these points as the interval of adjacent points was 3 m and the high sampling density would crowd fig 1 the propagation velocity of the ground wave can be calculated by incorporating the parameters of arrival time i e taw and tgw fig 4b into eq 4 2 5 statistical and geostatistical analyses one way analysis of variance anova was adopted to test if the vswc was significantly different at five soil depths p 0 05 the normality of the dependent variable should be evaluated before spatial prediction in this study the derived vswc values were normally distributed through the analysis of quantile quantile qq plots and histograms all vswc data at different soil depths exhibited a square trend when performing the trend analysis the vswc values derived by the fo method were interpolated by ordinary kriging ok ok is a widely used geostatistical model that uses a series of statistical tools to predict the soil properties vswc in this study at unsampled locations a semivariogram is a continuous function for describing the spatial variability of soil properties positive definite models exponential functions and automated fitting procedures were used to approximate the variograms spatial interpolations were evaluated by tdr values in terms of the correlation coefficient r r2 and root mean square error rmse the spatial heterogeneity of vswcs was quantified by statistical indices such as the maximum minimum average values standard deviation std and coefficient of variation cv gpr data were processed in reflexw 8 5 software the statistical analysis mapping and map visualization were performed using sas 9 2 software r 3 3 1 with packages gstat and raster and arcgis 10 3 software respectively the formula between the dielectric constants and vswcs was fitted with origin 8 6 software 3 results 3 1 effective sampling depth of the gpr ground wave method as described in section 2 4 1 the effective sampling depth was verified in accordance with the correlation coefficient r table 2 which was obtained from linear regression analysis of the in situ calibrated vswcs of tdr and the soil dielectric constants ε obtained from 32 cmp soundings the r values were greater than 0 53 in all depth ranges and were greater than 0 74 when the depth of the bottom layer was 60 cm it was suggested that there was a strong correlation between the dielectric constant of the ground wave and the vswc in different layers this result was different from that of steelman and endres 2011 which might be ascribed to the low frequency of radar antennas and the small difference in the soil water content in the homogeneous laterite layer 3 2 the suitable petrophysical relationship the vswcs in the depth ranges of 0 20 0 40 0 60 0 80 and 0 100 cm were computed according to eq 1 five empirical nonlinear formulas between the dielectric constants and vswcs at these five depths were established which were referred to as f0 20 f0 40 f0 60 f0 80 and f0 100 5 f 0 20 θ 0 20 2 68 10 1 8 67 10 2 ε 4 8 10 3 ε 2 9 1 10 5 ε 3 r 2 0 66 6 f 0 40 θ 0 40 2 23 10 1 7 67 10 2 ε 4 17 10 3 ε 2 8 31 10 5 ε 3 r 2 0 89 7 f 0 60 θ 0 60 1 48 10 1 1 26 10 4 ε 8 8 10 4 ε 2 2 29 10 5 ε 3 r 2 0 67 8 f 0 80 θ 0 80 3 81 10 1 5 12 10 2 ε 4 45 10 3 ε 2 1 01 10 4 ε 3 r 2 0 47 9 f 0 100 θ 0 100 2 74 10 1 3 61 10 2 ε 3 86 10 3 ε 2 9 58 10 5 ε 3 r 2 0 58 where ε denotes the dielectric constant of the top 1 m of soil and θ 0 20 θ 0 40 θ 0 60 θ 0 80 and θ 0 100 denote the vswcs at soil depths of 0 20 0 40 0 60 0 80 and 0 100 cm respectively the fitting results of these five models showed that at least 47 of the vswc could be accounted for interestingly the r2 was 0 89 for the f0 40 model and declined to 0 66 for the f0 20 model the surface roughness of the 0 20 cm soil was frequently affected by agricultural tillage which may change the propagation path of the electromagnetic wave and thus lead to poor fitting the r2 of the f0 60 model was 0 67 but the r2 of the f0 80 model was only 0 47 this difference may be due to the existence of a compacted layer with more soil moisture between 60 and 80 cm which makes electromagnetic waves more easily attenuated when the electromagnetic waves passed through the compacted layer the r2 of the f0 100 model moderately increased to 0 58 these models are presented in fig 5 for visual comparison in which the soil dielectric constant ranges from 5 to 25 the petrophysical relationships optimized by data from the five depths eqs 5 9 had small differences when the dielectric constant was between 10 and 15 in other ranges the difference was large 3 3 in situ vswc before and after rainfall the impact of rainfall events on the vswc was investigated based on the vswc of tdr n 32 on 21 and 25 july 2018 fig 6 fig 6a shows the calibrated average vswcs and the standard errors for five layers with the same depth increments the average vswc for the 0 20 20 40 and 60 80 cm depths increased to a certain extent fig 6a the vswc for the 20 40 cm depth showed an approximately 21 increase due to this rainfall event however the soil water content in the 40 60 and 80 100 cm depth ranges decreased slightly there were no significant differences between most treatments before and after rainfall 3 4 spatiotemporal variations in the vswc derived from the ground wave fo method an exponential model and a 3 m lag distance were used to compute the variograms fig 7 the effective range of the variograms was larger than 20 m except for the variogram of 0 100 cm after rainfall regarding the f0 20 model the after rainfall variogram was characterized by a higher nugget sill ratio 54 3 and a larger range 27 4 m which suggested that the spatial variability among the samples was due to random factors conversely the nugget sill ratio and range were smaller before rainfall 36 0 and 21 8 m respectively indicating strong spatial dependence in addition the f0 40 f0 60 and f0 80 models showed results similar to the f0 20 model the kriging results for these models after rainfall had a long range 26 6 26 6 and 35 8 m respectively and a high nugget sill ratio 48 2 49 1 and 57 8 respectively however a smaller nugget sill ratio 1 5 was found in the after rainfall f0 100 model the lower the nugget sill ratio is the stronger the spatial dependence structure lado et al 2008 fig 8 shows the ok mapping results for the vswc on 21 and 25 july in which the same color scale is used the nine vswc maps on 21 july showed a similar spatial pattern in which high vswc values were found at the highest and lowest elevations the upland in the middle of a slope appeared drier than its upper and lower portions the field average vswc was equivalent to 0 255 m3 m 3 for the 0 20 cm soil layer with a cv of 4 7 table 3 when the depth ranged from 0 20 to 0 100 cm the average vswc increased from 0 255 to 0 276 m3 m 3 and the cv increased from 4 7 to 9 2 regarding the 20 40 40 60 60 80 and 80 100 cm depths the mean vswc was approximately equal to 0 28 m3 m 3 and the cvs were 10 1 9 6 11 8 and 11 2 respectively the vswc maps derived from the 0 40 0 60 0 80 and 0 100 cm relationships on 25 july showed high vswc values in almost all of the field areas the average vswc was 0 272 m3 m 3 in the 0 20 cm layer after rainfall low soil moisture levels were found on both sides of the road and near drainage ditches the vswc distribution pattern of the 20 40 cm layer was different from those of the 40 60 60 80 and 80 100 cm layers and had a high soil water content near the zone boundary fig 8 meanwhile the vswc differences before and after rainfall were further compared in space fig 9 after rainfall the water content of all the soil layers increased over a large area mainly in the depth range of 20 40 cm the proportions of vswcs that decreased that is the vswcs with differences 0 as computed by arcgis 10 3 software were found to be 12 4 8 7 33 6 43 1 and 50 2 respectively for the 0 20 20 40 40 60 60 80 and 80 100 cm soil masses the soil water content decreased in some places such as ridges and field paths land use type had a noticeable influence on the soil water content changes the upland area had a greater water content increase than the orchard in the 0 20 20 40 40 60 and 80 100 cm depths with mean vswc differences of 0 019 0 048 0 034 and 0 023 m3 m 3 respectively 3 5 accuracy evaluation to objectively assess the estimation accuracy the vswc values of the 0 20 0 40 0 60 0 80 and 0 100 cm depths in fig 8 were compared with the calibrated tdr values fig 10 and table 4 and the subsoil vswc maps at 20 cm intervals e g 20 40 and 80 100 cm were not validated the overall validation in terms of r2 suggested an acceptable estimation table 4 fig 10a shows the validation diagram of the f0 20 model for both datasets together with an overall rmse of 0 046 m3 m 3 and r2 of 0 501 the f0 40 model yielded the best result with an overall rmse of 0 027 m3 m 3 and r2 of 0 725 the f0 60 model was in good agreement with the f0 40 model except for having a smaller fitting curve slope for which the overall rmse and r2 were 0 028 m3 m 3 and 0 578 respectively in contrast the f0 80 and f0 100 model validation graphs had greater rmse values of 0 032 m3 m 3 and 0 031 m3 m 3 and smaller r2 values of 0 395 and 0 335 respectively 4 discussion 4 1 gpr sampling depth and petrophysical relationship due to the different measurement locations the ground truth values of vswc measured by the tdr and gpr ground wave methods were not always parallel before and after rainfall gpr could represent the average vswc between two antennas whereas the tdr measurement was restricted to a small area near the probe whalley 2010 a number of studies have shown that the field gpr antenna configuration and signal wavelength have an effect on the sampling depth of the ground wave method vanovermeeren et al 1997 huisman et al 2003 for example the sampling depth of the 450 mhz surface gpr can be within the 0 20 cm depth range grote et al 2003 furthermore under different antenna frequencies and soil texture conditions the gpr sampling depth analysis can be based on the highest r2 value steelman and endres 2011 which was equivalent to r in our study table 2 our results showed that the vswc value derived ground wave method had a very good correlation with the tdr results of different depth ranges table 2 and five depth models had good prediction accuracy table 4 this result may be because the 0 1 m soil mass in the red soil area was a homogeneous laterite layer with the same soil properties and less change in the soil water content this depth range could be regarded as the root zone of plants and crops which is conducive to the growth and production of crops gao et al 2013 tahir et al 2016 in this study all cmp lines were conducted near tdr locations therefore a correlation analysis between dielectric constants derived from cmp lines and the vswcs observed at different soil depths was performed it was difficult to verify the effective depth of each cmp sounding however notably this area was characterized by a similar soil texture in the horizon tang et al 2008 gao et al 2015 gao et al 2016 table 1 we believed that the correlation analysis based on all cmp lines table 2 was credible enough for this study to acquire the empirical model between the vswc and the dielectric constant in a special study site both gpr measurements were collected on undisturbed farmlands and validated with the corrected tdr method nevertheless seasonal soil conditions and soil properties were also related to the gpr measurement steelman and endres 2011 the fitted petrophysical relationships may be limited to our study area or other similar areas and thus further study is needed to obtain a more appropriate empirical formula 4 2 land use type and rainfall effect on the surface vswc to map and evaluate the impact of land use type on soil water content change one traditional direct method was collecting soil drilling samples and conducting water content analysis at multiple locations nevertheless the collection of high resolution vswc data using drilling was expensive and time consuming our study presented a convenient approach through monitoring the location at fo survey lines using the gpr ground wave method in addition through the transformation function eq 2 vswc difference maps of 20 40 40 60 60 80 and 80 100 cm could be obtained as shown in fig 8 the mean vswc of the entire 0 40 cm solum can be expected to be considerably lower at altitudes of 56 58 m than at high and low altitude areas with low vegetation coverage the differences in the mean vswc values in the orchard were less than those in the upland region at the depth ranges of 0 20 and 20 40 cm table 5 these differences could be attributed to the effects of vegetation on rainfall redistribution processes such as canopy interception and water uptake by roots starks et al 2006 nippert et al 2012 fang et al 2016 wang et al 2019 citrus roots are densely distributed and have a wide water absorption range which is consistent with the findings of lu et al 2017 who observed a high average soil water content in the depth range of 0 42 cm meanwhile soil moisture is also affected by the crown canopy which can effectively reduce evaporation in agricultural fields rainfall is intercepted and redistributed by the crop canopy as it moves toward the ground in recent years many studies have found that the rate of canopy interception ranges from 11 4 to 34 3 in different vegetation types murakami and toba 2013 sun and wang 2014 the vswc difference in the 20 40 cm depth was characterized by high mean values in the upland region 0 048 m3 m 3 and orchard 0 041 m3 m 3 table 5 this result suggests that the rainwater mainly concentrated in this layer and gradually infiltrated the subsoil due to increasing soil compaction table 1 regarding the spatial distribution which tahir et al 2016 mentioned we generally can anticipate a high vswc and suitable growing environment for plants at the bottom of a slope rainfall events greatly affected the vertical variations in soil water content table 3 the cvs of the vswc before rainfall increased from 4 7 to 9 2 for depths ranging from 0 20 to 0 100 cm table 3 it seems plausible that the vswcs in deep soil varied substantially more than those in topsoil however the vswcs at 20 cm intervals below the surface soil exhibited similar variations with cvs varying from 9 6 to 11 2 the great cvs of the 0 80 and 0 100 cm layers could be jointly ascribed to the relatively poor fitting between the dielectric constant and vswc eqs 8 and 9 and slightly high stds of vswcs at depths of 60 80 and 80 100 cm table 3 the cvs of the vswc after rainfall generally decreased as the depths ranged from 0 20 to 0 100 cm or declined per 20 cm table 3 the changes in the cv along the soil profile could be partly attributed to the maximal soil water content in the 20 40 cm layer in this area the most intense evapotranspiration was found in july tahir et al 2016 which acted as the main hydrological process before rainfall and could consume more water from topsoil gao et al 2015 and deep soil water frequently interacted with groundwater of which the level was approximately 2 3 5 m gao et al 2015 therefore the vswcs observed before rainfall events were slightly greater in deep soil than in topsoil there were exceptions for the vswc changes after rainfall events such as the slight declines in the 40 60 and 80 100 cm depth ranges fig 6a this result might be comprehensively explained by the spatiotemporal variability of the vswc gao et al 2016 the high soil water content at depths of 20 40 cm after rainfall table 3 and the increasing soil compaction in deep soil that prohibited rapid infiltration even so the overall vswc along the soil profiles increased after a rainfall event fig 6b which was consistent with the general understanding of the significant impact of precipitation on soil moisture variations in humid or semihumid areas gao et al 2015 fang et al 2016 wang et al 2019 4 3 gpr derived vswc validations the high accuracy of the ground wave method for the estimation of the surface vswc was determined from an exact and suitable empirical relationship to improve the vswc estimation accuracy we proposed an empirical function for each depth range in this way the overall performance was obviously improved notably the inversion results of the 0 40 cm depth yielded the best performance r2 0 725 the r2 of our fitted models was over 0 47 eqs 5 9 and the overall accuracy of the vswc maps was acceptable fig 10 which were better than or comparable to those in related studies reza and ardekani 2013 barker et al 2017 even so there were still some limitations as discussed in section 4 1 appropriate empirical models may require more data at the regional scale furthermore even if we calibrated the empirical models with field gpr data the vswc inversion errors were as high as 0 10 m3 m 3 sambuelli 2009 steelman and endres 2011 measurement accuracy may be affected by the soil sampling methods of the ground truth vswc value huisman et al 2001 demonstrated that the rmse between gpr and tdr was 0 03 m3 m 3 and lunt et al 2005 found that the vswc variability of 0 018 m3 m 3 was measured by the neutron method with gpr using the ground wave method in the current study the real vswc could be best represented by tdr which was calibrated by the gravimetric method the overall rmse could be considered to be the sum of gpr measurement uncertainty before and after rainfall from the visualization of the predicted results greater rmse values were obtained on 25 july than on 21 july table 4 the greater the vswc was the greater the rmse and the worse the inversion effect the general trend was consistent with the findings of giroux and chouteau 2010 who showed that highly conductive soil conditions may result in a poor result regarding gpr inversion in addition precipitation may have an impact on the reflection of radar waves due to high soil water contents 5 conclusions in this research petrophysical relationships down to soil depths of 1 m were quantified based on 32 cmp soundings and tdr measurements furthermore vswc maps of a 3 2 ha agricultural field before and after rainfall were generated based on gpr data from the ground wave method validation indices showed that the vswc prediction based on geostatistical methods appeared to be precise and consistent with the tdr values both before and after rainfall the topography and land use types had an obvious impact on the vswc spatial distribution by assessing the sources of errors in vswc mapping we found that precipitation increased the vswc which greatly changed the propagation path of the electromagnetic wave and further intensified the uncertainty of the ground wave method the enhanced ground wave technique for vswc monitoring and predictive mapping shows promising potential at the field scale and compensates for the shortcomings of traditional sampling methods and remote sensing methods in particular this technique may contribute to managing water resources effectively increasing crop yields and promoting

5716,we report on a series of high resolution sensor measurements from within the yax chen cave system near the city of tulum quintana roo mexico and a box model of mangrove groundwater interactions the sensors were positioned in the cave following a transect moving inland conductivity water pressure and temperature data were collected at 30 min intervals for a span of two years temperature water level and conductivity records showed a response to large rainfall events hurricane nate in october 2017 and topical storm philippe in november 2017 which coincided with differences in surficial vegetation groundwater with areas of mangrove coverage showed an input of warm mangrove water as the water level receded to pre rainfall levels and the temperature effect was not observed in areas dominated by an upland forested terrain a model of the groundwater mangrove interaction was developed with an on off switch for the flow of mangrove water into the groundwater system when the rainfall is sufficiently large the model reproduces the observed timing difference in the temperature and conductivity response and matches the field data during rainfall events this model shows the effectiveness of simple box models in understanding a complicated geophysical processes and provides quantitative support to this previously hypothesized groundwater interaction keywords times series analysis anchaline hydrology karst topography groundwater mangroves 1 introduction despite containing the number one tourist destination in mexico cancun significant continuing development within the mayan riviera pelas 2011 garcia flores et al 2008 and risks due to climate change mendoza gonzález et al 2013 the hydrology of the yucatan peninsula remains incompletely understood previous research has shown that the dominant drivers of yucatan aquifer dynamics are sea level fluctuations and changes in the hydraulic head whitaker and smart 1990 beddows et al 2007 however it is only recently that the impact of short term intense rainfall events on the aquifer have been examined coutino et al 2017 kovacs et al 2017 and kovacs et al 2018 showed that hurricane rainfall results in mixing of the meteoric water mass mewm with the marine water mass mawm with subsequent re stratification taking days to weeks to occur however the mixing dynamics of less intense storms have not been investigated nor the role of surficial terrain on the hydrology given the prevalence of open cenotes with mangrove coverage in the coastal zone it is expected that the mangroves may play a role in the upper aquifer dynamics collins et al 2015 mcneill jewer et al 2019 during the time period of may 2016 to may 2018 a series of depth salinity and temperature sensors were positioned in the mewm 2 m depth throughout the yax chen which is part of the larger ox bel ha cave system fig 1 the sensors recorded various rainfall events hurricane earl in august 2016 hurricane franklin and hurricane harvey in august 2017 hurricane nate in september 2017 and tropical storm philippe in october 2017 over this period it was observed that rainfall events caused differing response in the temperature water depth and salinity of the mewm depending on rainfall amount and duration further differences were noted between groundwater areas with predominant mangrove coverage compared to forested terrain mangroves can trap and accumulate organic debris within their root systems and over time form extensive peat deposits that act as an aquitard which prevents or dampens downward flow of rainfall through the underlying karst twilley and chen 1998 collins et al 2015 and mcneill jewer et al 2019 found large rainfalls raised the water table resulting in mangrove water flowing into the sinkholes as water level decreased post rainfall the mangrove water mass mgwm would be warmer due to a high residence time and heating due to direct solar radiation and its contact with the overlying warmer atmospheric air thus as this warmer water mass drained into the sinkhole it would cause an increase in groundwater temperatures in contrast the upland forest terrain would experience only a minimal change in groundwater temperature as the rainfall which is cooler than the groundwater would directly percolate through the overlying karst into the mewm a similar effect has also been noted approximately 50 km to the south at bahia de la ascension lagoon in the sian ka an biosphere reserve medina gómez et al 2014 observed that during the rainy season increased mangrove discharge to the lagoon was characterized by increases water temperatures and lower salinity values to test this hypothesis a box model of the mangrove cenote groundwater interaction was created and validated using a flow switch for the mangroves if a certain water level is reached when rain data from 2017 was used the box model results matched the observations validating the mangrove flooding hypothesis which was hypothesised with prior sediment transport and accumulation data 1 1 yucatan hydrogeology the yucatan peninsula which encompasses three mexican states is composed of miocene to late pleistocene biogenic limestone with a total area of 165 000 km2 the limestone has undergone intense dissolution through cycles of sea level change creating a karst topography over much of the peninsula weidie 1985 a prominent feature of karstic landforms are sinkholes and cave systems which are created through mixing zone dissolution ford and williams 2013 smart et al 2006 the dominant class of sinkhole in the eastern part of the yucatan peninsula consists of points of bedrock collapse regionally called cenotes that form when the roof of a cavern or cave passage breaks down to expose the subsurface smart et al 2006 gutiérrez et al 2014 additionally the high porosity of this limestone 14 23 beddows et al 2007 results in no surficial rivers as rainfall quickly infiltrates to the aquifer and flows towards the coast emblanch et al 2003 stoessell 1995 beddows et al 2007 on a large regional scale fracture zones create directions of preferential groundwater flow parallel to the coast bauer gottwein et al 2011 the aquifer is stratified with a mewm located above an underlying mawm though there can be variation throughout the region the rain derived mewm has a lower temperature 25 c and lower salinity 1 10 ppt than the mawm 26 28 c and 35 ppt respectively stoessell and coke 2006 kovacs et al 2017 coutino et al 2017 in areas of open water such as lakes or cenotes a thermocline is formed in the upper mewm beddows 2004 the temperature can increase from 27 c in the lower mewm to 30 c near the surface the interface between the water masses is a mixed brackish layer called the halocline or mixing zone that while generally thin increases in vertical extent as it approaches the coast bauer gottwein et al 2011 this stratification is well documented for many coastal systems especially given a porous coastal geology cooper et al 1964 though the hydrodynamics of this system are still not fully understood specifically while several groundwater models exist for coastal ocean geographies jones et al 2000 sanford and konikow 1989 they typically assume that the region of interest has a homogeneous porosity hubbert 1940 wilson 2005 however due to the presence of the fractures and in particular the large scale cave networks this is not the case in the yucatan peninsula kambesis and coke 2013 the porous geology and cave networks also allow for propagation of tides further inland than is typically expected with tides however the overall amplitude is relatively low at 0 5 cm near the coast beddows 2004 while generally understood to occur and contribute to water quality changes beddows et al 2007 the specifics of mixing between the mawm and mewm have only recently been investigated kovacs et al 2017 and coutino et al 2017 demonstrate the large impact that hurricanes have on the water column specifically focusing on the yax chen cave system part of the larger ox bel ha system fig 1 while brankovits et al 2018 has examined water column mixing with regards to methane dynamics at a more inland portion of the ox bel ha system brankovits et al 2018 also reported increased mixing during the wet season compared to the dry season 1 2 yucatan climate the climate of the yucatan peninsula is strongly tied to the position of the inter tropical convergence zone itcz the concentrated band of low pressure located 5 15 degrees above the equator which is characterized by large scale thunderstorms and precipitation gill 1976 the yucatan peninsula is located directly under the yearly migration path of the itcz thus when it moves overhead during the summer wet season large scale precipitation occurs throughout the region to highlight this during the wet season may october in 2017 the yucatan peninsula the states of quintana roo yucatan and campeche had an average monthly precipitation of 552 mm month while during the dry season november april average monthly precipitation was 103 mm month https smn cna gob mx es climatologia temperaturas y lluvias resumenes mensuales de temperaturas y lluvias additionally between june and november numerous hurricanes form in the atlantic ocean and bring additional rainfall peaks up to 300 mm day to the region 1 3 box models box models have a long history in geophysics stommel 1961 budyko 1969 box models are simple and do not seek to fully represent a complicated system such as the climate instead they use a reduced number of variables and interactions to form and test hypotheses or explain field observations similar to a classical box model a water budget model can be considered a form of box model where each box now represents the location or state of the water twilley and chen 1998 created a water budget model for mangrove basin interactions which was used to develop a finite difference hydrology model this model was used to simulate the water level and salinity within 50 cm of the ground surface in rookery bay national estuarine research reserve florida u s a the authors found that salinity within the ground was more sensitive to prolonged rainfall deficits at higher elevations in the inter tidal zone where tidal inundation frequency is reduced 2 study area yax chen is a 2 7 km long subsection of cave passage and part of the larger ox bel ha cave system and is located approximately 9 km south of the city of tulum quintana roo fig 1 the primary entrance to the cave is located within cenote yax chen at approximately 270 km long ox bel ha is a very large network of anastomosing cave passages that generally trends in a nw to se in direction https caves org project qrss qrss htm fig 1 seven cenotes open along the length of cave passage covering a total open water cenote area of 35 000 m2 collins et al 2015 the main passage of the cave system is relatively shallow with a depth of 8 m in the downstream portion from the l shaped cenote to yax chen cenote and 10 11 m in the upstream section from l shaped cenote to gemini cenote collins et al 2015 flow within the passage is coast wards and is generally low at 10 cm s increasing to 25 cm s during heavy rainfall moore et al 1992 brankovits et al 2018 in the study area mangroves extend inland to the isod 2 cenote where the vegetation transitions to an upland forest terrain that is characterized by exposed karst with no or very thin soil coverage collins et al 2015 assuming a drainage area of 250 meters on either side of the main passage 2 km to the forested area the potential area of mangrove that could pond water to flow into the system would be 1 km2 collins et al 2015 meacham 2012 3 methods 3 1 sensor placement and rainfall data all sensors were placed within the cave passage at a depth of 2 m and were located 10 30 m downstream coast wards from cenotes gemini isod 2 l shaped and lil with the exception of yax chen which was placed below a dock within the cenote fig 2 red arrows cenote gemini is located well within the upland forest isod 2 cenote is located at the border of the upland forest and mangrove coverage fig 2 the yellow dashed line and the remaining cenotes l shaped lil and yax chen are located within the mangrove area two types of sensors were used 1 the hobo conductivity data logger from onset model u24 001 provides both conductivity 5 μ s cm and temperature 0 1 c measurements with resolutions of 1 μ s cm and 0 01 c respectively 2 the hobo water level data logger from onset model u20l 02 provides both water pressure 1 20 kpa and temperature 0 44 c measurements with resolutions of 0 04 kpa and 0 1 c respectively due to the lower temperature accuracy on the u20l the u24 temperature values were used an additional pressure sensor was affixed to a tree above a small unnamed cenote along the passage to record atmospheric pressure to calibrate the water pressure and calculate water depth an estimate of brackish water 1010 g m 3 was used for the water density as this most closely matched the observed mewm density 6 ppt collins et al 2015 kovacs et al 2017 specific conductance μ s cm was converted to salinity ppt using an empirical equation fofonoff and millard 1983 this equation is valid for salinity values from 2 to 42 ppt which is within the range of known salinity values for the system collins et al 2015 the sensors were left in place for two years though there are several gaps due to battery failure and sensor malfunction however as the data from the sensors was collected every six months in may and december the shortest gap in data was six months each of the sensor sites are named after the closest upstream cenote from furthest inland to the coast gemini isod 2 l shaped lil and yax chen fig 2 hourly rainfall data mm hr from the city of tulum was gathered from https www worldweatheronline com the weather data spanned the year of 2017 based on this data we will refer to a small rainfall event as one with a rainfall rate of less than 200 mm day while a large event is one with more than 200 mm day 3 2 model development a conceptual diagram illustrating the mangrove hypothesis proposed in collins et al 2015 is shown in fig 3 in mangrove covered areas confined aquifer rainfall is unable to infiltrate through the karst as the peat layer underneath the mangroves acts as an aquitard this pooled water has a high residence time in the mangrove and is thus warmed through solar forcing moreover the weak daily tidal pumping in this region is insufficient to flush it out during a light rainfall event the water table does not rise significantly and there is little surface flow from the mangroves into the open cenotes because of a low hydraulic gradient the dominant input to the groundwater is thus direct rainfall which is cools the groundwater byers et al 1949 kovacs et al 2018 during high rainfall events there is sufficient rainfall to raise the water table so that as the groundwater draws down post event a large hydraulic gradient is created between the open cenotes and the pooled mangrove water inflow of the warm water from the mangrove causes an increase in temperature in the cenote and surrounding groundwater in the forested areas unconfined aquifer the rainfall is able to directly infiltrate through the karst as the rain does not pool on the surface it is not warmed and subsequently directly cools the mewm to test the dynamics of the mangrove interaction hypotheses proposed in collins et al 2015 and mcneill jewer et al 2019 a simplified box model of the system was created the key interaction within the box model is a switch that allows flow from the mangrove into the cenote only if the mangrove water level has reached a specified minimum value a diagram of the model set up is shown in fig 4 there are two boxes in the model one representing the mangroves and one representing the cenote within these boxes both water temperature and water level are tracked the cenote water temperature may change due to a day night oscillation rainfall and mangrove overflow the cenote water level may change due to tidal oscillations rainfall and inflow from the surrounding mangrove both the mangrove temperature and water level change due to the rainfall and the water level also changes due to the inflow additionally all the fields are set to exponentially return to a prescribed background state the set of ordinary differential equations that govern this system can be written as dh c t dt r r t ti t k 1 h c 0 h c t t k 2 h m t θ h m t h cr dt c t dt k 3 t c 0 t t c t r r t h c t r t t c t k 4 h m t h c t t m t t c t θ h m t h cr dn t dh m t dt k 5 h m t k 2 h m t θ h m t h cr r r t dt m t dt k 6 t m 0 t m t r r t h c t r t t c t where h c is the cenote water level t c is the cenote temperature h m is the mangrove water level and t m is the mangrove temperature in these equations h c 0 is the base cenote water level t c 0 t is the base cenote water temperature fit t m 0 is the base mangrove water temperature h cr is the critical water level r t is the rain water temperature and θ t is the heaviside step function the k variables are rate constants we have elected to use a simple switch via the heaviside function to enable flow from the mangrove box to the cenote box as a preliminary attempt as we are primarily concerned with investigating the dynamical effects of the switch we have elected to simplify other aspects of the system namely the mangroves are not actively heated but rather return to a higher water temperature we are also assuming that there is a background state for all the variables to which the system returns water in our particular box equalizes with the rest of the groundwater as such the equations are non conservative the various parameters for this model were then calculated using the full two years of data from the isod 2 location close to the cenote entrance rate constants directly related to the cenote were calculated using exponential fits to the data while the other rate constants were tuned to give the same amplitude response as what is observed in the data the base water level was chosen to be the average depth of the open l shaped cenote the rain temperature of 25 c and mangrove temperature of 27 5 c were chosen based on field measurements while the critical mangrove water level of 0 20 m was selected to match data results all parameters were verified using a markov chain monte carlo algorithm using the stan software https mc stan org the baseline water level water temperature critical water level and rate constants are listed in table 1 the cenote water temperature was calculated using the

computing over long times δ t 0 1 h was considered sufficient furthermore as the rain data was provided with a uniform time step an adaptive time step would have required interpolation and was considered to be excessively complicated for a first implementation for the preliminary test cases a rain event was modelled as a gaussian curve over one day to compare with the observed data rainfall data from the city of tulum was interpolated onto a six minute time spacing and used as input for the model both the model presented here and the data used can be found athttps git uwaterloo ca acoutino mangrove box model git 4 results 4 1 sensor observations the water depth fig 5 a at all locations exhibit the same long term and short term oscillations with only minor differences in amplitude rapid increases in water depth are associated with rainfall events and are commensurate with previously observed water level changes in yax chen kovacs et al 2017 coutino et al 2017 also visible is the wet dry yearly oscillation which exhibits a slightly elevated average water level from august to january salinity fig 5 b follows a similar pattern to water depth exhibiting longer scale seasonal oscillations as well as prominent rapid increases resulting from large rainfalls the behaviour across all the sensor locations follows the same pattern though differing slightly in salinity value the most prominent features in the salinity graph are the large increases in salinity associated with hurricanes and tropical storms the largest event is hurricane nate in october 2017 this event caused a large increase in the salinity of the upper portion of the mewm raising it more than 2 5 ppt across all sensor locations in less than 12 h following hurricane nate and tropical storm philippe the previous gradient of salinity values yax chen most saline to gemini least saline changes with the isod 2 and l shaped locations becoming the least saline the other large salinity increase is hurricane earl in august 2016 however it does not appear to have had as long lasting an impact on mewm salinity as hurricane nate smaller rainfall events are also reflected as slight increases in salinity the temperature records fig 5 c show less variability with the large rainfalls the dominant responses are rapid small decreases followed by return to mean values over a slightly longer time the seasonal variation is visible in the temperature time series as two regular oscillations between wet and dry seasons the other dominant feature is the difference between yax chen l shaped isod 2 and lil cenote which have very similar temperatures 26 0 50 c and that of gemini which is 1 c cooler 25 0 50 c this temperature difference was verified with four independent dive computers that recorded a similar temperature decrease isod 2 exhibits the least amount of short term variability gemini exhibits a moderate amount and l shaped lil cenote and yax chen all have the most short term variability which follows the distribution of mangrove with gemini in an upland forested terrain isod 2 at the transition to mangrove and l shaped lil cenote and yax chen within the mangrove terrain fig 6 presents the data collected during the october 2017 rainfall events hurricane nate and tropical storm philippe where both events are visible as perturbations to all three records at all locations water level increased 0 34 m in 12 h at the gemini and isod 2 locations temperature water depth and salinity all begin to increase at the same time in contrast at the l shaped location water depth and salinity begin to increase at the same time but temperature only changes afterwards at yax chen small coincident peaks are observed across all the measurements followed by a decrease in water level a maximum in temperature and finally a maximum in salinity the pattern observed during the first event is consistent during the second event however during the second event the local maxima in salinity and temperature at the gemini and isod 2 locations coincide the response of the system to the october 2017 rain event fig 6 is contrasted with the response to a smaller rainfall in early january 2017 in which water level increased by 0 14 m in 24 h fig 7 across all locations the same pattern is observed an increase in water level an increase in salinity and decrease in temperature which all begin at the same time the local maxima in salinity and local minima in temperature coincide at the l shaped and lil locations while they do not coincide at the gemini and isod 2 locations following the event all the locations follow the same pattern of decreasing water depth and increasing temperature 4 2 model output to test the model the rainfall event is modelled by a simple gaussian normal curve with a duration of 24 h seasonal variations in t c 0 t were disabled and the temperature was set to a constant value of 26 61 c the day night and tidal signals were removed we begin by considering two cases a low rainfall event and a high rainfall event the low event peaks at 10 mm hour while the high event peaks at 60 mm h fig 8 a presents the normalized water level and temperature of the cenote the water level reaches a maximum in the hours following the peak in rainfall at 200 h at a similar time the minimum in water temperature is observed the water level and temperature then return to their equilibrium values 150 h later the side panels fig 8 b c d e show the physical i e non normalized water temperature and water level fields for both the mangroves right and the cenote left the total increase in water level of both the mangroves and the cenote is 5 cm the water temperature in the mangroves drop approximately 0 08 c before quickly returning to the prescribed 27 5 c the water temperature in the cenote drops 0 008 c and takes 150 h to return to equilibrium values the quantity of water in the mangrove was substantially less than the cenote the rain thus proportionally cooled the mangrove more resulting in the small variation in the temperature the water level fig 9 a follows a similar pattern as in the low rainfall case peaking a few hours after the maximum rainfall at 200 h however immediately following the peak the water level decayed slower than in the previous case until around 240 h when there was a cusp and then the water level decayed faster this abrupt change was due to the switch being activated until 240 h thereby reducing the draw down by adding mangrove water to the cenote box the temperature begins dropping slightly around 200 h and dramatically increases in the following hours until it reaching a peak at around 230 h the temperature then begins to decay slowly before reaching a cusp and then rapidly decaying to its undisturbed value physically the water level in both the mangrove and the cenote increased by 30 cm fig 9 b and d the mangrove water decreased by a maximum of 0 14 c fig 9 c the temperature in the cenote decreased by 0 01 c and then increased by 0 15 c fig 9 e for model runs meant to simulate measurements rainfall data from the city of tulum for the year of 2017 was used as input the results of the model were then compared to the sensor measurements from the l shaped location as it was within the mangroves and the data did not have any interruptions there is broad agreement between the model and sensor temperatures fig 10 a there are periods of time during which the model and the data align well 3000 500 h but also periods where the sensor data appears to exhibit more variation than the model from 0 2000 h and 7000 8500 h these periods coincide with the wet season and increased rainfall during the hurricane nate rainfall 6594 h the model precisely matches the timing of the increase in temperature this increase occurs 24 h after 6618 h the peak in water level the model and sensor water depths also exhibit broad agreement fig 11 the values did not match precisely during the middle portion of the year 3000 5000 h however the pattern of temporal change in water depth did many of the rainfall events are also captured however the model quickly returns to baseline conditions while the sensor data exhibits a slower rate of return and the measured water depth does not fully return to baseline further there are discrepancies in rainfall events with some increases appearing in one data set but not the other the hurricane nate event was captured accurately the timing of the model peak in water level was within 4 h of the observations and reflects the post rainfall decline in water level to quantify the agreement between the model and the field observations we have elected to use wavelet coherence torrence and compo 1998 grinsted et al 2004 due to the number of data points traditional cross correlation metrics do not provide meaningful values for example the correlation coefficient for the temperature is 0 83 and the coefficient for the depth is 0 22 however they both have a p value of 0 indicating they are significant both depth and temperature exhibit coherence fig 12 during the hurricane nate event 6600 h the model depth fig 12 a exhibits high 0 8 coherence with the field results particularly for the band between 96 h and 512 h the model temperature fig 12 b also exhibits high coherence however compared to the depth the temperature is coherent at a slightly shorter time band between 64 h and 130 h in both areas of coherence the arrows are pointed to the right indicating that there is essentially no phase shift 5 discussion there is a distinction between the response of the forested sensor locations fig 6 a and b and the mangrove surrounded locations fig 6 c and d to heavy rainfall events during hurricane nate within the forested locations the temperature and salinity respond at the same time indicating interaction of precipitation with the underlying mawm in the mangrove region the temperature and salinity responses are not coincident indicating a different mechanism of action in comparison to the other locations the temperature response in these areas is delayed and coincides with the decrease in water level post rainfall event together these responses indicate that there is a large input of warm fresh water that occurs after the rainfall this appears to be consistent as the same pattern occurs during tropical storm philippe and provides support for the mangrove influence hypothesis fig 3 collins et al 2015 used bi annually collected sediment traps within the yax chen cave system to show the effects of mangrove distribution and cenote size on cave sedimentation patterns and inferred that low lying mangrove environments allow flushing of nutrient rich waters into the sunlit cenotes during large rainfalls causing increased primary productivity which is then advected downstream into the cave passages recently mcneill jewer et al 2019 has also found that the mangroves have an impact on the elemental inputs to the aquifer using the same sediment trap configuration as collins et al 2015 and mcneill jewer et al 2019 detected increased levels of silica and organic matter inputs from the mangrove areas when compared to the terrestrial forest areas these elemental signatures added support to the hypothesis proposed in collins et al 2015 that the mangrove dominated cenotes act as points of water collection during heavy rainfall due to concentration of rainwater within the surrounding mangrove peat it was hypothesized that the peat aquitard prevents immediate downward percolation after rainfalls and allows for the accumulation of nutrients within the water which later provides organic matter inputs to the cave system in contrast the upland forest terrain has less nutrient input into the cave system as rainfall is able to directly percolate through the karst and into the subsurface aquifer although this was a plausible explanation for the pattern of deposition observed in the sediment trap data there was no direct hydrological data to reinforce this interpretation the box model created in this paper provides the hydrological connection and data to solidify this interpretation the difference in response across the geographic locations during heavy rainfall events is contrasted with the similarity in response across the geographic locations to small rainfall events fig 7 while there are minor differences in timing and specific values the general pattern of response across all the locations is consistent the temperature response to smaller events is the opposite to what is observed during heavy rainfall events a decrease in temperature rather than an increase this indicates that the mechanism which drives the differences observed during heavy rainfalls is not active during smaller ones which further supports the mangrove influence hypothesis the box model was created with the intention of testing the influence of mangrove coverage specifically the difference in timing of the responses of temperature and water level this is illustrated in the difference in response of the model to a high and low rainfall event comparing the shape of model created curves during the low rainfall event fig 8 with those observed in the data fig 7 we can see that the pattern is qualitatively similar during the high rainfall event the dynamics are fundamentally different fig 9 than in the low rainfall and the dynamics are qualitatively similar to those observed in the data fig 6 specifically a sharp peak in water level corresponds to a small decrease followed by large increase in temperature more importantly the model captures the delay in temperature peak observed in the field data when the tulum rain data is used as input for the model fig 10 and fig 11 the results broadly reproduce what is observed while there are differences the focus of the model the response to rainfall events is faithfully reproduced specifically the timing of both the peak in water level and water depth during hurricane nate are extremely accurate as this model was designed to capture the dynamics of rainfall events the primary validation we are concerned with are these responses and not the longer time scale aquifer dynamics for which this simple model may not be suitable this model was designed specifically to capture the dynamics of rainfall events hence we are not concerned with the general difference that could be observed during the non rainy portions of the year the box model is extremely simple and does not include many of the known forcing mechanisms and dynamics such as spring and neap tides and the suppression of tidal oscillations during the rainfall events coutino et al 2017 while the rainfall data taken from the city of tulum is relatively close to the field location the extremely localized nature of the rainfall events in this region results in an error in the timing and magnitude of many of the events further due to the connected nature of the groundwater it is possible that rainfall events from upstream of the study site can impact the observations which would not be captured by relying solely on rainfall from tulum 6 conclusions in this paper we have presented results from the ongoing study of the coastal quintana roo aquifer and the yax chen cave network conductivity temperature and pressure sensors placed high in the water column have corroborated the results found in coutino et al 2017 and kovacs et al 2017 the data that was collected from yax chen sites covering both mangrove dominated coastal areas and forested upland areas show systemic differences in their response to large rainfall events in the forested areas the rainwater directly infiltrates into the subsurface and results in mixing of the mawm this is expressed by the coincident salinity and temperature increases observed in the sensor data in the mangrove covered areas there is a small initial decrease in temperature followed by a large increase in water temperature that is not coincident with salinity this occurs during the water level decline that follows a rainfall event following the hypothesis raised in collins et al 2015 we suspected that this was a result of mangrove coverage surrounding the cenotes with the underlying mangrove peat layer acting as an aquitard and forcing the water to collect in the mangroves this water would be warmed through air temperature and solar forcing and when the water levels began to decrease post rainfall would flow into the cenotes and warm the mewm this effect is contrasted by smaller rainfall events where the mangrove peat is not fully saturated and does not accumulate enough to flow into the cenotes during draw down this is observed in the sensor data as both forested and mangrove covered areas responding similarly to these events this hypothesis was tested by creating a box model of this interaction with a switch allowing for flow from the mangroves when a certain minimum water table level is reached through simplified test cases it was shown that the observed dynamics were captured by this simple model the model was then tested by forcing using rainfall data from the city of tulum for the year 2017 during the hurricane event there is correspondence between the model and the observations the results of this analysis indicate that our hypothesis was correct and the mangroves are the primary reason for this difference in dynamics understanding this pathway of mangrove water into the aquifer is important as mangrove peat can often be a heavy metal sink and when heavily disturbed could potentially become a source of nutrients and contaminants to oligotrophic shallow coastal zones and reef systems due to increased erosion deforestation and degradation as the area continues developing clark et al 1998 defew et al 2005 bayen 2012 there are many natural extensions to the model beginning with the addition of salinity and partitioning the cenote box into two boxes one for each of the mewm and mawm this would allow for the investigation of the impact that the mangroves have on mixing and stability within the water column furthermore due to the simplicity of the model long time simulations can be carried out quite easily it would be reasonable to compute 1000 calendar years of the aquifer in a few hours of computation specifically this model would allow for statistical distributions of rainfall to be input and their effect on the groundwater to be considered with the advent of anthropogenic climate change and sea level rise significantly more of the yucatan platform will consist of these coastal mangrove systems and more variable climate will result in changes to how the aquifer responds this is particularly important given the effect of global climate change and sea level rise which will likely submerge these mangrove areas in the coming decades this coupled with increased coastal development may heavily disturb the mangrove ecosystem and could potentially change mangrove peat from a sink to a source of heavy metals and other nutrients kathiresan and bingham 2001 marchand et al 2011 which could have serious impacts for coastal environments another avenue of further research would be a larger investigation into the effect that the tides play on mangrove inundation and the impacts that it may have on the mewm due to the relatively weak coastal tidal amplitudes the effects would likely be limited to near surface waters as the mangrove water slowly flows into the cenotes however such consistent flushing may have larger environmental effects due to micro nutrient inputs this work has shown that the mangroves are the likely reason for dynamical differences in rainfall events however the impact of this effect on the aquifer system remain to be documented in detail in addition to supporting the results showing differences in geo chemical signatures of the sediment input based on cenote vegetation coverage mcneill jewer et al 2019 it highlights the effect that mangroves can have on the groundwater in extremely karstic areas declaration of competing interest the

5716,we report on a series of high resolution sensor measurements from within the yax chen cave system near the city of tulum quintana roo mexico and a box model of mangrove groundwater interactions the sensors were positioned in the cave following a transect moving inland conductivity water pressure and temperature data were collected at 30 min intervals for a span of two years temperature water level and conductivity records showed a response to large rainfall events hurricane nate in october 2017 and topical storm philippe in november 2017 which coincided with differences in surficial vegetation groundwater with areas of mangrove coverage showed an input of warm mangrove water as the water level receded to pre rainfall levels and the temperature effect was not observed in areas dominated by an upland forested terrain a model of the groundwater mangrove interaction was developed with an on off switch for the flow of mangrove water into the groundwater system when the rainfall is sufficiently large the model reproduces the observed timing difference in the temperature and conductivity response and matches the field data during rainfall events this model shows the effectiveness of simple box models in understanding a complicated geophysical processes and provides quantitative support to this previously hypothesized groundwater interaction keywords times series

mayan riviera pelas 2011 garcia flores et al 2008 and risks due to climate change mendoza gonzález et al 2013 the hydrology of the yucatan peninsula remains incompletely understood previous research has shown that the dominant drivers of yucatan aquifer dynamics are sea level fluctuations and changes in the hydraulic head whitaker and smart 1990 beddows et al 2007 however it is only recently that the impact of short term intense rainfall events on the aquifer have been examined coutino et al 2017 kovacs et al 2017 and kovacs et al 2018 showed that hurricane rainfall results in mixing of the meteoric water mass mewm with the marine water mass mawm with subsequent re stratification taking days to weeks to occur however the mixing dynamics of less intense storms have not been investigated nor the role of surficial terrain on the hydrology given the prevalence of open cenotes with mangrove coverage in the coastal zone it is expected that the mangroves may play a role in the upper aquifer dynamics collins et al 2015 mcneill jewer et al 2019 during the time period of may 2016 to may 2018 a series of depth salinity and temperature sensors were positioned in the mewm 2 m depth throughout the yax chen which is part of the larger ox bel ha cave system fig 1 the sensors recorded various rainfall events hurricane earl in august 2016 hurricane franklin and hurricane harvey in august 2017 hurricane nate in september 2017 and tropical storm philippe in october 2017 over this period it was observed that rainfall events caused differing response in the temperature water depth and salinity of the mewm depending on rainfall amount and duration further differences were noted between groundwater areas with predominant mangrove coverage compared to forested terrain mangroves can trap and accumulate organic debris within their root systems and over time form extensive peat deposits that act as an aquitard which prevents or dampens downward flow of rainfall through the underlying karst twilley and chen 1998 collins et al 2015 and mcneill jewer et al 2019 found large rainfalls raised the water table resulting in mangrove water flowing into the sinkholes as water level decreased post rainfall the mangrove water mass mgwm would be warmer due to a high residence time and heating due to direct solar radiation and its contact with the overlying warmer atmospheric air thus as this warmer water mass drained into the sinkhole it would cause an increase in groundwater temperatures in contrast the upland forest terrain would experience only a minimal change in groundwater temperature as the rainfall which is cooler than the groundwater would directly percolate through the overlying karst into the mewm a similar effect has also been noted approximately 50 km to the south at bahia de la ascension lagoon in the sian ka an biosphere reserve medina gómez et al 2014 observed that during the rainy season increased mangrove discharge to the lagoon was characterized by increases water temperatures and lower salinity values to test this hypothesis a box model of the mangrove cenote groundwater interaction was created and validated using a flow switch for the mangroves if a certain water level is reached when rain data from 2017 was used the box model results matched the observations validating the mangrove flooding hypothesis which was hypothesised with prior sediment transport and accumulation data 1 1 yucatan hydrogeology the yucatan peninsula which encompasses three mexican states is composed of miocene to late pleistocene biogenic limestone with a total area of 165 000 km2 the limestone has undergone intense dissolution through cycles of sea level change creating a karst topography over much of the peninsula weidie 1985 a prominent feature of karstic landforms are sinkholes and cave systems which are created through mixing zone dissolution ford and williams 2013 smart et al 2006 the dominant class of sinkhole in the eastern part of the yucatan peninsula consists of points of bedrock collapse regionally called cenotes that form when the roof of a cavern or cave passage breaks down to expose the subsurface smart et al 2006 gutiérrez et al 2014 additionally the high porosity of this limestone 14 23 beddows et al 2007 results in no surficial rivers as rainfall quickly infiltrates to the aquifer and flows towards the coast emblanch et al 2003 stoessell 1995 beddows et al 2007 on a large regional scale fracture zones create directions of preferential groundwater flow parallel to the coast bauer gottwein et al 2011 the aquifer is stratified with a mewm located above an underlying mawm though there can be variation throughout the region the rain derived mewm has a lower temperature 25 c and lower salinity 1 10 ppt than the mawm 26 28 c and 35 ppt respectively stoessell and coke 2006 kovacs et al 2017 coutino et al 2017 in areas of open water such as lakes or cenotes a thermocline is formed in the upper mewm beddows 2004 the temperature can increase from 27 c in the lower mewm to 30 c near the surface the interface between the water masses is a mixed brackish layer called the halocline or mixing zone that while generally thin increases in vertical extent as it approaches the coast bauer gottwein et al 2011 this stratification is well documented for many coastal systems especially given a porous coastal geology cooper et al 1964 though the hydrodynamics of this system are still not fully understood specifically while several groundwater models exist for coastal ocean geographies jones et al 2000 sanford and konikow 1989 they typically assume that the region of interest has a homogeneous porosity hubbert 1940 wilson 2005 however due to the presence of the fractures and in particular the large scale cave networks this is not the case in the yucatan peninsula kambesis and coke 2013 the porous geology and cave networks also allow for propagation of tides further inland than is typically expected with tides however the overall amplitude is relatively low at 0 5 cm near the coast beddows 2004 while generally understood to occur and contribute to water quality changes beddows et al 2007 the specifics of mixing between the mawm and mewm have only recently been investigated kovacs et al 2017 and coutino et al 2017 demonstrate the large impact that hurricanes have on the water column specifically focusing on the yax chen cave system part of the larger ox bel ha system fig 1 while brankovits et al 2018 has examined water column mixing with regards to methane dynamics at a more inland portion of the ox bel ha system brankovits et al 2018 also reported increased mixing during the wet season compared to the dry season 1 2 yucatan climate the climate of the yucatan peninsula is strongly tied to the position of the inter tropical convergence zone itcz the concentrated band of low pressure located 5 15 degrees above the equator which is characterized by large scale thunderstorms and precipitation gill 1976 the yucatan peninsula is located directly under the yearly migration path of the itcz thus when it moves overhead during the summer wet season large scale precipitation occurs throughout the region to highlight this during the wet season may october in 2017 the yucatan peninsula the states of quintana roo yucatan and campeche had an average monthly precipitation of 552 mm month while during the dry season november april average monthly precipitation was 103 mm month https smn cna gob mx es climatologia temperaturas y lluvias resumenes mensuales de temperaturas y lluvias additionally between june and november numerous hurricanes form in the atlantic ocean and bring additional rainfall peaks up to 300 mm day to the region 1 3 box models box models have a long history in geophysics stommel 1961 budyko 1969 box models are simple and do not seek to fully represent a complicated system such as the climate instead they use a reduced number of variables and interactions to form and test hypotheses or explain field observations similar to a classical box model a water budget model can be considered a form of box model where each box now represents the location or state of the water twilley and chen 1998 created a water budget model for mangrove basin interactions which was used to develop a finite difference hydrology model this model was used to simulate the water level and salinity within 50 cm of the ground surface in rookery bay national estuarine research reserve florida u s a the authors found that salinity within the ground was more sensitive to prolonged rainfall deficits at higher elevations in the inter tidal zone where tidal inundation frequency is reduced 2 study area yax chen is a 2 7 km long subsection of cave passage and part of the larger ox bel ha cave system and is located approximately 9 km south of the city of tulum quintana roo fig 1 the primary entrance to the cave is located within cenote yax chen at approximately 270 km long ox bel ha is a very large network of anastomosing cave passages that generally trends in a nw to se in direction https caves org project qrss qrss htm fig 1 seven cenotes open along the length of cave passage covering a total open water cenote area of 35 000 m2 collins et al 2015 the main passage of the cave system is relatively shallow with a depth of 8 m in the downstream portion from the l shaped cenote to yax chen cenote and 10 11 m in the upstream section from l shaped cenote to gemini cenote collins et al 2015 flow within the passage is coast wards and is generally low at 10 cm s increasing to 25 cm s during heavy rainfall moore et al 1992 brankovits et al 2018 in the study area mangroves extend inland to the isod 2 cenote where the vegetation transitions to an upland forest terrain that is characterized by exposed karst with no or very thin soil coverage collins et al 2015 assuming a drainage area of 250 meters on either side of the main passage 2 km to the forested area the potential area of mangrove that could pond water to flow into the system would be 1 km2 collins et al 2015 meacham 2012 3 methods 3 1 sensor placement and rainfall data all sensors were placed within the cave passage at a depth of 2 m and were located 10 30 m downstream coast wards from cenotes gemini isod 2 l shaped and lil with the exception of yax chen which was placed below a dock within the cenote fig 2 red arrows cenote gemini is located well within the upland forest isod 2 cenote is located at the border of the upland forest and mangrove coverage fig 2 the yellow dashed line and the remaining cenotes l shaped lil and yax chen are located within the mangrove area two types of sensors were used 1 the hobo conductivity data logger from onset model u24 001 provides both conductivity 5 μ s cm and temperature 0 1 c measurements with resolutions of 1 μ s cm and 0 01 c respectively 2 the hobo water level data logger from onset model u20l 02 provides both water pressure 1 20 kpa and temperature 0 44 c measurements with resolutions of 0 04 kpa and 0 1 c respectively due to the lower temperature accuracy on the u20l the u24 temperature values were used an additional pressure sensor was affixed to a tree above a small unnamed cenote along the passage to record atmospheric pressure to calibrate the water pressure and calculate water depth an estimate of brackish water 1010 g m 3 was used for the water density as this most closely matched the observed mewm density 6 ppt collins et al 2015 kovacs et al 2017 specific conductance μ s cm was converted to salinity ppt using an empirical equation fofonoff and millard 1983 this equation is valid for salinity values from 2 to 42 ppt which is within the range of known salinity values for the system collins et al 2015 the sensors were left in place for two years though there are several gaps due to battery failure and sensor malfunction however as the data from the sensors was collected every six months in may and december the shortest gap in data was six months each of the sensor sites are named after the closest upstream cenote from furthest inland to the coast gemini isod 2 l shaped lil and yax chen fig 2 hourly rainfall data mm hr from the city of tulum was gathered from https www worldweatheronline com the weather data spanned the year of 2017 based on this data we will refer to a small rainfall event as one with a rainfall rate of less than 200 mm day while a large event is one with more than 200 mm day 3 2 model development a conceptual diagram illustrating the mangrove hypothesis proposed in collins et al 2015 is shown in fig 3 in mangrove covered areas confined aquifer rainfall is unable to infiltrate through the karst as the peat layer underneath the mangroves acts as an aquitard this pooled water has a high residence time in the mangrove and is thus warmed through solar forcing moreover the weak daily tidal pumping in this region is insufficient to flush it out during a light rainfall event the water table does not rise significantly and there is little surface flow from the mangroves into the open cenotes because of a low hydraulic gradient the dominant input to the groundwater is thus direct rainfall which is cools the groundwater byers et al 1949 kovacs et al 2018 during high rainfall events there is sufficient rainfall to raise the water table so that as the groundwater draws down post event a large hydraulic gradient is created between the open cenotes and the pooled mangrove water inflow of the warm water from the mangrove causes an increase in temperature in the cenote and surrounding groundwater in the forested areas unconfined aquifer the rainfall is able to directly infiltrate through the karst as the rain does not pool on the surface it is not warmed and subsequently directly cools the mewm to test the dynamics of the mangrove interaction hypotheses proposed in collins et al 2015 and mcneill jewer et al 2019 a simplified box model of the system was created the key interaction within the box model is a switch that allows flow from the mangrove into the cenote only if the mangrove water level has reached a specified minimum value a diagram of the model set up is shown in fig 4 there are two boxes in the model one representing the mangroves and one representing the cenote within these boxes both water temperature and water level are tracked the cenote water temperature may change due to a day night oscillation rainfall and mangrove overflow the cenote water level may change due to tidal oscillations rainfall and inflow from the surrounding mangrove both the mangrove temperature and water level change due to the rainfall and the water level also changes due to the inflow additionally all the fields are set to exponentially return to a prescribed background state the set of ordinary differential equations that govern this system can be written as dh c t dt r r t ti t k 1 h c 0 h c t t k 2 h m t θ h m t h cr dt c t dt k 3 t c 0 t t c t r r t h c t r t t c t k 4 h m t h c t t m t t c t θ h m t h cr dn t dh m t dt k 5 h m t k 2 h m t θ h m t h cr r r t dt m t dt k 6 t m 0 t m t r r t h c t r t t c t where h c is the cenote water level t c is the cenote temperature h m is the mangrove water level and t m is the mangrove temperature in these equations h c 0 is the base cenote water level t c 0 t is the base cenote water temperature fit t m 0 is the base mangrove water temperature h cr is the critical water level r t is the rain water temperature and θ t is the heaviside step function the k variables are rate constants we have elected to use a simple switch via the heaviside function to enable flow from the mangrove box to the cenote box as a preliminary attempt as we are primarily concerned with investigating the dynamical effects of the switch we have elected to simplify other aspects of the system namely the mangroves are not actively heated but rather return to a higher water temperature we are also assuming that there is a background state for all the variables to which the system returns water in our particular box equalizes with the rest of the groundwater as such the equations are non conservative the various parameters for this model were then calculated using the full two years of data from the isod 2 location close to the cenote entrance rate constants directly related to the cenote were calculated using exponential fits to the data while the other rate constants were tuned to give the same amplitude response as what is observed in the data the base water level was chosen to be the average depth of the open l shaped cenote the rain temperature of 25 c and mangrove temperature of 27 5 c were chosen based on field measurements while the critical mangrove water level of 0 20 m was selected to match data results all parameters were verified using a markov chain monte carlo algorithm using the stan software https mc stan org the baseline water level water temperature critical water level and rate constants are listed in table 1 the cenote water temperature was calculated using the

considered to be excessively complicated for a first implementation for the preliminary test cases a rain event was modelled as a gaussian curve over one day to compare with the observed data rainfall data from the city of tulum was interpolated onto a six minute time spacing and used as input for the model both the model presented here and the data used can be found athttps git uwaterloo ca acoutino mangrove box model git 4 results 4 1 sensor observations the water depth fig 5 a at all locations exhibit the same long term and short term oscillations with only minor differences in amplitude rapid increases in water depth are associated with rainfall events and are commensurate with previously observed water level changes in yax chen kovacs et al 2017 coutino et al 2017 also visible is the wet dry yearly oscillation which exhibits a slightly elevated average water level from august to january salinity fig 5 b follows a similar pattern to water depth exhibiting longer scale seasonal oscillations as well as prominent rapid increases resulting from large rainfalls the behaviour across all the sensor locations follows the same pattern though differing slightly in salinity value the most prominent features in the salinity graph are the large increases in salinity associated with hurricanes and tropical storms the largest event is hurricane nate in october 2017 this event caused a large increase in the salinity of the upper portion of the mewm raising it more than 2 5 ppt across all sensor locations in less than 12 h following hurricane nate and tropical storm philippe the previous gradient of salinity values yax chen most saline to gemini least saline changes with the isod 2 and l shaped locations becoming the least saline the other large salinity increase is hurricane earl in august 2016 however it does not appear to have had as long lasting an impact on mewm salinity as hurricane nate smaller rainfall events are also reflected as slight increases in salinity the temperature records fig 5 c show less variability with the large rainfalls the dominant responses are rapid small decreases followed by return to mean values over a slightly longer time the seasonal variation is visible in the temperature time series as two regular oscillations between wet and dry seasons the other dominant feature is the difference between yax chen l shaped isod 2 and lil cenote which have very similar temperatures 26 0 50 c and that of gemini which is 1 c cooler 25 0 50 c this temperature difference was verified with four independent dive computers that recorded a similar temperature decrease isod 2 exhibits the least amount of short term variability gemini exhibits a moderate amount and l shaped lil cenote and yax chen all have the most short term variability which follows the distribution of mangrove with gemini in an upland forested terrain isod 2 at the transition to mangrove and l shaped lil cenote and yax chen within the mangrove terrain fig 6 presents the data collected during the october 2017 rainfall events hurricane nate and tropical storm philippe where both events are visible as perturbations to all three records at all locations water level increased 0 34 m in 12 h at the gemini and isod 2 locations temperature water depth and salinity all begin to increase at the same time in contrast at the l shaped location water depth and salinity begin to increase at the same time but temperature only changes afterwards at yax chen small coincident peaks are observed across all the measurements followed by a decrease in water level a maximum in temperature and finally a maximum in salinity the pattern observed during the first event is consistent during the second event however during the second event the local maxima in salinity and temperature at the gemini and isod 2 locations coincide the response of the system to the october 2017 rain event fig 6 is contrasted with the response to a smaller rainfall in early january 2017 in which water level increased by 0 14 m in 24 h fig 7 across all locations the same pattern is observed an increase in water level an increase in salinity and decrease in temperature which all begin at the same time the local maxima in salinity and local minima in temperature coincide at the l shaped and lil locations while they do not coincide at the gemini and isod 2 locations following the event all the locations follow the same pattern of decreasing water depth and increasing temperature 4 2 model output to test the model the rainfall event is modelled by

removed we begin by considering two cases a low rainfall event and a high rainfall event the low event peaks at 10 mm hour while the high event peaks at 60 mm h fig 8 a presents the normalized water level and temperature of the cenote the water level reaches a maximum in the hours following the peak in rainfall at 200 h at a similar time the minimum in water temperature is observed the water level and temperature then return to their equilibrium values 150 h later the side panels fig 8 b c d e show the physical i e non normalized water temperature and water level fields for both the mangroves right and the cenote left the total increase in water level of both the mangroves and the cenote is 5 cm the water temperature in the mangroves drop approximately 0 08 c before quickly returning to the prescribed 27 5 c the water temperature in the cenote drops 0 008 c and takes 150 h to return to equilibrium values the quantity of water in the mangrove was substantially less than the cenote the rain thus proportionally cooled the mangrove more resulting in the small variation in the temperature the water level fig 9 a follows a similar pattern as in the low rainfall case peaking a few hours after the maximum rainfall at 200 h however immediately following the peak the water level decayed slower than in the previous case until around 240 h when there was a cusp and then the water level decayed faster this abrupt change was due to the switch being activated until 240 h thereby reducing the draw down by adding mangrove water to the cenote box the temperature begins dropping slightly around 200 h and dramatically increases in the following hours until it reaching a peak at around 230 h the temperature then begins to decay slowly before reaching a cusp and then rapidly decaying to its undisturbed value physically the water level in both the mangrove and the cenote increased by 30 cm fig 9 b and d the mangrove water decreased by a maximum of 0 14 c fig 9 c the temperature in the cenote decreased by 0 01 c and then increased by 0 15 c fig 9 e for model runs meant to simulate measurements rainfall data from the city of tulum for the year of 2017 was used as input the results of the model were then compared to the sensor measurements from the l shaped location as it was within the mangroves and the data did not have any interruptions there is broad agreement between the model and sensor temperatures fig 10 a there are periods of time during which the model and the data align well 3000 500 h but also periods where the sensor data appears to exhibit more variation than the model from 0 2000 h and 7000 8500 h these periods coincide with the wet season and increased rainfall during the hurricane nate rainfall 6594 h the model precisely matches the timing of the increase in temperature this increase occurs 24 h after 6618 h the peak in water level the model and sensor water depths also exhibit broad agreement fig 11 the values did not match precisely during the middle portion of the year 3000 5000 h however the pattern of temporal change in water depth did many of the rainfall events are also captured however the model quickly returns to baseline conditions while the sensor data exhibits a slower rate of return and the measured water depth does not fully return to baseline further there are discrepancies in rainfall events with some increases appearing in one data set but not the other the hurricane nate event was captured accurately the timing of the model peak in water level was within 4 h of the observations and reflects the post rainfall decline in water level to quantify the agreement between the model and the field observations we have elected to use wavelet coherence torrence and compo 1998 grinsted et al 2004 due to the number of data points traditional cross correlation metrics do not provide meaningful values for example the correlation coefficient for the temperature is 0 83 and the coefficient for the depth is 0 22 however they both have a p value of 0 indicating they are significant both depth and temperature exhibit coherence fig 12 during the hurricane nate event 6600 h the model depth fig 12 a exhibits high 0 8 coherence with the field results particularly for the band between 96 h and 512 h the model temperature fig 12 b also exhibits high coherence however compared to the depth the temperature is coherent at a slightly shorter time band between 64 h and 130 h in both areas of coherence the arrows are pointed to the right indicating that there is essentially no phase shift 5 discussion there is a distinction between the response of the forested sensor locations fig 6 a and b and the mangrove surrounded locations fig 6 c and d to heavy rainfall events during hurricane nate within the forested locations the temperature and salinity respond at the same time indicating interaction of precipitation with the underlying mawm in the mangrove region the temperature and salinity responses are not coincident indicating a different mechanism of action in comparison to the other locations the temperature response in these areas is delayed and coincides with the decrease in water level post rainfall event together these responses indicate that there is a large input of warm fresh water that occurs after the rainfall this appears to be consistent as the same pattern occurs during tropical storm philippe and provides support for the mangrove influence hypothesis fig 3 collins et al 2015 used bi annually collected sediment traps within the yax chen cave system to show the effects of mangrove distribution and cenote size on cave sedimentation patterns and inferred that low lying mangrove environments allow flushing of nutrient rich waters into the sunlit cenotes during large rainfalls causing increased primary productivity which is then advected downstream into the cave passages recently mcneill jewer et al 2019 has also found that the mangroves have an impact on the elemental inputs to the aquifer using the same sediment trap configuration as collins et al 2015 and mcneill jewer et al 2019 detected increased levels of silica and organic matter inputs from the mangrove areas when compared to the terrestrial forest areas these elemental signatures added support to the hypothesis proposed in collins et al 2015 that the mangrove dominated cenotes act as points of water collection during heavy rainfall due to concentration of rainwater within the surrounding mangrove peat it was hypothesized that the peat aquitard prevents immediate downward percolation after rainfalls and allows for the accumulation of nutrients within the water which later provides organic matter inputs to the cave system in contrast the upland forest terrain has less nutrient input into the cave system as rainfall is able to directly percolate through the karst and into the subsurface aquifer although this was a plausible explanation for the pattern of deposition observed in the sediment trap data there was no direct hydrological data to reinforce this interpretation the box model created in this paper provides the hydrological connection and data to solidify this interpretation the difference in response across the geographic locations during heavy rainfall events is contrasted with the similarity in response across the geographic locations to small rainfall events fig 7 while there are minor differences in timing and specific values the general pattern of response across all the locations is consistent the temperature response to smaller events is the opposite to what is observed during heavy rainfall events a decrease in temperature rather than an increase this indicates that the mechanism which drives the differences observed during heavy rainfalls is not active during smaller ones which further supports the mangrove influence hypothesis the box model was created with the intention of testing the influence of mangrove coverage specifically the difference in timing of the responses of temperature and water level this is illustrated in the difference in response of the model to a high and low rainfall event comparing the shape of model created curves during the low rainfall event fig 8 with those observed in the data fig 7 we can see that the pattern is qualitatively similar during the high rainfall event the dynamics are fundamentally different fig 9 than in the low rainfall and the dynamics are qualitatively similar to those observed in the data fig 6 specifically a sharp peak in water level corresponds to a small decrease followed by large increase in temperature more importantly the model captures the delay in temperature peak observed in the field data when the tulum rain data is used as input for the model fig 10 and fig 11 the results broadly reproduce what is observed while there are differences the focus of the model the response to rainfall events is faithfully reproduced specifically the timing of both the peak in water level and water depth during hurricane nate are extremely accurate as this model was designed to capture the dynamics of rainfall events the primary validation we are concerned with are these responses and not the longer time scale aquifer dynamics for which this simple model may not be suitable this model was designed specifically to capture the dynamics of rainfall events hence we are not concerned with the general difference that could be observed during the non rainy portions of the year the box model is extremely simple and does not include many of the known forcing mechanisms and dynamics such as spring and neap tides and the suppression of tidal oscillations during the rainfall events coutino et al 2017 while the rainfall data taken from the city of tulum is relatively close to the field location the extremely localized nature of the rainfall events in this region results in an error in the timing and magnitude of many of the events further due to the connected nature of the groundwater it is possible that rainfall events from upstream of the study site can impact the observations which would not be captured by relying solely on rainfall from tulum 6 conclusions in this paper we have presented results from the ongoing study of the coastal quintana roo aquifer and the yax chen cave network conductivity temperature and pressure sensors placed high in the water column have corroborated the results found in coutino et al 2017 and kovacs et al 2017 the data that was collected from yax chen sites covering both mangrove dominated coastal areas and forested upland areas show systemic differences in their response to large rainfall events in the forested areas the rainwater directly infiltrates into the subsurface and results in mixing of the mawm this is expressed by the coincident salinity and temperature increases observed in the sensor data in the mangrove covered areas there is a small initial decrease in temperature followed by a large increase in water temperature that is not coincident with salinity this occurs during the water level decline that follows a rainfall event following the hypothesis raised in collins et al 2015 we suspected that this was a result of mangrove coverage surrounding the cenotes with the underlying mangrove peat layer acting as an aquitard and forcing the water to collect in the mangroves this water would be warmed through air temperature and solar forcing and when the water levels began to decrease post rainfall would flow into the cenotes and warm the mewm this effect is contrasted by smaller rainfall events where the mangrove peat is not fully saturated and does not accumulate enough to flow into the cenotes during draw down this is observed in the sensor data as both forested and mangrove covered areas responding similarly to these events this hypothesis was tested by creating a box model of this interaction with a switch allowing for flow from the mangroves when a certain minimum water table level is reached through simplified test cases it was shown that the observed dynamics were captured by this simple model the model was then tested by forcing using rainfall data from the city of tulum for the year 2017 during the hurricane event there is correspondence between the model and the observations the results of this analysis indicate that our hypothesis was correct and the mangroves are the primary reason for this difference in dynamics understanding this pathway of mangrove water into the aquifer is important as mangrove peat can often be a heavy metal sink and when heavily disturbed could potentially become a source of nutrients and contaminants to oligotrophic shallow coastal zones and reef systems due to increased erosion deforestation and degradation as the area continues developing clark et al 1998 defew et al 2005 bayen 2012 there are many natural extensions to the model beginning with the addition of salinity and partitioning the cenote box into two boxes one for each of the mewm and mawm this would allow for the investigation of the impact that the mangroves have on mixing and stability within the water column furthermore due to the simplicity of the model long time simulations can be carried out quite easily it would be reasonable to compute 1000 calendar years of the aquifer in a few hours of computation specifically this model would allow for statistical distributions of rainfall to be input and their effect on the groundwater to be considered with the advent of anthropogenic climate change and sea level rise significantly more of the yucatan platform will consist of these coastal mangrove systems and more variable climate will result in changes to how the aquifer responds this is particularly important given the effect of global climate change and sea level rise which will likely submerge these mangrove areas in the coming decades this coupled with increased coastal development may heavily disturb the mangrove ecosystem and could potentially change mangrove peat from a sink to a source of heavy metals and other nutrients kathiresan and bingham 2001 marchand et al 2011 which could have serious impacts for coastal environments another avenue of further research would be a larger investigation into the effect that the tides play on mangrove inundation and the impacts that it may have on the mewm due to the relatively weak coastal tidal amplitudes the effects would likely be limited to near surface waters as the mangrove water slowly flows into the cenotes however such consistent flushing may have larger environmental effects due to micro nutrient inputs this work has shown that the mangroves are the likely reason for dynamical differences in rainfall events however the impact of this effect on the aquifer system remain to be documented in detail in addition to supporting the results showing differences in geo chemical signatures of the sediment input based on cenote vegetation coverage mcneill jewer et al 2019 it highlights the effect that mangroves can have on the groundwater in extremely karstic areas declaration of competing interest the

5717,the soil and water assessment tool swat model is one of the most extensively used watershed scale models across the world in recent years in order to enhance the potential of swat code maintenance and future development a completely reconstructed version of swat dubbed swat has been just released in addition to the new model structure in swat reservoir operation functions have been added to improve the performance of model simulations before conducting watershed scale model simulations reservoir functions of swat were further coupled with the automatic calibration tool ipeat to better consider the interactions among reservoir parameters and the corresponding hydrologic processes in this study a total of 123 reservoirs were simulated at daily scale across the contiguous united states conus a series of reference values of reservoir parameters total 15 were categorized based on different classifications i reservoir capacity ii reservoir release iii climate conditions and iv reservoir storage and release overall results showed that the performance of reservoir simulations at daily scales is satisfactory by commonly adopted statistical measures in different scenarios sfnfd seasonal flood control drawdown days during non flood season from 5 to 126 days effld exclusive flood control drawdown days from 0 1 to 2 1 days and efflc exclusive flood control constant flow from 4 8 to 6 5 ha m are sensitive parameters and the converged parameter ranges were close to each other but not for other parameters the recommended parameter ranges may be embedded by varying sources of uncertainty however the proposed calibration guidelines provide fast and accessible reference for future swat studies especially in subjects related to reservoir operations keywords calibration guidelines reservoir module swat ipeat optimization 1 introduction in the past 30 years the soil and water assessment tool swat arnold et al 1998 has become one of the most extensively used watershed scale models across the world it is a semi distributed continuous time hydrologic model with the following components weather surface subsurface flows return flow percolation evapotranspiration transmission losses pond and reservoir storage crop growth and irrigation reach routing nutrient and pesticide loading and water diversion swat has been applied to perform simulations for streamflow sediment and water quality processes at watershed scales with over 3 800 peer reviewed publications https www card iastate edu swat articles it has proven to be an effective tool to quantify the impacts of anthropogenic activities such as management practices and land use changes under various climate scenarios in large watersheds xia et al 2014 abbaspour et al 2015 wang et al 2016 in addition swat model is also adopted by government agencies and policy makers such as the conservation effects assessment project ceap conducted by the department of agriculture united states usda nrcs 2011 white et al 2014 scavia et al 2017 and environmental assessments by us epa yen et al 2016a while many previous research work and scientific projects across the globe have demonstrated the flexibility and effectiveness of swat in evaluating water quantity and quality subjects several weaknesses and limitations of the model are shown to have negative impact on future model development by the swat developer group and scientists in the swat community all over the world several issues have been addressed that could lead to less accurate simulation of individual processes regional adaptations to specific environmental conditions or linkages of swat with other models gassman 2017 numerous modifications have been added or revised in swat which results in source code that is increasingly difficult to manage and maintain the flexibility for potential model improvements is limited and the computational speed in simulations is reduced in the current structure therefore a completely reconstructed version of swat dubbed swat bieger et al 2017 arnold et al 2018 has been released recently with entirely new coding features swat is more flexible than swat in terms of spatial representation and the associated modular codes are designed to facilitate future applications and development for general users the advancement of the swat model is expected to continue as the worldwide swat community and the number of innovative applications continues to grow water is a vital resource that supports all forms of life pimentel et al 2004 unfortunately water is not evenly distributed by location or by season across the globe some areas are arid and water is a scarce and precious commodity whereas some receive excess rain causing flooding with loss of lives and property schultz et al 2017 throughout history reservoirs and dams have been constructed to collect store and manage the supply of water which can provide benefits such as flood and drought control recreation fishery wildlife habitats and also hydro electric power generation impacts of reservoirs on water are substantial to the hydrologic cycle causing significant effects as reservoirs are interconnected throughout most river network kim 2013 it is known that reservoir operation may vary substantially by the initiated purposes and goals research work can be found while different scientific targets were selected for instance hedging rule policies were investigated by analyzing the corresponding water availability demands and inflow uncertainty you and cai 2008 flushing strategies were developed by using network flow programming to better represent and compromise the potential conflicts between sediment load releases versus the goal of maximizing water supply chou and wu 2016 on the other hand it is difficult to develop universal reservoir operation routines or models for all possible cases development of realistic reservoir models can be tedious whereas sophisticated algorithms such as data mining or linear dynamic programming may be required hejazi and cai 2011 therefore most reservoir operation functions are embedded in programs with multiple tasks for example reservoir operation was incorporated with fish ecosystem restoration in east central illinois united states yang and cai 2011 in this case fish community is the primary research subject and reservoir operation is only the associated technical section however within swat model the reservoir module was simplistic and did not always provide accurate estimation of reservoir releases and ultimately streamflow sediment and load nutrients it is complicated and difficult to build a better reservoir module in current swat framework because of the limitations in model structure for instance in the swat application in mekong river basin vietnam water release and the consequence hydropower generation it was found that default swat framework cannot properly simulate complex hydrologic processes with large number of reservoirs in the system khan et al 2017 one has to manually revise the source code in each case study to provide scientific reliable results in addition for national scale environmental assessment e g ceap even a simple robust reservoir operation module that can be easily parameterized for all reservoirs in the u s is still needed thus it is timely important to add a new reservoir release module into swat taking advantage of its modular structure additional functions can be incorporated flexibly into swat framework the new functions of reservoir operation require additional parameters a total of 15 users may be confused about the associated functionalities and the recommended ranges of parameters are not yet defined in this study the automatic calibration program integrated parameter estimation and uncertainty analysis tool ipeat yen et al 2014 yen et al 2019 was coupled with swat to conduct reservoir operations ipeat has been shown to have pronounced flexibility in integrating with watershed models such as swat and agricultural policy environmental extender apex wang et al 2014 users can take advantage of the ipeat platform to perform calibration work efficiently the primary goal in this study is to develop a more realistic reservoir module for swat with recommended parameter ranges for national environmental assessments and also to the user community specifically three objectives are defined i develop a reservoir release model based on outflow storage relationships ii incorporate the release model into swat and optimize parameters by using ipeat and iii provide recommended parameter ranges for reservoirs in conus more than 120 reservoirs across conus were simulated reference tables of reservoir parameters in swat were categorized by different classifications 2 materials and methods 2 1 reservoir data source collection of historical reservoir data is a difficult and time consuming task u s reservoirs are owned and operated by a variety of federal state or municipal agencies various quasi governmental institutions and even private individuals or companies therefore reservoir release and storage data were derived from a variety of sources and differ greatly in quality and consistency many reservoirs in the u s are operated by the u s army corps of engineers ace ace is organized into seven operational districts each separately maintaining historical data for ace impoundments within its jurisdiction each district was contacted to obtain historical reservoir data with varying degrees of success some districts historical data were readily accessible via the web others were able to query their systems manually and some were unable to provide useful information the united states geological survey usgs maintains records on some structures e g dams whereas these are available via their web portal the bureau of reclamation also manages reservoirs throughout the western u s and the corresponding data were contacted to obtain historical data the tennessee valley authority tva provided historical release data for major structures on the ohio and tennessee rivers within its jurisdiction finally a limited number of municipally or state operated reservoir managers were contacted to obtain data in this study available reservoir data results 157reservoirs zip location of reservoirs is shown in fig 1 and the summarized detail of reservoirs reservoir details organized 123 reservoirs xlsx are stored in the swat reservoir operation database swat rod https soilandwaterhub brc tamus edu home swatplus maintained by the united states department of agriculture and also texas a m university additional data will also be uploaded onto the database in the future 2 2 the swat swat model the swat mode is a comprehensive time continuous semi distributed process based model developed by the united states department of agriculture usda arnold et al 1998 it is an effective tool for simulating various river flows over long periods of time swat has been successfully applied to many regions of the world with application to land use and climate change soil erosion crop yields and water quality rahman et al 2013 abbaspour et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 yuan et al 2018 wang et al 2019 in large river basins it is also used to assess the impacts of climate change and water management dile et al 2016 xu et al 2013 wang and kalin 2018 yan et al 2018 the first step of this model is to divide the basin into subbasins based on topography swat subsequently determines hydrological response units hrus within each sub basin based on soil land use and slope the calculation of the hydrologic cycle is based on water balance including snow soil shallow aquifer and deep aquifer using daily meteorological data daily monthly and annual fluxes of water and solutes can be simulated in river basins at hru level and aggregated for subbasins and the basin then loads are transported and routed through the river network more information about this model can be obtained from the official model literature arnold et al 1995 neitsch et al 2011 swat is the reconstructed version of the swat model developed to be more flexible in advanced upgrades and forthcoming expansion bieger et al 2017 the primary contribution of swat is that the spatial objects have been constructed as independent modules hydrologic response units hrus aquifers channels ponds reservoirs point sources and inlets to ease model maintenance and the corresponding development in addition to modularization there are also some main developments to improve performance of the model for example new functionalities of aquifers are available in swat aquifers were linked with hrus while the corresponding aquifer boundaries can now be defined flexibly without following the limitations of hrus in swat 2 3 reservoir functions 2 3 1 daily water balance and water quality processes in swat swat currently simulates a complete water balance for each reservoir in a river network neitsch et al 2011 1 v i v i 1 v flowin v rel v pcp v evap v seep where v is water volume in ha m i is the current day i 1 is the previous day flowin is the streamflow into the reservoir rel is water released and pcp evap and seep are the daily volume of precipitation evaporation and seepage respectively in addition to hydrologic processes sediment within the reservoir is simulated using a sediment balance and settling rate not being applied in this study but only briefly introduced here in case potential users may be interested in exploring output variables else than flow the sediment balance is 2 se d i se d i 1 se d flowin se d stl se d flowout where sed is total sediment in metric tons i

nutrient and pesticide fate in reservoirs also assume well mixed conditions and details of nutrient and pesticide transformations can be found in neitsch et al 2011 2 3 2 new reservoir release algorithm for general application within a large scale watershed model it is required to have a simple yet realistic model for managed reservoirs that is easy to parameterize in this study the release model on u s ace seasonal and long term operating rules lund 1996 was adopted for a single reservoir operating purposes include flood control navigation environmental recreation water supply and hydropower 2 3 2 1 setting system zones first reservoirs were categorized into conceptual storage zones similar to those used by lund 1996 for the missouri river system fig 2 principal and emergency volumes are available for all reservoirs in the swat rod principal and emergency volumes were used as multiple use seasonal flood control and exclusive flood control volumes below multiple uses in permanent pool or dead storage no outflow occurs for illustration purpose the outflow storage curve for grapevine lake near dallas texas is shown in fig 3 to show the relationship between release volumes principle and emergency and model target volumes mu multiple use sfc seasonal flood control and efc exclusive flood control several general tendencies can be found in fig 3 the mu target is below the principal spillway which is indicating municipal and irrigation demand is being met below principal spillway water channel for regular targets such as domestic and agricultural usages apart from flood or emergency spillway there is a relatively sharp increase at the sfc target and especially at the efc target indicating high release to preserve flood control storage although there is significant scatter within zones some of the scatter is due to varying release due to flood season but much is due to short term local conditions such as increased municipal or irrigation demand and possibly release reductions due to local downstream flooding concerns 2 3 2 2 setting target volumes to develop generic inputs that may be transferable to reservoirs without storage release data target volumes are defined as a function of the difference between emergency and principal volumes 3 targmu pvol evol pvol mu targ 4 targsf pvol evol pvol sfc targ 5 targef pvol evol pvol efc targ where targmu targsf and targef are target volumes in ha m for multiple use seasonal flood control and exclusive flood control respectively mu targ sfc targ efc targ are multiple use seasonal flood control and exclusive flood control fractions model inputs respectively evol is emergency spillway release volume in ha m and pvol is principal spillway volume in ha m 2 3 2 3 setting release rates release rates or daily outflow volumes are denied for each of the three conceptual storage zones assuming not outflow below the multiple use target permanent storage when the reservoir volume between the multiple use and seasonal flood control targets the release rate is dependent on flood season and is defined as the sum of a constant release plus a drawdown release shown in fig 2 6 vre l mu nf c

2 4 ipeat ipeat is the computational framework developed to conduct watershed model calibration and uncertainty analysis yen et al 2014 ipeat has been integrated with watershed models such as swat and apex wang et al 2014 in this study ipeat was coupled with reservoir functions of swat to develop calibration guidance for reservoir operation the integrated program links swat reservoir functions with ipeat framework the optimization technique used in ipeat is the dynamically dimensioned search which is a bayesian inference that can be flexible in searching solutions in domain space yen et al 2015 it has been shown to demonstrate superior performance in searching for optimal solutions with relatively easy operation requirements yen et al 2015 users only need to decide the total number of model evaluations and the desired objective function to run the program the goal of this study is to examine the sensitivity among reservoir parameters in swat and to provide recommended guidelines in varying situations by using data from 123 reservoirs in the united states detailed calibration validation routines could be extremely time consuming to the original research goals therefore all reservoir parameters a total of 15 as shown in table 1 will be included during automatic calibration routines please note that all the reservoir data was used for model calibration in this study details of the integrated program can be found in the appendix and the corresponding code is available upon request will be available later on the swat official website https swat tamu edu 2 5 evaluation of model performance in this study the nash sutcliffe coefficient ns nash and sutcliffe 1970 and pbias have been used as indicators for the best fit simulations the values of ns and pbias are calculated as 11 ns 1 i 1 n q i s i 2 i 1 n q i q 2 12 p b i a s 100 n 1 n q i s i m 1 m q i where q i represents the observed data s i represents the model simulated value q and s are the mean of observed and model simulated values for the entire time period of the evaluation respectively and i 1 2 n where n is the total number of observed and simulated data pairs ns measures the difference between the observed value and the simulated value the value of ns close to one indicates the best model performance perfect match between simulation outputs versus observation data the value of ns can be divided into four levels at monthly scales moriasi et al 2007 very good performance 0 75 ns 1 good performance 0 65 ns 0 75 satisfactory performance 0 50 ns 0 65 and unsatisfactory performance ns 0 50 note that percent bias was also implemented in this study to serve as a supplementary statistical measure instead of just using ns pbias is the deviation of data being evaluated expressed as a percentage the optimal value of pbias is 0 0 with small values indicating accurate model simulation negative values indicate model overestimation bias and positive values indicate model underestimation bias gupta et al 1999 based on moriasi et al 2007 the value of pbias can also be divided into four levels at monthly scales very good performance p b i a s 10 good performance 10 p b i a s 15 satisfactory performance 15 p b i a s 25 and unsatisfactory performance p b i a s 25 in addition statistical recommendations from moriasi et al 2007 were developed for streamflow predictions but not for managed reservoir releases although general reservoir operation rules and releases are generally following the corresponding flow patterns there are often specific local conditions that could require further adjustments of the operation rules therefore it is even more challenging to make accurate predictions in this study according to the simulating scales i e daily simulation scale and the reservoir data limitation model performance evaluation criteria were relaxed slightly reservoirs which both ns larger than 0 1 and pbias less than 35 were selected to analyze and further provide a recommended reference of the reservoir parameter ranges 2 6 classification of reservoirs in this study reservoirs with ns values more than 0 1 and absolute pbias values less than 35 were selected to build the reference guidelines of best daily simulation parameters in conus a total of 123 reservoirs were selected in these 123 reservoirs reservoir characteristic of storage release climate conditions are the basic information in order to facilitate the research without additional data three basic information sources were adopted which divided into four categories to build the guidelines based on the reservoir storage reservoirs were divided into three sub categories reservoir storage less than 10 000 ha m reservoir storage ranging 10 000 ha m to 100 000 ha m and reservoir storage more than 100 000 ha m based on the release reservoirs were divided into three sub categories reservoir daily release less than 1000 ha m reservoir daily release ranging 1000 to 10 000 ha m and reservoir daily release more than 10 000 ha m based on different climate reservoirs were divided into three sub categories the arid and semiarid region highlighted in red color the semiarid and semi humid region highlighted in yellow color the humid region highlighted in blue in fig 1 based on both storage and release reservoirs were divided into four sub categories median of storage and release 1 both reservoir storage and reservoir release less than the median 2 reservoir storage less than the median and reservoir release more than the median 3 reservoir storage more than the median and reservoir release less than the median and 4 both reservoir storage and reservoir release more than the median the details of scenarios and classifications were shown in table 2 3 results 3 1 performance of reservoir outflow simulations fig 4 shows the performance of daily reservoir outflow simulations for 123 reservoirs across the whole conus it can be found that the ns values in most reservoirs ranged from 0 1 to 0 7 while several were larger than 0 5 for pbias values in most reservoirs ranged from 10 to 10 in addition for reservoirs with low ns almost all had satisfactory pbias values therefore performance of daily reservoir outflow simulation was overall under the category of satisfactory based on both pbias and ns moriasi et al 2007 a reasonable pbias is relatively easy to attain with general release rules however it is difficult to obtain highly accurate daily release rates ns due to specific local conditions such as irrigation demand and downstream flooding concerns as shown in fig 5 simulated observed mean outflow and highest outflow were further compared in the 123 selected reservoirs simulated daily mean outflow was highly consistent with the observed mean outflow which the correlation coefficient r almost equals to 1 for high outflow simulation performance in most reservoirs were under satisfactory r 0 69 while overestimation for high flow can be found in a few reservoirs e g number 5 33 91 and 120 in brief from the perspective of the mean and high outflow simulation performance in most reservoirs was relatively in the category of satisfactory furthermore two best daily simulated and observed outflows were displayed from 1994 to 2015 as shown in fig 6 it can be found that simulations were underestimated for the high outflow in great salt plains reservoir while in caddo reservoir simulations were overestimated for the high outflow in general daily outflow simulations in both reservoirs were mostly under the statistical category of satisfactory 3 2 recommended parameter ranges by using different classifications the primary goal of this study is to propose a recommended list of parameter ranges for application in national conservation and environmental assessment however it s difficult to have a single set of recommended guidelines for all regions of the country therefore a series of categories were developed to properly reflect reservoir characteristics under the following conditions i reservoir capacity ii reservoir release iii climate conditions and iv reservoir capacity and release 3 2 1 reservoir capacity scenarios histograms of probability specifically probability distribution functions pdf for 15 parameters based on reservoir capacity classification s1 which reservoir capacity were less than 10 000 ha m was shown in fig 7 it can be shown that probabilities could concentrate within some intervals in parameters such as targmu targsf targef munfd sfnfd sffld effld and efflc these parameters were relatively sensitive to reservoir daily outflow while the rest was not sensitive as the corresponding probability was random in order to build the reference values of reservoir daily outflow simulation parameters based on reservoir storage classification i ranges of parameters can be narrowed based on the concentrated probability distribution ranges of parameters in reservoir storage classification 1 were shown in table 3 for sensitive parameters parameter ranges were 1 52 to 0 0 to 0 06 0 68 to 1 17 16 to 3192 5 to 124 3 to 123 0 17 to 2 15 and 4 8 to 6 4 for parameter targmu

changes though the sensitive parameters were completely the same the probability of 15 parameters based on reservoir capacity classification s3 which reservoir capacity was more than 100 000 ha m was shown in fig 9 the sensitive parameters were similar with the parameters in classification s1 and s2 whereas targmu and targsf were not sensitive as the reservoir capacity increases there are fewer restrictions adequate water supply so the required operation rules may reduce accordingly the best ranges for the sensitive parameters targef munfd munfc muflc sfnfd sfnfc sffld effld and efflc were 0

classification sr4 as shown in fig 18 most parameters were not sensitive with only five sensitive parameters in this scenario which were targef sfnfd sffld effld and efflc the ranges for the above sensitive parameters were 0 9 to 1 2 7 to 126 2 to 160 0 14 to 2 12 and 4 8 to 6 4 with the probability of 70 83 78 78 and 75 table 6 4 discussions 4 1 performance of recommended references for reservoir parameters in this study a simple reservoir module was proposed based on the release model on u s ace seasonal and long term operating rules lund 1996 reservoir modules were then conducted to optimize 123 individual reservoirs at a daily step finally recommended references of reservoir parameters within swat were developed based on the calibrated reservoir parameter it is really difficult to optimize reservoir modules with high statistical performance in daily steps while our results were relatively good compared to previous study for example yassin et al 2019 proposed dztr model reservoir operation algorithm and the ns of most reservoirs ranged from 0 to 0 75 even some were less than 0 data on reservoir storage inflow outflow and release existing for most reservoirs but they are not publicly available sometimes however storage data could be obtained from water level data which are generally available for major reservoirs and then could be converted to storage release data could also be deduced from the nearest downstream station in addition possibility of estimating storage and release data from different satellite data products was also found promising yassin et al 2019 climate information of the reservoirs was also easy to acquire therefore the recommended reservoir parameters were established mainly based on the basic reservoir characteristics which most reservoirs had or could be deduced according to the recommended reservoir parameters listed in tables 3 6 it is easier and timesaving for users to employ the reservoir parameter reference for example if the reservoir storage in their study is less than 10 000 104 m3 which is in classification s1 the corresponding parameter efflc could be ranged from 4 8 to 6 4 while as default the range was from 0 to 8 optimization and simulation time can be substantially reduced by using contractible parameter ranges to derive satisfactory results 4 2 applicability and advantages of new reservoir functions in swat for other commonly adopted watershed scale models such as hydrological simulation program fortran hspf bicknell et al 1997 and mike she refsgaard and storm 1995 simulation routines of reservoir operation are based on different strategy in hspf kinematic wave method is used whereas a piecewise linear function is implemented with corresponding depth and surface area during calculation in mike she reservoir simulation is a lot more sophisticated so that the topographical conditions can be better represented in each subwatershed combination of cells followed by mass balance functions both models could provide detailed simulation results in comparing with the version proposed in swat however the associated applicability of both models may come along with considerable computational burden if the targeted goal is nationwide environmental assessment in addition lack of data about the actual operation of numerous reservoirs could be another major barrier against applicability in sophisticated reservoir operation mechanisms in ceap i a total of four years 2003 2006 was taken to perform huc4 level hydrologic unit code 4 average size is around 36 000 km2 watershed simulation the size of conus is more than eight million square kilometers and it is extremely difficult to conduct large scale watershed simulation in a timely manner in addition to computational time it is also a challenging task to collect detailed reservoir data for the entire country specifically most reservoirs are having customized operation rules and regulations compensation could be made if reservoir data are not accessible the proposed new reservoir functions in swat offer easy and simply approach to address the corresponding issue in addition swat model was one of the widely used hydrologic model all over the world nationwide reservoir simulation could provide practical reference value for the researchers who focused on the hydrologic cycle in swat model 4 3 limitations and future development in this study it s not strictly sound to proclaim parameters to be sensitive by using pdfs as the primary reference on the other hand it is essentially important to provide preliminarily classified ranges for reservoir parameters before conducting national scale environmental assessment in addition observed reservoir data may not be abundant across large size of conus therefore in order to take full advantage of all reservoir information reservoir model evaluation criteria were relaxed in corresponding to the increase of model uncertainty from the given results it was found that model performance was not substantially affected in pbias than ns in addition in some countries scarcity of data could lead to higher uncertainty for the recommended default ranges however the given work can be expended by incorporating more data in the future so that the recommended default ranges will be more reliable for ceap ii ongoing since 2018 more data will be collected so that the proposed reference tables can be further revised in addition more categories e g new boundaries by state or local river network can be built to address more specific objectives in the program for swat development further modularization is continuing that will enhance maintenance and allow scientists to link other models to swat additional models that have been linked with swat code include modflow bailey et al 2017 and built in auto calibration tool dubbed ipeat yen et al 2019 current algorithm development includes salt transport a complete carbon budget and refinement of pathogen fate and transport with the new relational input data structure of swat national and global data files are being crowd sourced supported and maintained in addition to reservoir data data files for land management water management and structural conservation practices are actively developed and supported 5 conclusions in this study the coupled ipeat reservoir release model was implemented into four classifications reservoir capacity release climate and combination of storage release to develop calibration guidelines for the swat model for reservoir storage classification finalized parameter ranges vary in different reservoir capacity even for the sensitive parameters however for parameter targef sfnfd effld and efflc parameter ranges were almost same in different reservoir capacity around 0 67 to 1 18 5 to 126 0 1 to 2 15 and 4 7 to 6 4 for each in other words ranges of targef sfnfd effld and efflc remain the same regardless of reservoir capacity for reservoir release classification similarly parameter ranges were almost same in different reservoir capacity for targef sfnfd effld and efflc around 0 82 to 1 23 4 to 125 0 12 to 2 12 and 4 8 to 6 4 for each however for the climate scenario sensitive parameters vary under varying climate conditions specifically sensitive parameters in semiarid and semi humid region varied the most see fig 15 and table 5 it is probably because the quantity of reservoirs is most in this region and a smaller quantity of reservoirs in other climate could result in uncertainty in addition effld and efflc were almost the same in different climate conditions although there was a smaller quantity of reservoirs in some climate scenarios ranges of these two parameters were 0 11 to 2 12 and 4 7 to 6 5 which was very similar to that in reservoir capacity and release scenarios consideration of both reservoir storage and release it can be preliminarily concluded that the sensitive parameter ranges for sfnfd was almost same which was similar with the results derived in above three scenarios the ranges were 5 to 126 whereas other parameters were not the same as limited by the number of reservoirs in brief although the number of reservoirs was not enough much data of 123 reservoirs were collected to validate simulation results and the daily simulation was not very satisfactory for every reservoir while our results are still can be served as an useful referential guidelines for swat calibration it can be revised and updated if more data and case studies are available in the future credit authorship contribution

5717,the soil and water assessment tool swat model is one of the most extensively used watershed scale models across the world in recent years in order to enhance the potential of swat code maintenance and future development a completely reconstructed version of swat dubbed swat has been just released in addition to the new model structure in swat reservoir operation functions have been added to improve the performance of model simulations before conducting watershed scale model simulations reservoir functions of swat were further coupled with the automatic calibration tool ipeat to better consider the interactions among reservoir parameters and the corresponding hydrologic processes in this study a total of 123 reservoirs were simulated at daily scale across the contiguous united states conus a series of reference values of reservoir parameters total 15 were categorized based on different classifications i reservoir capacity ii reservoir release iii climate conditions and iv reservoir storage and release overall results showed that the performance of reservoir simulations at daily scales is satisfactory by commonly adopted statistical measures in different scenarios sfnfd seasonal flood control drawdown days during non flood season from 5 to 126 days effld exclusive flood control drawdown days from 0 1 to 2 1 days and efflc exclusive flood control constant flow from 4 8 to 6 5 ha m are sensitive parameters and the converged parameter ranges were close to each other but not for other parameters the recommended parameter ranges may be embedded by varying sources of uncertainty however the proposed calibration guidelines provide fast and accessible reference for future swat studies especially in subjects related to reservoir operations keywords calibration guidelines reservoir module swat ipeat optimization 1 introduction in the past 30 years the soil and water assessment tool swat arnold et al 1998 has become one of the most extensively used watershed scale models across the world it is a semi distributed continuous time hydrologic model with the following components weather surface subsurface flows return flow percolation evapotranspiration transmission losses pond and reservoir storage crop growth and irrigation reach routing nutrient and pesticide loading and water diversion swat has been applied to perform simulations for streamflow sediment and water quality processes at watershed scales with over 3 800 peer reviewed publications https www card iastate edu swat articles it has proven to be an effective tool to quantify the impacts of anthropogenic activities such as management practices and land use changes under various climate scenarios in large watersheds xia et al 2014 abbaspour et al 2015 wang et al 2016 in addition swat model is also adopted by government agencies and policy makers such as the conservation effects assessment project ceap conducted by the department of agriculture united states usda nrcs 2011 white et al 2014 scavia et al 2017 and environmental assessments by us epa yen et al 2016a while many previous research work and scientific projects across the globe have demonstrated the flexibility and effectiveness of swat in evaluating water quantity and quality subjects several weaknesses and limitations of the model are shown to have negative impact on future model development by the swat developer group and scientists in the swat community all over the world several issues have been addressed that could lead to less accurate simulation of individual processes regional adaptations to specific environmental conditions or linkages of swat with other models gassman 2017 numerous modifications have been added or revised in swat which results in source code that is increasingly difficult to manage and maintain the flexibility for potential model improvements is limited and the computational speed in simulations is reduced in the current structure therefore a completely reconstructed version of swat dubbed swat bieger et al 2017 arnold et al 2018 has been released recently with entirely new coding features swat is more flexible than swat in terms of spatial representation and the associated modular codes are designed to facilitate future applications and development for general users the advancement of the swat model is expected to continue as the worldwide swat community and the number of innovative applications continues to grow water is a vital resource that supports all forms of life pimentel et al 2004 unfortunately water is not evenly distributed by location or by season across the globe some areas are arid and water is a scarce and precious commodity whereas some receive excess rain causing flooding with loss of lives and property schultz et al 2017 throughout history reservoirs and dams have been constructed to collect store and manage the supply of water which can provide benefits such as flood and drought control recreation fishery wildlife habitats and also hydro electric power generation impacts of reservoirs on water are substantial to the hydrologic cycle causing significant effects as reservoirs are interconnected throughout most river network kim 2013 it is known that reservoir operation may vary substantially by the initiated purposes and goals research work can be found while different scientific targets were selected for instance hedging rule policies were investigated by analyzing the corresponding water availability demands and inflow uncertainty you and cai 2008 flushing strategies were developed by using network flow programming to better represent and compromise the potential conflicts between sediment load releases versus the goal of maximizing water supply chou and wu 2016 on the other hand it is difficult to develop universal reservoir operation routines or models for all possible cases development of realistic reservoir models can be tedious whereas sophisticated algorithms such as data mining or linear dynamic programming may be required hejazi and cai 2011 therefore most reservoir operation functions are embedded in programs with multiple tasks for example reservoir operation was incorporated with fish ecosystem restoration in east central illinois united states yang and cai 2011 in this case fish community is the primary research subject and reservoir operation is only the associated technical section however within swat model the reservoir module was simplistic and did not always provide accurate estimation of reservoir releases and ultimately streamflow sediment and load nutrients it is complicated and difficult to build a better reservoir module in current swat framework because of the limitations in model structure for instance in the swat application in mekong river basin vietnam water release and the consequence hydropower generation it was found that default swat framework cannot properly simulate complex hydrologic processes with large number of reservoirs in the system khan et al 2017 one has to manually revise the source code in each case study to provide scientific reliable results in addition for national scale environmental assessment e g ceap even a simple robust reservoir operation module that can be easily parameterized for all reservoirs in the u s is still needed thus it is timely important to add a new reservoir release module into swat taking advantage of its modular structure additional functions can be incorporated flexibly into swat framework the new functions of reservoir operation require additional parameters a total of 15 users may be confused about the associated functionalities and the recommended ranges of parameters are not yet defined in this study the automatic calibration program integrated parameter estimation and uncertainty analysis tool ipeat yen et al 2014 yen et al 2019 was coupled with swat to conduct reservoir operations ipeat has been shown to have pronounced flexibility in integrating with watershed models such as swat and agricultural policy environmental extender apex wang et al 2014 users can take advantage of the ipeat platform to perform calibration work efficiently the primary goal in this study is to develop a more realistic reservoir module for swat with recommended parameter ranges for national environmental assessments and also to the user community specifically three objectives are defined i develop a reservoir release model based on outflow storage relationships ii incorporate the release model into swat and optimize parameters by using ipeat and iii provide recommended parameter ranges for reservoirs in conus more than 120 reservoirs across conus were simulated reference tables of reservoir parameters in swat were categorized by different classifications 2 materials and methods 2 1 reservoir data source collection of historical reservoir data is a difficult and time consuming task u s reservoirs are owned and operated by a variety of federal state or municipal agencies various quasi governmental institutions and even private individuals or companies therefore reservoir release and storage data were derived from a variety of sources and differ greatly in quality and consistency many reservoirs in the u s are operated by the u s army corps of engineers ace ace is organized into seven operational districts each separately maintaining historical data for ace impoundments within its jurisdiction each district was contacted to obtain historical reservoir data with varying degrees of success some districts historical data were readily accessible via the web others were able to query their systems manually and some were unable to provide useful information the united states geological survey usgs maintains records on some structures e g dams whereas these are available via their web portal the bureau of reclamation also manages reservoirs throughout the western u s and the corresponding data were contacted to obtain historical data the tennessee valley authority tva provided historical release data for major structures on the ohio and tennessee rivers within its jurisdiction finally a limited number of municipally or state operated reservoir managers were contacted to obtain data in this study available reservoir data results 157reservoirs zip location of reservoirs is shown in fig 1 and the summarized detail of reservoirs reservoir details organized 123 reservoirs xlsx are stored in the swat reservoir operation database swat rod https soilandwaterhub brc tamus edu home swatplus maintained by the united states department of agriculture and also texas a m university additional data will also be uploaded onto the database in the future 2 2 the swat swat model the swat mode is a comprehensive time continuous semi distributed process based model developed by the united states department of agriculture usda arnold et al 1998 it is an effective tool for simulating various river flows over long periods of time swat has been successfully applied to many regions of the world with application to land use and climate change soil erosion crop yields and water quality rahman et al 2013 abbaspour et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 yuan et al 2018 wang et al 2019 in large river basins it is also used to assess the impacts of climate change and water management dile et al 2016 xu et al 2013 wang and kalin 2018 yan et al 2018 the first step of this model is to divide the basin into subbasins based on topography swat subsequently determines hydrological response units hrus within each sub basin based on soil land use and slope the calculation of the hydrologic cycle is based on water balance including snow soil shallow aquifer and deep aquifer using daily meteorological data daily monthly and annual fluxes of water and solutes can be simulated in river basins at hru level and aggregated for subbasins and the basin then loads are transported and routed through the river network more information about this model can be obtained from the official model literature arnold et al 1995 neitsch et al 2011 swat is the reconstructed version of the swat model developed to be more flexible in advanced upgrades and forthcoming expansion bieger et al 2017 the primary contribution of swat is that the spatial objects have been constructed as independent modules hydrologic response units hrus aquifers channels ponds reservoirs point sources and inlets to ease model maintenance and the corresponding development in addition to modularization there are also some main developments to improve performance of the model for example new functionalities of aquifers are available in swat aquifers were linked with hrus while the corresponding aquifer boundaries can now be defined flexibly without following the limitations of hrus in swat 2 3 reservoir functions 2 3 1 daily water balance and water quality processes in swat swat currently simulates a complete water balance for each reservoir in a river network neitsch et al 2011 1 v i v i 1 v flowin v rel v pcp v evap v seep where v is water volume in ha m i is the current day i 1 is the previous day flowin is the streamflow into the reservoir rel is water released and pcp evap and seep are the daily volume of precipitation evaporation and seepage respectively in addition to hydrologic processes sediment within the reservoir is simulated using a sediment balance and settling rate not being applied in this study but only briefly introduced here in case potential users may be interested in exploring output variables else than flow the sediment balance is 2 se d i se d i 1 se d flowin se d stl se d flowout where sed is total sediment in metric tons i is the current day i 1 is the previous day flowin is the sediment into the reservoir flowout is sediment released and stl is the daily amount of sediment settling to the reservoir bottom similarly nutrient and pesticide fate in reservoirs also assume well mixed conditions and details of nutrient and pesticide transformations can be found in neitsch et al 2011 2 3 2 new reservoir release algorithm for general application within a large scale watershed model it is required to have a simple yet realistic model for managed reservoirs that is easy to parameterize in this study the release model on u s ace seasonal and long term operating rules lund 1996 was adopted for a single reservoir operating purposes include flood control navigation environmental recreation water supply and hydropower 2 3 2 1 setting system zones first reservoirs were categorized into conceptual storage zones similar to those used by lund 1996 for the missouri river system fig 2 principal and emergency volumes are available for all reservoirs in the swat rod principal and emergency volumes were used as multiple use seasonal flood control and exclusive flood control volumes below multiple uses in permanent pool or dead storage no outflow occurs for illustration purpose the outflow storage curve for grapevine lake near dallas texas is shown in fig 3 to show the relationship between release volumes principle and emergency and model target volumes mu multiple use sfc seasonal flood control and efc exclusive flood control several general tendencies can be found in fig 3 the mu target is below the principal spillway which is indicating municipal and irrigation demand is being met below principal spillway water channel for regular targets such as domestic and agricultural usages apart from flood or emergency spillway there is a relatively sharp increase at the sfc target and especially at the efc target indicating high release to preserve flood control storage although there is significant scatter within zones some of the scatter is due to varying release due to flood season but much is due to short term local conditions such as increased municipal or irrigation demand and possibly release reductions due to local downstream flooding concerns 2 3 2 2 setting target volumes to develop generic inputs that may be transferable to reservoirs without storage release data target volumes are defined as a function of the difference between emergency and principal volumes 3 targmu pvol evol pvol mu targ 4 targsf pvol evol pvol sfc targ 5 targef pvol evol pvol efc targ

2 4 ipeat ipeat is the computational framework developed to conduct watershed model calibration and uncertainty analysis yen et al 2014 ipeat has been integrated with watershed models such as swat and apex wang et al 2014 in this study ipeat was coupled with reservoir functions of swat to develop calibration guidance for reservoir operation the integrated program links swat reservoir functions with ipeat framework the optimization technique used in ipeat is the dynamically dimensioned search which is a bayesian inference that can be flexible in searching solutions in domain space yen et al 2015 it has been shown to demonstrate superior performance in searching for optimal solutions with relatively easy operation requirements yen et al 2015 users only need to decide the total number of model evaluations and the desired objective function to run the program the goal of this study is to examine the sensitivity among reservoir parameters in swat and to provide recommended guidelines in varying situations by using data from 123 reservoirs in the united states detailed calibration validation routines could be extremely time consuming to the original research goals therefore all reservoir parameters a total of 15 as shown in table 1 will be included during automatic calibration routines please note that all the reservoir data was used for model calibration in this study details of the integrated program can be found in the appendix and the corresponding code is available upon request will be available later on the swat official website https swat tamu edu 2 5 evaluation of model performance in this study the nash sutcliffe coefficient ns nash and sutcliffe 1970 and pbias have been used as indicators for the best fit simulations the values of ns and pbias are calculated as 11 ns 1 i 1 n q i s i 2 i 1 n q i q 2 12 p b i a s 100 n 1 n q i s i m 1 m q i where q i represents the observed data s i represents the model simulated value q and s are the mean of observed and model simulated values for the entire time period of the evaluation respectively and i 1 2 n where n is the total number of observed and simulated data pairs ns measures the difference between the observed value and the simulated value the value of ns close to one indicates the best model performance perfect match between simulation outputs versus observation data the value of ns can be divided into four levels at monthly scales moriasi et al 2007 very good performance 0 75 ns 1 good performance 0 65 ns 0 75 satisfactory performance 0 50 ns 0 65 and unsatisfactory performance ns 0 50 note that percent bias was also implemented in this study to serve as a supplementary statistical measure instead of just using ns pbias is the deviation of data being evaluated expressed as a percentage the optimal value of pbias is 0 0 with small values indicating accurate model simulation negative values indicate model overestimation bias and positive values indicate model underestimation bias gupta et al 1999 based on moriasi et al 2007 the value of pbias can also be divided into four levels at monthly scales very good performance p b i a s 10 good performance 10 p b i a s 15 satisfactory performance 15 p b i a s 25 and unsatisfactory performance p b i a s 25 in addition statistical recommendations from moriasi et al 2007 were developed for streamflow predictions but not for managed reservoir releases although general reservoir operation rules and releases are generally following the corresponding flow patterns there are often specific local conditions that could require further adjustments of the operation rules therefore it is even more challenging to make accurate predictions in this study according to the simulating scales i e daily simulation scale and the reservoir data limitation model performance evaluation criteria were relaxed slightly reservoirs which both ns larger than 0 1 and pbias less than 35 were selected to analyze and further provide a recommended reference of the reservoir parameter ranges 2 6 classification of reservoirs in this study reservoirs with ns values more than 0 1 and absolute pbias values less than 35 were selected to build the reference guidelines of best daily simulation parameters in conus a total of 123 reservoirs were selected in these 123 reservoirs reservoir characteristic of storage release climate conditions are the basic information in order to facilitate the research without additional data three basic information sources were adopted which divided into four categories to build the guidelines based on the reservoir storage reservoirs were divided into three sub categories reservoir storage less than 10 000 ha m reservoir storage ranging 10 000 ha m to 100 000 ha m and reservoir storage more than 100 000 ha m based on the release reservoirs were divided into three sub categories reservoir daily release less than 1000 ha m reservoir daily release ranging 1000 to 10 000 ha m and reservoir daily release more than 10 000 ha m based on different climate reservoirs were divided into three sub categories the arid and semiarid region highlighted in red color the semiarid and semi humid region highlighted in yellow color the humid region highlighted in blue in fig 1 based on both storage and release reservoirs were divided into four sub categories median of storage and release 1 both reservoir storage and reservoir release less than the median 2 reservoir storage less than the median and reservoir release more than the median 3 reservoir storage more than the median and reservoir release less than the median and 4 both reservoir storage and reservoir release more than the median the details of scenarios and classifications were shown in table 2 3 results 3 1 performance of reservoir outflow simulations fig 4 shows the performance of daily reservoir outflow simulations for 123 reservoirs across the whole conus it can be found that the ns values in most reservoirs ranged from 0 1 to 0 7 while several were larger than 0 5 for pbias values in most reservoirs ranged from 10 to 10 in addition for reservoirs with low ns almost all had satisfactory pbias values therefore performance of daily reservoir outflow simulation was overall under the category of satisfactory based on both pbias and ns moriasi et al 2007 a reasonable pbias is relatively easy to attain with general release rules however it is difficult to obtain highly accurate daily release rates ns due to specific local conditions such as irrigation demand and downstream flooding concerns as shown in fig 5 simulated observed mean outflow and highest outflow were further compared in the 123 selected reservoirs simulated daily mean outflow was highly consistent with the observed mean outflow which the correlation coefficient r almost equals to 1 for high outflow simulation performance in most reservoirs were under satisfactory r 0 69 while overestimation for high flow can be found in a few reservoirs e g number 5 33 91 and 120 in brief from the perspective of the mean and high outflow simulation performance in most reservoirs was relatively in the category of satisfactory furthermore two best daily simulated and observed outflows were displayed from 1994 to 2015 as shown in fig 6 it can be found that simulations were underestimated for the high outflow in great salt plains reservoir while in caddo reservoir simulations were overestimated for the high outflow in general daily outflow simulations in both reservoirs were mostly under the statistical category of satisfactory 3 2 recommended parameter ranges by using different classifications the primary goal of this study is to propose a recommended list of parameter ranges for application in national conservation and environmental assessment however it s difficult to have a single set of recommended guidelines for all regions of the country therefore a series of categories were developed to properly reflect reservoir characteristics under the following conditions i reservoir capacity ii reservoir release iii climate conditions and iv reservoir capacity and release 3 2 1 reservoir capacity scenarios histograms of probability specifically probability distribution functions pdf for 15 parameters based on reservoir capacity classification s1 which reservoir capacity were less than 10 000 ha m was shown in fig 7 it can be shown that probabilities could concentrate within some intervals in parameters such as targmu targsf targef munfd sfnfd sffld effld and efflc these parameters were relatively sensitive to reservoir daily outflow while the rest was not sensitive as the corresponding probability was random in order to build the reference values of reservoir daily outflow

shown in fig 9 the sensitive parameters were similar with the parameters in classification s1 and s2 whereas targmu and targsf were not sensitive as the reservoir capacity increases there are fewer

reservoir parameters in this study a simple reservoir module was proposed based on the release model on u s ace seasonal and long term operating rules lund 1996 reservoir modules were then conducted to optimize 123 individual reservoirs at a daily step finally recommended references of reservoir parameters within swat were developed based on the calibrated reservoir parameter it is really difficult to optimize reservoir modules with high statistical performance in daily steps while our results were relatively good compared to previous study for example yassin et al 2019 proposed dztr model reservoir operation algorithm and the ns of most reservoirs ranged from 0 to 0 75 even some were less than 0 data on reservoir storage inflow outflow and release existing for most reservoirs but they are not publicly available sometimes however storage data could be obtained from water level data which are generally available for major reservoirs and then could be converted to storage release data could also be deduced from the nearest downstream station in addition possibility of estimating storage and release data from different satellite data products was also found promising yassin et al 2019 climate information of the reservoirs was also easy to acquire therefore the recommended reservoir parameters were established mainly based on the basic reservoir characteristics which most reservoirs had or could be deduced according to the recommended reservoir parameters listed in tables 3 6 it is easier and timesaving for users to employ the reservoir parameter reference for example if the reservoir storage in their study is less than 10 000 104 m3 which is in classification s1 the corresponding parameter efflc could be ranged from 4 8 to 6 4 while as default the range was from 0 to 8 optimization and simulation time can be substantially reduced by using contractible parameter ranges to derive satisfactory results 4 2 applicability and advantages of new reservoir functions in swat for other commonly adopted watershed scale models such as hydrological simulation program fortran hspf bicknell et al 1997 and mike she refsgaard and storm 1995 simulation routines of reservoir operation are based on different strategy in hspf kinematic wave method is used whereas a piecewise linear function is implemented with corresponding depth and surface area during calculation in mike she reservoir simulation is a lot more sophisticated so that the topographical conditions can be better represented in each subwatershed combination of cells followed by mass balance functions both models could provide detailed simulation results in comparing with the version proposed in swat however the associated applicability of both models may come along with considerable computational burden if the targeted goal is nationwide environmental assessment in addition lack of data about the actual operation of numerous reservoirs could be another major barrier against applicability in sophisticated reservoir operation mechanisms in ceap i a total of four years 2003 2006 was taken to perform huc4 level hydrologic unit code 4 average size is around 36 000 km2 watershed simulation the size of conus is more than eight million square kilometers and it is extremely difficult to conduct large scale watershed simulation in a timely manner in addition to computational time it is also a challenging task to collect detailed reservoir data for the entire country specifically most reservoirs are having customized operation rules and regulations compensation could be made if reservoir data are not accessible the proposed new reservoir functions in swat offer easy and simply approach to address the corresponding issue in addition swat model was one of the widely used hydrologic model all over the world nationwide reservoir simulation could provide practical reference value for the researchers who focused on the hydrologic cycle in swat model 4 3 limitations and future development in this study it s not strictly sound to proclaim parameters to be sensitive by using pdfs as the primary reference on the other hand it is essentially important to provide preliminarily classified ranges for reservoir parameters before conducting national scale environmental assessment in addition observed reservoir data may not be abundant across large size of conus therefore in order to take full advantage of all reservoir information reservoir model evaluation criteria were relaxed in corresponding to the increase of model uncertainty from the given results it was found that model performance was not substantially affected in pbias than ns in addition in some countries scarcity of data could lead to higher uncertainty for the recommended default ranges however the given work can be expended by incorporating more data in the future so that the recommended default ranges will be more reliable for ceap ii ongoing since 2018 more data will be collected so that the proposed reference tables can be further revised in addition more categories e g new boundaries by state or local river network can be built to address more specific objectives in the program for swat development further modularization is continuing that will enhance maintenance and allow scientists to link other models to swat additional models that have been linked with swat code include modflow bailey et al 2017 and built in auto calibration tool dubbed ipeat yen et al 2019 current algorithm development includes salt transport a complete carbon budget and refinement of pathogen fate and transport with the new relational input data structure of swat national and global data files are being crowd sourced supported and maintained in addition to reservoir data data files for land management water management and structural conservation practices are actively developed and supported 5 conclusions in this study the coupled ipeat reservoir release model was implemented into four classifications reservoir capacity release climate and combination of storage release to develop calibration guidelines for the swat model for reservoir storage classification finalized parameter ranges vary in different reservoir capacity even for the sensitive parameters however for parameter targef sfnfd effld and efflc parameter ranges were almost same in different reservoir capacity around 0 67 to 1 18 5 to 126 0 1 to 2 15 and 4 7 to 6 4 for each in other words ranges of targef sfnfd effld and efflc remain the same regardless of reservoir capacity for reservoir release classification similarly parameter ranges were almost same in different reservoir capacity for targef sfnfd effld and efflc around 0 82 to 1 23 4 to 125 0 12 to 2 12 and 4 8 to 6 4 for each however for the climate scenario sensitive parameters vary under varying climate conditions specifically sensitive parameters in semiarid and semi humid region varied the most see fig 15 and table 5 it is probably because the quantity of reservoirs is most in this region and a smaller quantity of reservoirs in other climate could result in uncertainty in addition effld and efflc were almost the same in different climate conditions although there was a smaller quantity of reservoirs in some climate scenarios ranges of these two parameters were 0 11 to 2 12 and 4 7 to 6 5 which was very similar to that in reservoir capacity and release scenarios consideration of both reservoir storage and release it can be preliminarily concluded that the sensitive parameter ranges for sfnfd was almost same which was similar with the results derived in above three scenarios the ranges were 5 to 126 whereas other parameters were not the same as limited by the number of reservoirs in brief although the number of reservoirs was not enough much data of 123 reservoirs were collected to validate simulation results and the daily simulation was not very satisfactory for every reservoir while our results are still can be served as an useful referential guidelines for swat calibration it can be revised and updated if more data and case studies are available in the future credit authorship contribution

5718,non rainfall water inputs nrwis provide crucial water resources for dryland ecosystems in arid and semi arid regions however little is known about the quantitative characteristics and formation of nrwis and the relative importance of nrwis as water sources in a dryland jujube ziziphus jujuba mill plantation in the hilly loess region of china the objectives of this study were to determine the characteristics of nrwis during the jujube growing season with regard to amount duration and contributions to transpiration evaporation and evapotranspiration dew intensity and duration were monitored using dielectric leaf wetness sensors also sap flow soil water content soil temperature and meteorological variables were measured during the 2017 and 2018 growing seasons nrwis were found to be composed of canopy dew cd and water vapor adsorption wvas in the 0 5 cm soil layer amounting to 75 218 mm in 2017 and 75 309 mm in 2018 cd accounted for about 81 of nrwi daily average cd was significantly greater than wvas p 0 05 and cd duration was 2 09 9 14 h more than wvas duration p 0 05 the cd rate and frequency generally exceeded that of wvas cd occurred from 19 00 to 9 00 wvas mainly occurred from 6 30 to 9 00 cd reduced nocturnal sap flow by 7 36 55 64 but increased soil water storage in the 5 100 cm root zone by 0 274 0 717 mm wvas had no effect on soil water evaporation over the entire growing season the ratio of cd to total transpiration was 0 218 in 2017 and 0 258 in 2018 and the ratio of wvas to soil water evaporation was 0 082 in both years nrwis occurred more frequently and were quantitatively more stable than rainfall events their contributions to evapotranspiration reached a maximum value of 0 184 in 2018 nrwis are important components of the hydrological cycle in this region and probably have potential positive ecological effects on dryland jujube plantations in the hilly loess region of china keywords non rainfall water input canopy dew water vapor adsorption transpiration evaporation 1 introduction non rainfall water inputs nrwis e g fog dew and water vapor adsorption are important but often neglected ecohydrological components of the surface water balance in terrestrial ecosystems kaseke et al 2017 wang et al 2017a gerlein safdi et al 2018a b nrwis are liquid surface water exclusive of rainwater and irrigation water resulting from the deposition and condensation of atmospheric water vapor nrwis can affect the energy balance of the soil plant atmosphere continuum and can produce more unique ecological and climatic effects compared with rainwater in arid zones agam and berliner 2006 over specific time periods the amount of water from nrwis can be greater than rainfall malek et al 1999 sometimes reaching a maximum rate of 5 mm d 1 wallin 1967 occurring on more than 70 of growing season days zhuang and zhao 2017 and amounting to 4 5 64 0 of total rainfall hao et al 2012 hanisch et al 2015 thus nrwis provide important water resources for maintaining ecosystems in arid and semi arid regions and are sometimes the only water sources for biological crusts insects small animals and plants in extremely arid desert areas tomaszkiewicz et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 kaseke et al 2017 in recent years nrwis have attracted interdisciplinary interest in such fields as plant physiology ecology meteorology and agriculture hanisch et al 2015 tomaszkiewicz et al 2017 groh et al 2018 fog or dew deposition on plant canopies provides supplementary water to plant leaves that can be directly absorbed and utilized through plant stomata or specialized plant organs konrad et al 2015 berry et al 2018 with water use ratios that are much higher than those associated with rainfall zhang et al 2010 in cloud forests of brazil nrwis were found to diffuse through the leaf cuticle of drimys brasiliensis miers contributing up to 42 of its total foliar water content eller et al 2013 in the garajonay national park of spain nrwis fog decreased transpiration of erica arborea l and myrica faya ait by 30 fold ritter et al 2009 and reduced solar radiation by 58 and temperature by 3 6 c compared with periods of no fog ritter et al 2008 sso and dawson 2004 found that fog suppressed transpiration and reversed xylem sap flow in sequoia sempervirens dew significantly increased net accumulation of photosynthate and the photosynthetic rate in leaves of bassia dasyphylla in desert regions zhuang and ratcliffe 2012 gerlein safdi et al 2018a developed an energy balance model for individual leaves to simulate effects of dew accumulation and evaporation on leaf transpiration and found a 30 decrease in the transpiration rate of highly hydrophobic leaves of colocasia esculenta compared with control leaves leaves that were left untouched and unmisted with isotopically labeled water δ18o 8 8 δ2h 737 remote sensing observations have shown that dew can affect microwave brightness temperature of and backscatter from vegetation kabela et al 2009 gerlein safdi et al 2018b modeled leaves with a characteristic length of 50 cm and found that dew suppressed transpiration by up to 25 and decreased co2 assimilation by up to 12 in addition dew can improve crop water use efficiency ben asher et al 2010 konrad et al 2015 and can provide a valuable supplementary water source for reforestation efforts during droughts or in arid or semi arid areas tomaszkiewicz et al 2017 the loess plateau of china is a typical arid and semi arid region nrwis are important supplementary water sources for the surface water budget in this

preliminary research studies have been conducted on nrwis in the semi arid loess plateau working on flat farmland without high rise buildings or trees zhang et al 2015 reported that nrwis accounted for 13 of the total land surface water sources some other scholars have only explored soil condensation water or dew in the loess plateau for example li 2002 studied the effects of gravel and sand mulches on soil condensation water wang and zhang 2011 investigated the physical characteristics of condensed atmospheric water in the soil surface layer and wang et al 2017b and jia et al 2019 analyzed characteristics of dew formation in jujube ziziphus jujuba mill plantations and an irrigation area respectively in light of these results we know some of the effects and characteristics of soil condensation water in the surface soil layer and dew formation on plants however the observed soil condensation water included vapor adsorption water thus soil condensation water amounts were overestimated and quantitative estimates and ecological effects of dew are still lacking for the loess plateau of china rainwater is the only soil water source for dryland farming in the hilly loess regions of china xin et al 2011 and has seen a significant decreasing trend in the past 50 years jujube is tolerant of drought and is of significant economic value it has been widely planted in the loess plateau region for the past 2000 years with a planting area of some one million hectares liu et al 2013 chen et al 2015 because rainwater cannot completely meet the water demands of vegetation in this region severe soil water deficits can occur in densely planted jujube plantations where a 3 4 m soil layer exists whose water is difficult to restore wang et al 2015 in order to clarify the water consumption mechanism of jujube plantations several previous studies have been conducted to measure jujube transpiration using thermal diffusion probes for sap flow measurements liu et al 2013 chen et al 2014 chen et al 2015 chen et al 2016 ma et al 2019 however there is no information available on the relationship between nrwis and evaporation or transpiration in rainfed jujube plantations in the hilly loess region the objectives of this study were to 1 determine the duration and amount of nrwis during the jujube growing season 2 demonstrate characteristics of nrwis related to jujube canopy and soil surface characteristics and 3 investigate ecological effects and contributions of nrwis to jujube transpiration evaporation and evapotranspiration it was expected that the results of this study would provide a factual basis for correctly evaluating ecological effects of nrwis on jujube plantations in the hilly loess region of china and help to quantify the contribution of nrwis to the water balance of jujube plantations 2 materials and methods 2 1 experiment location a field experiment was conducted at the demonstration base of jujube of the mizhi experimental station in shaanxi province china 38 11 n 109 28 e the area has a semiarid temperate climate typical of the hilly and gully region of the loess plateau fig 1 and has an annual average temperature of 8 4 c an annual average sunshine duration of 2761 hr and an annual total radiation of 580 5 kj cm 2 the mean annual precipitation from 2000 to 2018 was 440 mm of which 61 9 occurred during july august and september with a maximum annual precipitation of 594 mm and a minimum annual precipitation at 298 mm fig 2 the 0 500 cm soil profile was loess soil with a uniform texture 7 7 silt 47 8 sand and 44 5 clay with a soil bulk density of 1 29 1 31 g cm 3 in the 0 200 cm soil layer the available nitrogen phosphorus and potassium were 30 12 1 56 and 89 33 mg kg 1 respectively the field water holding capacity was 22 06 cm3 cm 3 and the wilting point was 6 66 cm3 cm 3 the water table was below 50 m the experimental plot had an area of 2 7 ha dwarfing jujube trees were planted on 25 east facing rainfed terrace lands in 2003 with trees planted in rows spaced 3 m apart trees were spaced 2 m apart within rows the non irrigated dwarfing jujube trees were 15 years old and the mean trunk diameter was 8 cm at about 20 cm above the ground surface to facilitate the management the non irrigated jujube trees were pruned every 21 days during the growing season to keep tree height at 2 2 0 12 m and canopy size at 2 2 2 2 m with three main branches bifurcate on the trunk at about 80 cm above the ground surface annularity ditch fertilizing was performed each year for each cultivated jujube tree the ring ditch around each tree had a depth of 40 50 cm and a width of 30 40 cm at a distance of 90 cm from the tree trunk every year 432 kg n ha 1 100 kg p2o5 ha 1 and 216 kg k2o ha 1 fertilizer were placed into the annularity ditch and the annularity ditch was filled with soil over time weed and pest control measures were also taken during the jujube growing season the experiment was conducted during two jujube growing seasons 1 may 2017 to 7 october 2017 and 4 may 2018 to 15 october 2018 the starting and ending dates for each jujube growth stage are shown in table 1 2 2 measurement of nrwi components in the loess plateau nrwi components are fog water vapor adsorption and dew deposition zhang et al 2015 depending on different dew deposition objects dew forming on the plant canopy is called canopy dew cd and dew condensed on the soil surface is defined as soil condensate there are no standardized methods for measuring nrwi components wang et al 2017a the detailed measurements and definitions used in this study are provided in sections 2 2 1 2 2 4 2 2 1 fog fog occurs only if atmospheric water vapor concentration reaches the saturation point and consists of small water droplets floating in the atmosphere these droplets can fall by sedimentation and be intercepted by object surfaces agam and berliner 2006 during the current experimental period the relative humidity was always less than 100 fig 3 a and there were no occurrences of fog 2 2 2 canopy dew three dielectric leaf wetness sensors lws decagon devices inc usa were installed at the canopy tops of three selected jujube trees to monitor the canopy dew intensity ii and duration signals from the sensors were automatically recorded every 30 min by a single em50 data logger decagon devices inc usa connected to the sensors the voltages recorded by the em50 were converted to ii by calibration according to jia et al 2019 the calibration process was as follows the lws was placed horizontally and its signal output port was plugged into an em50 data logger a small sprinkler about 0 0418 mm per spray was used to spray a certain amount of water on the surface of the lws sensor and the electrical signal was recorded by the em50 as the amount of sprayed water increased the voltage increased accordingly the dew intensity on the lws sensor was determined as a function of the voltage recorded from the lws sensor the relationship was a strong power function and well described r2 0 995 by the function 1 i i 4 10 14 x i 4 4188 where i i is the dew intensity at time i mm h 1 x i is the voltage mv recorded by the em50 daily dew can be classified into several categories tomaszkiewicz et al 2015 in this study the maximum cd intensity was defined as the highest measured intraday dew intensity zangvil 1996 and the daily cd was calculated by the method of kabela et al 2009 and xu et al 2012 as 2 c d d i i max 2 l a i i where c d d is the daily canopy dew amount mm d 1 i i max which is different from xu et al 2012 is the maximum dew intensity measured using lws at the time i 2 is the coefficient related to the upper and lower leaf surfaces and la i i is the leaf area index in general dew and rainfall do not occur at the same time however when it rains lws also records rainwater as dew rainfall data recorded by nearby meteorological stations were compared with lws measurements to exclude periods of rainfall from dew measurements the winscanopy canopy analysis equipment regent instruments inc canada was employed to obtain hemi spherical photographs of jujube canopies every 10 days during the budding to stable fruit ripening stages in 2017 and 2018 the photographs of jujube canopies were concurrently measured five times in each of the four cardinal directions jujube lai values were obtained by using winscanopy 2005a software to analyze the photos the lai values were defined well by an exponential growth function to describe the seasonal lai dynamics with coefficients of determination r2 0 95 fig 4 leaf area of a single tree la was calculated by multiplying lai by the crown projection area and the growth functions were used to fit the la dynamics during the budding to stable fruit ripening stages in 2017 and 2018 daily jujube leaf areas were interpolated using the fitting equations between la and day of the year doy given as 3 la 4 76 1 e x p 0 052 d o y 158 74 r 2 0 97 for 2017 and 4 la 4 08 1 e x p 0 060 d o y 154 73 r 2 0 95 for 2018 2 2 3 soil condensate soil condensate mainly occurs in 0 5 cm soil layer in arid and semi arid regions of china guo and liu 2005 when the soil temperature in the 0 5 cm soil layer is lower than the dew point temperature the water content in the 0 5 cm soil layer is the soil condensate at the time i s c i eq 5 and the daily soil condensate s c d eq 6 is the sum of soil condensates at different times within an individual day hao et al 2012 5 s c i 10 h θ i θ i 1 6 s c d i 0 n s c i where s c i is soil condensate mm at time i s c d is daily soil condensate mm d 1 h is soil depth cm θ i and θ i 1 are volumetric soil water contents cm3 cm 3 at times i and i 1 respectively and n is the number of soil condensates that occurred within one individual day the days when soil condensate appeared accounted for only 3 5 and 6 6 of all of the monitored days in 2017 and 2018 respectively fig 3b however soil water content remained at a certain value not changing with time during the period of time when soil condensate occurred perhaps the lateral redistribution of condensate water would cause the buried gs3 probe decagon devices inc usa at the 5 cm soil depth to not record a change in soil water content and to remain at a certain value over a long time period therefore the amount of soil condensate was negligible and could reasonably be ignored 2 2 4 water vapor adsorption soil can adsorb water vapor directly from the atmosphere when soil surface temperature is higher than the dew point temperature and the relative humidity of air in the soil pores is lower than the relative humidity of the atmosphere agam and berliner 2006 in addition water vapor in deep soil can be transported through soil pores and adsorbed to soil surfaces the 0 5 cm soil layer is the main site for liquid water flux and for water vapor flux to transform zeng et al 2009 and the temperature gradient in this layer is the main driving force for water vapor transport in the soil when soil temperature at about 15 cm is higher than temperature at a shallower soil 1 cm deep water vapor moves from the deeper soil to shallower soil in response to the temperature gradient and water vapor molecules accumulate in the surface soil layer and then are adsorbed onto the surface of soil particles when the deep soil 15 cm temperature is lower than the shallow soil 1 cm temperature water vapor moves in the opposite direction hirotaka saito et al 2006 zeng et al 2009 in this study the following rules were followed to define water vapor adsorption wvas 1 the soil temperature at the 5 cm soil depth was higher than the atmospheric dew point temperature and the relative humidity in the 0 5 cm soil layer pores was lower than the atmospheric relative humidity at time i 2 the soil temperature at 5 cm was lower than at 15 cm at time i when both 1 and 2 were true the increase in soil water content in the 0 5 cm soil layer was the water vapor adsorption at time i wva s i eq 7 and the daily water vapor adsorption wva s d eq 8 was the sum of water vapor adsorption at all times within one individual day 7 wva s i 10 h θ i θ i 1 8 wva s d i 0 n wva s i where wva s i is the water vapor adsorption rate at time i mm h 1 wva s d is the daily water vapor adsorption mm d 1 h is the soil depth cm θ i and θ i 1 are the soil water contents cm3 cm 3 at times i and i 1 respectively and n is the number of water vapor adsorption times within one individual day in order to calculate soil condensate or wvas the volumetric water contents and temperatures at the 5 15 and 100 cm soil depths under the three jujube canopies used for dew monitoring were measured using gs3 sensors decagon devices inc usa placed 30 cm away from the jujube trunks there were nine gs3 sensors connected to em50 data loggers decagon devices inc usa which automatically recorded soil water content and soil temperature every 30 min at the same time that lws was recorded the soil water and temperature measurements are shown in fig 3b and c because soil moisture is closely related to stomatal opening and closing volumetric soil water affects sap flow oren and pataki 2001 relative extractable water θ e reflects plant available soil water and thus it is calculated as the ratio of actual extractable water to maximum extractable water granier et al 2000 in accordance with the threshold value of θ e 0 4 determined by chen et al 2014 for a jujube plantation in the hilly loess region soil water status was categorized when θ e 0 4 jujube trees were under water stress and when θ e 0 4 jujube trees were under no water stress roots are the primary organs that plants use to obtain water ma et al 2012 indicated that the dry weight of fine roots the major plant water absorption tissues in the 0 100 cm layer accounted for 83 of the total root mass in a densely planted jujube plantation in the semiarid hilly loess region of china hence the average soil water content in the 0 100 cm soil layer was used to calculate θ e soil relative humidity one of the indicators to determine if wvas occurs was calculated by the formula proposed by hao et al 2012 2 3 transpiration and evaporation 2 3 1 transpiration only single thermal dissipation probes tdp dynamax co usa with two needle probes were used to monitor sap flow of three selected jujube trees the upper probe was heated continually by the joule effect while the lower probe reference probe was kept unheated and remained at trunk temperature tdp probe placement can result in significant variations in sap flow the upper and lower probes length 20 mm diameter 2 mm were uniformly inserted horizontally into the upper and lower drilled holes in sapwood on the northern sides of tree trunks at 20 cm above the ground to minimize sap flow variation the tdp units were carefully wrapped with highly reflective foil to avoid interference from the external environment chen et al 2015 chen et al 2016 a cr1000 data logger campbell scientific usa was used to record the sap flow of the jujube trees every 30 min during the jujube growing season in 2017 and 2018 the standard non calibrated sap flux density was calculated by eq 9 granier 1987 9 j s 119 δ t max δ t δ t 1 231 where js is sap flux density g m 2 s 1 δ t is the temperature difference between heated and unheated probes and δ t max is temperature difference between probes at zero sap flow δtmax was determined separately for each tdp and was estimated over a 13 day period the values of δtmax were determined following the method described by lu et al 2004 during jujube growing season 1 with 13 days as the time step the linear relationship between the maximum value of local δt δtmax and the corresponding day of year doy was established 2 data points below the regression line were eliminated 3 new linear relationship between δtmax and doy was established with the remaining data points and 4 new regression relationship between δtmax and doy was used to calculate actual δtmax assuming that js is uniform across the sapwood profile then sap flow and average transpiration rate per unit ground area were calculated using the following equations 10 sf k j s a s 11 t g k j s a s a g where sf is sap flow kg d 1 k is a unit conversion coefficient equal to 0 00864 ag is the ground area that one individual jujube tree occupies equal to 2 3 6 m2 tg is the average transpiration rate per unit ground area mm d 1 and as is the area of sapwood cm2 as was calculated from the relationship between sapwood area and tree diameter determined by randomly cutting down 11 jujube trees at 20 cm above the ground as was calculated as 12 a s 10 97 t d 43 826 where td cm is the jujube trunk diameter at 20 cm above the ground a significant linear relationship was found between as and td r2 0 95 the leaf area affects sap flow liu et al 2012 consequently changes in leaf area and soil water make the relationship between sap flow and meteorological factors difficult to understand using relative sap flow sfr i e sap flow divided by leaf area which is normalized sap flow can reveal water consumption patterns and the transpiration self regulation capacity of jujube trees in arid and semi arid environments chen et al 2014 and can also quantify the transpiration rate per unit leaf area du et al 2011 to investigate the influence of cd on jujube transpiration the values of sfr of jujube with and without i i present during the jujube growing season were observed 2 3 2 evaporation built on the penman montieth model the shuttleworth wallace model sw model can divide evapotranspiration et into canopy transpiration t and soil evaporation e shuttleworth and wallace 1985 using a bayesian calibration and uncertainty analysis chen et al 2015 calibrated tested and validated the sw model against observed t and e data of jujube plantations in this study area t was measured by the sap flow method section 2 3 1 and e was measured by the micro lysimeter method section 2 2 5 of chen et al 2015 the results obtained in that study showed that the sw model could accurately simulate the hourly et of a jujube plantation therefore the calibrated sw model can be employed to calculate jujube plantation et during the jujube growing season the jujube plantation evaporation is the difference between estimated et and measured t the calibration and validation of the sw model has been well documented in the past see chen et al 2015 to verify whether the calibrated sw model could be applied in the 21 00 9 00 time period we used data from 21 00 9 00 in 2012 and 2014 during the jujube growing season chen 2018 to validate the calibrated sw model results of correlation analysis of the measured et and et estimated by the calibrated sw model for validation periods 2012 and 2014 are shown in fig 5 at hourly time scale the values of the coefficient of determination r2 mean relative error mre and willmott s index of agreement d were 0 84 18 81 and 0 97 respectively the sw model met the reliability criteria r2 and d 0 8 mre 20 for the 2012 and 2014 growing seasons thus the calibrated sw model could be employed for the 21 00 9 00 time period in 2017 and 2018 2 4 meteorological factors the relative humidity rh air temperature tair solar radiation rs w m 2 precipitation p mm and wind speed u m s 1 were monitored with an automated weather station rr 9100 yugen technology co ltd china in the experimental field data were collected every 30 min during the jujube growing season table 1 dew point temperature is an indicator to determine if condensation will occur on objects it can be calculated by the following equation lawrence 2005 13 t d b ln rh 100 a t air b t air a ln rh 100 a t air b t air where td is dew point temperature a and b are the constants of 17 625 and 243 04 respectively tair is average atmospheric temperature and rh is the average relative humidity of the atmosphere 2 5 statistical analyses all of the statistical analyses were performed using spss16 spss chicago usa significant differences in i i c d d cd duration wva s i wva s d and wvas duration were tested among different jujube growth stages by multiple comparison the results thus obtained were tested at p 0 05 by lsd post hoc test the independent sample test was employed to test for significant differences among cd and wvas durations during the same growth stage 3 results 3 1 duration of canopy dew and water vapor adsorption fig 6 illustrates the number of days when cd and wvas occurred and the duration of cd and wvas during the 2017 and 2018 jujube growing seasons panels a and b in fig 6 show that the total number of cd days were fewer than the total number of wvas days the total number of cd days was 97 days in 2017 and 118 days in 2018 accounting for 61 0 and 72 0 of the total days of the jujube growing season respectively the total number of wvas days was 107 days in 2017 and 125 days in 2018 accounting for 68 6 and 77 6 of the total days of the jujube growing season respectively the maximum number of cd and wvas days were observed during stage 3 and were 46 and 53 days respectively in 2017 and 52 and 51 days in 2018 accounting for 69 7 and 75 4 2017 and 80 3 and 73 9 2018 of the total days during stage 3 respectively the numbers of wvas days during stage 1 in 2017 and 2018 were 18 and 23 days and were more than the number of cd days at the same stage panels a and b in fig 6 show that the cd duration differences between stages 1 and 2 in 2017 1 10 h and in 2018 0 74 h were not significant in both 2017 and 2018 the average cd duration peaked during stage 4 10 44 h in 2017 and 11 71 h in 2018 and was significantly higher than the durations observed during the other three growth stages p 0 05 the wvas duration during stage 2 was significantly lower than wvas duration at the other three growth stages p 0 05 with average values of 0 95 h in 2017 and 0 80 h in 2018 the wvas durations at the other three growth stages ranged from 1 75 to 2 57 h the cd durations were significantly higher than the wvas durations at every growth stage p 0 05 and the differences between cd and wvas durations at stages 1 2 3 and 4 were 2 09 4 35 4 99 and 8 08 h in 2017 and 3 45 3 67 7 75 and 9 14 h in 2018 respectively 3 2 canopy dew and water vapor adsorption 3 2 1 diurnal changes in dew intensities and water vapor adsorption rates diurnal changes in i i on the jujube canopy involved accumulation and evaporation stages fig 7 increasing with time during the accumulation stage and decreasing with time during the evaporation stage until the accumulated dew completely evaporated some periods can be seen with interrupted accumulation or evaporation of i i for example accumulated dew evaporated at 1 30 3 30 in the nighttime during stage 2 in 2017 fig 7b causing interrupted accumulation and fluctuating i i i i started to accumulate after 20 30 during stage 1 but this was 1 0 2 0 h 2 0 2 5 h and 2 5 3 0 h later than during stages 2 3 and 4 respectively i i peaked at about 5 00 6 30 during all four growth stages reaching 0 0139 0 0678 0 0897 and 0 0707 mm h 1 in 2017 and 0 0514 0 0383 0 0943 and 0 0943 mm h 1 in 2018 at stages 1 4 respectively i i did not differ significantly between stages 3 and 4 in 2017 or in 2018 but it was significantly higher during stages 3 and 4 than during stages 1 and 2 p 0 05 considering the frequencies of ii occurrences shown in fig 8 the accumulation stage of i i mainly occurred during 3 00 6 00 at stage 1 1 00 6 00 at stage 2 22 30 6 00 at stage 3 and 19 00 7 00 at stage 4 the frequencies of i i occurrences at these times were as high as 64 0 55 6 88 6 and 85 0 respectively for the four growth stages fig 8 during these particular periods partial pressure of water vapor above the canopy was greater than within the canopy making water vapor move toward the canopy causing leaf surface water vapor to saturate and dew to form at the same time water vapor also opened leaf stomata and promoted increased leaf absorption of dew and carbon dioxide exchange ben asher et al 2010 however the evaporation stage of i i lasted for a relatively short time during the four growth stages and mainly occurred between 6 00 and 9 00 at these stages fig 7 the frequency of ii occurrences after 9 00 was always less than 20 fig 8 the rates and frequencies of occurrence of wvas at the four growth stages were lower at 21 00 6 00 than at 6 30 9 00 figs 7 8 in 2017 and 2018 the rates of wvas changed slowly from 21 00 to 6 00 and the ranges of wvas rate at 21 00 6 00 during the four growth stages in 2017 and 2018 were 0 0012 0 0024 mm h 1 0 0007 0 0048 mm h 1 0 0026 0 0151 mm h 1 and 0 0015 0 0093 mm h 1 respectively only about 10 of the value of i i the ranges of wvas frequency at 21 00 6 00 at the four growth stages were 3 45 8 00 2 78 16 67 7 81 40 91 and 5 00 32 00 respectively however the rates and frequencies of wvas increased at 6 30 9 00 during the four growth stages and wvas mainly occurred from 6 30 9 00 with the ranges at 6 30 9 00 for the four growth stages being 0 0036 0 0437 mm h 1 0 0033 0 0257 mm h 1 0 0025 0 0133 mm h 1 and 0 0033 0 0373 mm h 1 respectively in 2017 and 2018 and their frequency ranges at 6 30 9 00 for the four growth stages being 12 00 76 00 11 11 62 96 10 94 39 09 and 10 00 80 00 respectively these results agreed with previous research results reported by zhang et al 2015 and liu et al 2018 however the rates of wvas were lower than those reported by verhoef et al 2006 i e 0 02 0 10 mm h 1 and the peak value of wvas rate was higher than the value of 0 02 mm h 1 reported by zhang et al 2015 there was no significant difference between the rates of wvas at the four growth stages in 2017 and 2018 3 2 2 daily canopy dew and water vapor adsorption amount the average c d d values were 0 632 and 0 519 mm d 1 averaged over the entire growing season in 2017 and 2018 respectively in 2017 and 2018 the average c d d during stage 1 was 0 082 and 0 198 mm d 1 significantly lower than cdd at the other three growth stages p 0 05 the average c d d reached a maximum of 0 884 mm d 1 during stage 3 in 2017 fig 9 a and a maximum of 0 755 mm d 1 during stage 4 in 2018 fig 9b the average wva s d were 0 137 and 0 113 mm d 1 over the entire growing season in 2017 and 2018 respectively but these values were significantly lower than the c d d values observed in 2017 and 2018 p 0 05 in 2017 and 2018 wva s d peaked during stage 1 averaging 0 190 and 0 174 mm d 1 respectively the average wva s d during stage 2 was 0 073 mm d 1 in 2017 and 0 058 mm d 1 in 2018 significantly lower than wvasd at the other three growth stages p 0 05 kidron 2000 demonstrated that 0 03 mm of c d d or wva s d was the threshold water availability for microorganisms the current study found that the c d d and wva s d totaling 0 03 mm d 1 occurred on 102 and 95 days respectively in 2017 and on 107 and 117 days respectively in 2018 accounting for 95 33 and 98 95 in 2017 and 84 25 and 98 32 in 2018 of all of the observed days moreover the frequency of heavy dew 0 2 mm as defined by kabela et al 2009 was observed on 69 38 of days in 2017 and 76 92 of days in 2018 3 3 ecological effects of canopy dew and water vapor adsorption 3 3 1 response of transpiration to canopy dew to understand the effects of cd on jujube transpiration under soil water stress the sfr with and without i i at the half hourly intervals during stages 1 2 and 3 under soil water stress conditions are shown in fig 10 the values of sfr with i i at 18 00 6 00 during stages 1 2 and 3 were lower than values of sfr without i i fig 10 during stage 1 in 2018 and stage 3 in 2017 the sfr with i i was lower than the sfr without i i for individual days fig 10 dew mainly occurred at night 18 00 6 00 fig 7 thus the effect of dew on nighttime sap flow was further explored a common widespread and significant process from all biomes and seasons forster 2014 the cumulative nighttime sap flow during the 18 00 6 00 time period are summarized in table 2 table 2 also shows that nighttime sap flow with i i dropped by 5 207 103 377 kg d 1 m 2 compared with nighttime sap flow without i i accounting for 44 36 92 64 of nighttime sap flow without i i 3 3 2 response of evaporation to water vapor adsorption fig 11 shows the daily time course of e with and without wvas in the jujube plantation during the 2017 and 2018 jujube growing seasons e with and without wvas was different in the different years and at different growth stages fig 11 the cumulative e with wvas at 21 00 6 00 at stages 1 and 2 in 2017 was 0 026 and 0 025 mm h 1 higher than cumulative e without wvas but the cumulative e with the wvas at 21 00 6 00 at stages 1 and 2 in 2018 was 0 103 and 0 004 mm h 1 lower than cumulative e without wvas higher wvas rates mainly occurred at 6 30 9 00 during all four growth stages figs 6 7 cumulative e values with wvas at 6 30 9 00 during the four growth stages in 2017 were 0 002 0 022 0 169 and 0 007 mm h 1 higher than cumulative e without wvas in contrast cumulative e values with wvas at 6 30 9 00 during the four growth stages in 2018 were 0 043 0 024 0 051 and 0 008 mm h 1 lower than cumulative e without wvas the number of days when wvas was observed comprised 68 6 and 77 6 of the entire growing season in 2017 and 2018 respectively but wvas duration was only 0 80 2 57 h fig 6 consequently wvas did not affect e and the main factors affecting e were soil moisture soil temperature atmospheric evaporative demand and leaf area index merlin et al 2018 zhao et al 2018 4 discussion 4 1 canopy dew and water vapor adsorption measurement method at present there are no standardized methods for measuring nrwi components of the hydrologic cycle wang et al 2017a the dielectric leaf wetness sensors lws were used to measure cd in dryland jujube plantations in the study area lws is specially designed to approximate thermodynamic properties of leaf and can accurately monitor dew ghobakhlou et al 2015 which is widely used today alvarado barrientos et al 2015 gerlein safdi et al 2018a jia et al 2019 wang et al 2017b dwarf jujube trees are planted widely in china s loess plateau region the jujube trees at our experimental site were pruned every 21 days during the growing season to keep the tree at the same height and canopy size as the widely planted dwarf jujube trees over the long term management the structure of the jujube trees have formed similar features dynamic trend and size of leaf area index in 2017 and 2018 fig 4 therefore the measured cd was assumed to be representative and accurate there are different definitions of daily dew amount but zangvil 1996 defined daily dew amount as the maximum amount of dew intensity for a day s dew event kabela et al 2009 and xu et al 2012 defined daily dew amount as the product of lai and daily dew intensity which is the difference of dew intensity before sunrise and after sunset xu et al 2012 in this paper daily cd is defined as the product of lai and daily dew intensity but daily dew intensity is the maximum dew intensity measured using lws in a day s dew event section 2 2 1 the daily cd calculated by xu et al 2012 was sometimes smaller than daily cd calculated in this study this is because different methods were used to calculate daily dew intensity for example sunrise and sunset in 2017 during stage 3 were 6 00 and 18 00 respectively daily dew intensities calculated using the method adopted by xu et al 2012 and the one used in this study were 0 081 and 0 090 mm h 1 respectively fig 7c the canopy dew formation involved accumulation and evaporation stages fig 7 the daily dew intensity used in this study was just the maximum value of dew intensity in the dew accumulation stage which was the total cumulative dew intensity it can accurately calculate daily cd in this study gs3 sensors were used to determine water vapor adsorption by measuring soil moisture variation and soil temperature at 5 cm soil depth sections 2 2 3 and 2 2 4 the basis of the method used was the same as that used by many other researchers hao et al 2012 uclés et al 2013 2016 the water vapor for wvas comes not only directly from the atmosphere but also from upward movement of water vapor deeper from the soil profile the effect of soil water in adjacent soil layers on wvas was considered too in section 2 2 4 temperature gradient drives liquid and vapor fluxes of soil water to migrate from the deep to surface soil layer however vapor flux was dominant during 18 00 9 00 when wvas occurs and water vapor flux is about 100 times that of liquid water flux zeng et al 2008 therefore liquid water flux is negligible and its movement affects wvas the effect of hydraulic redistribution in 0 5 cm soil layer on wvas was not considered perhaps there was heterogeneity of soil moisture in the surface soil layer causing lateral redistribution of wvas in the 0 5 cm soil layer in order to further study wvas in dryland jujube plantations the method adopted uclés et al 2013 was used in consideration of the effect of soil hydraulic redistribution on wvas even in areas with shallow groundwater there was the need to consider the effect of capillary upwelling water on wvas 4 2 nocturnal soil water relationships with canopy dew nocturnal soil water storage changes in the jujube tree root zone 5 100 cm soil layer on dew days were 0 144 3 483 mm higher than nocturnal soil water changes on non dew days at three growth stages table 2 this result suggests that the hydraulic redistribution of roots are an important ecological process that acts as an inherent survival mechanism for plants in arid habitats zeppel et al 2014 that could cause nighttime soil water storage changes water condensation resulting from turbulent dew deposition on leaves can increase the local humidity thereby decreasing the vpd directly at leaf surfaces creating a temporary humid condition at leaf air boundaries and improving plant water status the vaporization of dew water from leaf surfaces consumes heat evaporative cooling and reduces leaf temperature thereby reducing energy available for transpiration ben asher et al 2010 zhuang and ratcliffe 2012 konrad et al 2015 gerlein safdi et al 2018a gerlein safdi et al 2018b dew on leaf surfaces can provide an additional source of water that can be absorbed through specific surface structures or possibly through stomata berry et al 2018 in one chamber study with long exposure of plants to dew leaf absorbed dew accounted for close to 90 of the leaf water kim and lee 2011 leaf absorbed water will cause the leaf water potential to be higher than the root water potential in dry soil forming a downward ecological process of hydraulic redistribution leaf absorbed water can be transported through the xylem to soil close to roots and the roots may release small amounts of water the released water affects only soil in the rhizosphere and could be subsequently reabsorbed by the roots when the leaves resume transpiration eller et al 2013 cassana et al 2016 lateral redistribution of soil water may occur in response to horizontal water potential gradients leaf dew decreased nighttime sap flow table 2 weakened inhibiting effects of nighttime sap flow on hydraulic redistribution of roots and promoted water transport from wet soil to dry soil through plant roots thereby improving soil water availability and root activity and affecting plant water physiology si et al 2014 hydraulic redistribution has been generally recognized as an important ecological process so did greater downward and lateral hydraulic redistribution or rhizosphere water regulation on dew days compared with dew free days result in nighttime beneficial soil water storage changes in the root zone in the future it will be necessary to search for evidence of this supposition by using the techniques of root sap flow soil water or water potential observations and isotopic analyses 4 3 importance and contributions of canopy dew and water vapor adsorption to the water budget in a jujube plantation the p cd wvas t e and et as well as the contributions of cd wvas and cd wvas to t e and et e t were assessed at each growth stage in a jujube plantation table 3 wvas comprised a larger proportion of nrwis cd wvas at stage 1 than at the other three growth stages with proportions of 0 740 in 2017 and 0 507 in 2018 the ratios of cd to cd wvas at stages 2 3 and 4 were 0 870 0 849 0 774 in 2017 and 0 823 0 864 and 0 833 in 2018 respectively cd accounted for 80 60 and 81 21 of the cd wvas during the entire growing season in 2017 and 2018 respectively and was the most important component of nrwis this finding was consistent with the research results of wang et al 2017b and gao et al 2015 the cds were 60 63 and 61 21 mm which were equivalent to 15 18 and 17 06 of the rainfall during the entire growing season in 2017 and 2018 respectively the cd p ratios in the semi arid jujube plantation were lower than what has been reported in other regions for example measured cd p was 19 in semi arid coastal southwestern madagascar hanisch et al 2015 and 50 in a desert riparian forest ecosystem on the eastern boundary of the taklimakan desert in china hao et al 2012 wvas values were 14 60 and 14 15 mm equivalent to only 3 65 and 3 94 of the rainfall during the entire growing season in 2017 and 2018 respectively during the entire jujube growing season in 2017 and 2018 the numbers of rain days were 34 and 35 d respectively and the frequencies of rain days rain days observed days were 21 38 and 21 34 respectively less than those of cd and wvas although the total amounts of cd and wvas were less than the rainfall amount they occurred frequently this indicated that the non rainfall periods were more prolonged than the rain periods at this jujube plantation the coefficients of variation standard deviation mean for cd wvas and p were 94 05 and 59 20 87 96 and 51 63 and 266 20 and 321 03 during the 2017 and 2018 jujube growing seasons respectively moreover at each growth stage in 2017 and 2018 the ratios of the coefficients of variation for cd and p were 0 17 0 49 and 0 11 0 28 and the ratios of the coefficients of variation for wvas and p were 0 23 0 35 and 0 17 0 34 respectively these results showed that the coefficients of variation for nrwis in the jujube plantation studied in this experiment were smaller than those of rainfall considered over the entire growing season or at each growth stage which indicated that the characteristics of nrwis were quantitatively stable table 3 shows that at each jujube growth stage in 2017 and 2018 1 the contributions of cd to t mainly occurred at stages 3 and 4 with maximum values of 0 314 stage 3 in 2017 and 0 539 stage 4 in 2018 2 the contribution of wvas to e mainly occurred at stage 4 with a maximum value of 0 261 in 2018 and 3 contributions of nrwis to et cd wvas et mainly occurred at stages 3 and 4 with maximum values of 0 233 stage 3 in 2017 and 0 449 stage 4 in 2018 large amounts of water are needed to promote the growth of branch leaves and flower bud of jujube at stages 1 and 2 hu et al 2016 during these stages the contribution of nrwi was 0 052 0 107 and rainfall during these stages accounted for only 6 56 16 92 of the total rainfall during the growing season table 3 the relative extractable water in the root zone was seriously deficient for jujube growth θ e was 0 045 0 282 fig 3c soil water deficit will affect soil water movement hinder precipitation infiltration and recharge weaken the function of the soil reservoir reduce soil quality and soil productivity and further affect the ecosystem service functions of vegetation such as soil and water conservation and hydrological regulation chen et al 2007 wang et al 2012 in the past when the regional water amounts have been calculated using the water balance method nrwis were often neglected as water resource input items however nrwis are important components of the water balance when considered over half year or yearly scales lekouch et al 2011 the magnitudes of the water balance components in the jujube plantation from stage 1 to stage 4 are shown in table 3 water consumption et values for the jujube growing season half year were 456 813 mm and 410 110 mm more than the rainfall in 2017 and 2018 respectively over that period which meant that the rainfall amounts could not meet water consumption for the jujube plantation if the nrwis in the jujube plantation were considered as water resource input items then the differences between water resources inputs p cd wvas and water resources output et were 17 905 mm in 2017 and 23 999 mm in 2018 which were close to soil water storage changes in the root zone table 3 that is to say the jujube plantation was approximately water balanced the cd t ratio was 0 218 in 2017 and 0 258 in 2018 the wvas e ratios were very small with values of 0 082 in both 2017 and 2018 the cd wvas et ratio was 0 165 in 2017 and 0 184 in 2018 the cd wvas et ratio calculated in the present study was higher than what was recorded for a rice field in the subtropical monsoon climate of china liu et al 2018 and higher than what was reported for semi arid desert valley ecosystems in the great basin of the western usa malek et al 1999 in summary nrwis are an important supplementary water source for dryland jujube plantations in the hilly loess region of china and are a major water balance component that cannot be ignored in the regional hydrological cycle 4 4 change of water input and output items in a jujube plantation transpiration is the main pathway for water consumption by plants and remains an intense area of plant physiology and ecology research wullschleger et al 1998 almost all plants can open their stomata at night and continue to lose water through transpiration zeppel et al 2014 in arid and semi arid regions plants can absorb water by diffusion through leaf surfaces via leaf trichomes or hydathodes or they can take up water from soil through roots to maintain growth and transpiration limm and dawson 2010 however fig 3c shows that the relative extractable water available for jujube root systems was often insufficient θ e 0 4 that changes in soil water storage in the 5 100 cm root zone during the jujube growing season were only 11 49 mm in 2017 and 17 25 mm in 2018 table 3 and days when soil water deficits occurred accounted for 90 97 2017 and 86 62 2018 of the jujube growing season therefore jujube root systems can only obtain limited amounts of water from the root zone pruning is an agronomic practice to reduce plant transpiration in this study secondary branches were pruned to reduce the canopy sizes of the jujube trees and to control jujube transpiration but the effects of pruning are short lived hipps and atkinson 2014 previous research has shown that heavy pruning can reduce transpiration increase soil water storage and improve water use efficiency hipps and atkinson 2014 nie et al 2017 chen et al 2016 found that heavy pruning with main branches removed in rainfed jujube plantations in the loess plateau can alleviate soil water deficit in the 0 300 cm soil layer significantly reduce transpiration per unit ground area increase the sensitivity of canopy stomatal conductance to vpd avoid the risk of runaway cavitation under soil drought conditions and maintain a reasonably fresh fruit yield however they also reported that heavy pruning can cause light to pass through the upper canopy resulting in increased soil evaporation during the jujube growing season mulching practices have also been used to effectively limit soil evaporation in jujube plantations wang et al 2018 however different mulching treatments have different effects on suppressing evaporation and increasing soil water storage tomaszkiewicz et al 2017 changes in canopy structure caused by heavy pruning can lead to micrometeorological changes in the canopy that affect physiological activities such as photosynthesis and transpiration beis and patakas 2015 can the combined effects of heavy pruning and mulching reduce t and e increase cd and wvas and then increase the cd t wvas e and cd wvas et ratios especially at stages 1 and 2 further experimental research will be needed to answer this question 5 conclusions in a dryland jujube plantation of the hilly loess region of china nrwis were composed of cd and wvas in the 0 5 cm soil layer during the entire jujube growing season cd accounted for about 81 of the nrwis and the number of days when cd occurred were fewer than the number of days when wvas occurred cd durations at the stage 1 to stage 4 were significantly longer than wvas durations p 0 05 the onset time of cd varied with jujube growth stages and ii peaked at about 5 00 6 30 at the four growth stages there were no significant differences in i i between stages 3 and 4 but there were significantly higher i i at stages 3 and 4 than at stages 1 and 2 p 0 05 and the rates of wvas which were about 0 1 times the i i s and mainly occurred at 6 30 9 00 did not differ between the four growth stages the ratio of cd to transpiration was as high as 0 258 during the entire growing season and cd reduced nocturnal sap flow decreasing water consumption in water deficit soil 5 100 cm layer and increasing changes in soil water storage however wvas did not affect soil evaporation nrwis occurred frequently during the entire jujube growing season and were quantitatively more stable than rainfall their contribution to the water resource output term evapotranspiration reached a maximum value of 0 184 in 2018 therefore the contribution of nrwis to the jujube water balance in the hilly loess region cannot be disregarded and nrwis probably had positive ecological

5718,non rainfall water inputs nrwis provide crucial water resources for dryland ecosystems in arid and semi arid regions however little is known about the quantitative characteristics and formation of nrwis and the relative importance of nrwis as water sources in a dryland jujube ziziphus jujuba mill plantation in the hilly loess region of china the objectives of this study were to determine the characteristics of nrwis during the jujube growing season with regard to amount duration and contributions to transpiration evaporation and evapotranspiration dew intensity and duration were monitored using dielectric leaf wetness sensors also sap flow soil water content soil temperature and meteorological variables were measured during the 2017 and 2018 growing seasons nrwis were found to be composed of canopy dew cd and water vapor adsorption wvas in the 0 5 cm soil layer amounting to 75 218 mm in 2017 and 75 309 mm in 2018 cd accounted for about 81 of nrwi daily average cd was significantly greater than wvas p 0 05 and cd duration was 2 09 9 14 h more than wvas duration p 0 05 the cd rate and frequency generally exceeded that of wvas cd occurred from 19 00 to 9 00 wvas mainly occurred from 6 30 to 9 00 cd reduced nocturnal sap flow by 7 36 55 64 but increased soil water storage in the 5 100 cm root zone by 0 274 0 717 mm wvas had no effect on soil water evaporation over the entire growing season the ratio of cd to total transpiration was 0 218 in 2017 and 0 258 in 2018 and the ratio of wvas to soil water evaporation was 0 082 in both years nrwis occurred more frequently and were quantitatively more stable than rainfall events their contributions to evapotranspiration reached a maximum value of 0 184 in 2018 nrwis are important components of the hydrological cycle in this region and probably have potential positive ecological effects on dryland jujube plantations in the hilly loess region of china keywords non rainfall water input canopy dew water vapor adsorption transpiration evaporation 1 introduction non rainfall water inputs nrwis e g fog dew and water vapor adsorption are important but often neglected ecohydrological components of the surface water balance in terrestrial ecosystems kaseke et al 2017 wang et al 2017a gerlein safdi et al 2018a b nrwis are liquid surface water exclusive of rainwater and irrigation water resulting from the deposition and condensation of atmospheric water vapor nrwis can affect the energy balance of the soil plant atmosphere continuum and can produce more unique ecological and climatic effects compared with rainwater in arid zones agam and berliner 2006 over specific time periods the amount of water from nrwis can be greater than rainfall malek et al 1999 sometimes reaching a maximum rate of 5 mm d 1 wallin 1967 occurring on more than 70 of growing season days zhuang and zhao 2017 and amounting to 4 5 64 0 of total rainfall hao et al 2012 hanisch et al 2015 thus nrwis provide important water resources for maintaining ecosystems in arid and semi arid regions and are sometimes the only water sources for biological crusts insects small animals and plants in extremely arid desert areas tomaszkiewicz et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 kaseke et al 2017 in recent years nrwis have attracted interdisciplinary interest in such fields as plant physiology ecology meteorology and agriculture hanisch et al 2015 tomaszkiewicz et al 2017 groh et al 2018 fog or dew deposition on plant canopies provides supplementary water to plant leaves that can be directly absorbed and utilized through plant stomata or specialized plant organs konrad et al 2015 berry et al 2018 with water use ratios that are much higher than those associated with rainfall zhang et al 2010 in cloud forests of brazil nrwis were found to diffuse through the leaf cuticle of drimys brasiliensis miers contributing up to 42 of its total foliar water content eller et al 2013 in the garajonay national park of spain nrwis fog decreased transpiration of erica arborea l and myrica faya ait by 30 fold ritter et al 2009 and reduced solar radiation by 58 and temperature by 3 6 c compared with periods of no fog ritter et al 2008 sso and dawson 2004 found that fog suppressed transpiration and reversed xylem sap flow in sequoia sempervirens dew significantly increased net accumulation of photosynthate and the photosynthetic rate in leaves of bassia dasyphylla in desert regions zhuang and ratcliffe 2012 gerlein safdi et al 2018a developed an energy balance model for individual leaves to simulate effects of dew accumulation and evaporation on leaf transpiration and found a 30 decrease in the transpiration rate of highly hydrophobic leaves of colocasia esculenta compared with control leaves leaves that were left untouched and unmisted with isotopically labeled water δ18o 8 8 δ2h 737 remote sensing observations have shown that dew can affect microwave brightness temperature of and backscatter from vegetation kabela et al 2009 gerlein safdi et al 2018b modeled leaves with a characteristic length of 50 cm and found that dew suppressed transpiration by up to 25 and decreased co2 assimilation by up to 12 in addition dew can improve crop water use efficiency ben asher et al 2010 konrad et al 2015 and can provide a valuable supplementary water source for reforestation efforts during droughts or in arid or semi arid areas tomaszkiewicz et al 2017 the loess plateau of china is a typical arid and semi arid region nrwis are important supplementary water sources for the surface water budget in this region zhang et al 2010 in the loess plateau the variability of land surface water processes affect rapid responses to land surface heating and eco physiological processes li 1983 however only preliminary research studies have been conducted on nrwis in the semi arid loess plateau working on flat farmland without high rise buildings or trees zhang et al 2015 reported that nrwis accounted for 13 of the total land surface water sources some other scholars have only explored soil condensation water or dew in the loess plateau for example li 2002 studied the effects of gravel and sand mulches on soil condensation water wang and zhang 2011 investigated the physical characteristics of condensed atmospheric water in the soil surface layer and wang et al 2017b and jia et al 2019 analyzed characteristics of dew formation in jujube ziziphus jujuba mill plantations and an irrigation area respectively in light of these results we know some of the effects and characteristics of soil condensation water in the surface soil layer and dew formation on plants however the observed soil condensation water included vapor adsorption water thus soil condensation water amounts were overestimated and quantitative estimates and ecological effects of dew are still lacking for the loess plateau of china rainwater is the only soil water source for dryland farming in the hilly loess regions of china xin et al 2011 and has seen a significant decreasing trend in the past 50 years jujube is tolerant of drought and is of significant economic value it has been widely planted in the loess plateau region for the past 2000 years with a planting area of some one million hectares liu et al 2013 chen et al 2015 because rainwater cannot completely meet the water demands of vegetation in this region severe soil water deficits can occur in densely planted jujube plantations where a 3 4 m soil layer exists whose water is difficult to restore wang et al 2015 in order to clarify the water consumption mechanism of jujube plantations several previous studies have been conducted to measure jujube transpiration using thermal diffusion probes for sap flow measurements liu et al 2013 chen et al 2014 chen et al 2015 chen et al 2016 ma et al 2019 however there is no information available on the relationship between nrwis and evaporation or transpiration in rainfed jujube plantations in the hilly loess region the objectives of this study were to 1 determine the duration and amount of nrwis during the jujube growing season 2 demonstrate characteristics of nrwis related to jujube canopy and soil surface characteristics and 3 investigate ecological effects and contributions of nrwis to jujube transpiration evaporation and evapotranspiration it was expected that the results of this study would provide a factual basis for correctly evaluating ecological effects of nrwis on jujube plantations in the hilly loess region of china and help to quantify the contribution of nrwis to the water balance of jujube plantations 2 materials and methods 2 1 experiment location a field experiment was conducted at the demonstration base of jujube of the mizhi experimental station in shaanxi province china 38 11 n 109 28 e the area has a semiarid temperate climate typical of the hilly and gully region of the loess plateau fig 1 and has an annual average temperature of 8 4 c an annual average sunshine duration of 2761 hr and an annual total radiation of 580 5 kj cm 2 the mean annual precipitation from 2000 to 2018 was 440 mm of which 61 9 occurred during july august and september with a maximum annual precipitation of 594 mm and a minimum annual precipitation at 298 mm fig 2 the 0 500 cm soil profile was loess soil with a uniform texture 7 7 silt 47 8 sand and 44 5 clay with a soil bulk density of 1 29 1 31 g cm 3 in the 0 200 cm soil layer the available nitrogen phosphorus and potassium were 30 12 1 56 and 89 33 mg kg 1 respectively the field water holding capacity was 22 06 cm3 cm 3 and the wilting point was 6 66 cm3 cm 3 the water table was below 50 m the experimental plot had an area of 2 7 ha dwarfing jujube trees were planted on 25 east facing rainfed terrace lands in 2003 with trees planted in rows spaced 3 m apart trees were spaced 2 m apart within rows the non irrigated dwarfing jujube trees were 15 years old and the mean trunk diameter was 8 cm at about 20 cm above the ground surface to facilitate the management the non irrigated jujube trees were pruned every 21 days during the growing season to keep tree height at 2 2 0 12 m and canopy size at 2 2 2 2 m with three main branches bifurcate on the trunk at about 80 cm above the ground surface annularity ditch fertilizing was performed each year for each cultivated jujube tree the ring ditch around each tree had a depth of 40 50 cm and a width of 30 40 cm at a distance of 90 cm from the tree trunk every year 432 kg n ha 1 100 kg p2o5 ha 1 and 216 kg k2o ha 1 fertilizer were placed into the annularity ditch and the annularity ditch was filled with soil over time weed and pest control measures were also taken during the jujube growing season the experiment was conducted during two jujube growing seasons 1 may 2017 to 7 october 2017 and 4 may 2018 to 15 october 2018 the starting and ending dates for each jujube growth stage are shown in table 1 2 2 measurement of nrwi components in the loess plateau nrwi components are fog water vapor adsorption and dew deposition zhang et al 2015 depending on different dew deposition objects dew forming on the plant canopy is called canopy dew cd and dew condensed on the soil surface is defined as soil condensate there are no standardized methods for measuring nrwi components wang et al 2017a the detailed measurements and definitions used in this study are provided in sections 2 2 1 2 2 4 2 2 1 fog fog occurs only if atmospheric water vapor concentration reaches the saturation point and consists of small water droplets floating in the atmosphere these droplets can fall by sedimentation and be intercepted by object surfaces agam and berliner 2006 during the current experimental period the relative humidity was always less than 100 fig 3 a and there were no occurrences of fog 2 2 2 canopy dew three dielectric leaf wetness sensors lws decagon devices inc usa were installed at the canopy tops of three selected jujube trees to monitor the canopy dew intensity ii and duration signals from the sensors were automatically recorded every 30 min by a single em50 data logger decagon devices inc usa connected to the sensors the voltages recorded by the em50 were converted to ii by calibration according to jia et al 2019 the calibration process was as follows the lws was placed horizontally and its signal output port was plugged into an em50 data logger a small sprinkler about 0 0418 mm per spray was used to spray a certain amount of water on the surface of the lws sensor and the electrical signal was recorded by the em50 as the amount of sprayed water increased the voltage increased accordingly the dew intensity on the lws sensor was determined as a function of the voltage recorded from the lws sensor the relationship was a strong power function and well described r2 0 995 by the function 1 i i 4 10 14 x i 4 4188 where i i is the dew intensity at time i mm h 1 x i is the voltage mv recorded by the em50 daily dew can be classified into several categories tomaszkiewicz et al 2015 in this study the maximum cd intensity was defined as the highest measured intraday dew intensity zangvil 1996 and the daily cd was calculated by the method of kabela et al 2009 and xu et al 2012 as 2 c d d i i max 2 l a i i where c d d is the daily canopy dew amount mm d 1 i i max which is different from xu et al 2012 is the maximum dew intensity measured using lws at the time i 2 is the coefficient related to the upper and lower leaf surfaces and la i i is the leaf area index in general dew and rainfall do not occur at the same time however when it rains lws also records rainwater as dew rainfall data recorded by nearby meteorological stations were compared with lws measurements to exclude periods of rainfall from dew measurements the winscanopy canopy analysis equipment regent instruments inc canada was employed to obtain hemi spherical photographs of jujube canopies every 10 days during the budding to stable fruit ripening stages in 2017 and 2018 the photographs of jujube canopies were concurrently measured five times in each of the four cardinal directions jujube lai values were obtained by using winscanopy 2005a software to analyze the photos the lai values were defined well by an exponential growth function to describe the seasonal lai dynamics with coefficients of determination r2 0 95 fig 4 leaf area of a single tree la was calculated by multiplying lai by the crown projection area and the growth functions were used to fit the la dynamics during the budding to stable fruit ripening stages in 2017 and 2018 daily jujube leaf areas were interpolated using the fitting equations between la and day of the year doy given as 3 la 4 76 1 e x p 0 052 d o y 158 74 r 2 0 97 for 2017 and 4 la 4 08 1 e x p 0 060 d o y 154 73 r 2 0 95 for 2018 2 2 3 soil condensate soil condensate mainly occurs in 0 5 cm soil layer in arid and semi arid regions of china guo and liu 2005 when the soil temperature in the 0 5 cm soil layer is lower than the dew point temperature the water content in the 0 5 cm soil layer is the soil condensate at the time i s c i eq 5 and the daily soil condensate s c d eq 6 is the sum of soil condensates at different times within an individual day hao et al 2012 5 s c i 10 h θ i θ i 1 6 s c d i 0 n s c i where s c i is soil condensate mm at time i s c d is daily soil condensate mm d 1 h is soil depth cm θ i and θ i 1 are volumetric soil water contents cm3 cm 3 at times i and i 1 respectively and n is the number of soil condensates that occurred within one individual day the days when soil condensate appeared accounted for only 3 5 and 6 6 of all of the monitored days in 2017 and 2018 respectively fig 3b however soil water content remained at a certain value not changing with time during the period of time when soil condensate occurred perhaps the lateral redistribution of condensate water would cause the buried gs3 probe decagon devices inc usa at the 5 cm soil depth to not record a change in soil water content and to remain at a certain value over a long time period therefore the amount of soil condensate was negligible and could reasonably be ignored 2 2 4 water vapor adsorption soil can adsorb water vapor directly from the atmosphere when soil surface temperature is higher than the dew point temperature and the relative humidity of air in the soil pores is lower than the relative humidity of the atmosphere agam and berliner 2006 in addition water vapor in deep soil can be transported through soil pores and adsorbed to soil surfaces the 0 5 cm soil layer is the main site for liquid water flux and for water vapor flux to transform zeng et al 2009 and the temperature gradient in this layer is the main driving force for water vapor transport in the soil when soil temperature at about 15 cm is higher than temperature at a shallower soil 1 cm deep water vapor moves from the deeper soil to shallower soil in response to the temperature gradient and water vapor molecules accumulate in the surface soil layer and then are adsorbed onto the surface of soil particles when the deep soil 15 cm temperature is lower than the shallow soil 1 cm temperature water vapor moves in the opposite direction hirotaka saito et al 2006 zeng et al 2009 in this study the following rules were followed to define water vapor adsorption wvas 1 the soil temperature at the 5 cm soil depth was higher than the atmospheric dew point temperature and the relative humidity in the 0 5 cm soil layer pores was lower than the atmospheric relative humidity at time i 2 the soil temperature at 5 cm was lower than at 15 cm at time i when both 1 and 2 were true the increase in soil water content in the 0 5 cm soil layer was the water vapor adsorption at time i wva s i eq 7 and the daily water vapor adsorption wva s d eq 8 was the sum of water vapor adsorption at all times within one individual day 7 wva s i 10 h θ i θ i 1 8 wva s d i 0 n wva s i where wva s i is the water vapor adsorption rate at time i mm h 1 wva s d is the daily water vapor adsorption mm d 1 h is the soil depth cm θ i and θ i 1 are the soil water contents cm3 cm 3 at times i and i 1 respectively and n is the number of water vapor adsorption times within one individual day in order to calculate soil condensate or wvas the volumetric water contents and temperatures at the 5 15 and 100 cm soil depths under the three jujube canopies used for dew monitoring were measured using gs3 sensors decagon devices inc usa placed 30 cm away from the jujube trunks there were nine gs3 sensors connected to em50 data loggers decagon devices inc usa which automatically recorded soil water content and soil temperature every 30 min at the same time that lws was recorded the soil water and temperature measurements are shown in fig 3b and c because soil moisture is closely related to stomatal opening and closing volumetric soil water affects sap flow oren and pataki 2001 relative extractable water θ e reflects plant available soil water and thus it is calculated as the ratio of actual extractable water to maximum extractable water granier et al 2000 in accordance with the threshold value of θ e 0 4 determined by chen et al 2014 for a jujube plantation in the hilly loess region soil water status was categorized when θ e 0 4 jujube trees were under water stress and when θ e 0 4 jujube trees were under no water stress roots are the primary organs that plants use to obtain water ma et al 2012 indicated that the dry weight of fine roots the major plant water absorption tissues in the 0 100 cm layer accounted for 83 of the total root mass in a densely planted jujube plantation in the semiarid hilly loess region of china hence the average soil water content in the 0 100 cm soil layer was used to calculate θ e soil relative humidity one of the indicators to determine if wvas occurs was calculated by the formula proposed by hao et al 2012 2 3 transpiration and evaporation 2 3 1 transpiration only single thermal dissipation probes tdp dynamax co usa with two needle probes were used to monitor sap flow of three selected jujube trees the upper probe was heated continually by the joule effect while the lower probe reference probe was kept unheated and remained at trunk temperature tdp probe placement can result in significant variations in sap flow the upper and lower probes length 20 mm diameter 2 mm were uniformly inserted horizontally into the upper and lower drilled holes in sapwood on the northern sides of tree trunks at 20 cm above the ground to minimize sap flow variation the tdp units were carefully wrapped with highly reflective foil to avoid interference from the external environment chen et al 2015 chen et al 2016 a cr1000 data logger campbell scientific usa was used to record the sap flow of the jujube trees every 30 min during the jujube growing season in 2017 and 2018 the standard non calibrated sap flux density was calculated by eq 9 granier 1987 9 j s 119 δ t max δ t δ t 1 231 where js is sap flux density g m 2 s 1 δ t is the temperature difference between heated and unheated probes and δ t max is temperature difference between probes at zero sap flow δtmax was determined separately for each tdp and was estimated over a 13 day period the values of δtmax were determined following the method described by lu et al 2004 during jujube growing season 1 with 13 days as the time step the linear relationship between the maximum value of local δt δtmax and the corresponding day of year doy was established 2 data points below the regression line were eliminated 3 new linear relationship between δtmax and doy was established with the remaining data points and 4 new regression relationship between δtmax and doy was used to calculate actual δtmax assuming that js is uniform across the sapwood profile then sap flow and average transpiration rate per unit ground area were calculated using the following equations 10 sf k j s a s 11 t g k j s a s a g where sf is sap flow kg d 1 k is a unit conversion coefficient equal to 0 00864 ag is the ground area that one individual jujube tree occupies equal to 2 3 6 m2 tg is the average transpiration rate per unit ground area mm d 1 and as is the area of sapwood cm2 as was calculated from the relationship between sapwood area and tree diameter determined by randomly cutting down 11 jujube trees at 20 cm above the ground as was calculated as 12 a s 10 97 t d 43 826 where td cm is the jujube trunk diameter at 20 cm above the ground a significant linear relationship was found between as and td r2 0 95 the leaf area affects sap flow liu et al 2012 consequently changes in leaf area and soil water make the relationship between sap flow and meteorological factors difficult to understand using relative sap flow sfr i e sap flow divided by leaf area which is normalized sap flow can reveal water consumption patterns and the transpiration self regulation capacity of jujube trees in arid and semi arid environments chen et al 2014 and can also quantify the transpiration rate per unit leaf area du et al 2011 to investigate the influence of cd on jujube transpiration the values of sfr of jujube with and without i i present during the jujube growing season were observed 2 3 2 evaporation built on the penman montieth model the shuttleworth wallace model sw model can divide evapotranspiration et into canopy transpiration t and soil evaporation e shuttleworth and wallace 1985 using a bayesian calibration and uncertainty analysis chen et al 2015 calibrated tested and validated the sw model against observed t and e data of jujube plantations in this study area t was measured by the sap flow method section 2 3 1 and e was measured by the micro lysimeter method section 2 2 5 of chen et al 2015 the results obtained in that study showed that the sw model could accurately simulate the hourly et of a jujube plantation therefore the calibrated sw model can be employed to calculate jujube plantation et during the jujube growing season the jujube plantation evaporation is the difference between estimated et and measured t the calibration and validation of the sw model has been well documented in the past see chen et al 2015 to verify whether the calibrated sw model could be applied in the 21 00 9 00 time period we used data from 21 00 9 00 in 2012 and 2014 during the jujube growing season chen 2018 to validate the calibrated sw model results of correlation analysis of the measured et and et estimated by the calibrated sw model for validation periods 2012 and 2014 are shown in fig 5 at hourly time scale the values of the coefficient of determination r2 mean relative error mre and willmott s index of agreement d were 0 84 18 81 and 0 97 respectively the sw model met the reliability criteria r2 and d 0 8 mre 20 for the 2012 and 2014 growing seasons thus the calibrated sw model could be employed for the 21 00 9 00 time period in 2017 and 2018 2 4 meteorological factors the relative humidity rh air temperature tair solar radiation rs w m 2 precipitation p mm and wind speed u m s 1 were monitored with an automated weather station rr 9100 yugen technology co ltd china in the experimental field data were collected every 30 min during the jujube growing season table 1 dew point temperature is an indicator to determine if condensation will occur on objects it can be calculated by the following equation lawrence 2005 13 t d b ln rh 100 a t air b t air a ln rh 100 a t air b t air where td is dew point temperature a and b are the constants of 17 625 and 243 04 respectively tair is average atmospheric temperature and rh is the average relative humidity of the atmosphere 2 5 statistical analyses all of the statistical analyses were performed using spss16 spss chicago usa significant differences in i i c d d cd duration wva s i wva s d and wvas duration were tested among different jujube growth stages by multiple comparison the results thus obtained were tested at p 0 05 by lsd post hoc test the independent sample test was employed to test for significant differences among cd and wvas durations during the same growth stage 3 results 3 1 duration of canopy dew and water vapor adsorption fig 6 illustrates the number of days when cd and wvas occurred and the duration of cd and wvas during the 2017 and 2018 jujube growing seasons panels a and b in fig 6 show that the total number of cd days were fewer than the total number of wvas days the total number of cd days was 97 days in 2017 and 118 days in 2018 accounting for 61 0 and 72 0 of the total days of the jujube growing season respectively the total number of wvas days was 107 days in 2017 and 125 days in 2018 accounting for 68 6 and 77 6 of the total days of the jujube growing season respectively the maximum number of cd and wvas days were observed during stage 3 and were 46 and 53 days respectively in 2017 and 52 and 51 days in 2018 accounting for 69 7 and 75 4 2017 and 80 3 and 73 9 2018 of the total days during stage 3 respectively the numbers of wvas days during stage 1 in 2017 and 2018 were 18 and 23 days and were more than the number of cd days at the same stage panels a and b in fig 6 show that the cd duration differences between stages 1 and 2 in 2017 1 10 h and in 2018 0 74 h were not significant in both 2017 and 2018 the average cd duration peaked during stage 4 10 44 h in 2017 and 11 71 h in 2018 and was significantly higher than the durations observed during the other three growth stages p 0 05 the wvas duration during stage 2 was significantly lower than wvas duration at the other three growth stages p 0 05 with average values of 0 95 h in 2017 and 0 80 h in 2018 the wvas durations at the other three growth stages ranged from 1 75 to 2 57 h the cd durations were significantly higher than the wvas durations at every growth stage p 0 05 and the differences between cd and wvas durations at stages 1 2 3 and 4 were 2 09 4 35 4 99 and 8 08 h in 2017 and 3 45 3 67 7 75 and 9 14 h in 2018 respectively 3 2 canopy dew and water vapor adsorption 3 2 1 diurnal changes in dew intensities and water vapor adsorption rates diurnal changes in i i on the jujube canopy involved accumulation and evaporation stages fig 7 increasing with time during the accumulation stage and decreasing with time during the evaporation stage until the accumulated dew completely evaporated some periods can be seen with interrupted accumulation or evaporation of i i for example accumulated dew evaporated at 1 30 3 30 in the nighttime during stage 2 in 2017 fig 7b causing interrupted accumulation and fluctuating i i i i started to accumulate after 20 30 during stage 1 but this was 1 0 2 0 h 2 0 2 5 h and 2 5 3 0 h later than during stages 2 3 and 4 respectively i i peaked at about 5 00 6 30 during all four growth stages reaching 0 0139 0 0678 0 0897 and 0 0707 mm h 1 in 2017 and 0 0514 0 0383 0 0943 and 0 0943 mm h 1 in 2018 at stages 1 4 respectively i i did not differ significantly between stages 3 and 4 in 2017 or in 2018 but it was significantly higher during stages 3 and 4 than during stages 1 and 2 p 0 05 considering the frequencies of ii occurrences shown in fig 8 the accumulation stage of i i mainly occurred during 3 00 6 00 at stage 1 1 00 6 00 at stage 2 22 30 6 00 at stage 3 and 19 00 7 00 at stage 4 the frequencies of i i occurrences at these times were as high as 64 0 55 6 88 6 and 85 0 respectively for the four growth stages fig 8 during these particular periods partial pressure of water vapor above the canopy was greater than within the canopy making water vapor move toward the canopy causing leaf surface water vapor to saturate and dew to form at the same time water vapor also opened leaf stomata and promoted increased leaf absorption of dew and carbon dioxide exchange ben asher et al 2010 however the evaporation stage of i i lasted for a relatively short time during the four growth stages and mainly occurred between 6 00 and 9 00 at these stages fig 7 the frequency of ii occurrences after 9 00 was always less than 20 fig 8 the rates and frequencies of occurrence of wvas at the four growth stages were lower at 21 00 6 00 than at 6 30 9 00 figs 7 8 in 2017 and 2018 the rates of wvas changed slowly from 21 00 to 6 00 and the ranges of wvas rate at 21 00 6 00 during the four growth stages in 2017 and 2018 were 0 0012 0 0024 mm h 1 0 0007 0 0048 mm h 1 0 0026 0 0151 mm h 1 and 0 0015 0 0093 mm h 1 respectively only about 10 of the value of i i the ranges of wvas frequency at 21 00 6 00 at the four growth stages were 3 45 8 00 2 78 16 67 7 81 40 91 and 5 00 32 00 respectively however the rates and frequencies of wvas increased at 6 30 9 00 during the four growth stages and wvas mainly occurred from 6 30 9 00 with the ranges at 6 30 9 00 for the four growth stages being 0 0036 0 0437 mm h 1 0 0033 0 0257 mm h 1 0 0025 0 0133 mm h 1 and 0 0033 0 0373 mm h 1 respectively in 2017 and 2018 and their frequency ranges at 6 30 9 00 for the four growth stages being 12 00 76 00 11 11 62 96 10 94 39 09 and 10 00 80 00 respectively these results agreed with previous research results reported by zhang et al 2015 and liu et al 2018 however the rates of wvas were lower than those reported by verhoef et al 2006 i e 0 02 0 10 mm h 1 and the peak value of wvas rate was higher than the value of 0 02 mm h 1 reported by zhang et al 2015 there was no significant difference between the rates of wvas at the four growth stages in 2017 and 2018 3 2 2 daily canopy dew and water vapor adsorption amount the average c d d values were 0 632 and 0 519 mm d 1 averaged over the entire growing season in 2017 and 2018 respectively in 2017 and 2018 the average c d d during stage 1 was 0 082 and 0 198 mm d 1 significantly lower than cdd at the other three growth stages p 0 05 the average c d d reached a maximum of 0 884 mm d 1 during stage 3 in 2017 fig 9 a and a maximum of 0 755 mm d 1 during stage 4 in 2018 fig 9b the average wva s d were 0 137 and 0 113 mm d 1 over the entire growing season in 2017 and 2018 respectively but these values were significantly lower than the c d d values observed in 2017 and 2018 p 0 05 in 2017 and 2018 wva s d peaked during stage 1 averaging 0 190 and 0 174 mm d 1 respectively the average wva s d during stage 2 was 0 073 mm d 1 in 2017 and 0 058 mm d 1 in 2018 significantly lower than wvasd at the other three growth stages p 0 05 kidron 2000 demonstrated that 0 03 mm of c d d or wva s d was the threshold water availability for microorganisms the current study found that the c d d and wva s d totaling 0 03 mm d 1 occurred on 102 and 95 days respectively in 2017 and on 107 and 117 days respectively in 2018 accounting for 95 33 and 98 95 in 2017 and 84 25 and 98 32 in 2018 of all of the observed days moreover the frequency of heavy dew 0 2 mm as defined by kabela et al 2009 was observed on 69 38 of days in 2017 and 76 92 of days in 2018 3 3 ecological effects of canopy dew and water vapor adsorption 3 3 1 response of transpiration to canopy dew to understand the effects of cd on jujube transpiration under soil water stress the sfr with and without i i at the half hourly intervals during stages 1 2 and 3 under soil water stress conditions are shown in fig 10 the values of sfr with i i at 18 00 6 00 during stages 1 2 and 3 were lower than values of sfr without i i fig 10 during stage 1 in 2018 and stage 3 in 2017 the sfr with i i was lower than the sfr without i i for individual days fig 10 dew mainly occurred at night 18 00 6 00 fig 7 thus the effect of dew on nighttime sap flow was further explored a common widespread and significant process from all biomes and seasons forster 2014 the cumulative nighttime sap flow during the 18 00 6 00 time period are summarized in table 2 table 2 also shows that nighttime sap flow with i i dropped by 5 207 103 377 kg d 1 m 2 compared with nighttime sap flow without i i accounting for 44 36 92 64 of nighttime sap flow without i i 3 3 2 response of evaporation to water vapor adsorption fig 11 shows the daily time course of e with and without wvas in the jujube plantation during the 2017 and 2018 jujube growing seasons e with and without wvas was different in the different years and at different growth stages fig 11 the cumulative e with wvas at 21 00 6 00 at stages 1 and 2 in 2017 was 0 026 and 0 025 mm h 1 higher than cumulative e without wvas but the cumulative e with the wvas at 21 00 6 00 at stages 1 and 2 in 2018 was 0 103 and 0 004 mm h 1 lower than cumulative e without wvas higher wvas rates mainly occurred at 6 30 9 00 during all four growth stages figs 6 7 cumulative e values with wvas at 6 30 9 00 during the four growth stages in 2017 were 0 002 0 022 0 169 and 0 007 mm h 1 higher than cumulative e without wvas in contrast cumulative e values with wvas at 6 30 9 00 during the four growth stages in 2018 were 0 043 0 024 0 051 and 0 008 mm h 1 lower than cumulative e without wvas the number of days when wvas was observed comprised 68 6 and 77 6 of the entire growing season in 2017 and 2018 respectively but wvas duration was only 0 80 2 57 h fig 6 consequently wvas did not affect e and the main factors affecting e were soil moisture soil temperature atmospheric evaporative demand and leaf area index merlin et al 2018 zhao et al 2018 4 discussion 4 1 canopy dew and water vapor adsorption measurement method at present there are no standardized methods for measuring nrwi components of the hydrologic cycle wang et al 2017a the dielectric leaf wetness sensors lws were used to measure cd in dryland jujube plantations in the study area lws is specially designed to approximate thermodynamic properties of leaf and can accurately monitor dew ghobakhlou et al 2015 which is widely used today alvarado barrientos et al 2015 gerlein safdi et al 2018a jia et al 2019 wang et al 2017b dwarf jujube trees are planted widely in china s loess plateau region the jujube trees at our experimental site were pruned every 21 days during the growing season to keep the tree at the same height and canopy size as the widely planted dwarf jujube trees over the long term management the structure of the jujube trees have formed similar features dynamic trend and size of leaf area index in 2017 and 2018 fig 4 therefore the measured cd was assumed to be representative and accurate there are different definitions of daily dew amount but zangvil 1996 defined daily dew amount as the maximum amount of dew intensity for a day s dew event kabela et al 2009 and xu et al 2012 defined daily dew amount as the product of lai and daily dew intensity which is the difference of dew intensity before sunrise and after sunset xu et al 2012 in this paper daily cd is defined as the product of lai and daily dew intensity but daily dew intensity is the maximum dew intensity measured using lws in a day s dew event section 2 2 1 the daily cd calculated by xu et al 2012 was sometimes smaller than daily cd calculated in this study this is because different methods were used to calculate daily dew intensity for example sunrise and sunset in 2017 during stage 3 were 6 00 and 18 00 respectively daily dew intensities calculated using the method adopted by xu et al 2012 and the one used in this study were 0 081 and 0 090 mm h 1 respectively fig 7c the canopy dew formation involved accumulation and evaporation stages fig 7 the daily dew intensity used in this study was just the maximum value of dew intensity in the dew accumulation stage which was the total cumulative dew intensity it can accurately calculate daily cd in this study gs3 sensors were used to determine water vapor adsorption by measuring soil moisture variation and soil temperature at 5 cm soil depth sections 2 2 3 and 2 2 4 the basis of the method used was the same as that used by many other researchers hao et al 2012 uclés et al 2013 2016 the water vapor for wvas comes not only directly from the atmosphere but also from upward movement of water vapor deeper from the soil profile the effect of soil water in adjacent soil layers on wvas was considered too in section 2 2 4 temperature gradient drives liquid and vapor fluxes of soil water to migrate from the deep to surface soil layer however vapor flux was dominant during 18 00 9 00 when wvas occurs and water vapor flux is about 100 times that of liquid water flux zeng et al 2008 therefore liquid water flux is negligible and its movement affects wvas the effect of hydraulic redistribution in 0 5 cm soil layer on wvas was not considered perhaps there was heterogeneity of soil moisture in the surface soil layer causing lateral redistribution of wvas in the 0 5 cm soil layer in order to further study wvas in dryland jujube plantations the method adopted uclés et al 2013 was used in consideration of the effect of soil hydraulic redistribution on wvas even in areas with shallow groundwater there was the need to consider the effect of capillary upwelling water on wvas 4 2 nocturnal soil water relationships with canopy dew nocturnal soil water storage changes in the jujube tree root zone 5 100 cm soil layer on dew days were 0 144 3 483 mm higher than nocturnal soil water changes on non dew days at three growth stages table 2 this result suggests that the hydraulic redistribution of roots are an important ecological process that acts as an inherent survival mechanism for plants in arid habitats zeppel et al 2014 that could cause nighttime soil water storage changes water condensation resulting from turbulent dew deposition on leaves can increase the local humidity thereby decreasing the vpd directly at leaf surfaces creating a temporary humid condition at leaf air boundaries and improving plant water status the vaporization of dew water from leaf surfaces consumes heat evaporative cooling and reduces leaf temperature thereby reducing energy available for transpiration ben asher et al 2010 zhuang and ratcliffe 2012 konrad et al 2015 gerlein safdi et al 2018a gerlein safdi et al 2018b dew on leaf surfaces can provide an additional source of water that can be absorbed through specific surface structures or possibly through stomata berry et al 2018 in one chamber study with long exposure of plants to dew leaf absorbed dew accounted for close to 90 of the leaf water kim and lee 2011 leaf absorbed water will cause the leaf water potential to be higher than the root water potential in dry soil forming a downward ecological process of hydraulic redistribution leaf absorbed water can be transported through the xylem to soil close to roots and the roots may release small amounts of water the released water affects only soil in the rhizosphere and could be subsequently reabsorbed by the roots when the leaves resume transpiration eller et al 2013 cassana et al 2016 lateral redistribution of soil water may occur in response to horizontal water potential gradients leaf dew decreased nighttime sap flow table 2 weakened inhibiting effects of nighttime sap flow on hydraulic redistribution of roots and promoted water transport from wet soil to dry soil through plant roots thereby improving soil water availability and root activity and affecting plant water physiology si et al 2014 hydraulic redistribution has been generally recognized as an important ecological process so did greater downward and lateral hydraulic redistribution or rhizosphere water regulation on dew days compared with dew free days result in nighttime beneficial soil water storage changes in the root zone in the future it will be necessary to search for evidence of this supposition by using the techniques of root sap flow soil water or water potential observations and isotopic analyses 4 3 importance and contributions of canopy dew and water vapor adsorption to the water budget in a jujube plantation the p cd wvas t e and et as well as the contributions of cd wvas and cd wvas to t e and et e t were assessed at each growth stage in a jujube plantation table 3 wvas comprised a larger proportion of nrwis cd wvas at stage 1 than at the other three growth stages with proportions of 0 740 in 2017 and 0 507 in 2018 the ratios of cd to cd wvas at stages 2 3 and 4 were 0 870 0 849 0 774 in 2017 and 0 823 0 864 and 0 833 in 2018 respectively cd accounted for 80 60 and 81 21 of the cd wvas during the entire growing season in 2017 and 2018 respectively and was the most important component of nrwis this finding was consistent with the research results of wang et al 2017b and gao et al 2015 the cds were 60 63 and 61 21 mm which were equivalent to 15 18 and 17 06 of the rainfall during the entire growing season in 2017 and 2018 respectively the cd p ratios in the semi arid jujube plantation were lower than what has been reported in other regions for example measured cd p was 19 in semi arid coastal southwestern madagascar hanisch et al 2015 and 50 in a desert riparian forest ecosystem on the eastern boundary of the taklimakan desert in china hao et al 2012 wvas values were 14 60 and 14 15 mm equivalent to only 3 65 and 3 94 of the rainfall during the entire growing season in 2017 and 2018 respectively during the entire jujube growing season in 2017 and 2018 the numbers of rain days were 34 and 35 d respectively and the frequencies of rain days rain days observed days were 21 38 and 21 34 respectively less than those of cd and wvas although the total amounts of cd and wvas were less than the rainfall amount they occurred frequently this indicated that the non rainfall periods were more prolonged than the rain periods at this jujube plantation the coefficients of variation standard deviation mean for cd wvas and p were 94 05 and 59 20 87 96 and 51 63 and 266 20 and 321 03 during the 2017 and 2018 jujube growing seasons respectively moreover at each growth stage in 2017 and 2018 the ratios of the coefficients of variation for cd and p were 0 17 0 49 and 0 11 0 28 and the ratios of the coefficients of variation for wvas and p were 0 23 0 35 and 0 17 0 34 respectively these results showed that the coefficients of variation for nrwis in the jujube plantation studied in this experiment were smaller than those of rainfall considered over the entire growing season or at each growth stage which indicated that the characteristics of nrwis were quantitatively stable table 3 shows that at each jujube growth stage in 2017 and 2018 1 the contributions of cd to t mainly occurred at stages 3 and 4 with maximum values of 0 314 stage 3 in 2017 and 0 539 stage 4 in 2018 2 the contribution of wvas to e mainly occurred at stage 4 with a maximum value of 0 261 in 2018 and 3 contributions of nrwis to et cd wvas et mainly occurred at stages 3 and 4 with maximum values of 0 233 stage 3 in 2017 and 0 449 stage 4 in 2018 large amounts of water are needed to promote the growth of branch leaves and flower bud of jujube at stages 1 and 2 hu et al 2016 during these stages the contribution of nrwi was 0 052 0 107 and rainfall during these stages accounted for only 6 56 16 92 of the total rainfall during the growing season table 3 the relative extractable water in the root zone was seriously deficient for jujube growth θ e was 0 045 0 282 fig 3c soil water deficit will affect soil water movement hinder precipitation infiltration and recharge weaken the function of the soil reservoir reduce soil quality and soil productivity and further affect the ecosystem service functions of vegetation such as soil and water conservation and hydrological regulation chen et al 2007 wang et al 2012 in the past when the regional water amounts have been calculated using the water balance method nrwis were often neglected as water resource input items however nrwis are important components of the water balance when considered over half year or yearly scales lekouch et al 2011 the magnitudes of the water balance components in the jujube plantation from stage 1 to stage 4 are shown in table 3 water consumption et values for the jujube growing season half year were 456 813 mm and 410 110 mm more than the rainfall in 2017 and 2018 respectively over that period which meant that the rainfall amounts could not meet water consumption for the jujube plantation if the nrwis in the jujube plantation were considered as water resource input items then the differences between water resources inputs p cd wvas and water resources output et were 17 905 mm in 2017 and 23 999 mm in 2018 which were close to soil water storage changes in the root zone table 3 that is to say the jujube plantation was approximately water balanced the cd t ratio was 0 218 in 2017 and 0 258 in 2018 the wvas e ratios were very small with values of 0 082 in both 2017 and 2018 the cd wvas et ratio was 0 165 in 2017 and 0 184 in 2018 the cd wvas et ratio calculated in the present study was higher than what was recorded for a rice field in the subtropical monsoon climate of china liu et al 2018 and higher than what was reported for semi arid desert valley ecosystems in the great basin of the western usa malek et al 1999 in summary nrwis are an important supplementary water source for dryland jujube plantations in the hilly loess region of china and are a major water balance component that cannot be ignored in the regional hydrological cycle 4 4 change of water input and output items in a jujube plantation transpiration is the main pathway for water consumption by plants and remains an intense area of plant physiology and ecology research wullschleger et al 1998 almost all plants can open their stomata at night and continue to lose water through transpiration zeppel et al 2014 in arid and semi arid regions plants can absorb water by diffusion through leaf surfaces via leaf trichomes or hydathodes or they can take up water from soil through roots to maintain growth and transpiration limm and dawson 2010 however fig 3c shows that the relative extractable water available for jujube root systems was often insufficient θ e 0 4 that changes in soil water storage in the 5 100 cm root zone during the jujube growing season were only 11 49 mm in 2017 and 17 25 mm in 2018 table 3 and days when soil water deficits occurred accounted for 90 97 2017 and 86 62 2018 of the jujube growing season therefore jujube root systems can only obtain limited amounts of water from the root zone pruning is an agronomic practice to reduce plant transpiration in this study secondary branches were pruned to reduce the canopy sizes of the jujube trees and to control jujube transpiration but the effects of pruning are short lived hipps and atkinson 2014 previous research has shown that heavy pruning can reduce transpiration increase soil water storage and improve water use efficiency hipps and atkinson 2014 nie et al 2017 chen et al 2016 found that heavy pruning with main branches removed in rainfed jujube plantations in the loess plateau can alleviate soil water deficit in the 0 300 cm soil layer significantly reduce transpiration per unit ground area increase the sensitivity of canopy stomatal conductance to vpd avoid the risk of runaway cavitation under soil drought conditions and maintain a reasonably fresh fruit yield however they also reported that heavy pruning can cause light to pass through the upper canopy resulting in increased soil evaporation during the jujube growing season mulching practices have also been used to effectively limit soil evaporation in jujube plantations wang et al 2018 however different mulching treatments have different effects on suppressing evaporation and increasing soil water storage tomaszkiewicz et al 2017 changes in canopy structure caused by heavy pruning can lead to micrometeorological changes in the canopy that affect physiological activities such as photosynthesis and transpiration beis and patakas 2015 can the combined effects of heavy pruning and mulching reduce t and e increase cd and wvas and then increase the cd t wvas e and cd wvas et ratios especially at stages 1 and 2 further experimental research will be needed to answer this question 5 conclusions in a dryland jujube plantation of the hilly loess region of china nrwis were composed of cd and wvas in the 0 5 cm soil layer during the entire jujube growing season cd accounted for about 81 of the nrwis and the number of days when cd occurred were fewer than the number of days when wvas occurred cd durations at the stage 1 to stage 4 were significantly longer than wvas durations p 0 05 the onset time of cd varied with jujube growth stages and ii peaked at about 5 00 6 30 at the four growth stages there were no significant differences in i i between stages 3 and 4 but there were significantly higher i i at stages 3 and 4 than at stages 1 and 2 p 0 05 and the rates of wvas which were about 0 1 times the i i s and mainly occurred at 6 30 9 00 did not differ between the four growth stages the ratio of cd to transpiration was as high as 0 258 during the entire growing season and cd reduced nocturnal sap flow decreasing water consumption in water deficit soil 5 100 cm layer and increasing changes in soil water storage however wvas did not affect soil evaporation nrwis occurred frequently during the entire jujube growing season and were quantitatively more stable than rainfall their contribution to the water resource output term evapotranspiration reached a maximum value of 0 184 in 2018 therefore the contribution of nrwis to the jujube water balance in the hilly loess region cannot be disregarded and nrwis probably had positive ecological

5719,this study attempts to assess the consistency of various low flow indices evaluated at 12 water stations in the ljubljanica river catchment slovenia which is due to its high diversity of hydrogeological properties recognized as a non homogenous catchment daily discharge data were used in the study for evaluating low flow statistics baseflow index discharges from flow duration curves mean annual minimums seasonal indices and analysis of hydrograph recession curves the indices were compared at each station and their values were interpreted in terms of the connection between surface water and groundwater as well as the extent of contribution of delayed sources to surface water although all low flow statistics point to the same stations in terms of the greatest and the lowest contribution of water from groundwater we identified inconsistencies at some water stations the hydrograph recession analysis and seasonal indices support the conclusions drawn from low flow statistics analysis with the seasonality ratio lower than 1 at all stations meaning that summer low flow conditions prevail across the catchment however at the torrential stream gradaščica an inconsistency was found with recession constants that could be attributed to the inappropriate choice of computational parameters we assessed the overall consistency heat map visualisation although it shows consistency between low flow indices some variations demonstrate that in case of hydrologically and geologically heterogeneous catchments an analysis of several low flow indices is needed in order to obtain a holistic overview of low flow conditions and to avoid bad decisions in water resources management due to inappropriate consideration of low flow characteristics keywords low flow hydrogeologically non homogeneous catchment base flow index bfi seasonality recession curve analysis 1 introduction low flow analyses provide essential information for sustainable management of water resources and planning of their future use moreover understanding the low flow temporal variability is crucial for the assessment of hydrological risk hydropower production agriculture and various economic activities e g wmo 2008 giuntoli et al 2013 parajka et al 2016 until recently the definition of low flows has not been clearly established in his review paper about low flows smakhtin 2001 upgraded wmo s 1974 definition as low flow is flow of water in the stream during prolonged dry weather and is considered to be a seasonal phenomenon and an integral part of the flow regimes of all streams however the use of the term today still depends on the type of interest e g in which part of the year low flows occur how long do they last what are their values therefore various indices and procedures for determination of low flows have been developed low flows were analysed using different indices in different river catchments around the world in the last decades for example different mean n day annual minima mamn were used to determine trends in low flows e g svensson et al 2005 fiala et al 2010 stahl et al 2010 coch and mediero 2016 bormann and pinter 2017 in united kingdom mamn were used for the development of national low flow procedures e g gustard et al 1992 the usefulness of individual mamn indices varies depending on the purpose and the country smakhtin 2001 and bormann and pinter 2017 recommend the use of mam7 over mam1 since using mam7 day to day variations in the artificial component of the stream flow and measurement errors can be eliminated however in most cases the difference between mam1 and mam7 values is not significant gustard et al 1992 compared the ratios mamn mam7 n is the number of days between 1 and 180 in catchments with different geological characteristics they found that catchments with greater permeability have a lower ratio than those with lower permeability in the field of water resources management as well as in general hydrology flow duration curves fdc are an indispensable tool fdc expresses the relationship between any flow value magnitude and the percentage of time that this flow value is equalled or exceeded frequency e g vogel and fennessey 1994 1995 in fdc the type of the flow regime is reflected since it depends on the upstream conditions geology and groundwater human activities such as urbanization etc however in low flow studies the use of fdc is related primarily to the part of the curve with flows below q50 smakhtin 2001 in many countries flows evaluated from fdc are used for determining low flow requirements or ecological flows for example in united kingdom q95 is often used for ecological flow acreman and dunbar 2004 moreover ratio q90 q50 was used in low flow studies as an index of baseflow for evaluating the percentage of water contributing from groundwater to the streamflow e g caissie and robichaud 2009 another very often used low flow index is bfi baseflow index in the study of beck et al 2013 bfi was evaluated in more than 3000 catchments worldwide for identification of its global patterns and to construct the model for bfi prediction in ungauged catchments based on 18 climatic and physiographic characteristics something similar was done by mazvimavi et al 2009 for 52 catchments in zimbabwe they found that contribution of groundwater and other delayed sources to streamflow depends mainly on mean annual precipitation evapotranspiration catchment slope and catchment density bfis were evaluated also in many other studies as part of hydrograph recession analyses e g zhang et al 2017 yang et al 2018 the latter represents one of the options to answer the question how fast or slow the streamflow will be decreasing in the absence of precipitation as it is clear from the low flow definition of smakhtin 2001 an important feature of low flows is their period of occurrence seasonality therefore in the past several methods and indices were developed for determining and describing low flow seasonality laaha and blöschl 2006 suggested an examination of seasonal indices seasonality histograms seasonality index and seasonality ratio in the catchments where the reasons for low flows are seasonally different they applied seasonal indices in catchments of austria for regionalization of low flows and found that spatial patterns of seasonal indices can be well explained based on hydrological conditions in addition to the methods described above there are many other indices and techniques for low flow analyses most studies on low flows in relation to the hydrogeological properties of the catchment typically contain one or in rare cases few low flow indices e g bloomfield et al 2009 carlier et al 2018 this is true for slovenia as well although low flow analyses for some streams and karst springs in slovenia have been conducted in the past e g kobold and brilly 1994 brilly et al 1997 brenčič 2000 petek et al 2015 sapač et al 2019a none of them have systematically covered the low flow dynamics of the ljubljanica river and or its tributaries which differ substantially in terms of their hydrogeological characteristics moreover the consistency of low flow indices in case of non homogenous catchments has not been studied yet therefore the main aim of this study was twofold the first part is a detailed analysis of various low flow indices for the rivers in the hydrologically nonhomogeneous and mostly karst ljubljanica river catchment using the data from all operating water stations in order to get comprehensive information about the dynamics of low flows the second purpose is to investigate the possible relations among different low flow indices their relation to the known hydrogeological characteristics and consistency of various low flow indices due to the heterogeneity one can expect that the values of low flow indices will differ between different parts of the catchment based on the known hydrological and geological properties of the catchment individual values of the low flow indices could be interpreted and consistency of the results could be assessed 2 study area the ljubljanica river catchment is located in the central part of slovenia fig 1 the whole catchment area is estimated at 1890 km2 kolbezen and pristov 1998 since the exact contributing area of some of the karst streams in the ljubljanica river catchment is not yet known karstic fissured and porous carbonate rocks of limestone and dolomite dominate the ljubljanica river catchment kranjc 2007 consequently the flow of water into the subsoil in the area is typically fast bonacci 2015 below the karst surface there dominates a network of connected conduits developed within fractured and or porous rock the ljubljanica river is also known as the river of seven names since from its source at the foothills of snežnik it sinks and reappears six times and each part of the surface river has its own name šušteršič 1994 the catchment can be roughly divided into karst and non karst areas according to habič 1969 1100 1200 km2 of the southern part of the catchment up to the springs near vrhnika water stations 5240 5030 and 5270 in fig 1 is dinaric karst with the major part consisted of limestone the north western part of the catchment polhov gradec hills is classified as pre alpine or isolated karst with steep dolomite slopes however the map of hydrogeological units representing porosity type size and abundance of aquifers fig 1 indicates a large hydrogeological non homogeneity of the catchment since there are 6 out of 7 hydrogeological units occurring in slovenia the major part of the catchment consists of fissured including karstic aquifers the majority of the southern part up to the springs near vrhnika followed by intergranular or fissured layers that form insignificant aquifers with local or limited sources of groundwater ljubljana marshes and rivers with water stations 5840 5500 5540 5770 in fig 1 the northern part of the catchment close to the outflow to the sava river is classified as an intergranular aquifer with medium to high abundance dinaric pluvio nival flow regime is characteristic for this region with a temperate continental climate and with similar spring and autumn discharge maximums hrvatin 1998 nw part of the catchment polhov gradec hills consists of less permeable rocks kolbezen and pristov 1998 whereas ljubljanska kotlina consists of thick quaternary gravel layers and conglomerates pavlovec 1961 forest and semi natural areas prevail as land use types in the ljubljanica river catchment detailed descriptions of types of karst of the hydrogeological properties of the catchment and its river system can be found in kogovšek 2001 2004 gabrovšek et al 2010 petrič 2010 ferk 2016 mihevc et al 2016 and kovačič and ravbar 2016 the catchment s altitude is between 300 and 1800 m a s l therefore the mean annual rainfall in the catchment varies between 1400 and 2000 mm 1400 1600 mm at ljubljana marshes 1600 1800 mm in the gradaščica sub catchment 1800 2000 mm in the karst part of the ljubljanica river catchment and 2000 mm can be expected in the snežnik karst plateau bat et al 2008 average river density in the catchment is 0 98 km km2 whereas in the pivka sub catchment the density is only 0 55 km km2 kolbezen and pristov 1998 3 data and methods 3 1 data daily discharge data series arso 2018 at 12 water stations in the ljubljanica river catchment slovenia were analysed fig 1 table 1 the following criteria were used for including a water station into the study 1 still operational in 2016 2 at least 25 years of data 3 without more than a 5 year consecutive gap in the time series there is no single recommendation for the minimum length of the flow time series relevant for the analysis of the low flows and calculation of low flow indices in the literature beck et al 2013 used the criterion of more than 10 years of not necessarily consecutive data for the calculation of bfi kundzewicz and robson 2000 as well as bormann and pinter 2017 suggested more than 50 years of data for the investigation of climate change influence on low flows petek et al 2015 analysed low flows using data series of a minimum length of 30 years however all these researchers agree that it is best to carry out analyses on sets that are as long as possible for this reason the whole period of available daily discharge data for each considered water station table 1 was taken into account in this study in low flow analysis it is necessary to define the start of the hydrological year appropriately in order to avoid the splitting of the low flow season into two hydrological years wmo 2008 the lowest stream flows in the ljubljanica river catchment are expected in the summer months mainly due to less precipitation and higher evapotranspiration bat et al 2008 therefore in the study the start of the hydrological year coincides with the calendar year i e 1st of january most of the analyses in the study were performed using the lfstat package koffler et al 2016 included in r r core team 2018 the package functions were prepared based on the manual on the low flow estimation and prediction wmo 2008 orange software demšar et al 2013 was applied for hierarchical clustering using different low flow indices 3 2 low flow statistics for the purpose of this study different low flow statistics were calculated for 12 water stations in the ljubljanica river catchment namely baseflow index bfi mean annual minimum n day flow mamn mean discharge qmean and the values of the flows exceeded 50 70 90 and 95 of the time q50 q70 q90 q95 bfi is one of the most common indices calculated in low flow studies it is defined as the proportion of total flow that comes from stored catchment sources such as groundwater lakes wetlands melting snow ice etc gustard et al 1992 smakhtin 2001 it is expressed as 1 b f i v b a s e v t o t a l where vbase and vtotal are volume of base flow and volume of total flow respectively a detailed explanation of the bfi calculation procedure can be found in wmo 2008 low values of bfi 0 2 are mostly characteristic of impermeable catchments with a flashy flow regime and higher values to 0 95 are typical for high storage capacity catchments wmo 2008 for analysis of low flows based on fdc only the flows exceeded 50 of the time or more were evaluated already from the slope of this part of fdc one is able to obtain information about the contribution of the groundwater to the stream in other words hydrogeological properties of the catchment are reflected in the shape of a fdc small slope usually means greater groundwater contribution and vice versa smakhtin 2001 rather than the values of q50 q70 q90 and q95 we were interested in the ratios between them in order to obtain more information about low flows and water origin for example the q50 q90 ratio represents the variability of low flows whereas the opposite ratio q90 q50 shows the proportion of the streamflow that originates from the groundwater without considering the size of the catchment smakhtin 2001 q90 q50 is sometimes used as an index of baseflow caissie and robichaud 2009 mamn flows are also frequently used as low flow indices tallaksen and van lanen 2004 and can be calculated for different durations in the study mamn flows were estimated for durations of 1 7 10 30 and 90 days these durations are commonly used also in other studies wmo 2008 mam1 is in fact the mean of annual minimum flows for n greater than 1 the moving average technique of the previous n days is applied in the calculation based on the above described low flow statistics we applied hierarchical clustering to identify differences similarities between the considered stations of the ljubljanica river catchment cluster analysis is one of the most important analysis tools in data mining based on which objects data or observations are divided into two or more groups e g rokach and mainom 2005 zabret and šraj 2018 the goal of cluster analysis is to achieve the maximum similarity within a group and the maximum difference among the groups hierarchical clustering of low flow indices in the study was performed by orange software demšar et al 2013 using average linkage clustering euclidean distance and a defined top number of clusters n 3 clusters produced by hierarchical clustering are often illustrated by a dendogram everitt 1998 which was also the case in this study 3 3 seasonality of low flows the seasonality index is a measure of low flow timing estimating the mean day of low flow occurrence it is based on two parameters namely the day of low flow q95 occurrence which is expressed in terms of angular value θ and the length of vector r by which the strength of seasonality can be identified eq 2 and eq 3 mardia 1972 the methodology for calculation is analogous to the methodology of defining the day of flood occurrence bayliss and jones 1993 burn et al 1997 blöschl et al 2017 and the theory behind this methodology is derived from directional statistics mardia 1972 2 θ d 2 π 365 3 r x 2 y 2 where x and y represent x and y coordinates of the mean low flow day and are calculated as mean values of cosine θ and sine θ respectively in other words values of vector r closer to 0 indicate a greater variability in low flow occurrence while values closer to 1 indicate a stronger seasonal low flow response d in eq 2 is julian date ranging from 1 to 365 to 366 in a leap year in order to calculate the seasonality ratio sr it is first necessary to adequately define summer and winter periods in our case we divided the year into two seasons summer and winter in the same way as laaha and blöschl 2006 for austria the summer starts on 1 april and ends on 30 november and the winter period is from 1 december to 31 march in the next step the mean q95 for each season is determined q 95 s q 95 w the sr is then calculated as 4 sr q 95 s q 95 w sr values greater than or less than 1 indicate the presence of a winter low flow regime and a summer low flow regime respectively supplemental information and additional support to analysing low flow seasonality represents the so called seasonality histogram presenting the mean monthly flow and the 10th percentile of daily flow q90 this type of histogram is used also in the wmo 2008 manual for the explanation and comparison of low flows in various hydrological regimes in terms of low flows rain dominated regimes are first divided into the climates with or without a distinct dry season the latter can be further divided regarding the ratio between q90 and qmean a larger ratio means a lower standard deviation and therefore smaller differences between values of low and mean flows 3 4 hydrograph recession analysis the basic idea of the recession analysis is to model the recession curve by fitting an analytical expression to the outflow function qt where q is the rate of flow and t time when qt is modeled as the outflow from a first order linear storage with no inflow then the recession rate follows the simple exponential equation linearized depuit boussinesq equation tallaksen 1995 5 q t q 0 e t c where qt is the flow at time t q0 is the initial flow and c is the recession constant model parameter hereinafter two main groups of procedures to parameterize and identify the characteristic recession behavior that were applied in the study are briefly described i e by constructing the master recession curve mrc and by calculating the parameters for individual recession segments irs since rainfall often interrupts recession periods typical especially for humid climates the mrc method was developed to eliminate the problem of variability in individual segments wmo 2008 there are various techniques for the construction of mrc the correlation method is the most commonly used where data are pooled and pairs of qt 1 and qt are plotted langbein 1938 using the linear least squares fitting technique a straight line with slope k is drawn with the interception at 0 0 based on the known relationship between k and the recession constant time dimension the latter is calculated as wmo 2008 6 c δ t ln k in contrast to the mrc method the variability of individual segments of the recession is taken into account in the irs method the process is analogous to that described above for the mrc method but it is performed for each segment separately and therefore for each segment i recession constant c i is calculated the parameter c in the recession method is determined as the mean value of c is wmo 2008 for the calculation of recession constants we followed the recommendations in the literature e g tallaksen 1989 smakhtin 2001 wmo 2008 the decision for the selection of the segment length was based on the recommendation of tallaksen 1989 i e that segment length should be between 5 and 7 days wmo 2008 recommends that segment length should be selected based on the constructed histogram recession duration in our case we noticed a marked reduction in the number of segments for durations longer than 4 or 5 days for most of the water stations however to satisfy both recommendations we chose the segment length of 5 days additionally the results of the study by sapač et al 2019b demonstrate that the segment length of 5 days is appropriate for the ljubljanica river catchment according to smakhtin 2001 fdc values between q70 and q95 are most commonly used for design low flows in order to obtain the largest sample for the analysis of recession curves in the study the starting point of the recession was set to be the first value below q70 taking into account the set peak level of 0 95 q70 was determined in three ways namely for the whole period of data for two seasons 01 04 30 11 and 01 12 31 03 and monthly the reason for the multiple calculation of recession constants lies in the results of sensitivity analysis of the changing criteria on recession constant values made by sapač et al 2019b they found that the selection of a method has a statistically significant impact on the values moreover knowing the characteristics of catchments proved to be important when selecting the period for determining the threshold discharge for analysis a detailed description of the calculation procedure can be found in wmo 2008 in general a slow recession rate is typical for the streams in catchments that have a more permeable geological structure and a relatively large storage capacity while faster rates are characteristic for flashy streams in catchments that have an impermeable geological structure with smaller storages e g wmo 2008 3 5 low flow indices consistency assessment the consistency assessment of low flow indices was conducted according to the interpretation of the contribution of delayed sources e g groundwater to the streamflow based on the obtained values of low flow indices six low flow indices were selected for consistency assessment i e bfi mam90 qmean mam90 mam7 q90 q50 si and average recession constant for each index the contribution of groundwater to the streamflow was determined with a scale ranging from the minimum to the maximum value obtained in the study in case of bfi and q90 q50 a common scale was determined since both indices have the same interpretation consistency of indices values was assessed graphically with a heat map that was prepared based on the obtained values 4 results and discussion 4 1 low flow statistics low flow statistics namely bfi mamn for 1 7 10 30 and 90 days mean flow and flows from fdcs with exceedance of 50 70 90 and 95 of the time for all considered water stations are presented in table 2 calculated bfi values range between 0 22 and 0 91 the highest values of bfi 0 91 and 0 85 are calculated for stations malni 5910 and bistra 5270 respectively and the lowest value 0 22 was obtained at the mali otok 5840 water station high bfi values indicate that malni 5910 and bistra 5270 karst springs have the largest contribution of groundwater both catchments consist mainly of carbonate karstified rocks which can be characterised by high permeabilities e g brečko 1998 petrič 2010 due to the low bfi value the opposite is true for the water station mali otok 5840 where a small contribution of extensive subsurface groundwater flow to the nanoščica stream can be expected impermeable rocks dominate the nanoščica catchment kolbezen and pristov 1998 therefore surface rainfall runoff processes prevail findings are consistent with the results of sezen et al 2019 bfis at other stations vary between 0 41 and 0 67 based on the values close to 0 5 the contribution of groundwater to the total flow can be estimated at approx 50 in order to enable comparison of mean annual minimum flow results for different durations 1 7 10 30 and 90 days all mamn values were divided by qmean fig 2 the prestranek 5800 water station was excluded from the comparison since only mam90 differs from 0 the reason for zero values is in the intermittent character of the karst pivka river the pivka river dries up or has relatively low discharges during longer rainless periods the highest averages of ratios mamn qmean n 1 7 10 30 90 days were calculated for the malni 5910 and bistra 5270 stations and the lowest for mali otok 5840 and hasberg 5910 the average values of ratios for malni 5910 bistra 5270 mali otok 5840 and hasberg 5910 are 0 41 0 36 0 06 and 0 14 respectively the low ratio value at hasberg 5880 is a consequence of the large range between low and high flows in the next step ratios mamn mam7 were plotted as a function of the duration of n 1 7 10 30 90 days for these four stations following the procedure of gustard et al 1992 fig 3 the largest gradient is observed at station mali otok 5840 which is consistent with the findings of the bfi analysis smaller gradient is observed for stations hasberg 5880 bistra 5270 and malni 5910 for the latter two stations a finding based on the bfi analysis can be confirmed the contribution of groundwater to the flow is significant the results in fig 3 indicate a similar feature also for station hasberg 5880 although bfi is not so high 0 63 the malenščica malni and unica hasberg springs are geographically very close fig 1 however multi tracer tests conducted by ravbar et al 2012 have shown that there are significant differences between them in view of the recharge dynamics mainly related to different hydrogeological characteristics of the karst catchment area ravbar et al 2012 found out that during low flow conditions the malenščica is recharged mainly from the javorniki karst aquifer while the unica is recharged mainly from the pivka sinking river moreover according to petrič 2010 the highest flows of the unica spring can be up to 100 m3 s and the lowest around 0 1 m3 s whereas for the malenščica there is a much smaller range between the lowest and the highest values of flow the higher flows of the malenščica stream are limited by the outflow structure in the geological past some karst channels in this karst system collapsed and consequently limited the amount of outflow overflows are therefore directed toward the unica spring however during long drought periods the malenščica a tributary of the unica represents the majority of the water in the unica river petrič 2010 this is probably the reason why the gradient in fig 3 at the hasberg 5880 water station is small according to the values of ratio q90 q50 table 2 the largest contribution of groundwater can be observed at malni 5910 and bistra 5270 stations the ratio for both is 0 43 the finding is consistent with the results of the bfi analysis on the other hand a relatively high ratio q90 q50 is estimated also for dvor 5500 and razori 5540 water stations 0 43 and 0 40 respectively at these two stations bfi values were not very high 0 5 and 0 47 respectively gradaščica dvor and šujica razori rivers have torrential characteristics with fast formation of near surface and surface runoff which is also reflected in fdc s shape fig 4 it means that after a rainfall event flow increases sharply almost regardless of the preceding wetness of the catchment on the other hand during rainless period flows are low and with slight fluctuations this is also confirmed by comparing mean and median flows q50 in case of the malni and bistra stations both values are similar while in the case of dvor and razori stations qmean is approx 1 7 times higher than q50 furthermore the difference between q90 and q50 is high fig 4 since both bfi and the q90 q50 ratio are used as baseflow indices with a similar interpretation one can notice that values of q90 q50 are at most of the stations much lower than corresponding bfis in some cases for more than a half table 2 consequently there is no consistency between both indices however at stations dvor 5500 and razori 5540 values of both indices show a similar proportion of groundwater contributing to the streamflow in the karst part of ljubljanica river catchment a number of studies using artificial and natural tracers were carried out in the past with the aim to determine the sources of water and subsurface connections between streams along the preferential underground karst conduits however the connections between individual streams in the karst ljubljanica river catchment are not yet completely clear petrič 2010 ravbar et al 2012 this study demontrates that in view of the streamflow groundwater relations the flows at stations bistra 5270 and malni 5910 behave diferently comparing to the flows at other stations the difference was also demonstrated by hierarchical clustering of bfi mamn and fdc indices all the considered values except bfi were divided by qmean of the corresponding water station to enable direct comparison between the values the resulting dendrogram is shown in fig 5 similar results in terms of stations grouped in the individual cluster were obtained also by applying complete single weighted and ward s linkage clustering one can notice that the second group in the dendrogram fig 5 is divided into two subgroups where the smaller one consists of water stations mali otok 5840 and prestranek 5800 the reason for the separate subgroup could be in the intermittent nature of both streams very low values of low flow statistics e g mamn and flows from fdc 4 2 seasonality of low flows seasonality ratio values identifying the summer or winter low flow regime are presented in table 3 the maximum and minimum lengths of vector r which represents variability of seasonality values closer to 1 correspond to smaller variability of the day of the occurrence of the low flow and vice versa are calculated for stations hasberg 5880 and prestranek 5800 respectively the values of seasonal indices of low flow occurrence q95 have shown that at all considered water stations low flows occur in august and september fig 6 which is consistent with findings of bat et al 2008 the earliest occurrence of low flows is expected at station mali otok 5840 on the nanoščica river august 8 r 0 66 and the latest at station malni 5910 on the malenščica river september 22 r 0 70 which is also consistent with bfi results the highest bfi value the latest day of occurrence in the year and vice versa in other words streams with the largest bfi values are less sensitive to the precipitation deficit the connection between bfi and seasonality index is also confirmed with the high value of the significant correlation coefficient between both indices 0 8 p value 0 01 the connection between seasonality and bfi was reported also by petek et al 2015 where 55 stations from slovenia were analysed regardless of the expected low flow period in general they found a negative correlation between bfi and the seasonality index and bfi and the ratio of seasonality however the reason for a positive correlation coefficient in this study can be attributed to the fact that all analyzed stations in the ljubljanica catchment have a summer low flow regime and therefore the day of occurrence of low flows increases with a higher bfi on the other hand a weak correlation between the seasonality index and q90 q50 was found with a correlation coefficient of 0 3 p value 0 1 this could confirm the inconsistency of q90 q50 with other previously discussed indices related to the proportion of groundwater contributing to the streamflow the hydrological non homogeneity of the ljubljanica river catchment can be confirmed through the lack of any dependence of the day of occurrence of low flow on the relative position in the catchment seasonality histograms support the findings on the seasonal characteristics of low flows in the ljubljanica catchment bistra 5270 and malni 5910 do not show a strong low flow season whereas for the other considered stations for example mali otok 5840 and hasberg 5880 seasonality is more obvious fig 7 seasonality histograms also confirm the findings on the day of occurrence of low flows since for all stations the lowest mean monthly flows blue bars are observed in august or september by comparing the mean monthly flow and the 10th percentile of daily flow the blue and black bars on the histograms actually the ratio q90 qmean can be assessed qualitatively despite the fact that fig 7 shows ratios for each month separately the findings are consistent with those calculated for the entire period of the datasets the highest ratios were calculated for malni 5910 and bistra 5270 and the lowest for mali otok 5840 followed by hasberg 5880 furthermore seasonality histograms of the 10th percentile of daily flow extreme low flows in fig 7 again demonstrate that malni 5910 and bistra 5270 have a larger contribution of groundwater and therefore are less sensitive to low flows than some other stations like mali otok 5840 or hasberg 5880 4 3 hydrograph recession analysis results of hydrograph recession analysis for all considered water stations are presented in fig 8 for the prestranek 5800 water station it was not possible to perform a recession analysis due to the already mentioned intermittent nature of the headwater karst pivka river regardless of the criteria selected the mrc method gave lower recession constants than the irs method for all considered stations fig 8 the average recession constant for all combinations and for all considered stations is 13 days the absolute maximum of 35 8 days was calculated for malni 5910 using threshold q70 on a monthly basis and the irs method whereas the absolute minimum of 2 5 days was calculated for mali otok 5840 using threshold q70 for a fixed period of data and the mrc method fig 9 taking into account all the considered combinations bistra 5270 and malni 5910 have the highest average recession constants i e 26 7 and 25 9 days respectively mali otok 5840 has the lowest average recession constant 3 8 days these findings are in accordance with the analyses of other low flow indices in the study since a large recession constant represents slow drainage and a large contribution of groundwater or lake whereas a low recession constant is characteristic of flashy rivers with rapid drainage and limited storage as reported also by other researchers e g doctor and alexander 2005 wmo 2008 by comparing the results of the different criteria applied we found that on average the highest values are obtained in cases where q70 was calculated separately for summer and winter seasons thresh break 1 april 1 december furthermore the recession constant is closely related to the bfi with a statistically significant correlation coefficient r of 0 92 p value 0 01 similar results were obtained also by mazvimavi et al 2009 who predicted bfi for rivers in zimbabwe based on the catchment characteristic a very high correlation coefficient r 0 96 p value 0 01 was calculated also between recession constant values obtained using the irs and mrc methods a fact which confirms the proper choice of the input parameters however sapač et al 2019b investigated the influence of three different calculation criteria on the values of low flow recession constants and found that the values are statistically significantly different when using different method mrc or irs when the irs method was applied the calculated recession constants were on average 3 1 days higher than those calculated by the mrc method moreover these results suggest that the selection of the recession analysis thresholds should be based on the knowledge of the catchment s hydrological behaviour since it was found that threshold q70 in some parts of the year is not representative for the low flows analysis 4 4 low flow indices consistency assessment based on the values of low flow indices presented above a summary heat map fig 9 was prepared in order to assess consistency of low flow indices in general we conclude that indices show consistency however one can notice that ratio q90 q50 stands out compared with other indices fig 9 despite the fact that for example bfi and q90 q50 could be interpreted in the same way i e as a proportion of the flow contributing to the streamflow from delayed sources such as groundwater moreover caissie and robichaud 2009 used ratio q90 q50 as an index of baseflow the results of this study demonstrate the importance of taking into consideration the known hydrological and geological conditions by interpretation of the ratio values in our study the meaning of q90 q50 ratio could be interpreted incorrectly for most of the stations except in case of stations dvor 5500 and razori 5540 on torrential rivers and mali otok 5840 with an intermittent character furthermore values of the mam90 mam7 ratio for dvor 5500 and razori 5540 indicate a relatively great contribution of groundwater to streamflow which is not true for torrential rivers these results demonstrate that the use of mam90 mam7 as an index of contribution of groundwater to the streamflow is not appropriate in case of torrential rivers although flows can considerably increase after rainfall events most of the year flows are low and close to the mean which is also evident from fdcs consequently the small difference between mam90 and mam7 results in a low mam90 mam7 ratio in the case of hasberg 5880 on the unica river a similar explanation can be used for interpreting the mam90 qmean inconsistency with other indices since high flows of the unica river can be up to 1000 times higher than low flows petrič 2010 qmean is relatively high however mam90 is low since during low flows the water in the unica comes mainly from the malenščica river therefore ratio mam90 qmean is low and incorrectly shows low contribution of groundwater to the streamflow the results demonstrate the importance of combined low flow analysis such as the one presented in our study the indices values should be interpreted in view of the hydrogeological knowledge about the specific hydrological conditions especially in the cases of non homogeneous catchments where the spatial extrapolation of the result might be very questionable choosing an inappropriate index and its misinterpretation can lead to inappropriate water resource management decisions 5 conclusions the main objective of this study was to analyse various low flow indices based on daily flow data from the water stations in the hydrogeologically non homogeneous ljubljanica river catchment and relate them to the known hydrogeological characteristics regardless of the fact that the results vary from one station to another certain conclusions regarding low flow analysis can be made in general most low flow indices are consistent with each other however there are some streams with specific hydrogeological properties influencing the values of some indices in an inconsistent way compared to other indices all calculated low flow statistics mamn bfi qmean fdc show that stations malni 5910 and bistra 5270 have the greatest contribution of groundwater to the streamflow their catchments lie mainly on carbonate and fissured rocks which can be characterised by high permeability on the other hand the lowest contribution of groundwater to the streamflow was found at station mali otok 5840 whose catchment is dominated by impermeable rocks and where surface rainfall runoff processes are dominant inconsistency of low flow statistics was found by interpreting ratios mamn qmean at station hasberg 5880 on the unica river with a large difference between high and low flows up to 1000 times in case of stations dvor 5500 and razori 5540 on torrential rivers inconsistencies were found for the q90 q50 ratio therefore holistic analysis based on various low flow statistics proved to be important to avoid a wrong interpretation of the low flow indices seasonal indices support conclusions drawn from low flow statistics analysis the seasonality ratio at all stations is lower than 1 which means that summer low flow conditions prevail the highest ratio was evaluated for stations dvor 5500 and razori 5540 this could be related to the summer heavy rain and storms which cause fast increases in the discharges at these two water stations positioned on the rivers with a typical torrential character results of hydrograph recession analysis confirm findings about the connections between groundwater and streamflow dynamics i e malni 5910 and bistra 5270 have the largest recession constant and therefore the largest contribution of groundwater whereas mali otok 5840 has the smallest recession constant and the smallest contribution of groundwater to surface water interestingly for the dvor 5500 station positioned on a torrential river the third largest recession constant was calculated however the reason can be that recession analysis parameters were selected inappropriately as was shown by sapač et al 2019b thus the results of the study show that for the correct interpretation of the low flow analysis results it is not enough to calculate different low flow indices but it is necessary to thoroughly analyse and compare them also in view of other catchment characteristics e g hydrogeology presence of river network flow intermittency topography this is especially true for non homogeneous catchments such as the studied ljubljanica river catchment where the variety of hydrogeological conditions strongly influences the rainfall runoff formation and the presence of surface flow in this

5719,this study attempts to assess the consistency of various low flow indices evaluated at 12 water stations in the ljubljanica river catchment slovenia which is due to its high diversity of hydrogeological properties recognized as a non homogenous catchment daily discharge data were used in the study for evaluating low flow statistics baseflow index discharges from flow duration curves mean annual minimums seasonal indices and analysis of hydrograph recession curves the indices were compared at each station and their values were interpreted in terms of the connection between surface water and groundwater as well as the extent of contribution of delayed sources to surface water although all low flow statistics point to the same stations in terms of the greatest and the lowest contribution of water from groundwater we identified inconsistencies at some water stations the hydrograph recession analysis and seasonal indices support the conclusions drawn from low flow statistics analysis with the seasonality ratio lower than 1 at all stations meaning that summer low flow conditions prevail across the catchment however at the torrential stream gradaščica an inconsistency was found with recession constants that could be attributed to the inappropriate choice of computational parameters we assessed the overall consistency heat map visualisation although it shows consistency between low flow indices some variations demonstrate that in case of hydrologically and geologically heterogeneous catchments an analysis of several low flow indices is needed in order to obtain a holistic overview of low flow conditions and to avoid bad decisions in water resources management due to inappropriate consideration of low flow characteristics keywords low flow hydrogeologically non homogeneous catchment base flow index bfi seasonality recession curve analysis 1 introduction low flow analyses provide essential information for sustainable management of water resources and planning of their future use moreover understanding the low flow temporal variability is crucial for the assessment of hydrological risk hydropower production agriculture and various economic activities e g wmo 2008 giuntoli et al 2013 parajka et al 2016 until recently the definition of low flows has not been clearly established in his review paper about low flows smakhtin 2001 upgraded wmo s 1974 definition as low flow is flow of water in the stream during prolonged dry weather and is considered to be a seasonal phenomenon and an integral part of the flow regimes of all streams however the use of the term today still depends on the type of interest e g in which part of the year low flows occur how long do they last what are their values therefore various indices and procedures for determination of low flows have been developed low flows were analysed using different indices in different river catchments around the world in the last decades for example different mean n day annual minima mamn were used to determine trends in low flows e g svensson et al 2005 fiala et al 2010 stahl et al 2010 coch and mediero 2016 bormann and pinter 2017 in united kingdom mamn were used for the development of national low flow procedures e g gustard et al 1992 the usefulness of individual mamn indices varies depending on the purpose and the country smakhtin 2001 and bormann and pinter 2017 recommend the use of mam7 over mam1 since using mam7 day to day variations in the artificial component of the stream flow and measurement errors can be eliminated however in most cases the difference between mam1 and mam7 values is not significant gustard et al 1992 compared the ratios mamn mam7 n is the number of days between 1 and 180 in catchments with different geological characteristics they found that catchments with greater permeability have a lower ratio than those with lower permeability in the field of water resources management as well as in general hydrology flow duration curves fdc are an indispensable tool fdc expresses the relationship between any flow value magnitude and the percentage of time that this flow value is equalled or exceeded frequency e g vogel and fennessey 1994 1995 in fdc the type of the flow regime is reflected since it depends on the upstream conditions geology and groundwater human activities such as urbanization etc however in low flow studies the use of fdc is related primarily to the part of the curve with flows below q50 smakhtin 2001 in many countries flows evaluated from fdc are used for determining low flow requirements or ecological flows for example in united kingdom q95 is often used for ecological flow acreman and dunbar 2004 moreover ratio q90 q50 was used in low flow studies as an index of baseflow for evaluating the percentage of water contributing from groundwater to the streamflow e g caissie and robichaud 2009 another very often used low flow index is bfi baseflow index in the study of beck et al 2013 bfi was evaluated in more than 3000 catchments worldwide for identification of its global patterns and to construct the model for bfi prediction in ungauged catchments based on 18 climatic and physiographic characteristics something similar was done by mazvimavi et al 2009 for 52 catchments in zimbabwe they found that contribution of groundwater and other delayed sources to streamflow depends mainly on mean annual precipitation evapotranspiration catchment slope and catchment density bfis were evaluated also in many other studies as part of hydrograph recession analyses e g zhang et al 2017 yang et al 2018 the latter represents one of the options to answer the question how fast or slow the streamflow will be decreasing in the absence of precipitation as it is clear from the low flow definition of smakhtin 2001 an important feature of low flows is their period of occurrence seasonality therefore in the past several methods and indices were developed for determining and describing low flow seasonality laaha and blöschl 2006 suggested an examination of seasonal indices seasonality histograms seasonality index and seasonality ratio in the catchments where the reasons for low flows are seasonally different they applied seasonal indices in catchments of austria for regionalization of low flows and found that spatial patterns of seasonal indices can be well explained based on hydrological conditions in addition to the methods described above there are many other indices and techniques for low flow analyses most studies on low flows in relation to the hydrogeological properties of the catchment typically contain one or in rare cases few low flow indices e g bloomfield et al 2009 carlier et al 2018 this is true for slovenia as well although low flow analyses for some streams and karst springs in slovenia have been conducted in the past e g kobold and brilly 1994 brilly et al 1997 brenčič 2000 petek et al 2015 sapač et al 2019a none of them have systematically covered the low flow dynamics of the ljubljanica river and or its tributaries which differ substantially in terms of their hydrogeological characteristics moreover the consistency of low flow indices in case of non homogenous catchments has not been studied yet therefore the main aim of this study was twofold the first part is a detailed analysis of various low flow indices for the rivers in the hydrologically nonhomogeneous and mostly karst ljubljanica river catchment using the data from all operating water stations in order to get comprehensive information about the dynamics of low flows the second purpose is to investigate the possible relations among different low flow indices their relation to the known hydrogeological characteristics and consistency of various low flow indices due to the heterogeneity one can expect that the values of low flow indices will differ between different parts of the catchment based on the known hydrological and geological properties of the catchment individual values of the low flow indices could be interpreted and consistency of the results could be assessed 2 study area the ljubljanica river catchment is located in the central part of slovenia fig 1 the whole catchment area is estimated at 1890 km2 kolbezen and pristov 1998 since the exact contributing area of some of the karst streams in the ljubljanica river catchment is not yet known karstic fissured and porous carbonate rocks of limestone and dolomite dominate the ljubljanica river catchment kranjc 2007 consequently the flow of water into the subsoil in the area is typically fast bonacci 2015 below the karst surface there dominates a network of connected conduits developed within fractured and or porous rock the ljubljanica river is also known as the river of seven names since from its source at the foothills of snežnik it sinks and reappears six times and each part of the surface river has its own name šušteršič 1994 the catchment can be roughly divided into karst and non karst areas according to habič 1969 1100 1200 km2 of the southern part of the catchment up to the springs near vrhnika water stations 5240 5030 and 5270 in fig 1 is dinaric karst with the major part consisted of limestone the north western part of the catchment polhov gradec hills is classified as pre alpine or isolated karst with steep dolomite slopes however the map of hydrogeological units representing porosity type size and abundance of aquifers fig 1 indicates a large hydrogeological non homogeneity of the catchment since there are 6 out of 7 hydrogeological units occurring in slovenia the major part of the catchment consists of fissured including karstic aquifers the majority of the southern part up to the springs near vrhnika followed by intergranular or fissured layers that form insignificant aquifers with local or limited sources of groundwater ljubljana marshes and rivers with water stations 5840 5500 5540 5770 in fig 1 the northern part of the catchment close to the outflow to the sava river is classified as an intergranular aquifer with medium to high abundance dinaric pluvio nival flow regime is characteristic for this region with a temperate continental climate and with similar spring and autumn discharge maximums hrvatin 1998 nw part of the catchment polhov gradec hills consists of less permeable rocks kolbezen and pristov 1998 whereas ljubljanska kotlina consists of thick quaternary gravel layers and conglomerates pavlovec 1961 forest and semi natural areas prevail as land use types in the ljubljanica river catchment detailed descriptions of types of karst of the hydrogeological properties of the catchment and its river system can be found in kogovšek 2001 2004 gabrovšek et al 2010 petrič 2010 ferk 2016 mihevc et al 2016 and kovačič and ravbar 2016 the catchment s altitude is between 300 and 1800 m a s l therefore the mean annual rainfall in the catchment varies between 1400 and 2000 mm 1400 1600 mm at ljubljana marshes 1600 1800 mm in the gradaščica sub catchment 1800 2000 mm in the karst part of the ljubljanica river catchment and 2000 mm can be expected in the snežnik karst plateau bat et al 2008 average river density in the catchment is 0 98 km km2 whereas in the pivka sub catchment the density is only 0 55 km km2 kolbezen and pristov 1998 3 data and methods 3 1 data daily discharge data series arso 2018 at 12 water stations in the ljubljanica river catchment slovenia were analysed fig 1 table 1 the following criteria were used for including a water station into the study 1 still operational in 2016 2 at least 25 years of data 3 without more than a 5 year consecutive gap in the time series there is no single recommendation for the minimum length of the flow time series relevant for the analysis of the low flows and calculation of low flow indices in the literature beck et al 2013 used the criterion of more than 10 years of not necessarily consecutive data for the calculation of bfi kundzewicz and robson 2000 as well as bormann and pinter 2017 suggested more than 50 years of data for the investigation of climate change influence on low flows petek et al 2015 analysed low flows using data series of a minimum length of 30 years however all these researchers agree that it is best to carry out analyses on sets that are as long as possible for this reason the whole period of available daily discharge data for each considered water station table 1 was taken into account in this study in low flow analysis it is necessary to define the start of the hydrological year appropriately in order to avoid the splitting of the low flow season into two hydrological years wmo 2008 the lowest stream flows in the ljubljanica river catchment are expected in the summer months mainly due to less precipitation and higher evapotranspiration bat et al 2008 therefore in the study the start of the hydrological year coincides with the calendar year i e 1st of january most of the analyses in the study were performed using the lfstat package koffler et al 2016 included in r r core team 2018 the package functions were prepared based on the manual on the low flow estimation and prediction wmo 2008 orange software demšar et al 2013 was applied for hierarchical clustering using different low flow indices 3 2 low flow statistics for the purpose of this study different low flow statistics were calculated for 12 water stations in the ljubljanica river catchment namely baseflow index bfi mean annual minimum n day flow mamn mean discharge qmean and the values of the flows exceeded 50 70 90 and 95 of the time q50 q70 q90 q95 bfi is one of the most common indices calculated in low flow studies it is defined as the proportion of total flow that comes from stored catchment sources such as groundwater lakes wetlands melting snow ice etc gustard et al 1992 smakhtin 2001 it is expressed as 1 b f i v b a s e v t o t a l where vbase and vtotal are volume of base flow and volume of total flow respectively a detailed explanation of the bfi calculation procedure can be found in wmo 2008 low values of bfi 0 2 are mostly characteristic of impermeable catchments with a flashy flow regime and higher values to 0 95 are typical for high storage capacity catchments wmo 2008 for analysis of low flows based on fdc only the flows exceeded 50 of the time or more were evaluated already from the slope of this part of fdc one is able to obtain information about the contribution of the groundwater to the stream in other words hydrogeological properties of the catchment are reflected in the shape of a fdc small slope usually means greater groundwater contribution and vice versa smakhtin 2001 rather than the values of q50 q70 q90 and q95 we were interested in the ratios between them in order to obtain more information about low flows and water origin for example the q50 q90 ratio represents the variability of low flows whereas the opposite ratio q90 q50 shows the proportion of the streamflow that originates from the groundwater without considering the size of the catchment smakhtin 2001 q90 q50 is sometimes used as an index of baseflow caissie and robichaud 2009 mamn flows are also frequently used as low flow indices tallaksen and van lanen 2004 and can be calculated for different durations in the study mamn flows were estimated for durations of 1 7 10 30 and 90 days these durations are commonly used also in other studies wmo 2008 mam1 is in fact the mean of annual minimum flows for n greater than 1 the moving average technique of the previous n days is applied in the calculation based on the above described low flow statistics we applied hierarchical clustering to identify differences similarities between the considered stations of the ljubljanica river catchment cluster analysis is one of the most important analysis tools in data mining based on which objects data or observations are divided into two or more groups e g rokach and mainom 2005 zabret and šraj 2018 the goal of cluster analysis is to achieve the maximum similarity within a group and the maximum difference among the groups hierarchical clustering of low flow indices in the study was performed by orange software demšar et al 2013 using average linkage clustering euclidean distance and a defined top number of clusters n 3 clusters produced by hierarchical clustering are often illustrated by a dendogram everitt 1998 which was also the case in this study 3 3 seasonality of low flows the seasonality index is a measure of low flow timing estimating the mean day of low flow occurrence it is based on two parameters namely the day of low flow q95 occurrence which is expressed in terms of angular value θ and the length of vector r by which the strength of seasonality can be identified eq 2 and eq 3 mardia 1972 the methodology for calculation is analogous to the methodology of defining the day of flood occurrence bayliss and jones 1993 burn et al 1997 blöschl et al 2017 and the theory behind this methodology is derived from directional statistics mardia 1972 2 θ d 2 π 365 3 r x 2 y 2 where x and y represent x and y coordinates of the mean low flow day and are calculated as mean values of cosine θ and sine θ respectively in other words values of vector r closer to 0 indicate a greater variability in low flow occurrence while values closer to 1 indicate a stronger seasonal low flow response d in eq 2 is julian date ranging from 1 to 365 to 366 in a leap year in order to calculate the seasonality ratio sr it is first necessary to adequately define summer and winter periods in our case we divided the year into two seasons summer and winter in the same way as laaha and blöschl 2006 for austria the summer starts on 1 april and ends on 30 november and the winter period is from 1 december to 31 march in the next step the mean q95 for each season is determined q 95 s q 95 w the sr is then calculated as 4 sr q 95 s q 95 w sr values greater than or less than 1 indicate the presence of a winter low flow regime and a summer low flow regime respectively supplemental information and additional support to analysing low flow seasonality represents the so called seasonality histogram presenting the mean monthly flow and the 10th percentile of daily flow q90 this type of histogram is used also in the wmo 2008 manual for the explanation and comparison of low flows in various hydrological regimes in terms of low flows rain dominated regimes are first divided into the climates with or without a distinct dry season the latter can be further divided regarding the ratio between q90 and qmean a larger ratio means a lower standard deviation and therefore smaller differences between values of low and mean flows 3 4 hydrograph recession analysis the basic idea of the recession analysis is to model the recession curve by fitting an analytical expression to the outflow function qt where q is the rate of flow and t time when qt is modeled as the outflow from a first order linear storage with no inflow then the recession rate follows the simple exponential equation linearized depuit boussinesq equation tallaksen 1995 5 q t q 0 e t c where qt is the flow at time t q0 is the initial flow and c is the recession constant model parameter hereinafter two main groups of procedures to parameterize and identify the characteristic recession behavior that were applied in the study are briefly described i e by constructing the master recession curve mrc and by calculating the parameters for individual recession segments irs since rainfall often interrupts recession periods typical especially for humid climates the mrc method was developed to eliminate the problem of variability in individual segments wmo 2008 there are various techniques for the construction of mrc the correlation method is the most commonly used where data are pooled and pairs of qt 1 and qt are plotted langbein 1938 using the linear least squares fitting technique a straight line with slope k is drawn with the interception at 0 0 based on the known relationship between k and the recession constant time dimension the latter is calculated as wmo 2008 6 c δ t ln k in contrast to the mrc method the variability of individual segments of the recession is taken into account in the irs method the process is analogous to that described above for the mrc method but it is performed for each segment separately and therefore for each segment i recession constant c i is calculated the parameter c in the recession method is determined as the mean value of c is wmo 2008 for the calculation of recession constants we followed the recommendations in the literature e g tallaksen 1989 smakhtin 2001 wmo 2008 the decision for the selection of the segment length was based on the recommendation of tallaksen 1989 i e that segment length should be between 5 and 7 days wmo 2008 recommends that segment length should be selected based on the constructed histogram recession duration in our case we noticed a marked reduction in the number of segments for durations longer than 4 or 5 days for most of the water stations however to satisfy both recommendations we chose the segment length of 5 days additionally the results of the study by sapač et al 2019b demonstrate that the segment length of 5 days is appropriate for the ljubljanica river catchment according to smakhtin 2001 fdc values between q70 and q95 are most commonly used for design low flows in order to obtain the largest sample for the analysis of recession curves in the study the starting point of the recession was set to be the first value below q70 taking into account the set peak level of 0 95 q70 was determined in three ways namely for the whole period of data for two seasons 01 04 30 11 and 01 12 31 03 and monthly the reason for the multiple calculation of recession constants lies in the results of sensitivity analysis of the changing criteria on recession constant values made by sapač et al 2019b they found that the selection of a method has a statistically significant impact on the values moreover knowing the characteristics of catchments proved to be important when selecting the period for determining the threshold discharge for analysis a detailed description of the calculation procedure can be found in wmo 2008 in general a slow recession rate is typical for the streams in catchments that have a more permeable geological structure and a relatively large storage capacity while faster rates are characteristic for flashy streams in catchments that have an impermeable geological structure with smaller storages e g wmo 2008 3 5 low flow indices consistency assessment the consistency assessment of low flow indices was conducted according to the interpretation of the contribution of delayed sources e g groundwater to the streamflow based on the obtained values of low flow indices six low flow indices were selected for consistency assessment i e bfi mam90 qmean mam90 mam7 q90 q50 si and average recession constant for each index the contribution of groundwater to the streamflow was determined with a scale ranging from the minimum to the maximum value obtained in the study in case of bfi and q90 q50 a common scale was determined since both indices have the same interpretation consistency of indices values was assessed graphically with a heat map that was prepared based on the obtained values 4 results and discussion 4 1 low flow statistics low flow statistics namely bfi mamn for 1 7 10 30 and 90 days mean flow and flows from fdcs with exceedance of 50 70 90 and 95 of the time for all considered water stations are presented in table 2 calculated bfi values range between 0 22 and 0 91 the highest values of bfi 0 91 and 0 85 are calculated for stations malni 5910 and bistra 5270 respectively and the lowest value 0 22 was obtained at the mali otok 5840 water station high bfi values indicate that malni 5910 and bistra 5270 karst springs have the largest contribution of groundwater both catchments consist mainly of carbonate karstified rocks which can be characterised by high permeabilities e g brečko 1998 petrič 2010 due to the low bfi value the opposite is true for the water station mali otok 5840 where a small contribution of extensive subsurface groundwater flow to the nanoščica stream can be expected impermeable rocks dominate the nanoščica catchment kolbezen and pristov 1998 therefore surface rainfall runoff processes prevail findings are consistent with the results of sezen et al 2019 bfis at other stations vary between 0 41 and 0 67 based on the values close to 0 5 the contribution of groundwater to the total flow can be estimated at approx 50 in order to enable comparison of mean annual minimum flow results for different durations 1 7 10 30 and 90 days all mamn values were divided by qmean fig 2 the prestranek 5800 water station was excluded from the comparison since only mam90 differs from 0 the reason for zero values is in the intermittent character of the karst pivka river the pivka river dries up or has relatively low discharges during longer rainless periods the highest averages of ratios mamn qmean n 1 7 10 30 90 days were calculated for the malni 5910 and bistra 5270 stations and the lowest for mali otok 5840 and hasberg 5910 the average values of ratios for malni 5910 bistra 5270 mali otok 5840 and hasberg 5910 are 0 41 0 36 0 06 and 0 14 respectively the low ratio value at hasberg 5880 is a consequence of the large range between low and high flows in the next step ratios mamn mam7 were plotted as a function of the duration of n 1 7 10 30 90 days for these four stations following the procedure of gustard et al 1992 fig 3 the largest gradient is observed at station mali otok 5840 which is consistent with the findings of the bfi analysis smaller gradient is observed for stations hasberg 5880 bistra 5270 and malni 5910 for the latter two stations a finding based on the bfi analysis can be confirmed the contribution of groundwater to the flow is significant the results in fig 3 indicate a similar feature also for station hasberg 5880 although bfi is not so high 0 63 the malenščica malni and unica hasberg springs are geographically very close fig 1 however multi tracer tests conducted by ravbar et al 2012 have shown that there are significant differences between them in view of the recharge dynamics mainly related to different hydrogeological characteristics of the karst catchment area ravbar et al 2012 found out that during low flow conditions the malenščica is recharged mainly from the javorniki karst aquifer while the unica is recharged mainly from the pivka sinking river moreover according to petrič 2010 the highest flows of the unica spring can be up to 100 m3 s and the lowest around 0 1 m3 s whereas for the malenščica there is a much smaller range between the lowest and the highest values of flow the higher flows of the malenščica stream are limited by the outflow structure in the geological past some karst channels in this karst system collapsed and consequently limited the amount of outflow overflows are therefore directed toward the unica spring however during long drought periods the malenščica a tributary of the unica represents the majority of the water in the unica river petrič 2010 this is probably the reason why the gradient in fig 3 at the hasberg 5880 water station is small according to the values of ratio q90 q50 table 2 the largest contribution of groundwater can be observed at malni 5910 and bistra 5270 stations the ratio for both is 0 43 the finding is consistent with the results of the bfi analysis on the other hand a relatively high ratio q90 q50 is estimated also for dvor 5500 and razori 5540 water stations 0 43 and 0 40 respectively at these two stations bfi values were not very high 0 5 and 0 47 respectively gradaščica dvor and šujica razori rivers have torrential characteristics with fast formation of near surface and surface runoff which is also reflected in fdc s shape fig 4 it means that after a rainfall event flow increases sharply almost regardless of the preceding wetness of the catchment on the other hand during rainless period flows are low and with slight fluctuations this is also confirmed by comparing mean and median flows q50 in case of the malni and bistra stations both values are similar while in the case of dvor and razori stations qmean is approx 1 7 times higher than q50 furthermore the difference between q90 and q50 is high fig 4 since both bfi and the q90 q50 ratio are used as baseflow indices with a similar interpretation one can notice that values of q90 q50 are at most of the stations much lower than corresponding bfis in some cases for more than a half table 2 consequently there is no consistency between both indices however at stations dvor 5500 and razori 5540 values of both indices show a similar proportion of groundwater contributing to the streamflow in the karst part of ljubljanica river catchment a number of studies using artificial and natural tracers were carried out in the past with the aim to determine the sources of water and subsurface connections between streams along the preferential underground karst conduits however the connections between individual streams in the karst ljubljanica river catchment are not yet completely clear petrič 2010 ravbar et al 2012 this study demontrates that in view of the streamflow groundwater relations the flows at stations bistra 5270 and malni 5910 behave diferently comparing to the flows at other stations the difference was also demonstrated by hierarchical clustering of bfi mamn and fdc indices all the considered values except bfi were divided by qmean of the corresponding water station to enable direct comparison between the values the resulting dendrogram is shown in fig 5 similar results in terms of stations grouped in the individual cluster were obtained also by applying complete single weighted and ward s linkage clustering one can notice that the second group in the dendrogram fig 5 is divided into two subgroups where the smaller one consists of water stations mali otok 5840 and prestranek 5800 the reason for the separate subgroup could be in the intermittent nature of both streams very low values of low flow statistics e g mamn and flows from fdc 4 2 seasonality of low flows seasonality ratio values identifying the summer or winter low flow regime are presented in table 3 the maximum and minimum lengths of vector r which represents variability of seasonality values closer to 1 correspond to smaller variability of the day of the occurrence of the low flow and vice versa are calculated for stations hasberg 5880 and prestranek 5800 respectively the values of seasonal indices of low flow occurrence q95 have shown that at all considered water stations low flows occur in august and september fig 6 which is consistent with findings of bat et al 2008 the earliest occurrence of low flows is expected at station mali otok 5840 on the nanoščica river august 8 r 0 66 and the latest at station malni 5910 on the malenščica river september 22 r 0 70 which is also consistent with bfi results the highest bfi value the latest day of occurrence in the year and vice versa in other words streams with the largest bfi values are less sensitive to the precipitation deficit the connection between bfi and seasonality index is also confirmed with the high value of the significant correlation coefficient between both indices 0 8 p value 0 01 the connection between seasonality and bfi was reported also by petek et al 2015 where 55 stations from slovenia were analysed regardless of the expected low flow period in general they found a negative correlation between bfi and the seasonality index and bfi and the ratio of seasonality however the reason for a positive correlation coefficient in this study can be attributed to the fact that all analyzed stations in the ljubljanica catchment have a summer low flow regime and therefore the day of occurrence of low flows increases with a higher bfi on the other hand a weak correlation between the seasonality index and q90 q50 was found with a correlation coefficient of 0 3 p value 0 1 this could confirm the inconsistency of q90 q50 with other previously discussed indices related to the proportion of groundwater contributing to the streamflow the hydrological non homogeneity of the ljubljanica river catchment can be confirmed through the lack of any dependence of the day of occurrence of low flow on the relative position in the catchment seasonality histograms support the findings on the seasonal characteristics of low flows in the ljubljanica catchment bistra 5270 and malni 5910 do not show a strong low flow season whereas for the other considered stations for example mali otok 5840 and hasberg 5880 seasonality is more obvious fig 7 seasonality histograms also confirm the findings on the day of occurrence of low flows since for all stations the lowest mean monthly flows blue bars are observed in august or september by comparing the mean monthly flow and the 10th percentile of daily flow the blue and black bars on the histograms actually the ratio q90 qmean can be assessed qualitatively despite the fact that fig 7 shows ratios for each month separately the findings are consistent with those calculated for the entire period of the datasets the highest ratios were calculated for malni 5910 and bistra 5270 and the lowest for mali otok 5840 followed by hasberg 5880 furthermore seasonality histograms of the 10th percentile of daily flow extreme low flows in fig 7 again demonstrate that malni 5910 and bistra 5270 have a larger contribution of groundwater and therefore are less sensitive to low flows than some other stations like mali otok 5840 or hasberg 5880 4 3 hydrograph recession analysis results of hydrograph recession analysis for all considered water stations are presented in fig 8 for the prestranek 5800 water station it was not possible to perform a recession analysis due to the already mentioned intermittent nature of the headwater karst pivka river regardless of the criteria selected the mrc method gave lower recession constants than the irs method for all considered stations fig 8 the average recession constant for all combinations and for all considered stations is 13 days the absolute maximum of 35 8 days was calculated for malni 5910 using threshold q70 on a monthly basis and the irs method whereas the absolute minimum of 2 5 days was calculated for mali otok 5840 using threshold q70 for a fixed period of data and the mrc method fig 9 taking into account all the considered combinations bistra 5270 and malni 5910 have the highest average recession constants i e 26 7 and 25 9 days respectively mali otok 5840 has the lowest average recession constant 3 8 days these findings are in accordance with the analyses of other low flow indices in the study since a large recession constant represents slow drainage and a large contribution of groundwater or lake whereas a low recession constant is characteristic of flashy rivers with rapid drainage and limited storage as reported also by other researchers e g doctor and alexander 2005 wmo 2008 by comparing the results of the different criteria applied we found that on average the highest values are obtained in cases where q70 was calculated separately for summer and winter seasons thresh break 1 april 1 december furthermore the recession constant is closely related to the bfi with a statistically significant correlation coefficient r of 0 92 p value 0 01 similar results were obtained also by mazvimavi et al 2009 who predicted bfi for rivers in zimbabwe based on the catchment characteristic a very high correlation coefficient r 0 96 p value 0 01 was calculated also between recession constant values obtained using the irs and mrc methods a fact which confirms the proper choice of the input parameters however sapač et al 2019b investigated the influence of three different calculation criteria on the values of low flow recession constants and found that the values are statistically significantly different when using different method mrc or irs when the irs method was applied the calculated recession constants were on average 3 1 days higher than those calculated by the mrc method moreover these results suggest that the selection of the recession analysis thresholds should be based on the knowledge of the catchment s hydrological behaviour since it was found that threshold q70 in some parts of the year is not representative for the low flows analysis 4 4 low flow indices consistency assessment based on the values of low flow indices presented above a summary heat map fig 9 was prepared in order to assess consistency of low flow indices in general we conclude that indices show consistency however one can notice that ratio q90 q50 stands out compared with other indices fig 9 despite the fact that for example bfi and q90 q50 could be interpreted in the same way i e as a proportion of the flow contributing to the streamflow from delayed sources such as groundwater moreover caissie and robichaud 2009 used ratio q90 q50 as an index of baseflow the results of this study demonstrate the importance of taking into consideration the known hydrological and geological conditions by interpretation of the ratio values in our study the meaning of q90 q50 ratio could be interpreted incorrectly for most of the stations except in case of stations dvor 5500 and razori 5540 on torrential rivers and mali otok 5840 with an intermittent character furthermore values of the mam90 mam7 ratio for dvor 5500 and razori 5540 indicate a relatively great contribution of groundwater to streamflow which is not true for torrential rivers these results demonstrate that the use of mam90 mam7 as an index of contribution of groundwater to the streamflow is not appropriate in case of torrential rivers although flows can considerably increase after rainfall events most of the year flows are low and close to the mean which is also evident from fdcs consequently the small difference between mam90 and mam7 results in a low mam90 mam7 ratio in the case of hasberg 5880 on the unica river a similar explanation can be used for interpreting the mam90 qmean inconsistency with other indices since high flows of the unica river can be up to 1000 times higher than low flows petrič 2010 qmean is relatively high however mam90 is low since during low flows the water in the unica comes mainly from the malenščica river therefore ratio mam90 qmean is low and incorrectly shows low contribution of groundwater to the streamflow the results demonstrate the importance of combined low flow analysis such as the one presented in our study the indices values should be interpreted in view of the hydrogeological knowledge about the specific hydrological conditions especially in the cases of non homogeneous catchments where the spatial extrapolation of the result might be very questionable choosing an inappropriate index and its misinterpretation can lead to inappropriate water resource management decisions 5 conclusions the main objective of this study was to analyse various low flow indices based on daily flow data from the water stations in the hydrogeologically non homogeneous ljubljanica river catchment and relate them to the known hydrogeological characteristics regardless of the fact that the results vary from one station to another certain conclusions regarding low flow analysis can be made in general most low flow indices are consistent with each other however there are some streams with specific hydrogeological properties influencing the values of some indices in an inconsistent way compared to other indices all calculated low flow statistics mamn bfi qmean fdc show that stations malni 5910 and bistra 5270 have the greatest contribution of groundwater to the streamflow their catchments lie mainly on carbonate and fissured rocks which can be characterised by high permeability on the other hand the lowest contribution of groundwater to the streamflow was found at station mali otok 5840 whose catchment is dominated by impermeable rocks and where surface rainfall runoff processes are dominant inconsistency of low flow statistics was found by interpreting ratios mamn qmean at station hasberg 5880 on the unica river with a large difference between high and low flows up to 1000 times in case of stations dvor 5500 and razori 5540 on torrential rivers inconsistencies were found for the q90 q50 ratio therefore holistic analysis based on various low flow statistics proved to be important to avoid a wrong interpretation of the low flow indices seasonal indices support conclusions drawn from low flow statistics analysis the seasonality ratio at all stations is lower than 1 which means that summer low flow conditions prevail the highest ratio was evaluated for stations dvor 5500 and razori 5540 this could be related to the summer heavy rain and storms which cause fast increases in the discharges at these two water stations positioned on the rivers with a typical torrential character results of hydrograph recession analysis confirm findings about the connections between groundwater and streamflow dynamics i e malni 5910 and bistra 5270 have the largest recession constant and therefore the largest contribution of groundwater whereas mali otok 5840 has the smallest recession constant and the smallest contribution of groundwater to surface water interestingly for the dvor 5500 station positioned on a torrential river the third largest recession constant was calculated however the reason can be that recession analysis parameters were selected inappropriately as was shown by sapač et al 2019b thus the results of the study show that for the correct interpretation of the low flow analysis results it is not enough to calculate different low flow indices but it is necessary to thoroughly analyse and compare them also in view of other catchment characteristics e g hydrogeology presence of river network flow intermittency topography this is especially true for non homogeneous catchments such as the studied ljubljanica river catchment where the variety of hydrogeological conditions strongly influences the rainfall runoff formation and the presence of surface flow in this aspect this study provides valuable information about the influence of hydrogeological conditions on the low flow recession dynamics in the region credit authorship contribution statement klaudija
